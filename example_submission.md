# Example Submission: Hearsay

We walk through the process of submitting a task, using the [Hearsay](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench/tree/main/tasks/hearsay) as an example.

## Designing the task

We modeled the Hearsay task on the types of hypotheticals that a law student would be asked in a law school course on Evidence. The rule for hearsay dictates that "out-of-court statements introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted" are inadmissible as evidence. Course questions testing the hearsay rule usually provide a brief description of a legal issue and a piece of evidence. The student is tasked with determining if that evidence---in the context of the issue---constitutes hearsay.

## Dataset construction

We constructed this task by manually generating fact patterns to test the hearsay rule. All our fact patterns are intended to have an obvious answer---there are no close calls or subjectivity here. We manually generated 100 such fact patterns. An example of a fact pattern is provided below:

```text
On the issue of whether Rebecca was ill, the fact that Rebecca told Ronald that she was unwell.
```

We chose to split these 100 fact patterns into a train split of 5 and a test split of 95. We select samples for the train which tested different aspects of the hearsay rule. However, you may submit all data together, as a single file. 

Our [train](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench/blob/main/tasks/hearsay/train.tsv) and [test](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench/blob/main/tasks/hearsay/test.tsv) files are formatted as tab-separated value files. If you construct data manually in Google Sheets or Excel, then it's possible to export the file as a TSV.

## Prompt Construction [OPTIONAL]

Our prompt for this task follows a very simple template, in which we provide the rule for hearsay first, and then several examples. We append "Is this hearsay?" to every fact pattern.

```text
Hearsay is an out-of-court statement introduced to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

Q: On the issue of whether David is fast, the fact that David set a high school track record. Is there hearsay?
A: No

Q: On the issue of whether Rebecca was ill, the fact that Rebecca told Ronald that she was unwell. Is there hearsay?
A: Yes

Q: To prove that Tim was a soccer fan, the fact that Tim told Jimmy that "Real Madrid was the best soccer team in the world." Is there hearsay?
A: No

Q: When asked by the attorney on cross-examination, Alice testified that she had "never seen the plaintiff before, and had no idea who she was." Is there hearsay?
A: No

A: Yes

Q: {{text}} Is there hearsay?
A:
```

We then provide a description of how the task was constructed.

We then upload the `train.tsv` and `test.tsv` files, which contain the training samples and test samples respectively.
