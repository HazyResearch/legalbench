# Getting started

This page provides an overview of how to get started with LegalBench.

## Downloading data 

- LegalBench task data is available on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nguha/legalbench). 
- If you would like task data as TSV files, please email us.
- If you would like to access an older version of the benchmark, please email us.

## Accessing prompts

- Prompt templates for each task are accessible on the [Github repository](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench/).
- If you would like to add a prompt template, then please create a pull-request on that repository.
- See [here](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench/blob/main/UsingLegalBench.ipynb) for an example of how to generate prompts for a dataset using a template.


## Evaluation

- Additional information on the metrics used for each LegalBench task can be found in the paper.
- Code for automatically computing metrics is available on the [Github repository](https://github.com/HazyResearch/legalbench/).
- A small number of LegalBench tasks (~7) require manual evaluation. We have released a gradebook to guide this evaluation, which can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g4iEqLCu1sLh-_aeA8bPmVzccXAVMYO1/view?usp=sharing). If you have any questions regarding these tasks, please reach out.
