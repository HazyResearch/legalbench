## Task Description

Rule QA is a question-answer task in which the model is asked about laws. Questions span asking the model to state the formulations for different legal rules (e.g., the rule for hearsay), identify where laws are codified, and general questions about doctrine.

## Dataset construction

We constructed this dataset by hand. For each sample, we provide the area of law it relates to (e.g. Civil Procedure).
