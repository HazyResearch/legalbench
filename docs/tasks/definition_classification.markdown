## Task description
 
Courts frequently define terms in the course of interpreting and applying laws. For instance, the following sentence provides a definition of the term "confidential":

```text
The term “confidential” meant then, as it does now, “private” or “secret.” Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary 174 (1963). And here is a sentence defining “brought”: But a natural reading of § 27's text does not extend so far. “Brought” in this context means “commenced,” Black's Law Dictionary 254 (3d ed. 1933).
```

The goal of this task is to identify if a sentence contains a definition. For example, the following sentence defines "vacation":

```text
A vacation is defined by Bouvier to be the period of time between the end of one term and the beginning of another.
```
