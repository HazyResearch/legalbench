21-476	So, counsel, we've spoken a little bit about how Colorado has handled this compelled speech question differently with respect to different messages, some that it prefers, others that it dislikes. I'm curious how other states have dealt with this conundrum besides Colorado and how you -- which ones of those you think we should take account of.	Background
21-476	Well, so what are the differences between -- what differences do you see between her hypothetical and the actual case that is before us?	Clarification
21-1052	It doesn't say you have to meet the standards of the federal rules. It's -- and it reflects the backdrop, again, as Justice Thomas alluded to, of the Article II concern that would exist if the government's power to control prosecution of a case or pursuit of a civil action were somehow removed from the government's power. So why shouldn't we read the statute, given the Article II concern, read that provision for what it says?	Communicate
21-476	So this is a carveout that's applicable just to the same-sex context?	Criticism
21-476	So I will -- I will write a press release for many faiths and many belief systems that are -- but they have to be consistent with mine and I won't do it if it -- if it offends my religious faith. Good to go?	Criticism 
21-476	Well, my question really was not whether this website is a public accommodation. I understand that's been stipulated. That wasn't my question. What I'm trying to understand is the breadth of your argument, and what I get is that you're making a -- a tiny sliver of an argument. So the website can put anything on its website, even something that will blatantly or subtly *72 tell a same-sex couple, well, this is not a service that I want. They can do that. And a website can also potentially get itself out from being a public accommodation simply by reserving a degree of selectivity. That's what you've told me so far.	Criticsm
21-1168	He was affirming discussions and thoughts by Learned Hand. And you're asking us to overrule that form of consent as extortion, is that right? He would get it right this time?	Humor
21-476	So, for you, as -- as there's an effort to protect both the equal rights of gay and lesbian people and same-sex couples and at the same time protect free speech rights, your line is look at whether the action of the business involves speech?	Implications
21-1484	I hate to ---- be stuck on the same question, Mr. Dvoretzky, but, as between these two positions, which is Mr. Liu's position is that you have a right and they have a duty -- you know, you have -- they have a duty not to interfere with your water, as opposed to they have a duty to ensure access to your water. Both of those are not spelled out in the contract. You know, both of those are implied rights and duties. So how do we choose between them?	Implications 
21-1484	You said earlier that you had some things to say about Arizona v. California and the nature of what happened there. Have you gotten that out?	Support
