## Task description

This is a binary classification task in which the model must determine if a user's post discusses planning for end-of-life, possible incapacitation, and other special circumstances that would prevent a person from making decisions about their own well-being, finances, and property. This includes issues around wills, powers of attorney, advance directives, trusts, guardianships, conservatorships, and other estate issues that people and families deal with.

## Task construction

This task was constructed from the [LearnedHands](https://suffolklitlab.org/) dataset. Please see their website for more information on annotation. Our task consists of a binarized version of the original dataset, with "negatives" randomly sampled from posts with other topics. This dataset is class balanced.
