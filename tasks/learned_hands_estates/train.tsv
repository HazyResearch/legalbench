"Hello everyone I was wondering if any one had legal advice for contesting a will. Sorry if this is very long winded and not the right subreddit, let me know if I should cross post it somewhere better.   Some background, there is this woman ""J"" that my father my sister and myself feel have been taking advantage of  my  grandparents.  J was  ""bought"" (male order bride and what not) from the Philippines by her first husband who was friends with my grandparents. She had two kids by the time my sister and I were past the ""cute"" stages. My grandparents have a weakness for cute children and have been drooling over this woman and her kids for the past 16 years, including the new 6 yo kid with a new husband. This kid think my grandparents are hers and has no idea me or my father were relatives, so idk what J has been telling her but that could be paranoia talking.  We honestly have felt J has been taking advantage of my grandparents to try and be put on the will, and sure enough a few years ago they put her and her three kids on it for a very very gracious amount compared to the three blood family members that are on it. The grandparents refused to show us the will because J was on it. Since my dad in the executor so he was recently able to get a copy and it is split as follows:  30% to my dad, 10% to my sister 10% to me  20% to J 5% J kid 1 5% J kid 2 5% J kid 3 And the rest to boyscouts/church/stuff like that.  I guess our main concern/question is is there a way to contest the will effectively? I know there is a less then 1% of it happening historically. We think she should be on the will but this is extreme in our opinion. Her family, who's only been close friends essentially, gets more then their only son.   Also I guess we need a sanity check. Are we paranoid or are we justified in our feeling in your best opinion?"	Yes
So this is a throw away account since I'll be giving away a bit about my location here. I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.   I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.   Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.  So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.	Yes
My grandfather has dementia and my mom and him set up my mom to be his financial and medical POA. Located in Illinois.  It's been 4 years and my mom has slacked completely. She hasn't done his taxes, some bills have gone unpaid, and last but not least his debit card bounced because she didn't transfer money to it (really confused him and was a bad day).  I'm not sure my mom wants to give up this title but it's at a really bad point. It won't be an easy conversation but something needs to be done.  What are my best / worst case scenarios?  Thanks.	Yes
My parents passed away in 2003. My sister, brother, and I were minors at the time. In 2016, we were contacted by the state of Florida that there was abandoned property that was not included in my parent's original estate (we moved to Mississippi in 2003). We also became aware of a few Ameriprise accounts that were in my father's name that were never discovered in the original estate.  My sister contacted the original attorney who helped with the estate and helped her re-open the estate as the executor so the funds could be obtained. Neither the original executor nor the original attorney had the original estate tax ID number for the estate and we were told to apply for a new tax ID number, which we used to obtain the funds from the state of Florida and the stock accounts were transferred into an estate account at our bank.  We are worried about what taxes we will owe on these funds because they have been siting for so long and because we do not have the original tax ID number and are afraid of filing something wrong but no one we talk to can give us a solid answer. Some of the Ameriprise accounts were IRA accounts they seem to have a bunch of deadlines attached to them that we have missed but we can't really find a solid answer on what to do if we did miss the deadlines. The abandoned property from the State of Florida came from a ScottTrade account but we don't know if we owe capital gains taxes on it because we cannot differentiate what was the original amount in the account we we don't know if there was a gain or a loss on that account or even what stocks were in it, we only know the amount and where it came from.  tl:dr: My siblings and I became aware of more funds from a 2003 estate that just recently came under our control and can't get an answer on the taxes we owe.	Yes
"Hi there!   So my mother has recently sent copies of her Living Will and POA documents to myself and my siblings. I have a small question regarding how she wrote my name on the documents. I got married almost a year ago and decided to keep my maiden name(same as her name). Despite her and I having a previous conversation clarifying my decision to keep my name, she has decided to write my name on these legal documents as ""Mrs. FoxesRidingHorses MaidenName-HusbandName"". Does this mean anything? Will it affect the legality of my influence on these documents? It is not my name and will not be at any time. I am in Maryland and she is in Georgia."	Yes
My father plans on getting re-married later in his life.  I always thought when he passes away my brother and I would gain his inheritance and estate, but will my new stepmother be the new heir?  My father is older than her, so he will most likely pass away first.  My soon-to-be stepmother also has two children of her own.  I'm afraid she will gain all my father's assets and use them to benefit her children.  Is it still possible for my brother and I to inherit all my fathers property and assets when the inevitable happens.  We all live in California.	Yes
My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	Yes
"I'm located in Oregon. Let's say my dad's name is ""John Doe"".  John Doe passed away several years ago, and the house he purchased (that we currently live in) was transferred into the John Doe Revocable Trust. The house still has a mortgage that still has John Doe's name (not the trust). The deed of the house according to the county clerk's office has ""John Doe Revocable Trust"" as the owner.  The John Doe Revocable Trust has three trustees - my mom, my sister and I. We have documentation declaring this.   All three of us have agreed that we would like to have the house just in my name since currently, I'm making the mortgage payments and I have decent credit, and neither my mom nor sister feel they are in a position to be able to take responsibility for the property.   **What are the steps needed in order to get the house transferred out of being under the Trust's name and just under my name? And, with as minimal cost as possible?**   Here are the steps that I have figured out based on researching, but I would like to know if I am missing something, or if there is something else I need to consider:   1. Find a blank Quit Claim Deed form and fill in the info to show transfer of the property from the Trust (Grantor) to my name (Grantee).   2. Have all three of us trustees sign the Quit Claim Deed under a Notary.  3. Take Deed Form to County Clerk's Record office to get it recorded.   4. Submit deed showing new title of ownership to the mortgage bank who can transfer mortgage over to my name.   ----------------------------------------------------------------- Questions I have:   1. Are there any tax or other financial implications that I need to be aware of when this transfer happens? (other than fee for recording office, etc.)   2. There seem to be a lot of ""buy a deed form"" websites where you fill in the info then pay $30-$50 to print the form. I'd rather just write one up and format it myself and save the money if I can. Is there any trusted website or place that indicates what language *should* be on the quit claim form?   3. Are there any steps above that I'm completely missing?"	Yes
