Basically, my sister has a dangerous lifestyle. She into doing crazy mountain climbing challenges. She has two sons, and the children's father have died doing the exact same thing. Losing her is a reality that I worry about. I also worry about my nephews who I can't abandon if something happens to my sister.  Can I take a life insurance policy with myself as the beneficiary in case she died, so that I have the means to take care of her children? I'm assuming the premiums will be high due to her lifestyle but it's a small price to at least not having to worry about the financial aspects of her getting herself killed and leaving her children with nothing.  We live in Montana.	Yes
"Hi Reddit,  My mother passed away in Feb during the cleaning of her house my sister-in-law found a will that was signed, dated and notarized. I guess I have a few questions here.   1: Is this a ""legal"" will? What makes it legal and binding?  2: What is the process of selling the house?  3: She mentioned having to go to probate (what is that) and then said we could just not go though probate but did not say how that would work.  I am in the Dallas area my sister in law and the home are located in Austin.  I know this may not be enough info I can provide more if needed."	Yes
My parents passed away in 2003. My sister, brother, and I were minors at the time. In 2016, we were contacted by the state of Florida that there was abandoned property that was not included in my parent's original estate (we moved to Mississippi in 2003). We also became aware of a few Ameriprise accounts that were in my father's name that were never discovered in the original estate.  My sister contacted the original attorney who helped with the estate and helped her re-open the estate as the executor so the funds could be obtained. Neither the original executor nor the original attorney had the original estate tax ID number for the estate and we were told to apply for a new tax ID number, which we used to obtain the funds from the state of Florida and the stock accounts were transferred into an estate account at our bank.  We are worried about what taxes we will owe on these funds because they have been siting for so long and because we do not have the original tax ID number and are afraid of filing something wrong but no one we talk to can give us a solid answer. Some of the Ameriprise accounts were IRA accounts they seem to have a bunch of deadlines attached to them that we have missed but we can't really find a solid answer on what to do if we did miss the deadlines. The abandoned property from the State of Florida came from a ScottTrade account but we don't know if we owe capital gains taxes on it because we cannot differentiate what was the original amount in the account we we don't know if there was a gain or a loss on that account or even what stocks were in it, we only know the amount and where it came from.  tl:dr: My siblings and I became aware of more funds from a 2003 estate that just recently came under our control and can't get an answer on the taxes we owe.	Yes
My grandfather has dementia and my mom and him set up my mom to be his financial and medical POA. Located in Illinois.  It's been 4 years and my mom has slacked completely. She hasn't done his taxes, some bills have gone unpaid, and last but not least his debit card bounced because she didn't transfer money to it (really confused him and was a bad day).  I'm not sure my mom wants to give up this title but it's at a really bad point. It won't be an easy conversation but something needs to be done.  What are my best / worst case scenarios?  Thanks.	Yes
So I've known about this for years and years but honestly recently started using Reddit for real.   Growing up on the cotton farm my grandmother cared for her grandmother who was very ill. She was closer to her than much of the family. When she died my grandmother was in Italy with her army husband and couldn't go to Texas where the probate court is for all this land out in Texas she got, which has oil on it, a lot. That side of the family who did go get it ended up in politics and doing very well.  She has anxiety, always has, and is afraid of getting killed over trying to claim it due to the amount involved. She's almost 80 now and I'm not sure if this is something worth looking into since there have been some deaths around it. I called up the Clarksville Texas court to pull the old document that outlined what happened but they said it was incredibly long.   Is this something worth looking into? Sums involved are in the millions.	Yes
Hi /legaladvice  My dad died last week. He was too young. All of the funeral services and arrangements are complete and the family has gone home.  Now we're starting to get into dealing with estate stuff. Bank accounts, retirement fund, social security, car titles, etc. I think that we have most of the major things noted to take care of, but what are some of other things that people don't really think of where I should keep an eye out? What sort of unexpected hurtles may I face that I should be aware of?   We have his will and it names my mother the executor of his estate.	Yes
"I'm located in Oregon. Let's say my dad's name is ""John Doe"".  John Doe passed away several years ago, and the house he purchased (that we currently live in) was transferred into the John Doe Revocable Trust. The house still has a mortgage that still has John Doe's name (not the trust). The deed of the house according to the county clerk's office has ""John Doe Revocable Trust"" as the owner.  The John Doe Revocable Trust has three trustees - my mom, my sister and I. We have documentation declaring this.   All three of us have agreed that we would like to have the house just in my name since currently, I'm making the mortgage payments and I have decent credit, and neither my mom nor sister feel they are in a position to be able to take responsibility for the property.   **What are the steps needed in order to get the house transferred out of being under the Trust's name and just under my name? And, with as minimal cost as possible?**   Here are the steps that I have figured out based on researching, but I would like to know if I am missing something, or if there is something else I need to consider:   1. Find a blank Quit Claim Deed form and fill in the info to show transfer of the property from the Trust (Grantor) to my name (Grantee).   2. Have all three of us trustees sign the Quit Claim Deed under a Notary.  3. Take Deed Form to County Clerk's Record office to get it recorded.   4. Submit deed showing new title of ownership to the mortgage bank who can transfer mortgage over to my name.   ----------------------------------------------------------------- Questions I have:   1. Are there any tax or other financial implications that I need to be aware of when this transfer happens? (other than fee for recording office, etc.)   2. There seem to be a lot of ""buy a deed form"" websites where you fill in the info then pay $30-$50 to print the form. I'd rather just write one up and format it myself and save the money if I can. Is there any trusted website or place that indicates what language *should* be on the quit claim form?   3. Are there any steps above that I'm completely missing?"	Yes
My grandma passed away two years ago and left everyone in my family a couple thousand of dollars though her insurance and it was supposed to be given to us when we turned 18 but someone in my family took mine out and won't give me the money since I recently turned 18 is there anything I can do ? Maybe sue him or something ? 	Yes
"My 92 year old grandmother is currently decaying away in her home losing her mind. She has been injured various times but plays it off with insane excuses. She is clearly not mentally fit to be all on her own.  Currently she is in the ""care"" of my aunt, in which her daughter forced her so that she controls all my grandmother's finances. Right now the aunt does nothing at all, and worsens my grandmother's physical state.  In general the aunt is a big obstacle.  What can I do to help this situation? Ideally I'd want my grandmother to move in with me so I can actually take care of her but im unsure if my aunt would let that happen. It's come to the point where the aunt drains her pension each month not even leaving her enough for groceries.  Legally what are my options, alternatively i'd want her in an old folks home."	Yes
My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	Yes
"I need to disclaim some funds I would otherwise be inheriting so that they can go back to the Estate to settle outstanding debts. These funds are with Vanguard.   I submitted the paperwork they gave me and that is all in order but I also need to write up a document specifically disclaiming the funds by account number. The agent I've been dealing with was unable to give me a ""blueprint"" but said what I write up must include the account numbers and their reference number.   The Estate is already in the red, I don't want to pay the lawyer another $250 out of pocket to do this simple task if I can avoid it and I need to get this settled soon.    I'm in NY and another sibling in MA has to submit a similar document for their shares. Any suggestions?"	Yes
This is in KS.  My father passed away this morning. I am helping my mother through the process.  My family, including my mother, is worried about my brother going forward at this point. He has leeched off my parents his entire adult life, and now that my dad has passed we fear my brother's sense of grief and sympathy will not overpower his entitlement and he may try to take property or try to get money from my mother in her vulnerable state.   My father had a (small) life insurance policy and gets SSI. Other than that their assets are all in farmland/machinery/livestock.  What is the best way to go about making sure my mother is protected going forward so her, not my brother's, best interests are met?  Thanks.	Yes
(This is in Indiana)     So, my dad passed last April, and he was in talks for disability. After he passed I received mail from the Social Security office that I was able to receive his back benefits because he had been accepted prior to his death.     Now, I've filled out all manner of legal documentation, medical records, release forms, you name it, all addressed to me, courtesy of or on behalf of my father. Court is next week and the SSA is saying they need proof of kinship. I do not have the slightest idea where to look, as he's not on my birth certificate, and my (his) lawyer isn't exactly giving me great ideas. He had no will, nor any paperwork bequeathing anything to me, but after he passed I signed his estate over to my uncle because he's way smarter than I am and didn't, and still don't, have any idea how to deal with that.    What would work as proof of kinship?	Yes
My mom has schizophrenia. Her brother is the trustee of a large inheritance given to her by her Dad. This inheritance is her main source of income. He's also the executor of my Dad's estate who just recently passed away.   My uncle wants to sell her house and put her in a assisted living home. She's only 60. She wants to stay in her home, where we she is currently being taken care of by a caregiver.   He's not providing her any sort of autonomy or transparency about the decisions he's making. He also refuses to allow me to have any  knowledge of how much she has and how its being invested. I know she has (800k+).  Right now I'm trying to figure out where her rights start and his end. And also if it would be worth applying for guardianship, I'm only 25 and not exactly that established yet. Would applying for her guardianship allow me to hold him accountable for decisions?  I just hate the idea that he's making these life decisions she doesn't agree with. He's doing this under the guise of it being in her best interest, but if that were the case he would allow her to be apart of that decision and would be sensitive to the fact that her husband just died four months ago. He wants the sell the house she's lived in for over 17 years and put her there within the next few months. From my understanding he wants to do this to lessen his responsibilities of taking care of her.   I'm also concerned about him making decisions about the kind of medical care she receives. She has the mental capacity I believe to make her own medical decisions. With other family members in the past, he has prioritized money over care, and I would hate to see him do the same thing with my Mom.   Does anyone have any idea about how to approach this? I don't where to start or how I go about any of this. Am I asking the right questions?	Yes
My husband and I need to make our wills but all of our family is in Canada. Are there any rules we need to know about naming an executor outside of our resident country?	Yes
An aunt's traditional IRA was moved directly to a company called Equity Trust in Ohio that does these self directed IRAs. The funds were used to purchase a property under an LLC that both her and the husband were owners. The aunt passed away and on the IRA the husband was named as beneficiary who kept the account with Equity Trust. Then the husband passed away who had named the nephew as the beneficiary. A lawyer had already assisted with setting up the LLC itself to transfer to that same nephew as well. What will the nephew who is the named beneficiary on the IRA have to go through whether they decide to keep or sell the property, and any tax consequences? This is all new to me so hopefully that all made sense.  https://www.trustetc.com/real-estate-ira	Yes
Great Grandpa recently passed and at the settling of his estate me and my brother were presented with envolopes that had our names on them that were full of bonds our great grandparents had purchased in our names when we were born and while we were young. We have not cashed any of them in yet, but now members of our family are telling us to not cash them in due to the fact that none of the family outside of my Grandpa was present for the reading of the will. They are claiming it'd be illegal in some way or another. The bonds are in our names and all. Is this just a load of bull shit or do they have something here? Thanks in advance for any advice I get here.	Yes
"Basically what the title says. My wife and I just recently had our first child, and so we need to get a will and living will/medical directives in order.  I know wills can be complex, and rather than wasting an attorney's time with "" um, we don't know"" and ""we will get back to you"" responses, I figured that we could start with something like Willmaker pro. Then we could take our time and get everything filled out exhaustively, and take the documents it produces to an attorney to review and advise on. I figure this ultimately saves the attorney some time, and therefore saves us cash. I DO want an attorney to be involved because there are a lot of factors in our finances.  However, I wanted to see how actual lawyers who deal with wills feel about this. Would it be better to work through everything with the attorney from the beginning? How do you feel about things like Willmaker? Would my approach actually make things harder?"	Yes
"My mother has a specific dilemma regarding her father's bank account she is the POD for.  The will states that all assets aside from a few specified things (house and property lots) are to be equally divided among siblings.  I'm aware that the POD is separate from the will, and that my mother should have a legitimate claim to all of the money.  However, her intent is still to split it equally as my grandfather wished.  The problem is that she currently has Medicaid healthcare benefits.  It's a given that she will become ineligible for Medicaid for a time, and have to prove that she as ""spent down"" the funds to reapply.  The question is whether or not the state (Ohio, in this case) will honor the fact that the deceased wished the money to be split, or count the entire sum as belonging to my mother even if she splits it.  If the state does not recognize the will in this case, and counts the money as all hers, she will be ineligible for Medicaid for a much longer time without being able to spend down any more than her own share.  Is she going to be forced to keep the money herself, so she can afford private healthcare for however long it takes her to spend the full amount?"	Yes
Let's say my wife and I are 58, have $500k in an 401k and 4 adult kids. We would like to gift them money now instead of waiting until we die to give them their inheritance. We want to do this in a manner that results in the least amount of taxes/penalties possible. As I understand it, the government looks back 5-years when determining how much one is charged for a nursing home, so we would like to make our gifts sooner rather than later. We wonder also if there's a way we could ensure half the amount we give to each child could be made untouchable just in case of emergency.   We went to an elder lawyer to ask for assistance with this, but he wasn't a lot of help, so I turn to you. If you were me, how would you handle this? Thanks in advance.	Yes
My Grandmother died recently and left her home to my Mother. my grandmother had outstanding Medicaid debts so the state filed a claim on here estate. She only had 900 dollars in her checking account at the time of death and her home is only worth 20 grand max. We tried to file an exemption through my mother's(awful) lawyer. And she was denied her hardship claim. So the state took the 900 dollars and put a 4000 dollar lien against the house.   Now here is the thing. My mom is disabled and on SSI. And simply doesn't have a lot of money. Her benefit payment is less than 1200 a month. And she lives by herself. It was my understanding if the child of any age is disabled of the deceased person they are exempt from that law.   We have tried to get another lawyer to look at things and either they don't want to deal with it now that it is already said and done or don't want to deal with it because of the proximity to my others lawyer(i don't understand this one either). It is a small town.   Is there anywe we can get my mother an exemption after the denial. Or can someone point me in the right direction or what to do?  Also the house is payed off, and the state AG hired a local attorney  to do the Estate recover.	Yes
In short: --Widowed mother's assets consist of an HECM* (reverse-mortgaged home) and just enough cash/savings to cover current bills: utilities, trash, monthly Visa/medical bills etc. _(*house is worth more than HECM balance)_  --There are also 2 life insurance policies worth &lt;$10,000 designating the same beneficiaries as the estate.    --In addition to HECM, known liabilities = medical bills + CC debt slightly &gt;$11,000.   --We'll sell the house as soon as we're able (6 months) and distribute those proceeds (minus estate liabilities) ASAP.  Our issue is that among the beneficiaries, some don't need the life insurance money and want it all applied to claims on the estate, while others have real, immediate need for any/all funds available to them. While we expect there to be _some_ additional money to split in 6-8 months, the life insurance should  pay out in a matter of weeks.  Hence the question: are we _required_ to apply life insurance $ to the estate's  existing debt, or can/should it be disbursed directly to beneficiaries when it's paid?  Once we understand what we can do legally, we can sort out what we should do ethically, and according to our Mom's wishes...  Thanks for the help. We're talking a fairly simple estate and not much money overall, but it's a lot to some of the heirs. We want to handle these matters legally and correctly to everyone's benefit, but hopefully without spending down the estate's assets on professional legal help.    That's where you good people come in...	Yes
My grandmother passed just over two years ago.  Before she passed I was told (by someone I am no longer in contact with) that she was part of a will however, he seemed reluctant to give me much more information.  In fact, he seemed like he told me by mistake as if he did not want to disclose that information.  He was the son in law of the man who passed and supposedly left my grandmother something in his will.  He passed roughy 5 years ago about three years before my grandmother.    So to my question, is it worth it for my mother to pursue this and try and claim this on my grandmothers behalf?   All parties have passed or are living in Washington state.    All advice welcome thank you!	Yes
When preparing to write a will at the lawyers, will they ask about personal debt?  Hubby is commonlaw, everything is in his name. And help out there?	Yes
"Hi there!   So my mother has recently sent copies of her Living Will and POA documents to myself and my siblings. I have a small question regarding how she wrote my name on the documents. I got married almost a year ago and decided to keep my maiden name(same as her name). Despite her and I having a previous conversation clarifying my decision to keep my name, she has decided to write my name on these legal documents as ""Mrs. FoxesRidingHorses MaidenName-HusbandName"". Does this mean anything? Will it affect the legality of my influence on these documents? It is not my name and will not be at any time. I am in Maryland and she is in Georgia."	Yes
Hello. My father passed away a couple of months ago. He didn't leave much in the way of assets, but he did have a 401k with a little over $52k in it.   My siblings and I weren't close with him, he wasn't a nice guy. My mother wants no part of anything to do with him.  So, I met with a local estate lawyer who was willing to handle everything, but he wanted a $3000 payment up front that would cover all costs associated. He said that if we were to put it on a credit card, we could get money out of the estate that he would be opening in order to pay it off before the next payment is due. My siblings and I, being young, don't have access to that amount of capital up front, and with my mother not wanting to get involved, I don't know what to do.   So here are my questions: 1. Does this seem to be a fair rate for setting up an estate and handling all of the probate stuff 2. Are there any services that you're aware of that could pay the money up front for a fee, that we could pay back quickly from the estate 3. Is this something I could handle myself 4. Am I running out of time to do this  One of my siblings and I are adults, just young and in school. We don't want to miss out on this money, the only good thing our dad has ever really done for us as far as we are concerned. He listed no beneficiaries on his 401k and had no will. This is taking place in Michigan, and the lawyer came highly recommended by my mentor in the local chamber of commerce.  Thank you so much for your time.	Yes
My father plans on getting re-married later in his life.  I always thought when he passes away my brother and I would gain his inheritance and estate, but will my new stepmother be the new heir?  My father is older than her, so he will most likely pass away first.  My soon-to-be stepmother also has two children of her own.  I'm afraid she will gain all my father's assets and use them to benefit her children.  Is it still possible for my brother and I to inherit all my fathers property and assets when the inevitable happens.  We all live in California.	Yes
"California. Married, no kids (and there won't be any.) I have some personal assets (stocks, etc) and a partial share of a multi unit building that we live in (a san francisco tenancy in common) Our finances are mostly separate, we contribute to a shared bank account that we use for expenses.  I'd like to make sure that if I kick the bucket she'll get my assets, particularly the TIC share, with a minimum of hassle.   Is a trust the thing I want? A will? I've talked informally with a couple of different lawyers and have heard stuff ranging from ""you to combine all your assets"" to ""you don't have to do anything, it's automatic"" So I'd like to have a few more data points...  Particularly regarding trusts, I'm worried that transferring my share of the building to a trust will allow/trigger a property tax reassessment, which would suck for me and the other owners of the building. This may be too california-specific to be easily answerable.  TL;DR how do I make it so my wife doesn't have to go through probate, pay taxes, in order to get my stuff if I die unexpectedly?"	Yes
What do I need to do to inform SS, credit cards, banks, etc? Not sure where to go from here.	Yes
"I recently purchased insurance for a year long trip that I'm taking. It was a little unexpected, so I asked my doctor for some prescriptions I have for a pre existing condition and he decided that he would tweak them a bit. This counted as a ""change in medication"" so now I am not covered for my pre existing condition. I'm not too worried, but if I remain stable for sixty days I saw some policies would cover me. I don't want to go without any insurance, so I have purchased emergency medical. But if I want to change companies partway through to get the pre-existing condition covered (about sixty days after I arrive-I know world nomad begins policies when you're already away) can I do that? I know I won't get my money back after the ten day review period, but will they cancel the policy so I can go with another company?"	Yes
Knowing my family, they wouldn't respect my last wishes. So I'm wondering if, legally, there's a way to make sure I don't have a funeral when I die? Maybe leaving a will? If so, how would I go about doing that and what would be the cheapest option?  Even $100 would be difficult for me to come up with.	Yes
"My sister recently passed away under some very bothersome circumstances. My family has been involved in a lawsuit over this, which is reaching its end point. We were recently informed that before everything is finalized, my father is legally entitled to inquire about his possible share of the settlement. This naturally caused a collective ""WTF?!"" moment throughout my family, as he his an absentee deadbeat who hasn't had contact with the family in well over a decade, and even when contacted about becoming a co-executor of my sister's estate, he waived his rights by not giving a fuck and ignoring it. Here are some key points:  * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate.  * My sister passed away as a legal adult; after emancipation.  * This lawsuit was initially filed by my mother as an individual, and soon turned into it being on behalf of my sister's estate, as she became the sole executor.  * My father waived his rights when it came to becoming co-executor of my sister's estate. He had an opportunity to pursue it but didn't, and has absolutely no association with the lawsuit, my sister's estate, or the family.  * My father hasn't had any contact with my family for almost 13-14 years, and has never made any attempt to make contact. He knows very little about us, made no effort to contact us and seek information regarding my sister's passing.  * My father owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support, and is a tax dodger. He's been to jail several times over both. Our attorney and the judge handling this knows, as we've provided extensive documentation about this."	Yes
"My grandpa died in May. My grandpa died way before he did, and they'd saved and invested for years so he had a good amount of money, plus a paid off house. Grandpa always told me that I was to get half. He gave me the portion of his trust documents that named me so I could see the percentage I was getting (though there's no dollar amount).   It's now August and I've heard nothing from any lawyer. The trustee is my uncle (my grandpas son) but his wife (Aunt M) is really running the show. They're the other beneficiaries on the trust (it's actually 40% to me, 40% to them, and 20% to another aunt, Aunt K).   My maiden name is on the paperwork, not my married name. His house hasn't been sold nor have any of his other assets been liquidated (there's not many of those because he gave away most of his big stuff years ago, but I'm pretty sure they still have to liquidate everything). Aunt K also hasn't heard anything about how the process is going. It's a living trust so it shouldn't take this long I thought-- I mean it won't be settled in a few months but I think I should have heard *something?*  Today this is the reply I get from Aunt M, when I asked how this process is going:  ""Good morning, the financial group sent the check now it goes thur the bank attorney he reviews everything then the checks are sent out to everyone. I'll check with the bank, shouldn't be too much longer.""   Does that sound legit? For reference, I'm in Ohio: Aunt K is in California, the trust was drawn up in Oregon, and Aunt M is in Washington state where my grandpa died.   Thanks for any advice you can give me. I just want to know if I'm being scammed somehow by her. She's got a history of being dishonest."	Yes
"So essentially i was brought up under the guise of paternal alienation and covert incest. On top of a this, she also told all of us that Grandma would leave us an money when she died but 2 years after he death the will has been put into probate and we have been refused to see the will. She knows we are poor and she seemingly will just hold on to it till she dies.  First aspect, parental alienation. My mother would rarely ever speak positively of her my Dad. She belittled at every turn. Worse, she belittle his attempts at counseling and essentially use us to make him hit rock bottom (arrested usually.) my Mom did this portray herself as the valiant Mom. These things made bonding with him difficult and this only made things worse for him. She would never stage support for him, only ridicule him. He was like Lisa with Charlie Brown's football. We had to move 3000 miles to find work in the South because he failed a pisstest at his job. He has mental illness for sometime and figure she knew how to manipulate him. He lost so many opprotunities but my mother would always play the Wight Knight for him. Meth and pot arrests were big ones, however I witnessed her engage in these activities as well. Only after she would quickly criticize him. He was punching bag.   Stage 2: Covert incest, my mother always crossed every boundary with me. As a 4 year old, she bought me happy meals every day. She would constantly take me places and spend abhorrent time with me. I had a very hard time making connections with people. As I grew up after the move, I began to try and distance. But she would still act in ways that were inappropriate. The in 2008, my father tried leaving for the 1st time. Me and my sister quickly became each others escape. I would try and spend as much time with her as I could so I would not have to see my mother. The. In July my sister left with Dad for custody. I stayed with Mom and I believe she sexually manipulated. It got out of hand it was incredibly harming my 13 year old mind. Graphic depictions of sex and touchiness. These began the unwanted sexual thoughts that still plague me today. She offered me to come ""to bed with her"" one night. Of course that seemed like a sexual invite considering the previous events. But she knew I would have strong reaction that. All these thoughts made me turn to drugs and alcohol. I hung out with the wrong people. And she encouraged this. She would pretend like it was all okay. Then my Dad decided to come back and I would try rebuild a relationship with him. My mother interviened ever chance she got. She always would bad mouth any effort he made to connect. I thus would hang out and seek people who had drugs. This also impacted my relationship with Dad. Anytime he tried to stop me, my mother would constantly remind him about his past deeds.this only made me get worse.  Eventually in 2012 I started stealing some of my Moms tramadol pills because I was experiencing profound depression. She never addressed with me. But she knew it was going on and moved the bottle around and did try and intervene. This was the begining of a two year binge encouraged by my Mom and lead to me losing my scholarship. She practically encouraged me to leave school. My father left shortly after this. Now that he was gone for good, it was back to sexual manipulation and using drugs as a means to control. I quit tramadol on my own and then she began to romanticize her drug use and then a new substance for me. As this went I became more and more depressed and she began treating me worse and worse.the only reason I put up with was because she promised Grandma would leave an inheiritance. She would die and then she refused to talk about. I eventually was fed up and tried talking with my 17 year old sister for help. I was planning on getting help with that money. Turns out, my mother had manipulated her into blaming her father's absence on me. My sister geniunely complains about issues I can not fix. I left shortly after my mother refuses to help me in anyway.my father is so broken and he lives many miles away.   There is the issue of the will as well. i have checked the county office and the will is not in probate. She is ripping of my sister me and my two cousins. I think she is promising my sister money.   Thats the most polished way to put it. Is there anything I can do about the trust? Oh and she has stalled the divorce for three years. Its all just jumbled up and designed to be confusing as hell. Is there anyway to proceed with anything?"	Yes
Hello, /r/legaladvice.  I am currently researching the topic of Power of Attorney in British Columbia and an attorney’s ability to designate, alter or revoke a beneficiary designation on behalf of the adult (that made the enduring power of attorney).   Section 20(5) of the [Power of Attorney Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96370_01#section20) lays out specific circumstances under which an attorney can change or create a beneficiary designation.   However, my research of inquiries where this has arisen in my line of work has stated that an attorney has the power to make beneficiary designations if the Power of Attorney explicitly grants that power and, further, that Section 20(5) of the Power of Attorney Act only applies when such a provision does not exist in the Power of Attorney.   This leads me to believe that the Power of Attorney Act must fall under the legal doctrine of “everything which is not forbidden is allowed” **and so my question: is it codified anywhere that this Act, or British Columbia legislation in general, falls under this doctrine?** If so, where can I find that? Does Section 13(2) of the POA Act (“An adult may grant general or specific powers to an attorney”) considered to be the application of this doctrine?  Also, a side question. Years ago in a civics class I learned about this principle of if a law doesn’t forbid something then it is considered allowed and it was described with a one word adjective. Permissive? Non-exclusive? I can’t quite remember what that was. Does this ring a bell for anyone?   TIA	Yes
A friends grandmother has split her will among her four children. However, her daughter (my friends mother) died before she did. By this point the grandmother was senile and could no longer change her will so she died with her will unchanged. My friend would like to know whether she inherits the money willed to her mother or the remaining three children split the money between them.   Thank you for your help	Yes
My grandfather passed away recently.  More than a year ago he added me as a co-owner on his bank account. What happens to the money in that account? Does it become part of his estate, am I entitled to it?   I thought I was entitled to at least some of it as the co-owner, but my aunt said not to spend any of it because she would have to pay creditors with it.   The whole point of putting me on his account was because he wanted me to have the money. (I was his caretaker &amp; he lived with me). It's not a whole lot - prob about 5k.   I'm in PA.  TLDR had a joint account with my grandpa, in PA, what happens to the money?	Yes
Ok, so about a year ago my grandmother passed away. No will was left behind, but she had expressed that she wished for it to be sold and split amongst the four grandchildren. She has no living children.   I have no way to contract two of us (no social media, no known number as i haven't talked to them in years and they didn't show up to the funeral) and the third has said she wants the house solely for herself as she thinks she deserves it more.   I can't afford a lawyer, but i want to see the house sold and split evenly. What steps do i take to see this happen? If it matters, this is in Illinois and I'm the oldest grandchild.	Yes
I know it sounds ridiculous to make a will at 18 but I am suicidal and I do not trust my parents at all, nor do I trust any immediate family members with anything that I own. In addition, I don't want them inheriting anything since they aren't very nice people. And is it possible to give everything to one person? I don't have any friends or any family members that I'm really close to. I only have my boyfriend. Any help/advice would be great appreciated.	Yes
My grandfather died about 6 months ago and left all of his assets to his recent wife and made her the executor of his will. The one exception to this was my grandparent's house which he left her in a life estate.  Before his death he and his wife co-signed on a loan for several tens of thousands of dollars against the house. This past week I started getting calls from a debt recovery company asking about his finances. I know from my research that my family and I can't be chased down for his debts as we haven't received anything from and have no control over his estate, so I am not concerned about that.  Ideally we would like to sell the house ourselves and pay off the loan or take over the loan and rent out the house so it is not foreclosed on. I checked with my family and the deed was never updated to indicate the remaindermen he had described in his will so the first thing I am doing now is making sure that happens ASAP.  What are our best steps forward after that? Since she was on the loan can they even come after the house as part of the estate? We were thinking of calling the debt collection company and seeing if we could work with them directly, although we are not the executors so they may not even talk to us.	Yes
Delete if not allowed mods. I've searched the sidebar, and online, and haven't really gotten a solid answer to my question.  Currently my wife is the trustee for her fathers trust account. Trust is set up in Nevada. She put a lot of work into finalizing it all. Meetings with lawyers, closing multiple bank accounts, opening others, setting up auto pay, etc.  Question is, how does she determine a reasonable rate to pay herself? We've heard it can be 1% of the total trust, but that seems high. Is there a general mathematical equation to put in? Quarterly? Yearly?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
I've just received a copy of the trust documents and do plan to speak to an attorney on my behalf, but my grandma's husband's attorney also sent a w-9 form to be mailed to my grandparents home. His lawyer stated there is nothing to be distributed at this time (I'm assuming because they each has a sub-trust and if one of them dies the other can do what they want) and their grandchildren will each get half after their house is sold. The trust states that the surviving spouse gets to live in the house until their death if they so choose. So I'm not expecting to see any sort of money from that for a seriously long time. I've never had do taxes or fill out any IRS forms on my behalf and just want to know what the point of me sending this form to him would be. My dad used every penny that was left to my brother and I years ago when we were minors so I'm just really skeptical about everything going on right now.	Yes
"My sister recently passed away under some bothersome circumstances in police custody, and as a result, my family has been involved in a lawsuit regarding her death. This lawsuit is nearly over, and everything is about to be finalized. We were recently informed that my father is legally entitled to request his own share of the settlement. Naturally, this has caused a collective ""WTF"" among my family. Here are some key points:  * My sister died unexpectedly and left no will. * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate. * My father isn't attached to or associated with this lawsuit in any shape or form. * My father has dodged child support for well over a decade, and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail several times over this. * My father hasn't had any contact with my family since 2003; nor has he made any attempts to make any contact, in any form. The last time we saw him was when he showed up to my sister's funeral for approx. 10 minutes, and left. * My father made no attempt to help arrange, plan, or pay for my sister's funeral service."	Yes
Posting on behalf of my friend who just lost her step-father on Friday and is dealing with the fallout today.  I'm going to provide a little background to give you a better picture of her issue:  Her step-father passed away on Friday due to natural causes.  Sunday her and her mother (the deceaseds wife) and his family met to make arrangements, and his family didn't want her and her son included in the obituary, nor any arrangements in their name included in the funeral. He was in their lives more than 20 years, but since he never formally adopted her they don't think she should be included.  I think this is a sign things are going to get nasty.  This brings me to my questions:  He had no will, are they likely planning on pushing that fact that she wasn't his biological daughter to exclude her from getting anything?  His wife is still alive but is dealing with medical issues that impact her mental state at times.  What steps should they, (step-daughter and wife) take today to protect themselves?  My friend isn't interested in his money beyond making sure her mother will have enough money for her medical care, but he has considerable assets including a large house, many vehicles and a sizeable account.  Looking for any and all advice.	Yes
i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	Yes
Sorry if doesn't make sense. I'm 16 and my dad is quite old, past 70. He is leaving everything to me in his will, but I don't get it until age 25 which is fine. His brother (my uncle) is my trustee and he recently told my dad he is investing the money until I'm 25. My dad said no, it's my kid's (me) money, they get to decide. My uncle says it's not until I'm 25 and that he can invest the money if he wants and that it's too late to make changes to the will now. This was all in an email I wasn't supposed to be reading but I am just wondering is investing the money a good idea or is this bad... again sorry if this is confusing, I don't know much about this stuff, and would just like to know if my dad and I should talk about it?	Yes
So my mother passed away early this year and about a month or two afterwards he starts seeing this woman from Hong Kong who does not have Canadian citizenship or permanent residency. My father married her this month without me knowing but I found out there was no prenuptial agreement signed. So first of all, is he in any sort of trouble if the government deems this as a marriage of convenience? Second, with no prenup signed, how can we protect his assets (such as house and finances)? I don't trust her and I'm worried that she can take a lot from him if they divorce or would be able to claim everything if my father passes away even though he has a will that leaves his estate to me.	Yes
"Hello everyone I was wondering if any one had legal advice for contesting a will. Sorry if this is very long winded and not the right subreddit, let me know if I should cross post it somewhere better.   Some background, there is this woman ""J"" that my father my sister and myself feel have been taking advantage of  my  grandparents.  J was  ""bought"" (male order bride and what not) from the Philippines by her first husband who was friends with my grandparents. She had two kids by the time my sister and I were past the ""cute"" stages. My grandparents have a weakness for cute children and have been drooling over this woman and her kids for the past 16 years, including the new 6 yo kid with a new husband. This kid think my grandparents are hers and has no idea me or my father were relatives, so idk what J has been telling her but that could be paranoia talking.  We honestly have felt J has been taking advantage of my grandparents to try and be put on the will, and sure enough a few years ago they put her and her three kids on it for a very very gracious amount compared to the three blood family members that are on it. The grandparents refused to show us the will because J was on it. Since my dad in the executor so he was recently able to get a copy and it is split as follows:  30% to my dad, 10% to my sister 10% to me  20% to J 5% J kid 1 5% J kid 2 5% J kid 3 And the rest to boyscouts/church/stuff like that.  I guess our main concern/question is is there a way to contest the will effectively? I know there is a less then 1% of it happening historically. We think she should be on the will but this is extreme in our opinion. Her family, who's only been close friends essentially, gets more then their only son.   Also I guess we need a sanity check. Are we paranoid or are we justified in our feeling in your best opinion?"	Yes
"Hello.   My grandmother recently passed and left her estate to be divided among her grandchildren, including me.   My aunt, who was my grandmother's caretaker,  has sent all of the grandchildren a letter from her lawyer titled ""WAIVER OF NOTICE OF HEARING ON PETITION FOR LETTERS OF ADMINISTRATION AND CONSENT TO THE ENTRY OF AN ORDER OF SOLVENCY, WAIVER OF BOND""  The letter is about a page long, and basically states that upon an order of solvency by the court, my aunt will be the administrator of the estate and will be entitled to distribute or close said estate without court intervention or supervision.  She can sell, exchange, lease, mortgage, convey, etc the property of the decedent without court order, and without notice, approval, or confirmation.  The undersigned also waives the requirement for the issuance of a bond.     Is this basically asking me to give up my portion of the estate?  I'm having trouble understanding just exactly what she is asking me to sign, and when I've questioned her about it, she has been defensive and is pushing hard for me and the other grandchildren to sign it.     I could really use your advice, thank you for any light you can shed on this situation."	Yes
"**Yes, I know you're about to tell me to just hire a lawyer.**  My husband and I are expecting our first baby and we're working to get our finances and directives in order.  We have a relatively simple situation, the only ""big"" things being that we own a condo and we will soon have a dependent.  Given our situation, we feel pretty comfortable doing (and have been recommended by multiple sources to do) our documents DIY with an online service.  That being said, it's easy to find plenty of reviews saying ""it was easy and fast to use and the customer service was great!"" but I feel like the true test is in the actual execution of these documents.  You don't know if it was done right until it actually needs to be used.    So, has anybody out there executed a will and/or POA from an online service? Was it just fine or was it a disaster? We are particularly looking at LegalZoom and Willing. LegalZoom seems pretty solid but Willing is much newer so I'm curious to hear your anecdotes! Thank you!"	Yes
I wanted to apologize before hand, as I have never dealt with a situation like this before and I may be mixing terms up. If anything is unclear I'll explain to the best of my ability.  I recently received a letter in the mail regarding my deceased grandfather's estate that I was included in the Will for. It included a check for my portion of the estate.The letter stated the following verbatim:  &gt;We represent ****, executor of the estate of ****, Deceased. At this time, we are in a position to make a partial distribution of the amount bequeathed to you under **** will.  &gt;There are insufficient funds available in the estate to make full distributions. Accordingly, we are distributing funds at the pro rata amount of fifty percent of the amount bequeathed. Enclosed please fund two copies of a Receipt, Release, Indemnification, and Refunding Agreement for your review and signature. If you agree with the Receipt and Release document, please sign one copy in the presence of a Notary Public and return it to me in the envelope provided. The second copy is for your records. I have also enclosed an estate check payable to your order representing the amount due you as indicated in the release document.  &gt;One the estate is completed, we will be sending you an additional pro rata distribution of the balance of the estate. If you have any questions concerning the enclosed materials, please feel free to contact me at the telephone number listed above.  The letter then continued to the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement that said the following terms:  &gt;NOW, THEREFORE, the undersigned, beneficiary, intending to be legally bound, hereby: 1. Declares that he/she has read this instrument and that the facts set forth above are true and correct to the best of his/her knowledge, information and belief; 2. Requests the Executor to distribute the sum indicated to him/her and the acknowledges receipt of such distribution to him/her effective upon delivery to him/her; 3. Releases ad discharges the Executor and his successors from all further liability, responsibility, and accountability with respect to such distribution to him/her; 4. Agrees to refund all or any part of such distribution to him/her if it shoulder later be found that distribution was due to mistake (either innocent of negligent) is that all or part of it should have been paid to others or that taxes or other charges should have first been paid; 5. Agrees to indemnify the Executor against any and all liability, loss or expense (included, but not limited to, counsel fees) that the Executor may ever incur as a result of the distribution to him/her without first securing an award by the Court having jurisdiction over it; 6. Agrees that any claim under this agreement may be brought in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, agrees to submit to the jurisdiction thereof, and waives any objection to the jurisdiction thereof; 7. Declares it to be his/her intent that this instrument shall be governed by Pennsylvania law and shall be legally binding on him/her and on his/her executors, administration, heirs, successors, and assigns; and 8. Agrees that any period for the limitation of actions for the collection of any erroneous distribution to him/her shall commence only at such time as the Executor shall have obtained actual knowledge of such erroneous distribution and that in no event shall the period for collection of any erroneous distribution be less than two years after the actual discovery thereof by the Executor.   My major question here is to ask if anything above suggests that I should wait to deposit the check included with these documents and if I should have the Receipt, Release, Indemnification and Refunding Agreement signed and sent prior to doing so. Also, for an ELI5 of the terms I'd be agreeing to. I ask this because the executor of the will has done some cheap, questionable things in the past that have given his siblings and I reason to be suspicious that he might do something to exploit these terms. He also works for the firm that sent and wrote up these documents.  TL;DR-I received documents (detailed above) and a check from the firm handling the estate of my grandfather and wanted to make sure everything seems kosher since my Uncle who is the executor has been a shyster in the past. I also wanted to know if it is okay for me to deposit the check sent to me right away and when the appropriate time to send the signed documents back to the firm.	Yes
Hi I I'm located in BC, Canada and my mom recently passed away, she was in charge of cash fund that was disbursed to members of a group, every two weeks each member would place x amount of dollars into the pot and every two week someone from the group would claim the pot. Each member could claim the pot once during the duration but would have to continue contributing to it till each member has collected.  Luckily I have all the details of the pot and what goes funds go where and to who, what I want to do is protect myself and her estate in the event someone claims that payment was not made to them after I disburse the funds. Is there a document that I can use that would be legally binding, I plan to have witnesses with me when payments are made.  I really do appreciate any help and thanks for taking the time to read this, have a great day.	Yes
Once I am incapacitated, can't they just jave me declared incompatent and change whatever they like? Do I need to keep my attorney on retainer til then to prevent it? Is there some kind of advocate I can hire?	Yes
Hello, When my wife's uncle died he left her an inheritance but it stated she had to be 25 years of age to receive it. In her place, her mother was to place it in a trust account and manage it until that point. My wife is now 26 and her mother has now said that she won't give her access to the money until she dies.  We have a good relationship with her parents and this seems odd. We have a copy of his will and it clearly says that the money should be in trust to [Wife's mom] until [wife] attains the age of 25 in which the trust will terminate and my wife will have full access to it.  I hate fighting with family over money but we are both working 60 hours a week to make a better life for our family. Any advice would be appreciated. If anything I said is unclear I will be happy to answer further questions. Thanks reddit!	Yes
Firstly this is about my dad and just looking for some assurance that what I have been telling him is correct. Basically he and my aunt had my grandparents house signed over to them both (joint 50/50 owners) before they passed away. For the last 3 years it has been virtually uninhabited and as a result whenever I've been I have seen it progressively becoming more run down.  He wants nothing to do with the house and would prefer to sell it. My aunt keeps saying that she wants to keep it and because of this dispute and him thinking it's a massive task, my dad has not done anything.  From what I think, there are two options she has if he wants to sell which is either to buy out his 50% portion at an agreed or court ordered market rate OR she can agree to sell the house and the total value of the estate would be divided equally.  She wants to do renovations on the property and is asking my dad for money which he keeps thinking if he doesn't could affect the overall split of their ownership but I am quite sure that he has no obligation to contribute.  The property is located in Germany so falls under German law (if that makes any difference). The other thing I was thinking of is if he could sign power of attorney to me so I can work with the lawyers on his behalf (so as to stop it dragging on for another three years).  Any help would be greatly appreciated as this has been a massive burden.	Yes
Please no hotline numbers or any bullshit like that.  I want to make a will that will ensure that when I die that there is a DNR, my organs can be used for whatever purpose, that there is no funeral/wake/religious ceremony, that my body is donated to science, and that my body is cremated afterwards and flushed down a toilet for all I care.  https://www.slideshare.net/tomwinfrey/sample-last-will-and-testament    Is that link that has a sample a good way to start it out?  I'm 30, not married, never married, no children, etc.  Should I start it out like that?  I think the Personal Representative is an Executor, right?  Being brutally honest when I say I don't have a dollar to my name, so I can't get an attorney.  I also don't have any friends or anything similar.  Can I leave it to my mother to being the executor, even though she will be a witness to the will (hopefully...)?  The payment of debts is tricky for me because I am heavily indebted with credit card debt, school debt, and a Personal Guarantee for a failed business lease contract.   So its around 150k.  Unfortunately my mom is on the lease contract for the failed business, so she will be stuck with that (yeah, I know its shitty of me, but I give up).  Can someone chime in on this here?  The only thing under my name is a car.  Should I try to get that into my dad's name?  He is disabled, so I'm not sure if that is possible.  They would REALLY need to sell the car in order to make ends meet.  Is there anything else that I am missing?	Yes
"I'll try to make this as in a nutshell as possible, and be watching the comments for any questions needing more information. Grandparent's left will for all belongings to go to my father. Uncle rarely ever visited them. Grandfather passed about 3 months ago. Uncle for whatever reason is executor of the estate. Grandmother has hardcore alzheimer's, is in bad shape (bed sore, can't feed herself) and staying at uncle's personal care home.  Uncle wants to keep her away from hospice cause ""feels like she has a while more to live"" -his words. He is getting paid any money she gets from herself and my grandfather's pension, including he stated another $1K per month for her to stay at his home. He plans on selling my grandparent's estate in order to pay for the cost of her staying there.... AKA he will get everything in cash from my father when in reality nothing was left to him. Father said he doesn't have enough cash to hire a lawyer currently, though I feel as if he's milking the estate he should be reported to having my Grandmother still at his home since she should not at all be at a care home and needs to if so be in actually nursing home with actual nurses. The care home is all run by my Uncle's side of the family.   Any advice here would be wonderful as no clue where to start calling or looking for help on this matter. My father wanted my grandparent's house to move into and didn't want to have to sell everything especially the house for my Uncle to end up taking everything when he's never been around for years. (Plus Uncle came into the house today taking bags of stuff, didn't tell us he was going or what he took, as my father installed cameras around the property).  Also, this is just outside Pittsburgh if that helps with any information on who I would contact on any of this. Thank you guys again for your time. I lurk a lot but really needed advice this time myself."	Yes
My Mum passed away 3 years ago and in her will she left her house to her partner then upon his passing it was to be sold and proceeds divided between the 3 grandchildren.Her partner and my sister never got on and he has made a will leaving the house to my wife and I. What recourse would my sister have to enforce the original will?	Yes
Oklahoma is the place.   So, friends of mine are dealing with their mothers death. She passed last week. They are pretty sure that their parents were not divorced but have been separated only for 20+ years.   The father(or widower) might be married to someone in another state for around the same time of the separation to now. He is also starting to try and call the shots on many things with the estate.   Anyone have any advice on what they should expect? This is confusing me to no end but I'm not a lawyer.	Yes
My mom has a copy of his will from 1981. The will is not notarized, therefore my family is wondering if it is a legal will. My mom's uncle, my grandpa's brother, is the executor.  If my mom needs a lawyer, which I'm assuming she does, she is in southern Cali and my grandpa died in northern Cali. Should the lawyer be by my mom or by my grandpa.   If the will is legal, my grandpa had two more kids after the will was written. What are those two kids entitled to get? My mom wants to add them to the will but I don't know if that is possible. If it isn't, I think she wants to give them what they are entitled to regardless of the will.   Last my aunt is also in the will. My aunt is bipolar. She is not really able to take care of herself. Most of the time she prefers to live under a bridge even though she has a home. My mom wants to give my aunt my grandpa's trailer but she is worried about leaving her money. She is hoping the money can go to someone who can monitor what is given to my aunt. But if the will directly leaves my aunt money is that possible?   Thank you in advance.	Yes
The estate has plenty of assets to cover all debts so that is not the issue. Am I okay as executor to cover the post-funeral dinner for the relatives of the deceased from the assets. It will probably be $1000 out of an estate of $4m. 	Yes
Since the failing health and death of my great grandma, my family has been very divided and communication has been spilt between my  grandma and uncle on one side and my mom on the other. My uncle is the executor of the will and my mom does not know if he has executed the will. She is also afraid that the will may be altered to the benefit of my uncle and grandma.  Is there anyway to check to see if he has already started to execute the will through probate court? My mom is unsure if it is apathy or devious motives that he has not executed the will or communicated with her. How can she approach the situation legally to make sure the will is executed so that this ugly situation can be resolved and moved on from?	Yes
So i'm going to kill myself. i tried in august and failed and i definitely should have succeeded. the past few months haven't changed anything. basically that's not why i'm here. i have some student and credit card debt. what happens when i die to that? i don't wanna leave my parents with financial problems after i'm gone. they have life insurance on me but not that much. Does the debt disappear or is there something i can do first? thanks. 	Yes
Dad just died, now my Mom is trying to put all her ducks in a row in case she passes too. I have 2 younger siblings that Mom wants things to go to equally. Issue is that my younger brother and his wife and kid are moving into my Mom's house (so they can save rent) and my Mom wants to give them the house if she passes away, but wants all her assets split equally. How can she set this up so that it balances equally for all 3 siblings? She told me that the house she wants to put in my brother's name is not her largest asset (IRA, savings, etc).  I understand that my brother may help care for the house while he's there, and might take on some of my Mom's care down the road (but probably not, it'll be me, the eldest, as he's kinda flaky).	Yes
My mom has always been a bit controlling so I'm kind of doubting her intentions on this.. However, she just told me she went to a lawyer and got them to write me up a will and make her my health power of attorney.  The whole thing just feels weird and I didn't ask for it.. but I'm not really sure why this is needed, her intentions could be okay.  Can anyone explain the purpose of this? Everything online is really confusing and I'd rather be educated on this before she comes and asks me to sign the documents.  Information: 23, we live in different states, I'm not married and honestly do not have a net worth of much - about 30k.	Yes
My aunt is getting quite old and wants to set up a Living Trust and Will.  Both are quite straight forward as she wants to give everything to her daughter however she does have an estranged son that she no longer communicates with and wishes to ensure that he does not receive anything..  would LegalZoom be acceptable for this or would it be best to consult a lawyer.  also what would the expected cost be for a Living Trust and Will?	Yes
I'm moving out of the US and from what I understand, should have a POA to act on my behalf if needed with regard to banking, taxes, etc. I have a sibling in MI and a friend in FL that I would like to give independent POA. Obviously they can't sign one form at the same time in front of witnesses and a notary. Is it okay if I create two separate forms as long as I reference the other POA on it? Thanks in advance.	Yes
My friends mom died and did have a will, naming her as executor. Her mom was single, her parents are both deceased. I'm helping her with a checklist of what she needs to do to close her estate, I'm wondering if probate lawyers need payment up front or will they take payment once the estate is settled? She doesn't have much money but her mom does. Any advice is very helpful.	Yes
Hello all, I'm based in the UK, my grandmother recently underwent a lung transplant, things have gone south as she had a heart attack and is now in a critical condition. My mother is looking after my cousin (as she lived with my Nan) and my Aunt who has downs syndrome. I'm posting on behalf of my mother on if the power of attorney (or what is it and we aren't completely sure) would apply. This is because my mum's step-father has been taking money off my aunty (with down syndrome) for himself whilst they've been staying with us, and we believe he may/ or may not, have taken my grandmothers stash of money she hid away in the house alongside her will. What I'm trying to ask is if there is anyway we can hold/take ownership over my Nan's and aunties bank accounts (as they're both in my nans name) 1. whilst my Nan is in her critical condition 2. If she doesn't make it through. Mainly to stop him getting ahold of any of their money (my mum is the executor on the will if that means anything) as he's began to say that he is looking for my nan's pin to pay for stuff whilst shes away (they had separate accounts for a reason and he isn't in the will whatsoever).  Any advice on what to do in the situation would be greatly appreciated- once again we are in the UK. Thank you.	Yes
"My family are having issues with a trust fund set up by my father who passed away in 1998 and think we have been treated extremely unfairly for almost 20 years. This has now come to a breaking point – the trust has informed us they no longer think we (my brother and I) are beneficiaries due to an deed which was signed by Protector rather than my father and the firm are seeking legal and tax advice on the outcome of this.  In order to tell this story right I’ll section my post.   **Background:**  Relevant parties: Myself (f25), Mother (49), Brother (20), father (deceased), half-sister (no contact), half bother (no contact), my uncle who is protector (some contact but not close).  My parents were never married but had been together for 10 years. Previous to this my father was married and had two children. They divorced a few years before meeting my mother.  My father had a trust fund set up in in 1991 (before my brother and I were born but when my parents were together). My parents moved from the UK to another country were they made a life together – owning a property together, a boat and were in the process of building another property. Around 1996 my father sold his business in the UK.  The unbuilt house, the business and the boat were all assets of the trust.  My father passed away unexpectedly back in 1998 when I was around the age of five and my brother (M20) was a few months old.   **History of the Trust:**  The 1991 Deed The trust was set up in 1991 – the original trustees were UK residents. The trust was established by a deed of settlement and expressed to be a Guernsey law trust. The protector of the trust was appointed to my uncle.  The beneficiaries of the trust were declared: 1. The settlor (life tenant) 2. The spouse and any former spouse of the settlor 3. The children of the settlor.  Change of trustees 1991 The trustees retired in favour of a new trust to take over.  1997 Deed 1 – Addition of my mother: My mother was added as a beneficiary.  1997 Deed 2: This introduced different terms. To pay the income of the trust to his children and my mother in equal shares until my brother reached 25, when of which all the capital will be divided between the beneficiaries.  1999 Appointment: Additions of beneficiaries and appointment of assets A deed was prepared that added myself and my brother as beneficiaries. This was due to them finding we do not come under the definition of children for the purposes of the trust or the 1997 Appointment as our parents were unmarried. This added new terms, notably allowing the discretionary distribution of income and capital before the youngest child (my brother) turned 25.  In order to be a part of this ‘deal’, my mother put my parents shared property in the trust portfolio (this is important information – bear with me!)  Change of Trustee 2002: The trustees retired in favour of a new trust to take over. This trust remains the current trustee of the trust.  2008 Deed: Appointments of the trust fund Under the 1999 deed the trust gave my half-sister and half-brother their full amounts as they are ‘legitimate’ children.   **The Problems:**  For years my family have had battles with the trust over unfair treatment. I wont go into the details of this, it’s so lengthy and an issue itself but we have asked to leave them a number of times. We were always told its not possible for any of us (Myself, Mother, Brother, Half-sister, Half-brother). We were told we would need to wait until my brother turned 25. Over the course of the years we’ve (my immediate family – not half siblings) lost about £60,000 + combined from fees.  Back in 2015, I asked for a deposit for my first home. After a lengthy email battle over the year, they finally agreed. At some point during this it came to light that my half siblings walked away years ago (we were never made aware), and that my mother has had the ability to walk away since 2008 (again, we were never told despite continuously asking to leave). When this came to light my mother instantly asked for her funds, they agreed to start making this happen.  It didn’t happen. Instead they sent us a letter a year later stating that after investigating our Trust as something came to light which means me and my brother may not be beneficiaries after all.  In preparing my distribution for my house deposit, they reviewed the 1991 Deed concerns were found/ raised.  **Problem 1**  Basically, my dad didn’t sign the ‘Change of trustees 1991’ document despite having priority power under the terms. It was executed by my uncle – as this dates way back we aren’t sure why, perhaps my father was unavailable. But he did instruct my uncle to do so on his behalf.  The second Trustees have communication from 1994 regarding this issue – however they, and the previous trustees decided they ‘were satisfied the Settlor was not available and therefor a change of trustees executed by the protector was valid’. This was because the settlement listed three person with the power to appoint replacements ‘The settelor, the protector and the trustees’  Flash forward 20 years and a law firm now thinks that the second trustees (1991) decision was ‘wrong’ and that our current trustees should take the matter to court seeking a clear idea of the tax consequences.  The law firm advice found there are two outcomes: 1.	The 1991 retirement deed is invalid but the 2002 deed is valid.  2.	Or they are both invalid and the trust should have never moved from the UK and there will be serious tax implications. There are serious tax implications for both and the trust are currently investigating these and we are awaiting results. This investigation is costly (£10,000 so far) and the distributions are being made from our ‘accounts’ with them.   **Problem 2: Me and my brother being added post 1991 Retirement Deed.**  As the 1991 Retirement Deed is likely to be found invalid, it is also likely me and my brother are invalid as this was exercised by ‘invalid’ trustees and after my fathers death. Yet my mothers appointment is fine as this was exercised by my father while he was alive and under the terms of the original 1991 deed.  Therefor we are awaiting tax information and investigation into the 1991 deed,1997 appointment and 1999 appointment as it has bearings on 1. The tax positions 2. The validity of past distributions 3. Whether to continue with court application 4. How to respond for future requests for distributions 5. Whether the second trust have any obligation to assist.  **Where we stand**  We’re currently awaiting the tax information but the trust have said to us that they would be looking at hopefully distributing all capital to us so we can walk away from this (yeah right – I’m sure they’re going to offer that).  From our point of view we are an innocent party to this. We’re angry that: 1. It seems we will have most of the capital taken from us due to mistakes that weren’t ours. 2. That they convinced my mother to put her shared home into the trust under a now false promise. 3. They may seek the past distributions from us! 4. Our half siblings have been able to walkaway from this mess.S o many other things.  **My main questions are:** 1.	Will we be held responsible and ultimately be the ones who will have to pay for this mess? 2.	Do you think there is any room to recoup loss/ sue for this mess (fees throughout the years and the likely loss of all the capital as this has not been picked up previously (apart from the communication in 1994)? 3.	If they do come back with a resolution to this (an offer to walkaway with a sum), do you think we should consider it? I’m concerned as I feel we are still the ones who have ultimately paid the price of someone else mistake. Even in the unlikely case this was presented, for all these years we have paid so many fees, and now feed for this tax/ law firm (who we have no contact with and know nothing about!) and the fact that my mother could have walked away years ago (she has been paying fees all that time!) 4.	What type of solicitor should we be seeking advice from?  Please help! This is causing us so much distress and pain. It’s been ongoing all my life and we just want out of it now.  TL;DR  Current Trust is arguing the previous trust was invalid as a retirement deed was signed by protector rather than my father who is now deceased. This makes previous addition of me and my brother (after my dad passed) invalid and the moving of the trust to a offshore trust invalid. This could have serious tax implications for us and also removes us from the trust, making all previous distributions invalid. Basically big £££ and distress over a mistake that was not ours and was overlooked for almost 20 years. Currently being made to pay all the legal costs of this by our trust (distributions being made from the trust capital). Should we sue or seek legal action?   Also half siblings were informed they could leave early and left in 2008 with capital. Despite my mother continuously asking to leave and being told no, it has recently come to light she could of in 2008 yet they didn’t tell her and she has paid fees since then!   Please, any advice is welcome :(   FYI Despite how this story sounds my father and mother came from different backgrounds – my mother being working class. I would consider us to be working class right now so available funds are limited and all tied up in the trust."	Yes
Here is my question. If I were to commit suicide without a will wrote up for my kids, will they be left with my debt and taxes? Would it be better to not have them in a will, put each child's possessions in separate storages, and my cars into their names?	Yes
So this is a throw away account since I'll be giving away a bit about my location here. I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.   I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.   Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.  So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.	Yes
"Okay, so my mom passed away in the state of Texas back in 2009. One year before the, she and her husband at the time took out a home equity line of credit. He co-signed. Then she died. There was no probated will upon her death. As I understood it, the house and property goes to her husband at the time of death. I was in the military and have NEVER had any financial or legal ties or obligation to the house. Anyway, he stopped paying on the loan last year. Back in December, the attorney representing the bank calls me and asks if I have talked to my former step-father (who co-signed on the loan). I explained that he and I haven't been on speaking terms since my mom's death due to personal reasons. Then about two weeks ago, I get written notice in the mail that they are trying to  pursue judgment against my deceased mother, her husband, and ""any heirs..."". I immediately called the attorney representing the bank (plaintiff) and left a vocie mail explaining that I have never have any financial or legal ties to that property and that I have not been able to reach my former step-father. Today, I get written notice that now I personally and being sued for the property....  Mind you, I haven't lived in the state of Texas in 14 years. I have NEVER had any ties to my mom's house. But now they are suing ME for it?!?   I'm a full time college student here in California. I have ZERO means to defend myself financially. I can't afford to hire a defense attorney. I called and left another voicemail for the prosecuting attorney explaining yet again that I have no ties to the property. I requested that they call me back ASAP to straighten this out.  I don't get why I am being sued for 35k for a property that is never and was never my responsibility."	Yes
My friend's mother is currently being taken care of by hospice and they called her mother's siblings and told them that it is time to make funeral arrangements.  As her mother has been an incredible money pit her whole life and quite the burden on her siblings, they are declining to pay for any part of the funeral arrangements, and are foisting the monetary issues onto my friend (We'll call her Alice).  Alice is a management figure at a food chain, and doesn't make the money to pay completely for the cremation of the body.  Are there any legal footings that Alice can stand on that will compel her next of kin (who are loaded by the way) to pitch in or contribute to the cremation costs and transportation costs?  Is there any financial help that she can garner to complete the burial?  She would like to avoid the state taking the body so I would like to get an answer swiftly since her mother doesn't have much time left.  Thank you in advance for any information or help you may have.  We are located in Brevard County Florida, USA.  If this is the wrong subreddit to post in I am sorry in advance.	Yes
My mother, who I've been estranged from for several years passed away recently. I'm the only real family she had so I've begun the process to sort through the estate.  She always had some hoarding tendencies but I discovered after going to her house that she had become a full-blown hoarder. Like, rooms so full of junk that you can't access them.  I've run into 3 complications so far that I'm dealing with:  1. Despite an exhaustive search, there doesn't seem to be a will.  2. She was a renter, and the landlord obviously wants the house cleared out.  3. Under what I've read on NC law she would almost certainly qualify under the NC Small Estates law (I seriously doubt that in all that trash there's over $20,000 worth of property.) But under that law I cannot become administrator of the estate until 30 days after she died.  I'm trying to do the right thing by the landlords since they were personal friends of my Mom for over 20 years, and I've found a specialty hoarder cleanout company that can empty the house out.  So here's what my questions are:  1. Is it legally OK for me to clear the house out despite me not actually being the administrator yet? Everyone basically has already been treating me like one since there's nobody else to challenge me on it, but it won't be official for at least a couple more weeks.  2. The cleaners have said that since I'm not actually administrator yet that they want a letter from an attorney stipulating that I'm the only heir. How difficult/expensive would it be for me to get this?  Thanks in advance!	Yes
This is post ended up having quite a few questions but they're all  in regards to money.  I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ?   My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?  This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.  Please help me, I want to live my life on my own as soon as I can, I don't live with physical abuse or anything too bad but there is some problems and it's just one of those homes where you don't want to stick around past your due.  The day I turn 18 is going to be a great day and I want to get an idea of what I have to do.  I appreciate anything you can help me with even if it's only one thing, thank you in advance to/if anyone that can help.	Yes
My wife and I have two very young children (both under the age of 2) who are babysat and adored by family friends who are about our age. They love our kids almost as much as we do. We're trying to make plans for the future, including a will, and want the family friends to raise the kids if something happens to us. They have accepted (tears of joy were involved), and we just need to figure out the legal path.  Our own parents are late in their own life stages due to the age at which we chose to have children, with the youngest of our kids' grandparents about 60 years old. We have concerns with the idea of our kids losing their parents, and then potentially having to deal with losing a new set of parents in their teens (or earlier--three of the four grandparents have serious health conditions). Only one, the wife's grandmother, has what might be considered an ongoing relationship, and that's only once or twice a month for 2-3 hours at a time, always with us around.  The problem is that we expect the grandmother and the father's parents to not take this well (that's a relationship issue and not in play for this post) and to fight it legally. We'd like to know what to expect when we select a lawyer to figure out the path, and what is involved in ensuring that there is an opportunity for the grandparents to be in our kids' lives but not have the opportunity to gain custody. This is prep work to make as easy as possible what is going to be, at least in some ways, a very difficult process.	Yes
My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	Yes
"Forgive me if this isn't an appropriate subreddit for this subject.  My grandfather passed three months ago, leaving a will that split the inheritance between his three daughters. He had $100,000 in checking and savings accounts, a house on 80 acres of land probably only worth about $150,000, and shares of stock worth another $90,000. He happened to tell my mother, sister, and I that the shares of stock were to be split between us, the two granddaughters. He happened to not mention this to his other two daughters, my aunts, one of whom is the executor, and it isn't in the will.  Regardless, everybody has agreed that we two granddaughters will get this money to honor his wishes, though my eldest aunt, the executor, believes that this will be extremely difficult. She has declined to hire a lawyer for help, and lives on the other side of the country. She seems to be showing signs of early dementia, and has difficulties performing the simplest of tasks, including filling out simple forms. We can't directly help her, because she is so far away, and she refuses to ""waste"" money on a lawyer, though she is blowing thousands of dollars a month (it has been three months so far) because the enormous lawn needs to be maintained at nearly $200/week, and utilities are still on because she hasn't turned them off, property taxes are ridiculous, and the stock and property values have been declining steadily.   My mother and other non-executor aunt are frustrated, but at this point would rather give up the money than deal with their sister or bother with legal counsel. My sister and I are frustrated and could really use the money, but believe we have no legal recourse because we aren't formally in the will.  She is making zero progress on the estate and it is wasting money and preventing us from getting our inheritance. Is there anything my sister and I can do?   Additional info: Aunt lives in Arizona. Estate and sister are in NY. I am in Washington."	Yes
My deceased grandmother died in 2009 and she left me money in her will. My aunt is the executor of the will but won't pay it out, and I'm legally an adult now so what options do I have in claiming this? Also the will dictates that there is cash money in my name but my aunt says that the money was put into a 529 college plan for me.   What should I do?	Yes
I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	Yes
I own a trailer that is on my father-in-laws land. He is now deceased. The deed to the land is in his name. He did not have a will. But the land was automatically inherited by his children. Two of the heirs are now deceased as well. One of them was my husband. Our trailer is sitting on his part of the land. Which is in Carter Co Ky. Could any of the heirs tear down our trailer? What happens to my husband's part of the land that he is now deceased. He did not have a will. Is it legal for any of the heirs to tear down our trailer without our permission? Any help would be greatly appreciated!   	Yes
My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	Yes
"Hello, looking for some advice about the probate process for a small estate in the state of Arkansas. I've read up on what to do but I am still confused. Trying to understand if I need to go through probate court, or if this can just be solved through Arkansas's small estate process. I feel like this should be straightforward, so hopefully someone has some answers or recommendations.   My mother passed away last month. My father passed away 11 years ago, and I only have one (younger) brother.  I am named in her will as the executor of the will. My brother and I are listed in the will as beneficiaries, splitting any assets 50/50.   Her assets that are part of the estate are as follows: Checking account &amp; savings account, together totalling about $3K 11 year old van which she didn't owe money on, worth $1K at most  Assets that have my brother and I named as beneficiaries (so they shouldn't count towards in the probate process, right?): Life insurance policy for about $40K IRA account, about $30K 401K account, about $7K Another savings account, has about $200  Debts: Student loans, at least $20K Chase credit card, about $2K Not aware of others but will be running a credit report soon to confirm  From what I've read, her estate qualifies as a small estate in Arkansas, since it's worth less than $100K. So it should bypass probate court, and I simply need to file an affidavit of small estate. However, on the form for the affidavit of small estate, one of the stipulations for filing as a small estate is ""There are no unpaid claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate."" This is where I am confused. Chase wants to make a claim against the estate. If they make a claim, her assets are enough to cover the amount of their claim...so I assume I would need to pay them from the estate. However, I can't get the funds from her bank account to pay the claim without filing this affidavit. So how the heck am I supposed to pay them? Do I have to go through the probate court simply because there is a claim against her estate? I don't believe I should pay it out of my own pocket, it's not my debt. So it should come out of the estate. I'm just so confused about what to do next."	Yes
I need to write a complete last will and testament for a college assignment. I have a simple will I wrote by hand but it is barebones. I know it doesn't cover everything and my professor wants this will to be complete. Are there any actually free templates out on the internet? Any tips at all? 	Yes
I'm not sure which sub this should go in, but I recall seeing similar questions here. If there is a better sub, please direct me there.   My stepfather passed away suddenly. He didn't have much, but we need to handle his banking, cars, house, etc... No retirement, but of course he has some social security. He didn't have life insurance, but his wife did have some funeral insurance. His wife wants my wife (his daughter) to be the point person on this (executor?). What's the simplest, cheapest way to do this?  Our main concern right now is his car. He had a heart attack while driving and had a minor accident. The car was towed to a police lot. They will only release it to the owner. Well, he's passed away, and the technical owner is Carmax finance with whom he had a loan. They won't release it to his wife, stating they need legal ownership to claim the vehicle (she's not on the loan).	Yes
Am I entitled to a copy of a trust in the state of Arizona? I am a beneficiary of my grandfathers will and the trustees claim that I am not entitled to any paperwork, including the trust. Thinking of hiring an attorney if they do not provide these documents. They want me to sign a document written by a CPA (not an attorney) to relinquish my rights to question their authority, which I will not do without documentation. Thank you in advance.	Yes
My parent passed away 7 years ago. I was 18 at the time, and She left me a half the monetary value of the house, and the ownership name was put under my uncles (to make up the 2nd half) and specified on the will that I was to have access to these funds as of my 25th birthday. This is now coming up in 2 weeks, and my uncle hasn't made any moves towards taking out a mortgage nor has he put the house up for sale.  My last communication with him was in September 2016.. I have been attempting to get in touch with him semi-regularly since, as a reminder that we are nearing the deadline. The notary isn't helpful, and the executor of the will (my great aunt), is not doing her due diligence as she should have taken matters into her own hands and put the house up on the market. Not only has this been going on for 7 years.. but for the first 5 years, my uncle (lives in the house/lived with me but we do not get along and he kicked me out right) had been renting rooms out to people... one of them being a friend of a family-friend, and another being my cousin. He never once split the rent with me, which he should have been putting towards the succession, which he claimed he had been putting the money towards renovations for the house. This was a lie. He did not invest in the house with the rent money at all, and has in fact been reimbursed from the succession for the money invested on renovations as they are intended to help the sale of the house. He has ceased communications since last fall, meanwhile I've spent my entire adult life waiting for this to be over.   Basically, It's looking like this 25-year-old is needing to hire a lawyer under contingency. Has anyone had a similar experience to this that would be able to advise me?  I'm located in Montreal, QC.   Any help is appreciated.	Yes
Ok, so I'm a beneficiary to a generational skipping trust. We have inlaws that are for a lack of better words disruptive as well as aggressive towards some of the blood descendents Whom the trust designates as a beneficiary. I've considered calling hotel security to have them removed from the room as I assume they are not legally entitled to the information in the meeting when they get outta hand. Outside of this, what is the legal option to have them removed from the room entirely? Jokes aside please as I knew most people can't stand their inlaws.	Yes
"My Uncle was recently admitted to the Hospital in Houston and it took the Hospital 3 days to contact us, his family, because he was dropped off by a woman claiming to be his spouse who did not show back up until today wanting to pull the plug. We believe she is an illegel immigrant who has another valid marriage in Mexico, sorry for the lack of details I'm trying this as fast as i can because of the situation at the Hospital at the moment, he is located in Houston Texas and my aunt just made it to the hospital. We don't know who this woman who is apparently his spouse is, but we suspect it's some prostitute who was trying to become a citizen. What rights do we have as his family, can we stop her decision? Will she inherit everything he owns as he has no children?  What can we do as his family, nobody wants to unplug him except for his ""spouse"" who NOBODY know who she is."	Yes
I've already requested my cori and filled out the petition request. The attorney who represented me originally is asking for $1500 to represent me at court for the petition hearings.  State is MA if that matters.	Yes
* The actual house. Worth ~200K, in CA (where I live, my official residence is at the house). What deed makes the most sense for transferring into my name? From what I can tell, Quitclaim deed's are the easiest, but I don't understand the drawbacks to it.  * Does it make more sense to transfer the money into my accounts before their death so it doesn't have to go through any legal stuff?   Tl;Dr When they actually do die, I get everything. What are the processes that have to be gone through, and what do I need to do. I have power of attorney, and I'm the executor.  I don't know what I'm doing with all of this.	Yes
"So a little background my dad is 77, a widow.  He had a heart attack about 18 months ago and now was diagnosed with Parkinsons at the beginning of 2017.    I am his only child, his will is updated since my mom's death so everything goes to me.  He owns the home he lives in free and clear and it's worth about $180,000.  My wife keeps  nagging me to have the ownership of the home transferred from him to me.  Her belief is that if he have to put him in a nursing home at some point, that they will come after the home.  She believes this because her mother has told her this for years and is what they did to ""protect"" their grandparents home.    From my reading, if he was placed in a nursing home his medicare would kick in first, and they he would probably be eligible for medicaid (he doesn't have much money besides teh house).  I would rather not put it in my name, because I would face potential capital gains on the sale of it, whereas if i inherit it and sell it i'm paying nothing.  In the end, we don't want to lose the house.  I would rather pay the capital gains than lose it but i don't believe me wife is correct.  Thanks"	Yes
My grandfather died several months ago and his trust leaves everything to my mom. She understands his wishes after death was to sell the property to my brother and split the proceeds equally amongst the siblings. After pressure from her siblings she agreed to sign an agreement stating that the property would be sold, maybe to my brother, and the proceeds distributed equally. When she got the agreement today a portion states that they will amend the trust to include all of the siblings and a clause that the trust must be sold within 90 days.  From my understanding once someone dies the trust can't be amended at all, is this correct?	Yes
"Hi legaladvice crowd,  I met with an estate planning lawyer recently, and she drafted up a will, power of attorney, etc. that I am currently reviewing.  I am somewhat naive about how all this works, but could you kindly let me know what is ""typical"" or standard practice for Trusts?  -----------------------------------  * For the trust itself, once it is set up, how is money put into it?  Is money transferred from all of our accounts into a single account in the trust?  What about stocks that we own in brokerage accounts?  Our house? Is the executor/trustee required to sell these and have cash, or are they just transferred into an account owned by the trust?  * The Will indicates that all interest earned on the principal within the trust is to be distributed each year to the beneficiaries. Is this normal?  Why would it not just accrue?  Do I want a 10 year old receiving tens of thousands of dollars each year?  For background, my wife and I have one child (a 2 year old).  If we both pass away, the trust would be set up and money distributed in three installments when our daughter reaches certain ages. Estate right now is about $3 million once you take into account life insurance proceeds.  I do plan on asking follow-up questions to our attorney, but wanted to try to make them sound somewhat knowledgeable!  many many thanks, GR"	Yes
"**The Story** My Fiance's dad (let's call him Saul for anonymity) has been living in his father's old house, in upstate NY for the past 30 years or so. This house has fallen into a state of disrepair: caved in ceilings, mold and water damage. Basically it needs to be torn down and a new house needs to be built on the property before the conditions become too dangerous.  **The Problem** Saul and his family are low income, and he hasn't had the cash upfront for repairs over the years. The bank will not issue a loan against the property since he does not have legal ownership. He has told me that for the past 17 years he's been pursuing legal action to gain ownership, but the hired lawyer is making very little progress.  **Tricky Family Situation** The house was left to my Fiance's dad and his siblings in their father's will, but, Saul only has a copy of an un-signed will. Here's where it gets tricky, Saul's mother was never married to his father (who also had two previous marriages, and was never legally divorced from the second wife).  Saul has five siblings, three immediate and two half from previous marriages.  Marriage 1: * Father divorced from wife #1 * Half-Brother #1: Signed off as not wanting property - deceased * Half-Brother #2: Signed off as not wanting property - deceased  Marriage 2:  * Father NEVER divorced from wife #2 - deceased (her family may have claim to property) No children from marriage   Relationship 3:  * Father NEVER married to woman #3 (mother) * Sister #1: Executor of the estate, but has signed off as not wanting property * Sister #2: Signed off as not wanting property * Brother #1: Cut ties with the family and we don't know where he is  **Steps of Legal action taken** * ""Hired"" Lawer #1 to search for missing siblings / other family members to get sign-off. (Saul told me he gave $100 as incentive to get started 17 years ago). This lawyer passed away, and the case was handed off to his partner. * Lawyer #2 has continued the search, was paid $1,500 in 2014. (I'm not sure if this was just incentive or actual fee required to start official work). * A publication search was made to find Brother #1, a judge ruled that we need to publish ads in the paper of his last known location (this search has taken months). * A publication search was recently started for Wife #2. We're trying to figure out if she has any living children.   **Next Steps** I'm meeting with the current lawyer this week and I'm going to ask for a recap of the steps he's taken, what's left to do and if any options exist to accelerate this process.  **My Questions** * Is there anything I can do to speed up this process? Any work-arounds? We are starting to fear for the safety of the family in this house. * Anything specific I should be asking the current lawyer?  * How long does a case like this usually take? Seems to have been dragged out for an unreasonably long time by lawyer. Does any of this seem fishy or illegal?  Thanks for any help!"	Yes
Horribly sad, very young, sweet girl.  What do we do with her final paycheck?  We don't know any of her family, only her BF who she killed herself in front of, and we will definitely not be giving it to him.	Yes
"The sequence of events, over the course of many years, is as follows:  1. My dad's sister married an awful man.  2. My grandma's will leaves money to my dad and his sister.  3. My dad's sister dies.   4. Grandma revises the will to leave my aunt's widower way less than he expected.   5. Grandma dies. (She was in her right mind to the very end, amazingly sharp, more ""with it"" than people half her age.)  6. Aunt's widower is arguing that he's entitled to his dead wife's assets from an older will.  My question is, assuming the recent will is valid...that makes no sense, right?"	Yes
I know that it is illegal to brandish or present a firearm with the intent to intimidate people in all states. I was wondering if this law extends to all weapons or just firearms.	No
My wife and I have rented a condo for the past 9 months. We are on the second floor with 1 downstairs neighbor. The neighbor has made several complaints to the HOA and has called the police prior about noise. She doesn't speak English (polish only) and will not communicate to us what is bothering her.  &amp;nbsp;  My wife and I both work 9-5 jobs. We get up at 7 and both go to bed around 11. HOA rules specify quite time as 10pm-8am. We are not loud people, we do not throw parties or do jumping jacks all day long. We have carpet, no hardwood except for tile in kitchen and bathroom. I've grown tired of this woman and i'm wondering if i have any legal ramifications since she keeps calling the police and sent her granddaughter upstairs to express she was about to call the police again today. The granddaughter did mention this was also a problem with the previous tenant which lived here for 11 years. Any input/help would be appreciated. Thank you.	No
"So I currently live with two other people, one of them, ""Abby"", is pregnant and recently revealed to my other roommate, ""Brianna"", and I that she has decided to stay living there and doesn't want to move out. Obviously Brianna and I do not want to live with a screaming, crying newborn so we decided to get our own two bedroom.  We were able to find something very quickly and want to move asap since Abby is due early September and we are worried about it coming sooner. We are on a month to month lease and both gave our 30 day notice. Ideally we would have liked to move out mid August and get half the last months rent back but landlord said no so we decided to just eat it.  Yesterday the landlord (who is also a lawyer) emailed us the following: ""Please be advised that you both have given your notice but this does not remove you from your obligation to pay rent should the monthly amount not be paid.  You will remain jointly and severally liable for any rent owed until a new lease is signed.""  So he's saying that if Abby doesn't find someone to move in by September first we still owe the rent??? How is that legal? Abby should be the one that has to pay our rent since she couldn't find anyone to move in, right? Please someone help me make sense of this...  We are in Massachusetts btw if that changes anything"	No
I bought a 2014 Ford fusion used about 6 months ago. A few days after having it I found out it has some issue where it goes into the limp home mode if you accelerate too quickly. This means power train service light and airbag light come on and the car refuses to accelerate normally until turned off and back on again. It's sometimes accompanied by a check engine light but not always. I bought it with a third party extended service warranty that covers almost everything and it still has the manufacturers power train warranty.   It was bought used at a non Ford dealership who initially tried to repair it under their warranty for me, but they were unable to diagnose it and they had me take it to a Ford dealership and they would pay for it.   Over the course of about 4 months and 5 visits, they replaced a mass airflow sensor, the battery, and the throttle body. None of that fixed the issue.   I took it to a different Ford dealership but they were unable to fix it under warranty (the third party warranty required it be fixed at the selling dealer if I was within 40 miles of it) and they wouldn't honor the power train warranty. I took it back to the welling dealer who said they couldn't diagnose it and they told me to go to Ford. I took it back to the Ford they sent me to previously and they said it would take them several days to diagnose it and asked me to come back later.   At this point I was in the process of moving across the state, so I moved and found a Ford dealer near me and took it there. They kept it for a week and replaced the accelerator pedal. The check engine light came back on with the same code so I took it back the next day. They turned the code off and test drove it for a while and it didn't come back so they stated it was fixed.   I picked it up again and the original limp home mode issue happened again so in immediate dropped it off again. That was yesterday, and at this point its been at the third ford garage for 2 weeks now. I've been to garages for the same issue about 7 times or so over the last 6 months.   At this point it seems unlikely to me it'll get fixed and this has been an extreme hassle dealing with. Do lemon laws apply to used cars? What are my options here?	No
"TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.  First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.  Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.    The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.  Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays.   Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?"	No
She hasn't seen the kids in days and her husband isn't picking up the calls. She's high and wants to do nothing. People are cussing at her on facebook. Cousin says we can't even call the cops because we're not as close and don't count, cps was already called they don't know where they are. Anything I can do?	No
So I rented at this somewhat shady apartment complex and I decided I will not renewed this year. The lease was a joint lease between me, Roommate A and Roommate B. Roommate A and I decided that we will no longer rent here and we're moving out meanwhile Roommate B decided that he will stay there and bring in new roommates. I decided that I did not want to renew this lease nor be involved with this apartment unit any more so I will not renew the lease and they can decide what to do on their own.  Fast forward a month, I heard nothing and the lease is almost over so I checked with my roommate. They said that they already renewed without me or my other roommate and then 2 new people signed the lease instead of us. The security deposit will not be given back to me but the 2 new tenants will be responsible for paying us back. I understand that the security deposit is probably binded to the the unit therefore if someone is staying in the unit, it remains. But they also told me that 'legally' the new tenants are required to pay us back. Is this true? What if the new tenants do not pay Roommate A and I our deposit back? Was it legal in the first place to have this apartment unit renewed without 2 of the leaseholders? Thanks!	No
So, I slept with a friend of mine a while ago, and she hasn't talked to me since we broke up four months ago after dating for about a month - the day we broke up, she told me that she was pregnant - and long story short, it's starting to look like there's a good chance that I'll be a parent within the year.  I've met with a few family lawyers in the area, and thankfully, it sounds like there's a fairly good chance that I can swing joint legal custody when I'm sued for child support in the next six months to three years, as long as I don't make any major mistakes.  However, the friend that I hooked up with is still incredibly upset, and never wants to see me again - I spent the better part of three months trying to get in contact with her, but, it's no use - every time I try to talk to her, she tells me how foolish I was for leaving her.  That being said, if a joint legal custody agreement is reached, but we assume that she retains primary physical custody, can she arbitrarily move anywhere that she likes without my consent? That is, could she move hundreds of kilometres away to avoid me, and not be worried about things like parental child abduction?  Would my only recourse be to spend tens of thousands of dollars in court to get her to move back, or move closer to her?	No
I own a condo on the second out of three floors. Two weeks ago I notice a water stain forming in my dining room. All of the units are identical, so this was not a sink or dishwasher leak.   Called the HOA's maintenance and he cut a 1 sq ft hole in the ceiling to find complete saturation in the ceiling, crown molding, and wall. Found the source of the leak to be the upstairs owner's fish tank that has been leaking for this two week span. When maintenance went into his unit, the owner's girlfriend (who is also part owner) allowed him inside. When she called her boyfriend about everything, he immediately ordered maintenance to leave.   Turns out, he doesn't have home owner's insurance.   He works for a restoration company and offered to dry everything out and repair the damages. I declined. I called my insurance. The restoration company contracted through my insurance has come and found that an estimated 20 gallons worth of water has leaked from ceiling to floor. The wall has been cut out and is currently drying with machines.   I spoke with him earlier today and let him in to see the hole that has been cut and the damage he has done. He immediately said he is getting himself a lawyer. Do I need to do the same? Or will my insurance company's legal team do all of that?   I'm not sure if there is anything here that I need to be doing, or if I just pay my deductible and let my insurance take the reigns from here.	No
So my town does angled parking spots on some streets. Town ordinance (though it's not actually posted on any signs on the streets) states you have to park head-in in the angled spots.  I was pulling out of a lot onto a 2-way street with angled spots on the right side. Before I did, the person in the angled spot immediately to the right of the lot exit I was using left the spot.   The proximity of the spot to the lot exit was such that, instead of turning right onto the street, reversing, then pulling forward head-first into the spot, it was faster/easier/safer to just pull forward and back right into the spot.  When I got out of lunch, I had 2 tickets. One for $30 for violating the head-in ordinance - that one I understand. Ignorance is no excuse, etc. However, I also had a $54 ticket for a Section 39:4-135 violation. Here's that text:  39:4-135. Parking; direction and side of street; angle parking; one-way street The operator of a vehicle shall not stop, stand or park the vehicle in a roadway other than parallel with the edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the right-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway, except as follows:  a. Upon those streets which have been designated by ordinance and have been marked or signed for angle parking, vehicles shall be parked at the angle to the curb designated and indicated by the ordinance and marks or signs.  b. Upon one-way streets, local authorities may permit parking of vehicles parallel with the left-hand edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the left-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway.  I think that violation is in error. In (a) it states only the angle of parking in reference to angled-parking ordinances. I took photos of my car, it's at the correct angle and between the space markers, it's just backed in.  What do I do here? I doubt it's worth it to fight the head-in violation since that one's pretty cut-and-dry, but the 2nd violation really seems like it's not valid. I've literally had 2 non-parking tickets in my life, one was speeding that I hired a lawyer for when I was like 17, and 1 was driving without an inspection sticker on a car I bought on eBay that same day, so I'm pretty green to this. If I plead not guilty, am I gonna have to go word-against-word with some douche traffic cop? This is also the town I live in, and it's a very quiet town with a ton of bored cops, so I'm worried that making any sort of waves is gonna mark me and my car to every cop in town forever. $54 isn't going to break my bank account or anything, but it really steams me. We literally went out for lunch, and it went from a $50 meal to a $134 meal.	No
A while back I was arrested for public intoxication and possession of marijuana. I have court in the morning and have no idea the outcome. I'm only 18 and have no idea how these things go. Should I plead guilty and just accept the consequences or not guilty so I can try and get an attorney? And if I don't end up with an attorney would they give me one? How does this work?	No
"Alright, folks. I am a single mom who was renting a townhouse apartment in Beaverton, Oregon. Trying to cut costs a bit, I decided to get a roommate. I posted an ad on Craigslist and got a hit from a woman (let's call her Ally) who came over to view the place. She seemed relatively normal, passed a criminal background check, and was able to provide me with recent pay stubs. I agreed to let her move in and told her that she just needed to get her name on the lease within two weeks (per my lease agreement).  A week after moving in, I received a call from Child Protective Services, stating that they were concerned for the safety and well being of my three year old daughter. Obviously, I was super confused, so the caseworker explained that she had been informed by Ally's mom that Ally had moved into an apartment providing childcare in exchange for rent and that Ally has a long history with DHS due to child abuse and neglect charges against her own two children that have been removed from her custody. I immediately explained that a) my daughter comes to work with me everyday (I work at a preschool), b) I had NO idea that Ally had that type of history (Ally has never been arrested for the abuse and neglect, so it didn't show up on a background check), and c) that I was under the impression that Ally had a job and could pay rent that way.  Right after that phone call, I sent a text to Ally telling her that she needed to find a new place to live in the next two weeks. In the meantime, my daughter and I stayed with family. Ally wasn't happy about it, but she agreed. The night before Ally was supposed to be out of the apartment, she sent me a text stating that she had rights and that she wasn't going to be leaving anytime soon. I called the police, but they told me that even though she wasn't on the lease, she had ""established residence"" and that I would have to file for a legal eviction notice with the courts (and pay the hefty filing fees). I called my apartment manager and explained the situation to her as well, but she told me that since I had an ""unauthorized tenant"" living in the apartment, I was going to receive a 72-hour eviction notice, but if I broke my lease ($1600 fee), I could save myself from having an eviction on my record and the complex would handle the eviction process of Ally. So, that's what I did and I terminated my lease on April 1st by handing in my keys and giving a written notice of my intent to terminate the lease.  Meanwhile, after I moved my daughter and I out, Ally moved in her boyfriend (whom she has a no-contact order with due to prior domestic abuse issues), her two dogs, a parrot, and her 3 adult bunnies (who quickly multiplied).  Well, after eviction notices, court appearances, and finally changed locks, Ally and her boyfriend moved out on June 30th... nearly 3 months after I moved out. I am now being footed the bill for those three months of rent (1150/month), the apartment's electricity (even though I turned off the electricity from the electric company), storage fees (due to the things that they left behind when they finally moved out), and an estimated $8000 in damages (upstairs carpeting and downstairs kitchen linoleum has to be completely replaced, due to massive amounts of bunny feces and urine, several doors and walls need to be replaced/repaired due to holes, plumbing repair due to them flushing something down the toilet that busted a pipe, and a new refrigerator, since the door was broken off) because she was not on the lease.  I have spoken briefly with an attorney, but he said that since it was my name and I ""violated the lease agreement"" by moving someone in that wasn't on the lease (even though she was supposed to get on it within the two weeks), I probably don't have much of a chance against the apartment complex. He suggested that I could sue Ally, but she doesn't have any money to speak of (apparently she forged the pay stubs she gave me and hasn't worked in over three years) and I don't want to dig my hole deeper by adding on a bunch of court and attorney costs.  What do I do...???"	No
4 people moved into a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom house. 2 were a couple sharing a master bedroom/bath. The 4th bedroom was to be used as an office for all our our computers. Rent was decided to be split evenly with utilities since two people were staying in the master bedroom we thought it would be fair. $1800/4 = $450 + Utilities each. This was our initial agreement moving into the home together. This topped out the budget of 3 people, but we agreed to move in under these conditions regardless.  About a month into the 1 year lease the couple broke up and one moved out but is still paying rent. The one that moved out didn't want cause any problems so they said they would pay rent but not utilities until we could find a suitable roommate to take over. This put two of them almost at absolute max in terms of budget. Well after 3 months we are not able to find a roommate, definitely not a lack of trying. No one just wants to pay the money for the space offered.  The ex-roommate that moved but that is still paying rent wants to try and figure out a way to reduce cost for themselves. The options the ex-roommate suggested:  1)They offered a solution to increase our rent $50 dollars each a month and they pay $300. This would eliminate the need for a new roommate, but would put the current roommates over budget. 2)Opt out of our lease for $1800 x 3 month rent = $5,400 opt cost  /4 people = $1350 each to get out of the contract early. This doesn't seem like an option for 1/2 the parties involved and the other 1/2 just don't want to burn the money. 3) Get a roommate to completely offset cost. 4) She will just quit making payments and let the housing management / legal take it from there.  None of these options seem great, but at the end of the day the person giving the options was the same person that encouraged us to go top end of our budget. We don't want to increase cost, but we also don't want to get hurt legally.  Can she just simply get out of the lease and leave us with the burden?	No
So we are both early middle age, and overall I see this as great news since I can afford it, and probably wont have kids another way.  She has a lot of family help available and both of us have family roots keeping us in the area.  We want to coparent.  Mostly, my question is: am I foregoing any rights by not  lawyering up at the moment?  So far, it has been amicable and I would like to keep it that way.  What should I consider in terms of legal options?	No
I am a victim of armed robbery that happened few weeks ago and tried my best to provide all the information that I could recall (their height, accent, color of the vehicle). Unfortunately, there is no physical evidence except the cameras on highway since it was very late and those as*ho**s covered their face with a scarf.  Borough detectives called me yesterday and they said they were able to find the vehicle and its owner that match with the descriptions that I gave. They said the vehicle's owner was once arrested for attempted burglary and the vehicle was actually following us. However, they told me that arresting the suspects and bringing them to the county jail/borough police station would be difficult tasks since they do not have an enough physical evidence. Isn't it possible to investigate the possible culprits if the detectives are confident enough? I am afraid that they will end up not getting arrested since I am pretty confident that the culprits ended up discarding all the evidences (wallets and a backpack) so that they can find a loophole to be exonerated, if they get caught.	No
Within the past month (sometime between July 7th and now), the cost of housing in my dorm listed on the ASU website was increased by $69 a semester. The amount listed, before and after the change, was explicitly listed as the cost for the 2017-2018 school year. This change in price was well after a late cancellation fee of $500 was in effect (the fee slowly ramped up, reaching the full $500 on June 20th).  At the end of the previous school year, to sign up for housing, we had to agree to [this](https://housing.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2017-2018_license_agreement_-_ftf-ret-upp.pdf) housing agreement. Part of this agreement does say  &gt; The Arizona Board of Regents, ASU, and/or designated facility management companies reserve the right to change room rates and other charges and fees if circumstances require adjustments.  Is it legal for ASU to change the amount they charge for housing after a cancellation fee is in effect?	No
I am planning on signing a lease agreement in NYC with two other roommates but the landlord will only allow two of us to sign/have our names on the lease agreement. Is there some sort of legal contract that can be made to share the liability that comes with signing a rental agreement with the 3rd roommate or will it not be valid unless the contract is also signed by the landlord?	No
Hello,  My wife and I are looking to buy a house to use as a short term rental property in Rochester MN. Is anyone familiar with Minnesota laws as far as injury due to accidents of a guest? From what I understand this doesn't fall under homeowners insurance.  We would be advertising locally, on Airbnb, VRBO, and Homeaway. Does it make sense to start an LLC or does this change the tax status of the property? Sorry if none of this is very focused, I am trying to find a good resource to learn how to do this. If anyone on here happens to know a real estate attorney in Rochester they would recommend, we would appreciate it!   All the best	No
We were hoping to ask anyone with good knowledge on US immigration law on how we should proceed as a couple? I [20F] was born in the USA [MO] and have a passport, birth certificate and a SSN but moved when I was just a baby. I do not have family in the USA and don't have established residency in any state.   My partner [23M] was born in the UK and we now want to eventually move to the USA. However, I feel like I'm currently too young to get married and will probably be aiming to get married in 2-4 years.  I will be moving home to Hong Kong this year whilst he will be staying in the UK to finish the final year in his degree.    1) My partner wants to know how he can live and work in the USA legally without a marriage green card/visa. We are looking into him getting a masters in the USA as we know some masters courses allow their graduates to stay in the country to find work for the next 3 years but we know that chances of scholarships are slim.    2) I have read about how it is easier to get the marriage green card if he was already in the states at the time. Would him not being in the USA when applying for the green card/visa be a detriment?   3) Is it possible to get a marriage visa/green card if we got married outside of the USA and **both** parties are not present in the USA at the time of the application and will this affect his ability to enter the country?    4) My partner also wants to know if it's possible for him to eventually get a dual citizenship between UK/USA?   We have several other options ranging from him getting a masters in the USA, getting a masters in Hong Kong where grants and scholarships are much easier to get (and he can live with me), or him working in the UK for a few years whilst we get our act together. We are just very confused as to how the whole process of immigration works and the requirements for it.   TLDR - Boy and girl want to move to America to live the American dream. Girl is American by birth but doesn't live there and boy is from UK. How this work?	No
So we moved into a new apartment this spring and been having troubles with the fuse box. We are using normal house appliances, and the fuse will consistently blow, we asked the landlord to fix the problem, but they won't. We are not using anything out of the ordinary when these fuses blow. They have the kitchen, living room, and kitchen, all on one 15 fuse.	No
Hello! College teen here about to move into my first apartment. This is a student apartment, and I want to be aware of my rights as a renter. This is the part of the lease that bugs me:  If you are in violation of this Lease, we can, without demand or notice (other than as provided in this paragraph or as otherwise required by applicable law) in addition to other remedies allowed and to the extent permitted by applicable law, do any or all of the following: a. Collect any fine imposed by the Rules and Regulations; b. Bring a legal action against you to collect past due Rent and any other damages we have incurred because of your violating the Lease; c. Terminate your right to occupy the Premises, institute an action for eviction, without terminating the Lease or your monetary obligations for the Premises by giving you written notice providing 24 hours for you to vacate the Premises; d. Bring a legal action against you to collect all unpaid Rent and other sums which would become due until the Ending Date of the Lease or until another person takes occupancy (and then, we can still recover from you the difference between the Rent you were required to pay and the Rent actually paid by the new resident, together with any expense we incur to relet the Premises); e. Terminate the Lease and your right to occupy the Premises and institute an action for eviction, by giving you written notice and providing the legal time frame for you to leave;  f. Report all violations to credit reporting agencies; g. Report all violations to criminal/judicial authorities. The exercise of any remedy by us shall not be deemed to exclude or waive our right to exercise against you any other right or remedy which we might have.  After we give you notice to leave the Premises or if we file an eviction suit, even it we accept Rent or other sums due, such acceptance does not waive or diminish our continuing rights of eviction or any other contractual or statutory right unless we specifically agree to it in writing. In the event we bring an action against you because of your violation of this Lease, we can recover all costs or fees involved, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, as part of any judgment.   What it seems like to me is that they're trying to circumvent my right to remedy my lease violation by saying that they can request I leave the premises without terminating the lease. Is this legal?  Thanks!	No
Hi Reddit,  Moving out question about my fridge and annoying roommate. So I am moving out of my 3 bdrm apartment in Indiana when lease ends, July 31 and have utilities set to disconnect then. I and one roomate are moving out, but the third roomate renewed lease and found two new roomates.  She is in a different country for the month, and I believe has not set up utilities after I have told her she needs an account. I emailed management, and they told me she does need an energy account to start Aug 1.  I am worried about leaving the fridge plugged in for a month, which management has told me to do. No one will move into the apartment until August 20, though the lease starts Aug 1. She has a ton of food in there which will spoil if she does not have electricity. I do not want to get charged for damage/rot if she does not set up electricity...I would rather just chuck her food but I'm not sure if I will get in trouble.  I feel it is not my responsibility to make sure she sets up an account.  What should I legally do ?  TL;DR unsure about leaving fridge plugged in when roomate not setting up utilities	No
We purchased a home 2 years ago for $400k.  Last week, we were offered $1.5 million for the land from a commercial developer.  I think we should sale for future financial security. My wife and I have been on edge arguing for the past week. She says she will not sign any papers because this house is sentimental as our first home and she doesn't feel like she's been here long enough yet. A completely irrational view in my mind. Can I legally force a sale of the house if she refuses?	No
She came home from Banff Pregnant, Had a Daughter named “M”  Soon after Fell in love with a man we will call “Bob” whom took to M as his own. Moved them both into his home. He had a problem drinking and about a year in got in an accident causing bodily harm. He had also impregnated my sister with “L” They tried to avoid jail by going into detox voluntarily but come the court date 6 months later, Bob got 6 months in jail. My Family was at their home keeping it up while he was away. No Help for his side of the family. Both sides of the family supported him with zero ridicule. He has been sober for 6 years and my sister was his rock.  L was born, my parents again were there to help, no sign of Bob's family. Two years ago they had twin boys. This is where I believe postpartum depression poked its ugly head. M is 8, L is 5. Again not to repeat myself but my family is now there everyday helping, while Bob’s family doing as little as possible.  This is where the story gets dark. My Sister tried to killer herself with pills. She’s taken to the hospital,they run tests ect. Immediately admitted to the Mental Wing. Now the Children's Aid Society is involved.  I’m not living in the same province, I fly home to visit her in the hospital where she will reside for 2 weeks. If you’ve ever been in a Mental Wing one thing stood out she did not belong here. While she was in hospital Bob family all of the sudden had to help with the kids. She was no tint here for a week and Bob’s Aunt had papers for my sister to sign basically giving up custody of her children, thank goodness my parents were there to read the documents first. And they were not signed. Next the Van Bob’s mom Co-signed for needs some repairs that are to be covered by insurance but tell my sister that the only way to get it fixed is to sign over the van to Bobs mom. (Bob can not drive until 2020). This is obviously wrong she ended up just signing a different piece of paper from the insurance company saying they can pay for repairs. Keep in mind this was while she was in the hospital.  My sister finally gets out of the hospital, can not live at home because of the Children Aid Society rules she must have an additional adult present for visiting her children. These restrictions are to be lifted soon and she can move back home with her children, she is currently living with my parents.  But wait there's more since she has been living away from the children, Bobs family has had to step up and help alot more than ever. Is going to get a whole lot more bizarre so here goes. Bobs mom has taken the keys to the van and will not give them back forcing my parents to take two vehicles to pick up the kids because Bob will not let them in the house. They have packed up all my sisters things and put them on the porch one night, i advised them they can not move out of the marital home and to leave the boxes there. They have recently changed the locks to the Marital home leaving my sister without a key. Bob has also asked for a separation. All of this sounds bizarre but it's real, Bob’s family has completely turned against my sister when she needs the help and support the most.It all feels like set up now. They are dictating when she can see her kids &amp; implementing their own rules that accommodate themselves and no one else.  Financially they are not in a good place, They do get the tax benefit from having kids which pays for the van &amp; the rest she sends to Bob to pay for the marital home.  My questions are, can she move back home when the Children's Aid Society has removed their restrictions? What happens if she does not? Is this entrapment?  Can they legally do any of this? What’s the fastest way to get legal aid? We don’t know what her rites are  I'm not a real good story teller, please take it easy.	No
I want to make a clothing company that my get me into legal trouble and was wondering if I could be sued or if I'm fine. For example the company supreme has a plain white shirt that says supreme within a box, would I get in legal trouble if I made a similar shirt that said sub-par? The reason I think I will get in trouble is because The North Face company sued a company called the South Butt and switch their sign. So I just want to know if they would be able to sued?	No
Hi, thanks for taking the time to open this up.  We're looking to rent in London and had an offer accepted for a house, the agent then asked us to transfer the holding deposit via email. We transferred £700 now the agent says the landlord is considering other offers. Do we have any legal recourse? Are holding deposits binding for both parties?  Thanks again.	No
[California] Hypothetically, if a girl was visiting California from a country in Central Europe, and one were to get her pregnant, what are the ramifications?  Some other useful info:  * She's on some sort of 6'ish month visa with 3 months to go. * Claimed to be on birth control * Has a strong desire to remain in the US  Is child support required? Does the child get dual citizenship? Suppose the guy does not want to get married...what are his obligations?  This is all hypothetical.	No

I'm trying to enroll my child in kindergarten. I attended pre-reg in April and provided my lease and copy of utilities. All utilities are in my name. On lease my name is listed under occupants, but my step mother is the primary lease holder. (She signed for me 2 years ago when I first got back to the US because of the employment gap.)    Received letter stating that I am required to appear with the primary lease holder in person on a specific date/hours next week for her to sign an affidavit saying I live there. Apparently this is a new county wide requirement put in place specifically to [irrelevant opinion.] She cannot be here for it. She can't leave work and she lives out of state. They said she can't have it signed and notarized not in person. (She has never lived in the apartment and signed online. Basically my guarantor or whatever.)  I called the school board and they said a wordier version of too bad and that she has to come. Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated. I'm assuming I have to miss work and show up alone, but do I have any leg to stand on to get her enrolled?  Don't they have to enroll even homeless kids?	No
Got a memo stating the following:  This memo is to inform you that the soft story retrofit project for the building is going to start on Sept 1st, 2017. It will take approximately three months to finish. The garage will not be accessible during retrofit construction. No parking &amp; no laundry machines will be available for approximately 3 months.  The parking is part of my lease. It doesn't really state if there is any compensation being offered. Is there any I should expect?	No

"Hello,    We just received a certified letter from our rental company stating that our payment was ""dishonored by [my] financial institution."" They are now demanding an additional ~$150 in fees. When we called the number on the letter, we were prompted to leave a voicemail. I left my details along with the confirmation number we had received with the payment confirmation email. We then contacted the customer service for the rental company and the rep stated that it had been denied for ""insufficient funds"" while the website states it was denied for ""closed account.""     1) I have $800 in privilege pay, so if I hadn't had the funds (I did), my checking account would have gone negative to pay the rent.    2) The website deleted our saved account information so I cannot even verify the account number I used to make the transaction. All I have is the last 4 of my account number per the confirmation email, which I verified is correct.    3) The letter demands these fees be paid within 12 days or we will be taken to court. While we can pay these fees, this is not our error as we had the confirmation email stating the payment was made.     4) My checking account does NOT reflect that any attempt to retrieve the funds was made, however. I called to confirm this and the rental company didn't pull out any money. The funds are still sitting there.      5) No one called us to state there was an issue with the payment. We assumed all was well as we had the confirmation email and figured it would take the typical 3-4 business days. I reasoned that with the holiday last week, things would be delayed a bit.    6) We used my checking account for the first time instead of my fiancé's (his has never had any issue before). This is the only difference, but it still made us input the account number twice and routing number once when we entered the information initially.       Questions I have: Are we responsible for these fees? Does it seems suspicious to anyone else that both of our saved bank accounts were deleted from the system so we cannot even confirm the account number from which funds were supposed to be drawn out from? We have not been able to get in contact with the woman who issued the letter (from the collections department), and the customer service line was of no help."	No

Hi everyone,   Me and other tenants digitally signed a lease at the owner's insistence while we were out of state.  He never provided a copy of it with his signature. We need a copy as we are currently seeking a lawyer to help us with understanding if he is in breach of contract regarding something else, but we need the fully executable lease for the lawyer's help.   Questions: Is the landlord required to provide tenants with a copy of the lease with landlord's signature?  If the landlord is refusing to provide, what options do we as tenants have?Would a lawyer actually help us to receive a copy?  Thanks. Have learned a lot from all the mistakes we made during this current lease term.	No
If a couple is married, can one person file bankruptcy on their own? I'm married but have past premarital debt. My spouse doesn't have debt or bad credit. Would it be possible for me to file bankruptcy on my debt that occurred before our marriage without him having to file with me or be effected in any way? He has a security clearance to think of and his job depends on having good credit to keep his clearance. I need to protect my husband from my debt. I have a disabled child whom l stay home and care for, so me working to pay off the massive amount of medical bills and hospital stays my childs disability racked up with me being a single mom before I got remarried and got health insurance is impossible. My credit is shot. I'd really like to start new if could. My ex-husband doesnt contribute a dime for our son and never has. I've had hell trying to get the court to enforce support beyond the order, so all the bills are on me and hurt my credit. I can't afford to take the ex back to court again, not that he'd get a job and contribute anyway. What can I do?	No
"So an interesting thing happened today. There have been rumors for a while about a potential list of employees who will be laid off. Someone in the office noticed in the printer queue from our HR manager (This printer is a public printer and used for most of the office) Seperate documents in the queue with titles that would say ""termination notice - employee name.""  Things got out of hand really quickly and the entire office knew by the end of the day. HR probably scared for their own job quicky called a meeting explaining who was the person who originally saw the Printer Queue as they will be fired immediately and if no one comes forward they will start making assumptions on who that person is.  I would like to know who is in the wrong here and do they have any legal standing"	No
tl:dr Builder of my house refuses to take responsibility for wet basement and blames the earth itself as the problem.  I don’t know if there’s any way to recoup some of the money I’ll have to spend to fix problems.  A year ago, my house burned down.  The house was demolished completely, including the foundation.  With the insurance money I contracted with a modular home company to rebuild.  The new house, like the old, is a ranch with a walk-out basement (basement partly underground on two sides of the house).  The old house was a modular and similar to the new one, except the old one was very well built and had a dry basement.  It’s been very difficult dealing with the modular company. They have done a lot of careless work, with wavy siding, holes in walls, sloppy foundation work, etc.  For example more than half of the windows in the house are a different type than I asked for in the sales and planning meetings. This means the windows don’t all match.  They have refused to correct this.  All in all, the building process has been a slow motion nightmare.  People say modulars are built quickly, but this one is nearly three months over the scheduled time.  When problems with the new house started to show up and I wanted more information, the building company started acting shady. Who’s the CEO and who’s the president of the company?  No one will provide names.  Who was the subcontractor who built the foundation and basement?  They refuse to say.  This is not the behavior of a responsible company.  Shortly before I was to move in, I discovered that the basement gets damp on the floor and walls every time it rains. They just denied there was any moisture at all as I stared at the obvious stains.  Then they said, okay, there was moisture, but every basement was damp and I should get a dehumidifier or fan and that would fix the problem. However, the dampness only showed up on areas where the foundation drains would be. The walls and air in the basement were otherwise dry.    I had to hire a lawyer and an engineer just to get them to admit the basement leaking was an issue that needed to be addressed My engineer discovered that the footer drain was not connected properly and this was fixed but the basement still gets damp in the same locations after every rain.  I had to pay more than a month’s extra rent because  I couldn’t move in as well, but since I was told that correcting poor foundation drainage would be expensive, I was advised not to pay the final payment unless they corrected this.   The builder finally agreed to excavate near the foundation to check the foundation drains.  The engineers (mine and the company’s) agreed that the drains were okay, but that the builders had put clay soil instead of gravel against the foundation and that this was probably the source of the problem. Since both engineers agreed, I figured the builder would now correct this, but instead, the builder is saying that since the drains are otherwise fine, it’s my problem and I should pay for the correction. They act like the soil on the site was some unforeseeable accident they could not be expected to know about.  No one who contracts for a house to be built wants a damp basement, and no home buyer wants one, either, but they’re acting like a dry basement is some frill that I frivolously want.  I’m having to pay for this foundation twice now, once from the builder and now to correct the builder’s careless work, and they are acting like they have no responsibility in the matter.   Just to add a cherry on top of this shit sundae, I have PTSD because of the loss of the love of my life in the house fire, so I don’t really want to live in the new house.  I was planning to stay a short time while I decided where to move, and then sell it because I can’t afford to continue to rent.  I thought I could do this but now I have flashbacks when I visit the house and I cry all the damned time.  This does not really make me as articulate as I need to be when negotiating with the builder.   The amount I will have to pay to fix this is a lot of money for me and  my losses are now way over the small claims limit in my state yet the amount is not enough to interest a lawyer to sue on contingency.  I have to pay to correct the foundation and drainage issues because otherwise I will neither be able to live in the house or sell it  but I’m wondering if there's any way to  get the modular company to live up to their obligations and to get some of the extra money I had to spend back.  If I stay in the rental I lose money, and if I pay out of pocket to fix the builder’s mistake I lose money.  Do I have any practical options here?  If this is not the best sub to ask this, please suggest the right one.  Advance thanks for any useful advice.   I'm in NY.	No
"There are actually two different things related to the same situation that I could use some advice on. First some backstory. I'm sorry that it might be a long read but I think all the information is necessary to get a full scope of the situation. I am a woman and have been in a relationship for the past 6.5 years with another woman, we will called her Kaley, and she had a 2 year old daughter when we met who I've been co-parenting, and have been considered her other mom. We have lived together for the entire time, and in the apartment we are currently living in for the past 4-5 years. Her name is the only name on the lease. My mother lives with us because she is sick and on oxygen and can't live alone. Well, about a month ago my girlfriend comes to me saying that she has this friend, who we will call Jamie, who is involved in an abusive relationship and who is planning on leaving her boyfriend. She really needs a place to stay or she will be homeless. I feel for this girl and agree that she can stay with us until she finds other arrangements. Well, from the very start the situation was weird. My girlfriend and this girl spent every second together, and would leave together to go out with Jamie's friends all the time, sometimes even over night. When they were home they would spend most of the time in the basement supposedly smoking/hanging out. During this time I, and not to mention our daughter, might as well have been invisible to these girls. The excuse was that Jamie was depressed over the situation and needed support etc. Well, my and kaleys relationship had been a little rocky to begin with and I suspected that something was going on with them. My suspicions were confirmed when I found some comments online of Kaley referring to Jamie as her girlfriend. I confronted Kaley and she claimed that they were just joking around, and that they were not together, but did tell me that she wanted to break up. Okay. Wow, you know. It wasn't decided immediately who would move out. She was adamant that she still considered me to be her best friend and still our daughters other parent. Well, literal days later, on the fourth of July, we went swimming at the park and stayed for the fireworks. They were all over each other.  Now they were openly in a relationship. Needless to say this whole thing was very upsetting but I tried to keep my cool throughout every thing. Mainly for the sake of our daughter. I mean, if you were to ask my friends, I was being a saint when they said they would have flipped. Tbh, I think my friends thought I was being walked all over. What it really was was that I knew that I really didn't have any legal rights to my daughter, and I could not afford to piss Kaley off. Not only was I scared of losing my daughter, but I was also very worried for her. Kaley has some very serious diagnosed mental problems, and she has been very neglectful. There were years where kaley barely even spoke to our daughter. I am the one who mainly takes care of her and really the only one who plays with her, talks to her etc. I had a parenting agreement written up, and had her sign it and we took it to get notarized. I would like to do second parent adoption but I can't really afford that right now. It was decided that they would be the ones to move. They could afford it better than I, because supposedly Jamies grandparents were willing to pay the costs of moving. Well, this whole time I have been telling Kaley that we really need to sit our daughter down and explain this whole situation to her. She would always tell me that we will just not right now. I mentioned it almost on a daily basis. It occurred to me that they may have already told her all about it without involving me and thats why she keeps putting the talk off. This was confirmed when my friend and neighbor asked Jamie about the place they are getting and whether our daughter knew they would all be moving. She said yes. I was livid. I confronted Kaley and she got pissed and ended up telling me she was kicking me out and I had six days to leave. (Two days down, four to go.) That same day I texted my landlord, and told him that I wanted to add my name to the lease, which he said was fine. He has told me in the past that my mom and I both could add our names to the lease. He hasn't had a chance to come by yet, but I am hoping it's today. This may seem underhanded, but the thing is, my mom and I have been paying for the majority of the expenses for the apartment. Once my name is on the lease, I will tell her that now we can mutually come to a decision on who will be moving. A friend told me that they cannot kick us out in six days even if her name is the one on the lease. Because I have lived here so long that I have established residence. They would have to take me to court and evict me. Is this true? What should I do if my landlord does not end up coming before the six days is up?  The second thing happened two days ago. Kaley has always been very irresponsible with money, she is currently broke and has asked my mom for money to buy cigarettes etc. At this point my mom is understandably not willing to give her money, especially not for her and her new girlfriend to have cigarettes. This pisses kaley off because she goes on about how she has been letting us live here blah blah and we are all still family (even though she has not been acting like it) Well, the other night she asked my mom for some money again, which I'm pretty sure was to buy weed, but anyway she refused and kaley again got pissed and went off. The next day I took my mom's tablet, which she had been using back. She said wait I need to clear and I said that I knew how to do that. I opened the screen and a Facebook messenger conversation was on the screen. It was logged into Jamie's account. The conversation was with some person telling them that she was pissed because I hit kaley. What? She was saying that on the night she asked my mom for money afterwards, I hit her in the face. She was telling this to multiple people and even made a Facebook post about it. I immediately confronted them both together. I said, ""Kaley, did you tell Jamie that I hit you?"" She says that she didn't. But, obviously she did, that or Jamie made the whole thing up. But, I really wouldn't put it past Kaley to do this. I don't know if she's trying to get sympathy, trying to make Jamie hate me, make it appear that i was abusive so that she has an excuse to do all this to me, or just is a result of her many mental issues. I don't know. All I know is, that not only have I never laid a finger on this girl, but I have never even been in a fight before in my life. Sometimes I feel like I'm in the twilight zone honestly. They can't just spread around online that I assaulted her, can they? Isn't that a crime? To falsely accuse some one of a crime?  I'm so sorry for the long post. I would appreciate any and all advice."	No
I am a resident of Virginia and am being harassed by my abusive ex who lives in Indiana. When our relationship ended four years ago, I was granted a no contact order and a temporary restraining order; I left the state shortly after and thought that was the end of it. He has recently begun harassing me again via phone calls and texts from various numbers. I have changed my number twice and he managed to get the new number both times. Is there any legal recourse from a different state?	No
I have 50/50 legal and physical shared custody with my ex-wife. We get along fine and co-parent fine.  When we divorced, she worked part time most of our 8 year marriage, even though she has a Bachelors degree and I do not. I was the bread winner. Her income was imputed at minimum wage (although for a brief period she worked full time and made more annually than me). So, I pay her child support every month.  This isn't a huge deal, and I didn't mind, even though it was a financial burden.  Since divorcing, she began a Masters Degree program. She has also re-married.  I understand that the re-marriage has no effect on my child support payment. They're our kids, not the new spouse's responsibility.  However, she has now finished her Masters Degree, and is still working part time. She has acquired several new piercings. She has acquired a new half sleeve (half her arm) tattoo that has grown over what must be several sessions. And she is about to have breast implant surgery.  So, her education has increase, though her income and work hours have not, and she is getting a lot of voluntary and aesthetic work done on her body.  I'm not judging, and I don't care, she's allowed to do whatever she'd like....  But, I'm struggling financially to maintain my home for my children, bills, etc. AND pay a not insignificant amount to her each month.  Would any of this be grounds for CS adjustment in Oklahoma?	No
Hi guys, so here is the scenario. I took my car to get a free code scan to an autoshop (Goodyear). They gave a sheet with the codes and gave me the car keys back. When I went to my car, I found the car smashed in. I went inside and asked them what happened. The manager and the employee who drove my car denied the car crash. They said they didn't do anything and it was there already. I called the cops and then the manager made a claim through their company corporate. The manager told me that the company doesn't have its own insurance but it has a third party insurance. The manager told me that the car will be inspected and an estimate of the damage will be calculated. Afterwards the company will either have a body shop fix it or pay the amount for the damage depending who is seen to be at fault. He said that their insurance will be contacting my car insurance. He only said that my car's front bumper is damaged, when in fact i disagreed. The car's bumper is dented in; the grill came off; a part of the undercarriage frame is bent; car takes longer to crank up now. UPDATE: Goodyear's insurance denied the car crash and they denied the claim that was requested by the manager. The Goodyear insurance person said that the damage was not caused by the employees but it might have been one of their customers since they claim to have a footage from a nearby store. Here are the problems that I have with this: 1. This cannot go through my insurance, there are way too many claims (all no fault) on there already. I won't be able to afford a further increase for the car insurance. What can I do if they refuse to reimburse me from their insurance company? Would the next step be to go to small claims court?  2. If I take it to small claims court, how does the process work? and how would i get the amount for the damage the manager said there is and also the damage he said there is not?   3. Should I use these estimates as proof to claim there is more damage than the company agree to?   4. This is what i prefer: I want the company to pay for the damage and I want to fix it myself. Is this possible? What do I do to get them to pay me instead of fixing it through their body shop?  5. What should i do if they claim it through my insurance company? I don't want this  I know this is a long post, I am frustrated and confused. I don't know where to start, please give any information you think is helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read my whole post.	No
I have an apartment in south west Wisconsin. I've lived here for 5 years and been a very responsible tenant. I have two other roommates.   So our faucet would leak when used, but it was a small drip and we didn't notice it for a long time. The result of the leak was mold in the cabinet space below. That section will need to be replaced. I reported the leak and concern for mold. They fixed the leak and sprayed the mold with an assurance that it was taken care of, but the cabinets have not been replaced.   I'm about to move out next month and I'm concerned that they have put off the replacement until after we move out and charged me for the damages and I don't have renters insurance.   Is there anything I can do to get some assurance that I won't be effected by these damages?	No
My boyfriend of two years we have been living together for over a year has evicted me. 90% of my income goes to the household and bills. He is stating I have no vested interest and no rights to the property we had together that he forced me to remember my name or he would sell it? I am located in Michigan 	No
I'm in NY and preparing for a divorce and have a quick question, since I haven't been to a lawyer yet and am trying to anticipate things in advance in order to make a rough plan.  We own a house but have only about $8000 in equity. We've decided the best option is for me to keep the house. I am assuming this means he will just owe me $8000 less (since I will be receiving half of his retirement funds, etc.) but he seems to think that the court will order half the cost of the entire house deducted from what he is supposed to pay me. (So, including all the money that we still owe the bank.) That doesn't seem right to me, I'm just curious if anybody could help me out with what to expect.	No
"I am eighteen years old, in Oregon USA. moving out of an abusive household, I leave Thursday but mom, has my social security card, my passport, my birth certificate. All things I need. I understand I could duplicate them but that is difficult as you'd need verification from an adult that I exist with their documents (correct me if I'm wrong please) and think it'd be easier. (Especially for the expensive passport that my dad paid for three years ago if that matters at all) Anyway, I know she is not going to give them to me when I ask for them when I leave. Is there any legal matter in this? I need things now for learners permits and trying to acquire things to get on with the ""adult"" (haha 18) aspect of my life. Can't get a bank account without some form of I.d and fafsa is coming soon for college. Can't get I.d card without birth certificate or social security number. I don't have much money and so requesting would be a long process and I cannot go that way as I need to desperately get these things done in a matter of weeks. Can she really withhold all those things from me even if their not technically hers? I understand birth certificate and ss card was given to her in her possession but at some point it's for me right? My parents are not married either and he purchased the passport. Does that play into me getting that back? It's good for two more years and useful as form of identification."	No
My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	No
Im Located in Florida, USA. Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old.   My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.   I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.    My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.   This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.   I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!     tl/dr: ex wife keeps winning custody battle even though she knowingly is filling false accusations	No
"CA/Alameda county/Bay Area So long story short, I am posting for my brother. He is getting a divorce and she won't leave until he signs a paper saying he kicked her out with is untrue. A little backstory: they got together when she was in high school and then had a baby so never finished high school until some time later. fast forwarding, they got married and had kid number 2. They have been living together for quite some time but obviously unhappy. I mean I'm not rude or anything but she's a 2 and he's like a 7 at least right so how they got together is still a big question.....anyways the point is she's stuck in her high school mentality or something, never grew up. When they got together she became a ""housewife"" because she has no job and doesn't do anything with her life. She sits at her house watching netflix all day/facebooking all day. Her kids are usually dirty, her house is always a mess. Literally her dishes would be piled in her sink and she would leave them there for weeks! The house would smell like sewer because if the rotten food on the stove! Half of her food in the fridge was always decomposing!The kids clothes are small and not to mention the kids clothes smell rotten because she washes them and then dries them days later. Im pretty sure they shower every other week too! Now my brother works graveyard shifts all the time. He comes home and wants a hot meal and a clean home and clean kids! but no. So of course he would be unhappy! mind you she can go to the store anytime she wants she has a joint debit card with him. Theres so much to this story but i guess thats the basics. Now. I wanna know what can he do incase she tries him in court. I mean he brings in all the money, he provides for them and she's a stay at home mom. never had a job before and doesn't even clean or do anything at home. She wants to get full custody of the children. She wants him to sign a paper saying my brother kicked her out so she can pull it up in court. He told her if she wants to leave the door is open, but he will not continue to pay her phone, bills, buy her stuff , etc. I think she's crazy and honestly i don't know how they have lasted years of marriage, its been around 10 years. OH! and they have a new house together and of course the house is not paid off yet so its legally not theirs yet but i also am curious about the home. Someone please tell me what could happen and whats the best way to go and etc. Thanks!!"	No
My mother is 64 years old. She's a retired church secretary. My father is still working, making good money, and has a large sum in retirement. He just revealed today that he has been having an affair for 14 years, and is leaving my mother. My main concern is that she is taken care of. What should I advise her to do?	No
"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	No
I haven't seen my twin daughters in over a month. She told me she was moving with them to SC but never specified when, I didn't find out until I asked to see them yesterday because she has me blocked on social media.  It really caught me off guard and I was wondering if calling the police would do anything? Can she be arrested for taking them without my permission? Is what she did illegal at all? I know I'm definitely the father but I'm not on the birth certificate because I wasn't there at the birth and didn't even know they were born until hours later. Any advice would be great.	No
It seems that adult life has been set up in a way that makes things kind of complicated if you're trying to make financial decisions with someone who you are not married with. Some of the benefits of marriage include:  - Your spouse can make your medical decisions hassle free - If you're married your spouse can get health insurance through your job and you get the family rate if it's offered - Family leave is an option when you're married - Making big purchases is simpler  There seems to be so many benefits but I have no interest in getting married. Are there legal ways to get some of these benefits without getting married?   Location: Fl, US  Thanks reddit.	No
"A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him.   I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers.   The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on.   Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon.   A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design.   Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success.   We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.   We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either).   Would love some advice! Thank you in advance."	No
I live in NYS.  My car was stolen while I was at work an involved in an accident before I could report it stolen. The their hit another car and fled on foot.   My question is, am I liable even though I wasn't driving? The insurance company is telling me that I'd have to prove that I didn't give my keys to someone. It's a keyless ignition car, so there was no physical evidence of theft when we recovered it (there wouldn't be, they essentially hacked a computer).  But this doesn't sound right to me, if I'm the defendant in a civil suit, can't I use he negative defense of superseding cause, since I wasn't driving the car? How can you prove a negative? (That I didn't give my keys to someone)  Thanks for taking the time to read and respond!	No
I will contact lawyers, but wondering if anyone here has a general idea of how to proceed? She left me without any warning or explanation, and I want to file for divorce. We have a shared checking acct with only a small amount of money, but I have mutual funds/retirement savings in my own name (that I had before we got married, but they've accumulated a lot of wealth in the years we've been together). Will she be entitled to money from my retirement account in settling this?  Any idea of how to serve her papers in another country? I have no idea how the divorce process works. Does she need to be there in person?  Thanks.	No
I've been in my apartment for 2.5 years and have been a very good resident with no prior issues. Due to an accident (I'd rather not get specific but it was my fault and also injured me) I put a 5 inch hole right through a bedroom door. The door is cheap and hollow. My question is can I get evicted for this? I have been upset and fearful over it and ashamed to write into maintenance. Does this come out of my security deposit or do I have to pay more money for the door next time rent is due? I am in Arizona. I don't see this in my lease contract, only a small phrase about evictions for severe damage to property that endangers others (like driving into the building lol)  Thank you.	No
Hello, curious about IP in the US and have a few questions. Whenever you visit a convention (Comiccon etc) there are always a ton of artists selling fan-art.   What's the legality behind that? Is it just a matter of companies not going after small time artists and hoping they don't notice you? Is there a difference between selling a drawing of a companies character in their original costume vs designing a costume with that character in it? Does it matter?  What about accepting commissions to draw a companies IP?  With those out of the way - I plan on selling original artwork of my own design at conventions starting next year. What can I do to protect myself? How would you go about income tax (Specifically MO/KS tax laws regarding artwork sold)or licensing original content? If someone stole artwork from me what would be my best course of action?  Thanks for your help!	No
A few years back, our neighbor set up a new floodlight to go along with his new enormous barn. The floodlight is probably a bajillion terrawatts, and is having a seriously negative impact on my family's sleep. The light is there for security - an entirely fair reason, especially considering the value of the equipment he stores in his garage (he's a contractor). But it doesn't just illuminate the barn and their driveway, it comes straight across, horizontally, into every window on that side of my house.  When the light first went up, we asked him to do something about it. He was entirely dismissive, and didn't do anything. We didn't take it any further, but now that I'm home for the summer, the light makes it very difficult for me to sleep. Even with the curtains drawn, it lights up my bedroom and disturbs my sleep.  I do plan to get in touch with them again and try asking nicely once more, but I'd like to be confident that there's something more we can do if he won't agree to change it. In shining a fuck-ton of lumens through our windows at all hours of the night, is he in violation of any laws or codes?	No
I'm in a dispute with a landlord whose home I moved out of and kept half of my deposit for damages he claims were made when I was there. On a hunch, I called the Maryland Landlord/Tenant office and apparently they don't have him registered as operating with a license.  Are there penalties or repercussions for him operating w/o a license? I imagine this would help me in my case when I present it to landlord/tenant court? But I want to report him to make sure he doesn't do this to other people as well.	No
"Currently renting at an apartment community in GA. I've been here for a couple years and every year they send out a renewal offer each year. Well, i've been trying to get them to send the lease over so I can lock in my renewal rate for another year (we lucked out and pay MUCH less than any of our neighbors). The staff in the office has changed a lot over the years and I'm worried someone new will come in and really jack up our rent. We received a written renewal offer on the company letterhead stating our renewal rate for 2017-2018 with absolutely no expiration date or stipulations (i.e. offer is void if presented with future offers). Would they have to honor this since it's in writing? We've been calling and going into the office in person and keep getting the old ""we'll get to it"". Starting to get very nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!"	No

"Friendly old-guy neighbor learned I was planning on moving, and approached me offering to sell my home for 3% of the sale price. He wants me to put a ""for sale by owner"" sign in front of the property with **his** phone number on it, and says he knows cash buyers eager to move into the neighborhood. He says he has provided this service for other sellers in my neighborhood, though he is not licensed to practice real estate.  On the one hand, this seems super-shady and makes me more than a little uneasy. On the other, I'd be happy to quickly find a qualified buyer, and wouldn't mind paying my neighbor to bring me someone from his social network.  What kind of headaches am I setting myself up for here? What kind of headaches might he be setting himself up for?"	No
"Throwaway: I'm in MA and my lease ended June 1. It was a standard 1 year lease, and I have Venmo proof that rent was paid in full each month on or before the 1st. I took dated pictures when I moved in, and I took pictures when I moved out. I have the lease, my utilities were all paid online so I have access to that, and I have access to that, and I have plenty of people who will testify that all of this happened.  I lived in a one bedroom apartment in this guy's house. I had my own entrance, kitchen etc. We were NOT roommates. He was always a little creepy, but I wrote that off as just being a weird guy. I think his mom (very elderly) actually owns the place. She lived on the top floor, and he had his own apartment in the basement/first floor. I lived in the middle.   I told him in Feb I wouldn't be resigning the lease, and he said that it was ""a pain in his ass to re-rent it every year"" and I needed to reconsider, but I had a contract.  Then, in May, he saw me in the shared hallway and asked me out. I politely told him that I wasn't interested, and he told me he'd ask when I moved out (?). I ignored him for the last few weeks, moved my stuff out, cleaned the place etc.  After I was moved out, he asked to meet me to get the security deposit, but made it sound like we'd hang out. I told him to send it to my work address. I told him it was because I was traveling, but really, I wasn't comfortable with him knowing where I lived. He said he'd wait till I got back from my trip.   I waited a few weeks and said I really needed it, and he had to send it to me, and he ignored me, but asked me where I moved. This happened a few times.  Finally, I told him that he needed to send me my deposit check, or I would pick it up, but that I needed it by the end of the week.  He asked me for coffee, and I told him that I would not date him, but he owed me $1250 and I need it. He called me a ""stuck up bitch"". Our last conversation was this text: ""The house was a mess when you left. You aren't getting shit from me. Take us to court, bitch and see what happens when you try to fuck over an old lady on social securty (sic)"". All of this is via text.  I don't want to be in the same room with this guy, but I need the money. Do I have to sue him? I'm so frustrated and disgusted with this guy, but is it even worth it at this point, or will the lawyer cost more than the deposit is worth?"	No

I've been trying to research this for a while, and while it's easy to find how to remove a father from a birth certificate, I cannot locate anything on how to remove a mother.  I've never had a pleasant relationship with my mother. She didn't raise me, and I feel no attachment for her, and on the contrary, she has no attachment to me. We haven't spoken in ages. I'm a 30F, and would like to know if it's possible to remove her name from my birth certificate without having to replace it with an adopted mother's name?  Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.	No
My lease says that my move in day was supposed to be on the 4th of July but I didnt end up moving in until 2 weeks later. Is the lease still valid or does that effect the lease at all? 	No
 I signed a one year lease and moved in. I have email records of her telling me I could move in on the day I did. I read through the lease entirely and it does not mention alcohol or tobacco specifically however the Craigslist add did say no smoking but I have not smoked inside which is confirmed by her property manager. The only thing it mentions is not bothering other tenants. I was drinking beer the day I moved my stuff in and the other tenants saw but I was not being belligerent was not so drunk I couldn't move big furniture and whatnot. Over the next few days I continued to drink on the porch to my unit and smoke cig's outside. The tenants send her multiple complaints that I am extremely drunk and smoking and making noise at night which I would argue I was not beyond using my apartment (no yelling or banging). One of these tenants recorded me talking on my porch from her porch and claimed it was me in a drunken stupor (I doubt you can even hear me or see me in w/e recording they claim to have if one at all). She sent her local property manager to my house to discuss my behavior with me and to install an A/C unit. I explained to him literally what I had done every single day I had been there so far which included stopping the drinking and smoking five days previous. No music at night or loud noises beyond me talking in discord inside of my apartment this entire time mind you. He told me he thought that the other tenants were exaggerating and blowing the situation out of proportion and would tell her so himself on my behalf. I have yet to hear from her yet after this meeting. My question is: Am I breaching my lease, can she revoke my lease and if so does she have to give me 30 days to move out? Thank you for your input.	No
I was wondering if I gave up parental rights if I still had to pay child support in Arkansas? 	No
I used to live in a house with 4 other people and we finally (after 2 months) received a bill from the previous landlord of the damages we owed. I moved in last year and took the room from a friend and when I moved in there was no walkthdough or anything. My former roommates had moved in two years prior and there was no walk through at all when they moved in. The previous tenants before there were friends as well, and they had left a lot of stuff in the house before they had moved in. They landlord actually charged us less rent because the carpets were already so bad and she was going to replace them anyway.

We expected not to get our deposit back and we she did the final walk through with us before we moved out she did not mention anything major to fix or clean and she said was don't expect your deposit back. This house is a modern house, probably built early 00's but still has seen a lot of wear and tear over the years and we did not cause all this damage. Any help would be appreciated, thank you all in advance!	No
"Last month I signed for my first apartment by myself, which I moved into on July 1, and I never received a copy of the lease. This being my first time doing everything on my own, I was so worried about making beginner mistakes that I probably made more than just what I can identify now. All correspondence with the landlord has been done through the real estate agent who showed me the place. The agent is relatively new to the city and in a new office, so his explanation of not having a scanner yet to provide me a copy of the lease made sense to me and he said the landlord company would send me a copy once they signed. Of course, it wasn't until after the fact that I realized I could have simply taken photos with my phone, but I was too nervous to think straight.  Anyway, that was last month, every week since then I've been emailing the agent for any updates on the copy and he would respond that the company hadn't gotten back to him yet. The past two weeks I received no response to my weekly requests, so I had started assuming something's gone wrong. Earlier today I emailed the agent again, this time requesting the landlord company's address so I can mail the rent (the agent mailed the first checks - me, being an idiot, didn't think to ask where to). The agent finally got back to me with the address and casually added if I can come by later to sign another copy of the lease so I can have an original.  So now I'm concerned, I ask what happened to the original lease and why they don't have a copy they can send me. The agent replies that the company ""may have misplaced it or forgot to scan it"" but that the copy he's printing is exactly the same. I asked if I could just have the copy he printed for reference and that I'm willing to wait for the company to relocate the original. So far, that's the last message in the chain; it's already 11 PM here so I don't expect this to continue until tomorrow.  So what course of action can I take from here? Did I totally screw myself by not getting a copy at my first opportunity? Right now I'm giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, but does anyone sense anything more nefarious at hand?"	No
My friend and I had signed a lease and gave our banking information for an apartment unit on July 27th for one year.  Today I found out that our unit has been double booked and the lease has been signed by other people who had signed to pay a higher rent ($1495, we signed for $1150).   Apparently, the owners said our rental price was too low for the three bedroom unit we are renting..but we had already signed the lease with the property manager or whoever was showing us the property with that price ($1150).   She's calling me back later today, but I just want to know what I need to do or say. We had signed the lease already, can they just drop us like that?  I have an email copy of the lease with the rent stated and date we signed.	No
"Thanks in advance for any help.   My lease ended on May 25th and my landlord has yet to contact us about our security deposit. I'm listed as the agent on the lease and emailed her the day we moved out with my mailing address and a reminder that I was the tenant that would be receiving the deposit.  I read the Maryland statute that says the following ""If the landlord, without a reasonable basis, fails to return any part of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the termination of the tenancy, the tenant has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney’s fees.""  Today is the 45th day and I still have not heard from my landlord. How exactly should I proceed? The security deposit was a little under $10,000 and suing her for $30,000 seems somewhat unreasonable but is that what we're entitled to under the statute? At what point should I contact an attorney? Should I reach out to her directly again?"	No
Someone filmed me having sex through my window. My university conducted interviews to get more information, and I have the transcripts from those interviews which pretty clearly point to who was responsible for taking the video. Is there any action I can take against that person? Can I take action against the people who viewed the video and didn't report it? Should I take it to the police? Does it matter that I don't have access to the video?	No
"Hello /r/legaladvice,  In Georgia, USA. This is might be long, so I sincerely apologize in advance. My former landlord has not returned our security deposit after nearly three months now. Since my roommate and I moved out in the beginning of May, he has essentially ghosted us, seemingly deliberately not responding to our texts and emails, and dodging our phone calls. He told my roommate back in early June that he sent the check to my forwarding address. There was no evidence of this check. After waiting a full month (and then some because it was almost July) to pass, I finally sent him a formal demand letter by certified mail. He responded two weeks later with only a vague text message, saying he got a return check from me. There was no mention of the letter I sent him, but he said he had deductibles after his contractor took a look and he will be sending the list and remaining balance soon. I responded promptly, thanking and asking him to send it as soon as possible. Then we heard nothing from him again.   Ten days ago, I sent him *another* demand letter. He has finally *sort of* communicated to us two days ago, claiming via text message a list of numerous damages to his property. It was a lot of ambiguous stuff like, ""The fridge was messed up."" We have no idea what that entails. Still have not provided any monetary figures and when/if he was returning our deposit. We sent him an email back right away asking for clarification and again for him to return our deposit and he has gone completely silent again.   My question is: Can he even claim he is withholding money for damages after the 30 days allowed by Georgia law? Or does his limited communication still count as him expressing that he was going to withhold the deposit. Have we ruin hurt our own case by trying to communicate with him and work things out?   Some other things: *1. We have rented the place for two years—initially 1-year, then renewed for another year. Thinking now, this was a mistake because there were so many things wrong with the house and, of course, this whole situation now. But it was a good location and the rent was cheap. We thought we had spent so much time, effort, and money making the place livable, and were used to it.  *2. We gave him notice when we moved and we did not owe rent. We kept the place clean and well-maintained. He tried to convince us in April that our lease ended days earlier than it did and when we pointed what was clearly written on our lease, he told us it did not matter and it was common knowledge to everyone that the last day of the previous month was always the last day or a new month's rent had to be paid. And then he tried to say the lease date was a mistake he made that he never changed because he thought we would understand. And when we pushed back, he stopped responding and acted like it never happened the next time he talked to us. We have the impression that he is partially being vindictive now because he could not squeeze more money out of us. *3. Pretty much everything on the list of damages he finally sent basically fell into one of two categories: Either A) already existed when we moved in because it was a very old house or B) were things we had told him about but he did not want to repair or repaired poorly (ie. cheap materials or only replacing one small part when really the whole thing needed to be straight up replaced). He was even in denial about a gas leak and did not fix the broken front door for over a week. We took photographs of the condition of the house when we moved in and also took a video of us going through all the rooms of the house when we moved out. We also have text message correspondence with him where we told him about various house problems and asked him to come take a look at them (although there was a lot of verbal in-person assurances he made that we did not get down in writing, some of those things he listed a damages after he said they were fine).  *4. And this may or may not be a separate issue, but I do not know if there is any that can legally done about it now... We were responsible for the utilities for the property according to the lease, but what he failed to clarify until after we had already moved in was that he had converted the small 1(?)-car garage into a separate unit (that honestly did not seem up to code) and was renting it out. There was no mention of this unit in the lease. It had no access to the heating/cooling controls and there was not a separate meter for utilities. They were constantly knocking on our door to turn up or turn down the heat/air-conditioning depending on the season because they only had a vent coming from the main house. And we were stuck with the bill when the other tenants ran up the water or electric bill.   I an sorry if my post is a mess and if I said a lot of necessary things. There is honestly just so much, and I have no idea where to begin. I have also contacted my university's student legal services with my inquiry, but everything is a slow process in the summer semester, and I will be graduating shortly, so might not be eligible for legal advice there much longer. Thank you for reading."	No
Long story but here is the short version.  17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.   He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	No

"I am in the process of gathering information to find an attorney to bring this up with, and I can't figure out what type of firm this fall under.  I am located in Oklahoma, the company I have an issue with is located in Pittsburg, PA, and has servers located in Costa Rica.  The developer in question I believe is also located in the new england area.  The issue involves an online game that has a MLM type incentive structure, you get returns based on the people under you. It also has a vibrant economy that has real world implications as to results of some games/minigames which are promised to be ""fair"" and ""random"".   Issue 1: The lead developer changed the incentive structure and cut the earnings from downstream in half.  He justified this as saying it prevents people trying to steal downstreams by profit sharing, as now he ""automatically"" gives the profit sharing back to the downstream. Even though some people did not profit share and so realized a very real 50% or more cut in income.  Issue 2: Over the past few years the developer has made many statements of things he would ""never do/wont happen"" that were then used to make economic choices, but then he does them a few months/a year later to the economic detriment of those who took actions based on his statements. Given that the lead developer and employees have not changed in this time period, it's felt he's still liable for the contradiction.  Issue 3: The lead developer has made several statements about the fairness/programming of some of the minigames in this game, that are either provably false, or probabilisticaly unlikely to be true, that has similar economic damage. While randomness is hard to prove/disprove, deviations can be shown on results in-game vs an out of game programmed simulation with the same ""rules"".  So my questions are:   1. What type of firm should i be looking for?  Civil litigation? Fraud?    2. What jurisdiction am I looking at/will i need to get a national/out of state firm or is it not an entire waste of time to check in-state consultations first?  Sorry if this just seems so basic, I just don't want to be wasting peoples time barking up the wrong tree. Thank you for the help!"	No
"I realize that this is probably a lost cause, but whatever.  For context, my girlfriends brother, called Eric for this story, works in a family-owned restaurant in a mountain town in Colorado. My GF, called Jane for this story, was going to the town to meet up with her brother, as they hardly ever see each other. He is 27, Jane is 17. Eric has been working in a restaurant to finance his wedding to his fiancé, Jordan (fake name). He also works in ski patrol during the winter and does odd jobs around the town during the summer.  The incident began when Jane arrived in town. Jane and Jordan were waiting outside the restaurant for Eric to get off his shift, and both of them go inside to ask Eric how long he has remaining in his shift before he's off. Jane goes to wait outside while Jordan talks to the manager. Jordan comes back outside, apparently looking really creeped out and distraught. Jane asks what happened, Jordan says the manager asked how old Jane was, saying ""what is she? 19? 20?"" Jordan relies and says, ""no, she's 17, why?""  The manager responds with ""well when she's wearing shorts like that she might as well be 20. She's got an ass like a 20 year old"" and then made a gesture where he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and inserted his other index finger into the hole repeatedly. (This is obviously a sex gesture).  It should be noted here that the manager of the restaurant is not the owner, and is a 42 year old man.   Jane and Jordan wait for Eric to get off work, and when he does, they tell him of the situation. Eric replies with ""I'm going to fucking beat his ass."" (Eric is very protective of Jane. For the first 6 months of our relationship, our dates were always me and Jane… and Eric. Were like brother now though.)   Jane and Jordan tried to hold him back from going into the restaurant, but they're small girls while Eric is 6'4"" 250 lbs of pure muscle. He walked back into the restaurant, and Jane and Jordan followed him. He asked the manager what he said about his sister, and he, strangely, told Eric exactly what he said, with gesture and all, and added at the end ""she's a dirty little girl, isn't she Eric?"" And winked after the last question.  Eric uppercutted the manager so hard he left the floor briefly before hitting the ground. The manger was driven to the hospital by Eric, and has a concussion, a broken cheekbone, and brief amnesia.  I should say now that this is all 2nd hand. I didn't witness any of this, but Jane and Jordan saw all of it and relayed it to me.  Is there anything they can do to keep Eric out of jail and not bankrupt him/the entire family? Thanks all!"	No
 So me and my ex wife filled out all the paper work for a divorce, (No lawyers) nothing contested, we did it jointly, have everything sorted out already as we've been apart since 2012. Sent it in, judge sends it back saying I need to send in affidavit and 2 years taxes and a reason why I'm not paying the full amount per month. Me and my ex wife have agreed on amount that works for her and I contribute with the purchasing of what he needs when he stays with me on top of what I give her per month. My question is we have both agreed and signed off on an amount that works for us, how do we say this to the judge without him making me pay full amount?	No
**TL;DR:** Should I go to court over a 1110(a) violation based on the defense that I am an out of town and not regular NYC driver and the sign was not visible to me? Or take the 2 points and pay the fine?  **My problem:**  I received a traffic ticket for violation of 1110(a) (2 points) in November 2015 in Brooklyn. All I can read on the ticket is: Disobeyed...traffic...device. I had an initial court date of September 2017. I was unable to attend, and it was rescheduled to 5/2017. Then, I got a letter in the mail that it was now 8/2017.   I wanted to know my best approach. I am not sure what details matter so I included as many as I could remember.  **Background:**  I turned right after another car on a busy intersection at a green after sitting and waiting for pedestrians to clear. After I completed the turn, I was pulled over (the other car wasn't).  It was a no right turn intersection. I am not a regular city driver. And I had never seen this sign. It was new to me. I am trying to find out the date of install. At the time, it was blocked by a truck, and I was behind a big truck. I followed another car and turned right. The cop was aggressive with me and implied he could do more than ticket me which I felt to be arrest, and I did not challenge him beyond an inquiry.   At the time, I was back and forth in NY and did not drive in state, and I had an out of state license. Now I live in NY, and I have not got a NY license yet because I don't drive and didn't have a SS card and enough ID points (I do have a NYC ID card). Now I have both, and I am not sure if I should retain my out of state license for point reasons or get a NY license this week. This is my first ticket on this license (had a license at 16, let it lapse when I stopped driving, retook the driver's test in my 20s).  **Questions:**  1. Is it worth fighting this ticket on this basis? Or should I just pay the fine?  2. Do I need an attorney?  3. If not, how will this hearing go? What should I be prepared for? This is all new to me.  4. Should I get a NY license (and won't be driving) or will the outcome affect my new license? Or keep the out of state until the court date?  **Secondary questions:**  1. I can find a database about parking signs but not traffic signs. Any idea I can find when a traffic regulation began at a particular intersection?  2. My new hearing time is at 4:30 in the afternoon. Is this typical? The TVB closes at 4:00. I have an evening class, and I wondered how long I could expect to be there.  3. If I go to DMV and request a new date, are they likely to give me one with school conflict?  4. Why would the DMV change the hearing date on their end?  Thank you for any and all help. I appreciate any insight. I have no idea what to do or expect. Have a great week.	No
My rent is $1200 a month. I recently requested the apartment install a washer and dryer in my unit, which according to them, is $40 a month added to rent. It took them a month to get the washer and dryer installed, and I ever signed a new lease or any paperwork indicating that I agree to pay for the washer and dryer. The last rent bill included the cost for the washer and dryer. Can they arbitrarily increase the billable amount of my rent without me ever signing anything agreeing to pay for it? I get that I requested the washer and dryer, but they forgot to send me a new lease to sign (their mistake, not mine).	No
Hey Reddit looking for some guidance and/or advice. My fiancés grandpas house is paid off (he is widowed &amp; his deceased wife was also owner of the house/on the deed) so far we were told to file an affidavit of heirship (we did and it's recorded) so that his grandpa could gain all rights to her estate since there was no will. Then my fiancés grandpa could do a gift deed, giving the house to my fiancé with no exchange for money or anything else. (We did that yesterday and now it is filed with the county clerk office) we are in Texas bexar county. Does this change name on deed/title? Is there more I should do? What I've done so far was info given to me by an attorney (basic info) I did all of the paperwork. Amy help would be appreciated.	No
Lenexa, KS  Long story short.... Brand New Apartment 8/12 months completed of lease.  Rain Storm 6/17- Caused water to come in through window damaging walls, floors, and bedding wet. Call apartment complex, said they would send someone out from the onsite contractors.   7/12- Another storm- same result. Once again contacted property management said they were not sure what to do, and would be fixed within the week. Dropped off a $50 gift card.  7/22- Another storm- Same result however I was not home to move things out of the way, and my bed has been damaged along with floor, walls.  I am concerned with the growth of mold because I have severe asthma. I have looked at the tenant handbook from the state, not much help.   I have spoken with executive leaders of the property management and they could care less.  What are options in terms of course of action to get out of lease and pursue damages?	No
"I was hoping to resolve my dispute with my previous landlord out of court, but his most recent response of ""See you in court"" says he wants otherwise.   Moved out of the condo I was renting from an individual owner by time on the date of my lease ending on May 15th. There was a $1300 security deposit in my name. On July 11th, I receive the letter and $500 check postmarked from July 7th claiming he needed to withhold funds due to:   1) deep pet-cleaning needed 2) a $250 pet deposit that was owed and never paid.  3) painting fee due to nail holes.   Event though I disagree all of the above (he already had a pet deposit for $250 that should cover pet cleaning fee, a lease renewal should not pay new pet fee... if so, he should have asked 2 years ago when i renewed, and I lived there for 5 years and spackled and filled all nail holes on the walls prior to leaving. its normal wear a tear), my main point of contention was that according to Georgia Code Annotated § § 44-7-30 to 44-7-37, I should have my full deposit returned since his letter and check were not sent within 30 days.  My main concerns with small claims court are that I think he may be hard to find. I sent certified mail of my request for return of funds and intent to sue to the address of the rented condo, the address he had included in my lease which appears to be a business address, and the address tied to his check that he paid me with (Maryland). Both GA addresses letters were returned to me, and the Maryland is at a front desk that I doubt is where he lives permanently. I'm worried trying to find his real address to sue him may be more costly than the $800 I'm owed.   Reddit, any advice on how to track him down, sue him in the appropriate state, and am I on the correct side of this 30-day technicality of the security deposit?"	No
Hello, I just received driving permit under AB 60 from Stanton DLPC (I'm over 18). I want to make an appointment for driving test, so I called the DMV. Then I was told to call a number that says on my paperwork but I didn't get any paperwork other than my number. They said I have to call a number starting with 805, or DMV will call me but that's uncertain. Is the interview required? (Since stanton dlpc didn't mention anything) or will they call me? (How long then?) Thank you	No
There was an offer for 499 a month on rent and I tried signing the lease online the day after the offer expired and online it said the lease was unsigned. Now I am being told that I do have the lease but I do not want it anymore. Do I have any right to get out of this lease? They're telling me it is legally binding and won't break it.  This is in Illinois	No
This in regards to technically my nephew-in-law, my husband's sister's son. Our nephew is about two years old and we were informed by her and a family friend that he was taken into foster care on Friday. We aren't sure exactly what happened to cause it, since we can't get any straight answers out of my sister-in-law, but clearly it was pretty serious. She has been under the scrutiny of CPS since the child was born, and even lived with us for a few months after he was born under an agreement with CPS.   We don't understand why we weren't contacted to have our nephew stay with us instead of being put into foster care. We've been an advocate for him since he was born. We've tried contacting CPS, but we know they can't tell us anything--we're just a little desperate. I tried contacting a few lawyers Friday and today (Monday), but I haven't yet been able to find anyone able to help on short notice (not at least for three more weeks). I've contacted my work hotline that helps connect employees with a lawyer or legal advice, they gave me a couple names, but agreed it would be incredibly difficult to find someone to talk to immediately. I haven't been able to get a response from anyone today. None of that is too relevant except that to tell you all, I'm desperate and I just don't know what to do.  We're supposed to be going out of town tomorrow for the rest of the week. Our sister-in-law is telling us she has a hearing this week and wants to declare her intent to have us to adopt her son. But no one has contacted us and no one will talk to us about it, besides her, and we have reason to not trust her. We don't know if one of us should try to stay to see what happens and if we'll need to take action during the week. The trip is for work, and so it's hard for us to make this decision not to leave just on a whim, when no one's telling us we need to be here.  I don't want to be too specific just because this could all involve some legal allegations that, again no one will talk to us about, but I thought maybe I could ask some specific questions someone could give us some advice:  1. I've been told that typically children are placed with family before being placed into foster care. However, no one gave us the option to take him, even though we believe our sister-in-law and social services knew that we would willingly care for him. We're incredibly worried that our sister-in-law has said something about my husband to make them think we were a threat, which would be completely untrue. Is that possible, or does it seem normal that a child would be placed in foster care just while they were figuring out what to do? And if something was said about us do we have any right to know about it?  2. What can I say, who can I contact to let them know how urgent our situation is? I feel like I keep getting brushed off from law offices because my matter is 'too urgent', they tell me to talk again to my referral service, but then I'm just stuck again with someone who can't take our case.   3. Is it actually possible that my sister-in-law is preparing to hand her son off for adoption to us but yet no one has tried to talk to us about it besides her?!   4. I realize that two weeks in foster care probably won't harm this kid forever, but at the same time, I am worried that things are going to move down a path so quickly that we may never see our nephew again, without even getting the opportunity to speak up about it. I know that we don't technically have any legal rights over him since we aren't his parents, but we care about him and we want what's best for him, and think that that is with us (if it can't be with her). But we don't know where to start and we don't know who to talk to to make sure our voice is heard.  It's been a long day and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this! There are a lot of details I left out, and my mind is racing and stressed at the moment. I could write a novel about the journey we have been through with this kid, and I want to help him so much, but I don't know how to say it to the courts.	No
"Someone I know is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this."	No
So In January I signed a lease for an apartment with three of my friends. In February I was diagnosed with GBS. A rare spinal cord disease. Now I'm unsure on my ability to return to school (3 hours from home) this semester. My university wants me to wait one more semester before I return. Can my medical status be used to get out of my lease? 	No
My father needs to file some court papers about a domestic violence incident.  English isn't his first language, so he has asked me to help him fill out the form.  Do I need to know any particular legal terms, or is the form pretty self-explanatory?	No
"7 of my friends went camping on a Monday night, I had work unfortunately. They were camping at a site where camping isn't allowed but many people camp there anyways. After being there for a few hours, a man and woman came to the camp site and held a gun(later revealed to probably be a pellet gun) to the back of my friends head. He started saying things like, ""Are you prepared to die?"" And remained there pointing the gun from person to person for about 10 minutes. From this I have found out his name and I am wondering what sort of action, preferably legal, we should take against him. Is there anything we can do considering they were camping illegally?"	No
"Hello,      My GF could really use any advice available because she is in a crappy situation with her roomates. All of them are signed as co-tenants on a month to month lease. But the other couple had recently broken up and both wanted out. They never were going to tell my GF but she found new apartment applications on the dining room table and then asked them about it. Thats how she found out about everything. That was only a month ago, and both of them have already removed the majority of their stuff from the apartment, besides their cat, who has caused a lot of damage to the apartment and is being neglected. Last night one of them tried to move in a new girl to take their place but she has not even filled out an application and is not on the lease. My GF told her roommate that before she can move anybody in, it needs to be approved by the property manager first. Her roomate responded by saying ""i'm still moving her in if you want the bills paid"". We have this text screenshotted because shes threatening to not pay this months rent (even though she has been staying there and has not taken her cat yet) and to move somebody in without signing the lease first. Also, we were told by the assistant property manager that they were never even notified of the cat being in the apartment, meaning that she lied to my GF about having their permission. We have many photos of the cat, her admitting that the cat caused the damage, her saying that she ran it by the property manager (she didn't), and an ad that she put out on craigslist that was dated august 1, meaning she didnt start looking for a roomate until this month. My gf has given a 60 day notice and wants the three of them to split the remaining balance due so they can all be done with it. But the other girl is refusing and the bill is overdue. My gf does not want to live with a stranger, she does not want to stay there anymore, and she has not had the time to move out her belongings even though her current roomate is pressuring her into moving im a complete stranger by saturday. The property manager said a couple days ago that they can still perform a roomate swap, allow the new girl to move in, and release my gf from the lease, but the new person would be solely responsible for the rent and need to fill out an application first. But her current roomates still have not fixed the carpet that their cat ruined. What are my GF's options? Is there anything she can do? We have been documenting every little thing and have copys of the lease and monthly payments. She's also trying to pressure my gf into finding a new roomate to take her place, but thats not her responsibility, she just wants out. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	No
So I moved out of my last apartment at the end of the lease on the 1st of this month. Naturally I would expect my security deposit to come back to me by now, but I have not gotten anything from my landlord thus far. When I called him (the management company), he told me that my former roommates have not come up with a replacement roommate and are short on covering the replacement security. He stated I would not get my security back until my roommates covered that cost.  I am wondering why this should be an ongoing issue for myself if I am no longer legally binded to the lease.  My general experience with the management company has not been great. He never responds to my emails when I've requested information in the past. He answers the phone only when its convenient for him. And I have not actually ever met the guy. When he informed me of how the security deposit is being handled, I asked him if this was written in the lease and he said yes. I don't believe him though and am in the process of getting a copy of the lease to be sure.  Does a situation like this seem probable (legal) or is he just holding my money until he knows it's been covered (illegal)?	No
"My rap sheet consists of 1 DUI, which most companies I want to work at don't consider to be a disqualification. I got a job offer at my dream company and now I have to wait on the background check. I've seen a report from a background check company before and it has all ""gory details"" of the court case, including aggravating factors that were ultimately ignored. Can a background check company use all that info against me or can they only report on the fact that I have a *Gross Misdemeanor - Driving Under the Influence, 1st Offense*."	No
Greetings!  I reside in the state of Illinois, and I'm wondering if getting married in Mexico will automatically hold a legal authority in the US? I cannot find any info about this online (though I'm bad at research). Do countries instantly exchange marital information about a citizen/resident? Or will it only hold its legal value and thus show up on my american record if I notarize and apostille the certificate in the US.  Big thank you in advance.	No
"My ex-husband was ordered 3 years ago during our divorce to pay child support. Before I get a bunch of hate PMs -- I work, I didn't ask to keep the kid more. He didn't want more time. I don't enjoy never having any time to myself and always having to do everything on my own. It sucks, ok. I would gladly pay him the $350 he is required to pay me a month to get any sort of break on healthcare, child care, or even not having to use every single vacation day of work for a sick day or because school is out. Do you know how great it would be to just have to pay $350 a month for all child related expenses. It would all be worth $350 because that is nothing compared to the cost of a kid. I spent $100 on shoes the other day. Shoes. He needed shoes for school and water shoes for water activities and nice required shoes    for graduation. I swear to god I just bought him shoes 3 months ago that don't fit now. So before you come at me with the collecting child support shame just think for a second about how much it costs you to live and double that. Double all your costs. It isn't easy on one income. It isn't easy on two incomes.   My problem is my super pissed ex-husband who sees him kids the last weekend of every month likes to make it uncomfortable or hard to get my child support. In the last year, he has stuck the check in an actually bucket of slop, he has stuck it in a zip lock baggie of dog shit, he has taped it to my roof, he has tried to get me to play an elaborate scavenger hunt, he has driven to my son's elementary school on a day that isn't his custody day and stuck in my son's backpack and not told anyone and when I asked him where it was he has said "" guess where?"" which lead to an elaborate search of the house and two days of a guessing game (it was well hidden in a tiny pocket in the backpack and my son had no idea his dad even put anything in there, he has buried it in my back yard with my son's help, he has hand delivered to my HR department at work with ""for the bitch"" on the envelope, paid me cash in all $1, he has threatened to pay me in change (which he has not done yet), and he has written me 350 different checks for $1 each.   It is always something and it is getting old. I have not accept checks before (the ones covered in things) and he has eventually written me new ones after giving him a hard time.   I am exhausted. This is annoying. He doesn't work a consistent job so often times a garnishment would be hard. He always pays on time without hesitation but this is insane.   How much of this do I have to put up with? Is this just something I have to deal with for the next 11 years?"	No
This is a very very long story over the course of 5 years, but to begin with I'll just start with the most basic info to see if I have any chance of recourse. I live in a approximately 40 unit apartment building in Southern California.   Live in manager #1 was fired for sexually harassing tenants including my fiance Live in building manager #2 was fired refused to leave the building, defaced the building and his apartment and generally terrorized everyone living here.  Live in building managers (a couple) #3 were fired almost immediately, refused to leave, had to be evicted, severed all the internet cables, vandalized washing machines, vandalized their apartment and stole.  Since managers #3 left there haven't been any changes made. The locks weren't changed, the security cameras don't actually work, and zero effort was made to protect tenants from the extremely hostile managers #3.  I awoke this morning to someone trying to come through my window using a ladder managers #3 left in the alley. I am extremely distraught and don't feel remotely safe in my own apartment. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the basics.   The big kicker is that it's a rent controlled apartment and the landlord would be more than happy for anyone in the building to leave since rents have gone up substantially in the area. Especially those of us who have been here a while.	No
