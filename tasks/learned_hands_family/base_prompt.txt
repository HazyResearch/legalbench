Post: Ever since we came to USA, my dad has been handling the finance and will not disclose it with my mother. He said its because she does not understand English very well so she don't need to know. They own a small ma and pa store here in NJ and have a house. She work +12 hours a day 6 days a week but does not have freedom to spend, drive(he wont let her drive at all. His excuses he is afraid she might get into car accident and cost $$) and can't stay out too late.They work in same place but she works more and have to cook and clean for him.  She has not gone back to native country since we got here or any vacation for over 15 years. The biggest issue is that they are always in debt. My mother wants to know why but he won't tell her what's going on. Finally she got fed up and wants to leave him. She said that's the only way she will see any financial documents. He has already handed over store's tax and other documents to her but not all of them.  They are getting divorced by mutual consent. After they talked about divorce, he  handed over store's tax and other documents to her but not all of them.She said she will have the store and he will keep the house because he refuses to sell the house. She does not want to get a lawyer to fight for the house because we cannot afford to spend a lot of money on lawyer.   I read online that a divorce lawyer will cost about 15k-19k but mediator will only cost few hundred so she wants to go into that route.   The concern is that we do not know if he is 100% honest about where all the money is and going. We are looking into free consultation with lawyer but I wanted to get some quick feedback first.   Will the mediation lawyer be able to find and let my mother know how many bank accounts he have and anything else he is hiding? How much can I help without my mother being there? I have to talk to lawyer alone and such because she does not speak English very well and cannot leave the store. I will help her run the store after he is out of the picture. She suspects he might be cheating but she has no proof so I assume its no-fault divorce?  I am already moved out and married so I will not be affected.   **tl;dr:** My parents are getting divorced by mutual consent. He handled the money so she has no idea whats going on.  Can the mediator find out what my dad is hiding financially? Can he/she make sure there aren't any hidden debt under my mother's name? She suspect he might be cheating but she has no proof so I assume its no-fault divorce? We are looking into free consultation.

Post: My (ex)husband and I have been separated for two years. I moved to Ohio (Cleveland area) from Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area) and have resided in Ohio for the entire two years. I started paperwork for a disillusionment, but he refused to sign the papers because he says he can't make the trip to Ohio for the final court hearing. Papers were never filed.  We have no children, we never purchased anything together, and we have agreed on our debts.  My question is am I able to file for divorce here in Ohio without him? Or do you I have to file for divorce in Pennsylvania? Am I able to do this on my own or would it best for me to hire a lawyer? Is there any legal aid available for this if I do need a lawyer?  Okay that's like four questions, but I have no idea how to proceed and I just want this to be over. Help, please.

Post: Long story short when I was younger my mother cheated on my father with a new man who would do drugs together with my mom and abuse her right infront of me. My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway.   What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all. Like get some sort of financial compensation, and move far away.

Post: I'm planning to ask my HOA for permission to install solar panels. The Declaration doesn't to mention solar panels. Can the HOA use its general power to disallow solar panels when the Declaration doesn't to mention solar panels on the back side of my roof? My house is on the edge of the neighborhood.  It is two stories high so no one will even be able to see the roof when standing in the neighborhood. I've heard the HOA has previously rejected proposals to install solar panels. But I can't think of a reason they could conjure up to reject me because they won't be visible. It seems such a decision would be arbitrary and capricious. Do it's decisions have to have a rational basis?

Post: I am working as a Contractor in Orange, CA and teaching lessons scheduled a couple of weeks in advance. When I tried to quit, my boss told me that I was under contract and still had to teach. I have pasted the two clauses relating to quitting and teaching. It sounds like I still have to teach the previously booked lessons outside of the 14 day quitting notice. I wanted a second opinion on this. Thanks!  "(b) Either the Contractor or the Company may terminate the Contractor’s provision of the Services under this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, including for convenience, upon giving fourteen (14) calendar days’ written notice to the other party.  (c) Notwithstanding any termination of the Contractor’s provision of the Services for any reason whatsoever, the Contractor shall teach any lessons booked prior to the date on which notice of termination was given, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Company."

Post: I am currently residing in Florida  In April, I made the personal decision to leave my apartment due to personal conflicts with my roommate. We are both on the lease and I asked to either have my name removed from the lease, or to terminate all together. She refused to comply with either of those options out of spite. There is no contractual agreement between me and my roommate stating that we would pay our share of the rent, only a contract with the landlord(the lease). I have been paying the second half of the rent out of fear of what may happen if I choose to stop. From what I understand reading Florida law and finding bits and pieces, the landlord would undergo this process to collect rent: Once the rent is X amount of days late, the landlord will file a 3-Day eviction notice. The tenants will have 3 days to either pay the late rent, vacate the apartment, or fight the eviction in court. Now with that being said, having the eviction to my renter's history IS NOT A BOTHERSOME to me. I also understand the landlord may sue for missing rent. Being evicted and having to pay overdue rent for the month sounds like a better deal to me than continuing to pay rent for an apartment I'm not living in until December. My main concern is the retaliation of my roommate, and fact checking the eviction process. Is there anything legally she may pursue in a small claims court against me directly beings that there is no contractual agreement directly between the two of us, stating we would split the rent? Is there any actions that the landlord may take that is much more serve than eviction/suing for missing rent? Does my roommate have a case to fight the eviction in court?
