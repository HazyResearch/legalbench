Today has not been a good day.   For the last two years I've been dating a mentally unstable girl, and for the past couple days she for reasons unknown to me ghosted me and refused to talk to me. So today I went over to talk to her and see what was up,  and she looked me in the eye while laughing and telling me that last night she had sex with someone and cheated on me.  I was obviously angry as all hell, I punched the bed and squeezed her arm in anger (she was sitting in my arms). I calmly asked who it was with, she rolled her eyes saying she wont say. I asked for my things back and left. I knew my best bet would be to just block her, not post anything and be the bigger person.  She's now posting things saying I'm abusive and beat her when I never would and may report me to the cops.   I'm really scared, I'm 18, about to go to college and I'm terrified my life could get fucked over for something I never did.	Yes
"My (heterosexual) partner and I do not currently have plans to become legally married, but consider ourselves to be and meet all the NJ legal requirements (listed here http://www.nj.gov/health/forms/reg-d7.pdf) of Domestic Partners -- that is, we have a joint bank account, joint insurance, are one another's life insurance beneficiaries, etc. But everything we find regarding DP in NJ refers to those 62 and older, there doesn't seem to be anything on the books for younger couples.  Is there anything available to us at our age (early-mid 30's), or are we just SoL? Do we even NEED anything official, or do we just declare ourselves ""domestic partners"" to whoever listens and that's that? We just want to make sure we're protected in case of accident, emergency, legal issues, etc etc."	Yes
I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	Yes
"My son's mother spent 2014 incarcerated, she only saw our son in January that year. In 2015, she filed her federal 2014 tax return claiming him and that she ""cared for him more than 6 months that year"". In addition to that, I have a Court Order from 2014 very specifically assigning me all physical custody, all legal decision making and rights to the EITC. Recently, her parental rights were terminated because she doesn't contact him. Now that Court is over (I handled custody, termination and adoption pro-se), I have the time to pursue the EITC issue. In speaking to a tax attorney, if I refile my 2014 claiming my son and showing proof she couldn't claim him, there's a significant chance they will prosecute because of the *clear* violation of federal tax rules (i.e. the fraud was intentional).   Would it be considered ""blackmail"" to send her an email telling her that if she doesn't agree to repay my son his EITC at $100 per month (for 10 months) that I will refile my taxes, causing her to be investigated for fraud?  I wanted to give her the opportunity to handle it without being indicted on federal tax fraud charges but am thinking twice because I'm afraid this might be considered blackmail. The law is pretty vague (to me)."	Yes
Hi, I was told by r/personalfinance to post this here.  So, I am going to try to make this as brief as possible, but I also need to add in enough background information that may also help provide a better answer.  My dad and mom have been living together for nearly 30 years, my dad has worked full time post of that time in various positions. He is retired now and receives a significant amount of retirement income each month, totaling between 3k-4k. My mom has worked, but only infrequently and only has SS of about $500 per month.  Their combined income should be enough to live off of, but... My mom has been recklessly spending money on various things, mostly dining out and groceries that seem to disappear. Not only that, but my mom and sisters are semi-hoarders and breeders of animals (cats and dogs) which are destroying the house and costing them hundreds if not thousands of dollars each month to maintain. The amount of cats and dogs combined are almost 20. My mom also has power of attorney over my dad for unrelated reasons.  I recently found out that my mom forced my dad to open several credit cards in his name and has maxed out of them to a total of 25k. Additionally, in the past week my mom and my sisters have left me and my dad at home with a barely operable car and we do not know where they have gone or when they are coming back. The biggest issue is a large settlement that is incoming for my dad to the amount of 200k. Since my mom has power of attorney over my dad I need to know whether or not she can take the money out right or if we have time to stop her.     He has already been to a notary public to revoke the power of attorney and has a set appointment date for receiving the settlement in person. So, my question is, what the hell do I do or can do? What the hell do we do when we get the 200k? My mom and dad also own the house, both of their names are on it. My dad wants to setup a living trust and invest the 200k and keep it away from my mom. Is this the right decision? I just need help or advice.  Additionally, my dad is going to see a lawyer on Thursday about getting the POA fully revoke and we'll see  Thank you.	Yes
Location: Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and maybe Florida  Background: When my 2nd? cousin went to apply for a credit card, we found they had a number of loans in default from several years ago when they were under 18. We're about 90% sure their biological father stole their identity and have already filed a police report and they frozen their credit. They're on their way back to some semblance of normalcy, but the new issue is they have a large number of half siblings from their biological father, my shitty cousin. We aren't entirely sure how many, but my uncle, his dad, had met 17 of them, though relatives estimate around 25 to 30 altogether scattered through various states.  Problem: We realized if my cousin had stolen his oldest child's identity, it was likely he had done so to his other children as well. Unfortunately, as none of the others lived in that town, there was nothing the police could do to help. He works under the table to dodge child support, and can only be reached at a PO box in Indianapolis. Unfortunately, he would only respond to his dad. (After walking out on his family, he made it clear he wouldn't be around them. We decided to keep inviting them and he never forgave us for wronging him so horribly, but his dad was out of the picture at the time) Unfortunately, his dad was recently arrested  for selling meth and decided to skip town on bail.  Is there any way we could try to track down the other kids to let the mothers know to check? I know this whole thing sounds absurd, and quite frankly I would rather not air out family laundry online, but it would be inexcusable to allow him to rob his kids.	Yes
Hi, I'm new to legal advice and being in trouble in general, so please let me know if I'm missing anything.  First things first, I'm going to turn myself in obviously, I'm going to have my lawyer set up a time to do that.  About 5 years ago, my drug addict father showed up at my mom's house, after I hadn't seen him for over a year. In my opinion, he was messed up on prescription painkillers when he arrived. He was parked in the driveway, I yelled at him to leave, we yelled at each other. He tried to open the car door and I closed it back on him. I ran inside, called my mom, and he backed out of the driveway, called the cops and said I was threatening him. We were the only two people present. Honesty, I have no idea what I said to him. I was 20 at the time, and pretty upset that my abusive father showed up at my house without warning. The police arrived, assessed the situation, and told me something about how in domestic cases they usually arrest someone no matter what, but that my father wasn't going to sign a complaint and they told him to not come back to the property. The next day, apparently he called the police to sign a complaint. A warrant was issued for my arrest at the time, for misdemeanor domestic abuse  Here's where it gets fucked. I was never notified I had a warrant. Nobody ever showed up at my house. I never got a letter in the mail. I've had my ID ran by multiple police departments, including the one wanting to arrest me now (never in trouble or any other charges ever, just verbal warnings), applied for jobs, school, new passport, left the country and went through customs, etc ect. Nothing ever came up, so I had no idea.  About a year after that, my father passed away because his liver failed, due to the ridiculous amount of prescription pills and alcohol he was consuming.  Cut to just now. The police called me, saying they were going through old warrants and needed me to turn myself in. They explained that they tried to have the state's attorney quash the warrant, but the attorney refused. I'm not walking into the police station without a lawyer obviously.   What the hell happens next? The cops are saying that they'll transport me to court, I get booked, and then the bond court will PROBABLY throw it out. I don't believe them at all. I have bail/bond money, but I'm just afraid as fuck of jail.	Yes
"Here's the background: My ex-husband moved out of state (from OR to WA) about 4 years ago, and has visited our daughter (F, 12) maybe 4 times in those years. He has drug/alcohol/legal troubles, and is currently sitting in county jail awaiting a trial for domestic violence that will likely send him to prison for 5 years (that's the plea bargain).   We have ""joint custody"" and have since 2009, but our daughter has lived with me and with my husband (her stepfather) that whole time. I've discussed getting official full custody a few times, and it's just never seemed worth it. (He can't afford any child support; he's often homeless; he doesn't try to see her or have her for Christmas/vacations anyway, and so for all practical purposes, we really do have ""full custody"" anyway.)   But now, with this prison sentence looming, I'd like for my husband to be able to adopt her. I know I need to have his parental rights terminated, and I'm meeting with a lawyer next week to have that first conversation. Just a few questions:  We have a $100 consultation, but I'm wondering if after that, I'd be able to do most of this paperwork on my own. Does that seem reasonable? Or am I going to have to really sign up for the full deal with the lawyer? If so, does anyone have a rough ballpark of what that might cost so I can start figuring that end out? Are there any particular questions I should ask at our meeting?  And finally... this IS a good idea, right? It's possible and worth it?  Thank you, thank you!"	Yes
