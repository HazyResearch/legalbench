Hello,  Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I was concerned about overexposition to the stock market, and asked my wife in late 2015 to make changes.  She ignored my request.   I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax.   I feel overburdened because while my exwife claims a sizeable share of these funds, she has completely ignored anything related to stewardship.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.  Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case for a while now, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending to be unavailable, or absent from the country, or that they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months..., just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.   Any advice appreciated.	Yes
I got divorced in 2003 and I was on permanent disability. Since I first started getting disability, my wife was in control of the money due to my brain injury/mental disability. To this day, she still has full control over it. I am asking for advice on how to get it out of her name and either back into my name or another family member.  I don't know the exact amount I should be receiving, but i know that she keeps about half of the total amount. The only other source of income I have is 600$ that I receive from the insurance settlement that caused by brain injury.  She says I would probably lose the disability entirely if the disability was taken out of her name or if the bank account it's deposited into changes.   Location: Florida, Hillsborough County	Yes
"Hi Everyone,  I'm in the middle of one of the most messed up situations I have ever heard. As a  start I am BP1 and dependent on my wife . About 10 months into our marriage my wife started constantly skipping work to meet up with a friend's brother and fool around in our car. She got bold enough to rent a hotel room to have sex with him and I caught her. This is the time she exposed herself as a narcissist as she really couldn't show any remorse.  The day I found out her parents just showed up and her mom was very angry. They went on a short walk and Upon returning her mother completely changed and said that my wife has been living in fear of me and that we should be separated. My wife talked privately with me and cried and pleaded to stay and I said whatever you told your mom obviously was taken very seriously. Her mom went into Super protection mode and did not hold my wife accountable whatsoever, while my wife blocked me out of everything.  I start living at the house alone with my dog and two cats and start losing weight and making positive changes. I talk daily with my wife with a lot of communication that was always attempting to be positive. Fast forward a few weeks her brother has a wedding near our one year anniversary. After the wedding she went to her friend's house to meet up with her Affair partner and ""see how each other feels."" I snapped the picture of her car and his car and texted her that I was done and to feel free to stop by the house and talk. I was then completely mind f***** for about 5 hours until I finally realized she didn't want to come back she just wanted that as an option. I asked her to leave and she claimed to go home to her mom's but lied and admitted later she went to the""domestic abuse shelter."" She continued by saying that she was going to commit suicide and the counselors at the shelter wanted her to go to the hospital. My best friend died November last year from suicide, looking back I see now she was playing on that to keep me roped in.  A week later I stop by Petco after a therapy appointment and see the affair Partners vehicle. So I stop and wait about 5 minutes because I wanted to ask him if he was still seeing my wife / aware of suicide threats. She had been playing this oh my phone randomly shuts off game like I'm retarded for days before this so I had very little contact and was desperate for a smidgen of Truth. I was shocked when out of the corner of my eye I see my wife driving in our car with him in the passenger seat. She saw me and turned around in the parking lot so I jumped in my car and caught up. I videotaped so that way she was unable to narc her way out of it. I foolishly thought she would pull over and say okay The Jig Is Up.  Of course her Affair partner called the cops  and they pulled over into a parking lot and so did . They asked if I was following that car and I said hell yeah that's my wife and her Affair partner and she is supposed to be in a domestic abuse shelter and suicidal. Her response to them was oh I am terrified of him he carries a gun. The police asked I said no and it moved on very quickly. They said it sounds like it's time to move on and I said no crap dude. They were super cool mostly because I was obviously taking a video and not trying to physically do anything at all and it was apparent. She felt she was completely untouchable, but had finally been caught red-handed publicly. Several days later I get served with an order to appear in court for one of those blasphemous ex parte orders of protection which is early next week.   She is claiming I was stalking her because I ""knew of her whereabouts"" and that I was carrying a gun around the house and that she was in fear of her life. She has explained over and over to her mom dad myself and anyone that I have and never will harm her in any way. But for it to fit the statue it has to be fear of her life. The third thing she referenced was from a year-and-a-half ago and she claimed when she bailed me out after a bar fight I was in a rage and try to Veer her car off the road. This was about a three-minute drive on the way to my pdoc / therapist. It even reads like complete b*******. I believe completely that I am about to walk in there and get crucified. Her narc is so strong in so many ways. She is the queen of isolating me and telling one side of stories. It's clear to me that she wants the house to herself without me around so she can move her boyfriend in and also get revenge for being caught red-handed because that's basically criticism and that's not something she deals with. Sorry for the wall of text there are more details but I try to keep it short. I will probably come back through Andrea edit. Any help advice anything would help at this point."	Yes
"My fianc√©'s ex wife is threatening to withhold the kids from visitation. This isn't the first time and she has a habit of calling the cops and child protective services, etc. a few times a year. Every time, by the way, it's been considered ""unfounded"". The newest issue is sleeping arrangements. The kids are 5 yr old triplets. I personally have 2 kids of my own who live with me full time and we have the triplets every weekend. We have a 3 bedroom home with a finished basement (that was that way when we bought the home). The current sleeping situation is my two kids sharing a room, and the triplets (just turned 5) have toddler beds in a shared bedroom. We wanted to move them to big beds. We decided that we'd use one room of the finished basement and turn it into their bedroom (their play room/the theater is already down there and they spend most of their time down there anyway). We got the 2 girl triplets a queen bed to share, and the 1 boy triplet a twin bed. They only sleep at our house on Saturday nights. In the room that is now their bedroom, there are two means of egress (escape). One is the stairs leading to the upstairs, and the other is a Bilco door that is in the room leading directly to 4 stairs that lead to outdoors. Before we moved them down there we went to the township and spoke with the building code guy for the township-explained the situation and asked if we were in the clear to have them sleep down there. His answer was yes. No new construction or anything as it was finished when we bought it.   Ex wife states that it is against court order custody agreement which only states that there be an ""appropriate sleeping arrangement"" for the children. Obviously we're never going to have a house with 6 bedrooms, and so nothing will ever meet her personal definition of ""appropriate"" because she'd prefer they all have their own room. She states she called the township and asked if it was a legal bedroom and she says it's not.   I guess I'm just wondering if her complaints have any legal merit. I just think of these single dads with studio apartments or something and I can't imagine that as long as the child has an appropriate and safe place to sleep, that the court would dictate specifics on sleeping arrangements. Any thoughts?"	Yes
I'm in Minnesota. A little background to this twisty, complicated, decade-long issue. (names changed) 12 years ago when my sister was in high school, she was dating a nice boy named Mike. Mike's sister Nancy was... crazy. She had a baby (Derek) when they were all in 10th grade, and, long story short, Nancy was a huge partier and drug user and her parents were no better. Mike and my sister ended up raising Derek pretty exclusively (with help from my parents) until Derek was about 4. My sister and Mike got married right out of high school and then divorced (amicably), but Nancy continued to leave Derek at my sister's house for weeks while she disappeared god knows where. On and on this went until Derek was about 8. Nancy ended up doing some jail time and Derek was living with her parents who were heavy gamblers and drinkers. He was getting in serious trouble in school and having serious behavioral problems. Mike intervened and called my sister asking if she could take Derek full time as no one else in their family was stable enough to care for him. She agreed and Nancy agreed as well, stating that she 'never wanted him'. Derek went to live with my sister and her boyfriend Randy who, because he's such a great guy, had no problem with her ex husband's sister's kid moving in with them out of the blue. They worked up a plan with the new school district and got Derek into family therapy to work through his issues, and over the last couple of years he has been very stable and his grades and outlook have improved immensely. He has stated that he hates his mom for what she's done and he wants to live with my sister forever.    Things were going well until about 2 months ago. Nancy has been in and out of rehab for years, and she is currently living in a halfway house. She called my sister to demand that she bring Derek down to the Twin Cities (about a 6 hour drive from where my sister lives) because she wanted Derek to stay with her for the summer. My sister said no, for every reason. Nancy is living in a halfway house, Nancy is not sober, Nancy does not have a job. Derek is doing well, he is stable and he is happy with my sister. Nancy then threatened my sister and said she would be taking Derek back full time unless my sister drove him to the Twin Cities every weekend for visitation. My sister can't do that, it's a huge cost, it's a huge amount of time, and most importantly, Derek doesn't want to see his mom.    She is currently waiting on her approval for foster care status, but that takes time. She doesn't have any legal rights over Derek, but his entire extended family 100% agrees that the best place for him is with my sister. What options does she have to make sure that Nancy doesn't follow through with her threat? Everyone is sure that *eventually* Derek will still end up with my sister, but that could take time, and Nancy is so unstable that my sister worries for his well being, even being with Nancy for a short amount of time. She's feeling very frantic and stressed and she doesn't know who to talk to or where to go to make sure this doesn't happen.	Yes
Tx- my husband is telling me that in the next 45 mins he is going to kick me out while pregnant and take off with our son and he does not care that I have nowhere to live and no food which I need to maintain nutrition for our child while in the womb...he says he is going to literally drive me somewhere and kick me out of the car and lock the door. I'm so scared, can I call the cops for this or is this legal for him to do?	Yes
 i am 20 years old and decided to take my 2 and five yearold siblings with me to stay in my appartment thats an HR away. I have the mom's permission but not my dad. He is abusive to his wife and are both going through a separation right now. I wanted to take the children out of the tense environment. He wants the kids back and will call the police, what are my rights and options?	Yes
My mom is being pressured by family to sign a POA for her brother who suffers from dementia. He currently is assisted care in Florida. Would she be financially responsible and what are other issues she should know if she decides to sign? Should she seek out a lawyer before doing anything?	Yes
"During the school-year, my mother (Who had moved to Colorado with my sister the year prior, under the false pretense of wanting to be ""around family"" [she actually just wanted to smoke weed legally]) wanted me to spend the summer with her in Colorado. I was very much against this, since both my mother and my sister are massive control freaks and have anger issues. My mother is a touch narcissistic aswell. Even though I had stated multiple times I did *not* want to go down there, my father (and mother) forced me to go there. Are they legally allowed to do this? I know that my mother still has custody, but my father and mother are divorced. Am I allowed to choose where I want to live? My father lives in Minnesota, if that changes anything."	Yes
Legality - Ontario, Canada  Recently found out my estranged father has very likely been lying and severely downplaying his income during mine and my siblings childhood and made measly payments under duress to my mother for years.   He's owned a business and also registered it in at least 2 states in the U.S over the last 10 years as I've learned through research online. I've also found details on the market value of his (more than comfortable) home, as well as some help of friends viewing it who live in the area, and it does NOT align with the income story he was making up for years when I was younger.   Lots of variables and missing pieces but wanted some general advice on if this is worth my time pursuing for back pay as my mother had struggled for years to make ends meet for us. It may be impossible to forge a case as he was doing his own business during my childhood and that info isn't accessible. Where would a lawyer begin into something like this if there's evidence that there was some blatant lying going on?  Anything is greatly appreciated.	Yes
My (now ex)gf assaulted me in our shared apartment in nyc. I recorded it on my iPhone. Are there any laws in New York State preventing me from using it?	Yes
On July 9th, my dad died, it was sudden and although expected was still unexpected.   On July 11th, his wife since 2003 arranged his funeral and service and during that time explained to my brother and I that my dad's 401k was recently being transferred to a new finance company but that the old finance company was saying that they never received the paperwork. She was working the issue between the old and new companies.   On July 15th, we had a service, it was there that she started to freak out about the house because it was not willed to her, it was willed to my brother and I. The home was purchased in 2002 prior to the marriage. She was told us that she was unsure who the executor was during that convo. She also asked that I purchase his truck that had a $10k bank bill in good standing.   On July 17th, I went to the house to drop off the truck I borrowed, her and her adult daughter handed the will to me and told me to read it. It says that the home goes to my brother and I 50/50 and that she is to stay in the home until she dies. No mention of who pays the hoa dues, property tax etc. She was very upset because she only receives $1600 a month through SSD and a stipend from my dad's life insurance. I figured but did not say 'well we'll charge her to live here at whatever the property tax and hoa dues equate too, which would be $750 a month. She now tells me that the 401k has been transferred to the new company but no one will return her calls.   Emotional moment, I give zero shits about any of this stuff. My dad died. But I do want to move through the process and basically get there new normal figured out.   Back to July 17th, she tells me meet that the executor is a close cousin, my dad's niece and wife is unhappy about this because she doesn't believe executor will be fair. I tell her it's a piece of paper and there is really no way to mess around with it. Executor is a fair person, was not given any significant assets in the will, she has zero skin in the game.   Later that evening, wife's daughter calls me and is very upset because the will says that the executor was supposed to arrange the funeral and wife had done it without even inviting or extending courtesy to executor. She is also upset that my brother and I may charge 'rent' to her mom, she feels that my brother and I should pay $330 a month for hoa dues and $4k a year for property taxes. I simply said 'well, I really need to see the 401k distribution to see where I am financially'   July 18th, wife calls me and says we can't charge her to live there, a lawyer says so and she only has to pay hoa dues but we're on the hook for property taxes. I said okay, have you notified executor, she hadn't so I did because this is bullshit.   Executor did not know she was named because wife had told her right after my dad died that wife was. Apparently, my dad had drafted a new will prior to death but it was never signed and she was asking around to family how to get that will invoked, it gave her portion of the house and left items to daughter. I told wife that this will needs to be given to executor so she can begin the process, wife tells me that she has hired a probate lawyer and has been instructed to not give executor the will. She then tells me that the $10k truck bill and $2k credit card will have to paid by executor and that she has gone to the bank and closed out or taken my dad off the checking and savings accounts. She says the physical items left in the will for my brother and I are community property and she doesn't have to hand it over, we're talking about stuff my dad had looooong before he ever this lady and stuff that my family brought over from Italy in 1920 when they became citizens. Still no word on the 401k.   I'm at a fucking loss here. Wtaf.   I'm ready to hire a lawyer for my family because this lady is sneaky as shit.   Like I said, whatever the will says it will be followed, my brother and I don't care. There is an issue with us paying for the property tax though, neither of us can afford it. We both have houses of our own with incredibly high property tax (Yay king county), we both have 2 small kids, I'm not married. We both do alright in life but it's not like we have money lying around wanting to be spent on someone that isn't even a relative.   Can she really live there and my brother and I have to foot the bill? What if she remarries, what if she moves in her jobless daughter, her jobless husband and kid, do you we pay for that too?   Can she really remove the executor just because she doesn't like it? Can she withhold the 401k distribution? Can she really drag this out?  My dad was not a rich man, he lived simple, had a paid off home, some 401k and some things that were important to him. So we aren't talking a million dollars here. To me this is ludicrous.	Yes
Hello everyone, first and foremost thank you for taking the time to read my post, it means a tremendous amount to me. Throwaway for obvious reasons.  I am a 16 year old male living in California, in a household with my mother, stepfather, and younger brothers. I will be a senior this upcoming year in high school.  I have been living with my mother my entire life, parents split when I was younger (not married), and my stepfather moved in a year after.  I have suffered from mental abuse from my stepfather ever since he has moved in, around 10 years ago. It has involved constant bullying, intimidation, aggressive behavior, and abrasive yelling. He is much bigger than I am, and uses this to get up in my face and shout profanity at the slightest mistake or misspoken word. My mother is aware of what has been going on, but does not know of the impact his behavior has had on my life. There have been many attempts with counselors and family members to correct his action, but nothing has changed.  As a result, I suffer from heavy and frequent anxiety, stress, and panic attacks. It is difficult for me to participate in any amount of light arguing with anyone without choking up, tearing up, or cowering away in fear (it takes a lot for me to say that). Any type of confrontation or chance of there being one makes me extremely nervous and panicky. Yelling of any kind also raises my anxiety, which (almost) always ends with me crying. There are other examples of the impact of this abuse. This has affected my relationships in a variety of ways with my family members, friends, and peers, and hinders my day to day life.  When I leave my home for school, a friend's house, etc., I feel much better mentally. But when I return and see my stepfather, everything comes back in a wave. This has created a very unhealthy lifestyle for me.  I have a solid relationship with my father, but he lives across the country. He knows very little of what has occurred.  If you read this far, thank you, and here are my questions:  1. What are my rights living in California at 16 to choose where to live? Am I able to live with other family members at my own consent? It is my final year of high school, so moving into my father's house across the country is a last resort, although it is an available option.  2. Who are people I should get involved to help me? I have many loving family members and friends, but I don't want to drag everyone into a nasty battle.   3. What are my best options/decisions I have or could make to remove myself from my situation?  If there are any questions I could answer to improve your response, feel free to ask. Once again, thank you for reading.	Yes
Hello,   I have recently been looking into getting my last name changed back to my mother's maiden name. However at the same time I am needing to file a small estate affidavit in order to access some of my deceased father's assets.   I was wondering if I should go through the name change first and then file for the small estate or the other way around? If I file the estate first would I have to refile it again under my new name?  Would I have to refile my other paperwork stating my assets under my new name as well? I am scared that changing my name will somehow allow me to lose my heir assets that are underneath my old name.. and I am not sure of the process of getting them transferred over to my new name.  Asking my courthouse questions like these leads to no answers, and I've never hired a lawyer before so I am not sure the costs of filing a small estate or even if there are costs to just asking questions. Any advice is appreciated!	Yes
Me and my daughter were assaulted by my wife and she was charged with assault in the 4th degree and domestic mischief in the 3rd. She was a stay-at-home mother of our 1yr old daughter, but with the protection order I put in place for her own safety, her mother isn't allowed to see her.  I live in Bellevue, WA, and was already living pretty modestly, but it's damn expensive here and considering the immediate legal fees I'm going to have filing for divorce and full custody, I barely had enough to get by BEFORE all this happened.  Daycare centers are $2000/mo, and I already checked don't have any immediate openings, and I haven't been able to find a nanny on care.com for less than $15/hr.  I had a nanny, but it was a friend of my wife was was being paid with the meager income my wife had. She quit abruptly and I can't use my wife's income to pay for another.  I'm trying not to panic, but what can I do? It's going to take me some time to scale back my modest expenses (moving, primarily). I just moved here, so I don't have any friends who could help, and my family is too otherwise obligated and far away to help more than a week or so.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.	Yes
Alright so, my fiancee and I were dating pre turning 18 for me and she is a year younger. Before I turned 18 she got pregnant and now we're lost as what to do. We've been told since I am now 18 I can/will go to jail no matter what if I'm put on the birth certificate right away. So i cant sign it and have my ID so we can take our child home. But she was born on 29 Palms Naval base, and the Operation? was performed by a foreign doctor. Who left back to his home country with all his paperwork and she never had a birth certificate issued. now she would have to file a delayed registration of birth which will most likely take up to 6 months and still then get her idea. Our child will most likeyl be born by then. Any suggestions?	Yes
This is going to be long so thanks for reading in advance  My wife (Canadian) and I got married in Toronto in May 2016. She insisted that we go live with her wealthy family in the middle east in Jordan after we got married. She was already working for her dad and he wanted to keep her from leaving the office so he promised me work and business opportunity. His promises turned to be flat out lies, I realised after 6 months of working for him that he is not going to pay a cent. Furthermore, my wife demanded an expensive wedding, a whole heap of jewellery and a honeymoon that I paid for (approximately 200K total cost). He had discussed wedding expenses with me when we got engaged and he said that he would help, he also said that he would organise the honeymoon and that it would be a surprise for us. He did nothing and it all turned out to be empty talk.   After almost 10 months of living with in laws in the middle east in a country where I had no visa, no work permit, and no driver‚Äôs license. I had enough so I decided to go back to my home country in New Zealand so that I can go back to work, get out of the middle east and start earning a living again. My wife reluctantly joined me and we have been in NZ for almost 3 months. I started a new job and we are living at my family‚Äôs house till we can look at purchasing our own place. I came back from work on Tuesday only to find that all the jewellery is gone, her stuff is gone and she is uncontactable. There were Auckland airport charges on my bank statement on the day that she left. I couldn‚Äôt get hold of her but I managed to speak to her dad who told me that she was depressed in NZ and she is on a plane back to Canada. I tried contacting her but she didn‚Äôt pick up or return my text messages. I knew she was unhappy here but never expected that she would do something like this. We never had an argument, she didn‚Äôt have to do a thing at home as I did the shopping, cooking and laundry. We had a cleaner come in once a week and she just stayed in bed on her laptop watching soaps and going once a week to get her nails done. I never touched or abused her physically or anything like that.   Our total time together as a married couple was 14 months. We don‚Äôt have any kids and its very unlikely that she is pregnant. We mostly lived at her parent‚Äôs place and at my parents for a couple of months. I do own a rental property that is rented as an investment and have some money saved in the bank both of these I bought pre marriage. I earned a total of $2000 dollars from working 2 weeks in NZ while I was with her. She never earned a cent as she just used her dad‚Äôs credit card to shop while we lived in the middle east. She has an apartment in the middle east that her dad bought for us and put it in her name but we only lived in it for 6 weeks before we left to go to NZ.   This is where I need your help reddit, I don‚Äôt know anything about Canadian law or how it works. However I would appreciate it if you can help please. Do you think she can come after my property here, take away my money or make any other demands? She left me last week and she is not willing to communicate. Even if she was depressed after what she did I don‚Äôt think I can ever trust her or get back with her. She is very materialistic, she took all the jewellery even a gold cross that my mum gifted to me when I was 16 for my first communion. For some reason she feels entitled to everything I have yet she never earned a cent as she always worked for her dad. Any suggestions please if there is something I need to do to protect my assets in NZ, I don‚Äôt own anything in Canada and I am not a resident or have any immigration status there.   TL:DR Canadian wife walked out on my after 14 months and may try to fleece me for money (no kids involved). We didn‚Äôt have a family home as we stayed at in laws place mostly and I didn‚Äôt work during this time. Is she entitled to anything? What can I do to protect my assets in New Zealand?	Yes
State is Iowa.  So if my husband is not adhering to the custody Arrangements set forth in the finalized divorce decree and stipulation how many months or weeks or incidents should I document before I seek legal counsel.   I have no desire to work with him directly. I would rather surprise him with a court hearing.	Yes
I am an American married to a Canadian, and the marriage is not working out. A year ago we got married in the state of Ohio and I moved up to Canada with him. He is a Canadian citizen, and I an American citizen with permanent residency in Canada.  I wish to divorce and move my possessions and automobile back to the states. However I have a few questions about what will happen / how to handle the situation.  1. Do we have to divorce in Ohio where we were married, or am I able to file for a divorce at my current residence in Canada?  2. How will the border likely handle me bringing my possessions back into USA? I have a fair amount of goods that would be returning with me. 3. Will this null my permanent residency as I gained it through marriage? 4. What other effects will this possibly bring about?  5: rough estimate of cost?   If anyone has useful information about any of these things I would greatly appreciate it. Cheers!	Yes
This is in Maryland.  Recently, Conover v. Conover came to the top courts here in Maryland, and a lawyer friend advised my family to take advantage of this ruling.  We have a polyamorus triad ( M -F^1 -F^2 ) with 2 children, one biological child per female. (M+F^1 = 1 child, M+F^2 = 1 child).  The lawyer friend hasn't been available recently, due to workload and whatnot, so I can't ask them questions right now.  They emailed me a Baltimore Sun article, and said we should look into it. [This is the article in question.](http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/editorial/bs-ed-de-facto-20160710-story.html)  We have one big question in considering this.  What, exactly, are the benefits to seeking this ruling in our favor?  I'm gathering that it means that custody and visitation is assumed for all parents involved if there's a divorce or dissolving of the the triad.  And I also gather that, if something happens to one of the females and the male, the other female will have custody automatically, without requesting so from the court, since they are the de facto parent to their non-biological child.  I guess I'm asking for clarification about what it's all about, if any of my assumptions are correct, and why it would be in our best interest to do this.  If more details are necessary, I'd be happy to provide them, as I'm not sure what is and isn't relevant.	Yes
Newbie here looking for advice on my current legal situation. I'm a lesbian mom with a 4 year old child from a previous relationship. My wife has been in the picture since my daughter was 10 months. Majority of time is spent with us, bio father lives two hours away and sees her about once a month. All medical, school, etc.. is handled by my wife and I. When we enrolled her in pre-k last year, they required birth certificate and wouldn't let me put my wife as other parent. She is only listed as emergency contact. We have been legally married for almost 2 years. Question is, how do I go out about making my wife her legal parent/ guardian, without stripping any rights from bio dad? I know it bothers her that she doesn't have the same legal rights as him even tho she is a provider.. note that she is listed as other parent on all medical forms, never had issue until school. Daughter had surgery at 2 years old.. she was able to be there and sign all forms with no issues. Frustrated, just want her have the legal rights she deserves. Please help and sorry for the ramble.. thanks!	Yes
Hello. I live in Virginia and I'm recently separated from my spouse. I'm in the house and will be paying for all utilities and mortgage starting In September. Our son went to private school for the first time last year. With separation and pending divorce it's not feasible to continue to pay for private school and also drive 30mins each way to pick him up(majority of the pick ups would be me doing them due to my schedule). I told my former spouse I was not going to pay for schooling and she said she wouldn't consent or sign to have him transferred to the school right by my house(great public school, he has friends here, and bus stop is in front of my house). We haven't established primary custody because it will be 50/50. However she doesn't have a babysitter while I do. She also wouldn't be able to provide him with transportation every day at the private school.  Do I need her written consent to transfer his school?	Yes
I love and support my husband, despite the betrayal I feel after 13 years together (married 10) and 3 children.   Many problems arose in our marriage due to the secret he kept (I know it wasn't malicious, but still). The secret  caused me many tearful nights and physical stress, because he was generally critical, in bad moods, short with me.   My question is based on the 1 year separation clause that is required before divorce. There is zero chance of reconciliation, as he is not into women AT All.   Can I claim mental cruelty in this case? I feel that society has been cruel to him, but hiding this from me all these years has been cruel to me. Please see my posting history if you would like more background.	Yes
...just tell the judge that he is a roommate so it doesn't eliminate your spousal maintenance. Divorce is not yet finalized and obviously this would be a sticking point for the final decree (going in a few days).  What do I need to prove that he is a paramour and not just a roommate? What can I submit in the future to have spousal maintenance reduced/eliminated once this happens, assuming it happens after the final decree is submitted and approved?	Yes
My wife filed for assistance when my son was born. I didn't know I had I son, two years later I received a letter to be DNA swabbed at DFS, which I obliged . Even before the results were in I knew he was mine so I contacted my wife and we got married 12 years later, present day, I get called into HR and was told there was a order for back child support to garnish my wages. Look at the paperwork and my son's name is on it. WTF! I've raised this kid and I owe child support. Apparently the case was never properly closed. My question is what is fastest way to resolve this and if any is there any recourse for the state fucking up?	Yes
How can my wife, who was arrested nine days ago for assault against me while I was holding our daughter, get an ex parte judge to quash my protection order keeping my daughter safe and protected and enforce a temporary visitation arrangement that only gives me every other weekend and one night a week until the family court hears my case? How is this reasonable in any way, considering her assault charge? Washington State, btw.	Yes
Located in Oregon. Over a year ago I tried to file a restraining order against an ex boyfriend I had recently dumped. I'm going to try to recall exactly what info I gave before, and update on what's progressed since then -- it was denied last time, and I'm pregnant and expecting a daughter, and given his highly inappropriate behavior towards me I want to keep my family safe from him. I have moved twice since then as well.    I also want to state up front I will reference him harassing me on social media a lot -- I want to say I have changed my name multiple times on mediums I can not afford to delete (work purposes), I have made new social media platforms and blocked all his known accounts on all of them and have tweaked all privacy settings to the max. I have *no* public social media any more, strictly reviewed friends lists on all of them, etc. I can't get rid of things like my work email address and he's utilized those too -- like I said, I block him, but he uses different and new accounts to contact me so there's nothing I can do but avoid them. He still finds ways to contact me persistently by making new accounts and tracking my new social media accounts down through known friends and family . For work purposes I kind of have to have the basics like twitter/FB/instagram, but all are privacy locked within an inch of their life and not connected to one another.      This ex was super emotionally abusive to me -- controlling, manipulative, tried to tell me I *couldn't* break up with him, threatening self harm and suicide when he didn't get his way, pressuring me into sex stuff I wasn't comfortable with or into snorting adderal (something I did not like and have never done since.) After months of emotional abuse, it escalated to what I told the court about: He screamed and berated me for about 18 hours while refusing to let me leave my apartment or call anyone, and kept me silent by threatening to tell the police I had marijuana in my possession if I screamed or anything. He threw things at me during this time, told me I was a piece of shit and to kill myself and that I was worthless. I begged him to leave and offered him money for a cab, for a hotel, for gas, anything, and he wouldn't go. He also eventually implied if I had sex with him he'd be on his way, so I did that willingly but not because I wanted to, but I was too scared to tell the police that, or about the pressures to do drugs in the past.     I also told the court that for months following he's been making new accounts and contacting me-- telling me I'm being immature and to talk to him sometimes, other times just adding me with no message at all. I told him repeatedly to stop because he was upsetting and gas lighting me and he just flat out won't. When I tried to file a restraining order, they told me he didn't pose a real threat to me so like sorry he makes you sad but suck it up.    Smash cut to a year later after that rejection. 5 months ago, he found and added a new comment to a BDSM 'contract' he had us make together while we were dating, telling me it was fucking good work and that he was going to use it with his new dom. I told him clearly again to never contact me and to fuck off. He does. Until a few days ago, when he adds me on a new Instagram account, featuring him wearing his fetishwear of choice, womens clothing. The creepiest thing?? In the past week, he's posted photos *I * took of him, or that he took wearing my girly clothing, or in my apartment from years ago while we were dating. He added me. I used the messenger feature and told him he was being gross and to delete the pictures. He basically said they 'mean a lot to him' but that he will (I checked today -- they're still up. Ew.) He also claimed he didn't search out my account, that he 'added all of his contacts' (on his fetish account? sure. Also, I checked, he has 0 new followers /followees, so bullllllshittttt.)     He has stuff on me that would ruin my life it it came out so I can't publicly out his account, as satisfying as it would be. I still rely on my parents for financial and emotional support and he knows things and has evidence of things that I dont want to explain , but that would effectively make them cut me off immediately in every way.    I have been trying to record all interaction we have, and tell people close to me every time it happens . I want to try to file another restraining order -- is there a point, or am I going to get the same hand-wavey answer as before? Should I send a cease + desist? Will that do anything, and how do I do that? I can't afford a lawyer.     I know I sound pathetic and poor and whatever, I just really would like some answers and to not be told I'm overreacting. Thank you.	Yes
I've filed for uncontested divorce/irreconcilable differences and I am scheduled for my first case management conference later in August. I have been wanting to leave the marital home but my lawyer says I can not leave unless my ex-spouse (who still lives with me because I can not leave) signs a consent order. I am trying to put the house for sale but my ex-spouse refuses (house is titled in:both of our names). I don't know what to follow anymore and feel my lawyer is trying to get money from me.	Yes
My grandma passed away two years ago and left everyone in my family a couple thousand of dollars though her insurance and it was supposed to be given to us when we turned 18 but someone in my family took mine out and won't give me the money since I recently turned 18 is there anything I can do ? Maybe sue him or something ? 	Yes
Edit: Please read the entire thing before passing judgement  Hello, yesterday I was arrested for child endangerment because I took the keys out of the vehicle so we could stop arguing and to make sure I didn't go to jail for domestic abuse. (I was really pissed, it's a long story) yes, it was hot, but my wife was in the vehicle supervising my son. There was no harm to my son, this all happened in 5 minutes give or take. I got back in the vehicle, and offered her the keys, she told me to get out, so I got back out, and was then arrested for child endangerment. I looked at what the statutes are and my son was never unsupervised, and wasn't hurt in any way. (Less than 5 minutes in a vehicle, the AC had been going for a while, and at any time my wife could have taken my son out of the car) and I'm curious why I was arrested?	Yes
My girlfriend was first hit by her mother for disrespectful behavior keep in mind they are vietnamese immigrants to the United states. Her brother previously hit her for lying, he smashed her phone and hit her with a large stick on the butt until it was horribly bruised. He grabbed her arm leaving bruises and shoved her. The family encourages this type of discipline. Is there anything that can be done to help her like going to stay somewhere besides her home like a friend's house?	Yes
Hello!   My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force.   Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	Yes
Location: Alabama  My ex just served me with court papers saying I owe her $15k in back child support. I got hurt on the job several years ago and she knows I can't pay. She's just upset that I am filing for full custody and so now she's trying to get back at me. I just got a part time job a couple of months ago but didn't work for years trying to get disability.   Can the judge make me pay or send me to jail when I haven't even been working all this time? The child support was set when I had a job but that was in 2010. What happens if I can't pay? 	Yes
I have a friend who has been staying at another friends house for nearly two months now. His mother was manipulative and he lived in unsanitary conditions, so he came nearby to live and prepare for college in a more quiet environment where he can be supported. His mother has been upset with him but recently threatened to call the police and call him as a runaway, as he did not leave with full permission. He does not want to return, if he turns 18 and she calls the police, will they do anything?  Or, if he accepts her buying a plane ticket now, but is booked after his birthday, would there still be legal referendums for either my possible runaway friend, or my friend who can be accused of harboring him, if he decides not to go, and she still calls the police on him despite him being over 18 now?	Yes
"My mother is in her late 80s and her husband (my dad) died recently. My mom has dementia, which has worsened gradually over the last 3 years. During this time my mother and sister have blocked any attempt by my father and I for them, now only her, to move into a senior or assisted living environment.  Ok, so now my mom is a nutty, but tiny congenial woman who is living is the past and also some alternative weirdly twisted related universes.  I'm terrified at how vulnerable she is, physically (!!!) and financially.   Add to the mix, my sister (who has multiple mental heath issues) is now handling ""mother"" but is not  sharing any documentation or information regarding our father's estate, taxes, and/or our mother's health or financial situation.    I don't know whether her lack of transparency is due to my sister's complete inability to deal with any level of personal responsibility, change, or conflict or whether she's being sketchy. Our parents had many toys and lifestyle advantages my sister and her husband could not afford, and would lose access to it if our mother's lifestyle was simplified due to her dementia and our dad's death.  Add to the mix, I live out of town and came very close to dying myself recently and though my recovery is positive, it will be protracted. I'm not really up for a big legal fight. I'd like to avoid the ugly legal situation of having my mother declared legally incompetent, fighting my sister for guardianship, reporting mom's case to public trustee, etc...  My wife is fine with moving my mother into our house, wrapping her into our lifestyle, and completely footing the bill, but stipulates that we need to freeze my mom's credit and protect her assets from exploitation. She absolutely doesn't trust my sister or her husband. My wife has been very honest, that although my parents have never been there for us, because she loves and respects me and my moral code and obligation,  will back me on how I deal with my family.   How reasonable is it to freeze my mother's assets/debit without getting into a big legal mess?"	Yes
"Hello! 21 year old girl here. I was assaulted by my ex-boyfriend at least 4 times in a single night. Went to the police and told them everything. In my ptsd therapy, I'm beginning to remember incidents that built up to the March event.  I've been trying to contact the police officer who documented everything, but sometimes it takes a while to hear back.   In the mean time, we wait for the legal proceedings. Its been months. I will testify to a grand jury, and one thing has been bugging me.   So much happened that night, but there were so much more that happened in the months that built to that. On the spot, I don't think i'll be able to remember all those details. Its been hard enough recalling them after my physical and mental state left the ""survival"" fight-or-flight response mode. Will I be allowed a paper full of notes into the court room? I left out a lot of details in the Restraining Order hearing, simply because i forgot a lot of stuff. The hearing was only a few weeks after the assaults.   I would do much better if I had notes with me, but is that even allowed? I've never been a victim in a criminal case before, much less a victim of domestic violence."	Yes
My father left when I was young and never paid any child support after the split. He has reached a debt of about $50,000 and is somewhere in Georgia or South Carolina. I still have a way of contact and could find him if need be. Being in college, I could really use this money he owes me to pay the bills and make a down payment on a house after graduation. My mom won't pursue the issue herself, despite him using my sister's social to rent homes only to not pay on them. What can I do to begin receiving payments or put him in jail? Thanks Reddit.	Yes
One of my best friends with two children is currently going through a divorce but her husband is basically making her wait out till she runs out of money. He took all of the cash before she could get any from their joint account. He got his own apartment when she told him to leave, he left her with the girls and will only see them once a week for a few hours when he chooses. He already hired a lawyer and will not provide her any money for child support. He is basically holding out knowing that her job will not support her and the two children. He was very abusive before she finally kicked him out. I've been trying to help financially as much as I can but I know it's going to get worse. Does anyone have any recommendations? She cannot afford an expensive lawyer and the ones she's called all expect lots of money. I know his lawyer is holding out to make as much money as possible but any help now will be great. I honestly just want any options for her because he keeps making threats that his lawyer will make sure she doesn't get any money and that he will get full custody even though he never watched them and multiple times he left them unattended and would choose to sleep or game instead.	Yes
Posting for a friend since she doesn't fully understand Reddit. My friend is from Mississippi and struggling with depression and a recent suicide attempt. In an attempt to help herself and get better, she made an agreement (not in writing) with her mother and stepfather that they would look after her child, while she moved temporarily to Alabama to live with her father while she's working.  Recently she drove back to Mississippi to visit her child but her mother wouldn't allow her to see her child. An incident occurred where the police were called and she was told they couldn't keep her from the child, and if she needed them to they could go get her child for her. She elected not to do this because she felt it would traumatic to the child. She went back to Alabama without seeing her child.  Today, her mother emailed her father [this](http://imgur.com/a/qfvW8) and told him to print out page 6, have her sign it and get it notarized and then faxed back to her mother. My friend was not given the rest of the document until she pressed for it. Now her mother is telling her to sign and notarize the document and if she tries to take the child from them, she'll never see him again. She has text messages of this.  So what should my friend do? I told her to cease communication with her mother until she gets a lawyer and have all correspondence be between the lawyers. But she says she can't afford a lawyer and her mother knows that. Apparently her mother has hired one of the best in the state or something. I've linked her to lawhelp.com. She has not signed the affidavit, and refuses to. But she is scared that her mother and stepfather are trying to take her child away from her. What legal recourse does she have? Please feel free to ask questions and I'll try to respond in a timely manner to clarify anything.	Yes
"Good evening, /r/legaladvice.  I am a 21yo college student currently residing in Washington state. After reading some comments out of this morning's [AskReddit post](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/6ohltk/serious_family_court_laywers_whats_the_most_petty/) about petty parental behavior in family court, I realized that I may be nearing a legal issue of my own.  I am using a throwaway to isolate my financial information from my main Reddit accounts.  -----------  My parents have been married since before I was born. Around the time I was born (or within a couple of years after), my parents set up a UGMA money-market account in my name through `BankA`. (I believe my mother was listed as the account's custodian, but my father may have been included as well - I am currently unsure.) While I was still a minor, money was deposited into this account - usually birthday gifts from extended family, excess chore allowance, recurring monthly deposits from my parents, etc.   By the time I turned 18, the account had accrued a balance of approximately $12,000. As I was within a few months of graduating high school and heading off to college, my parents and I decided to leave the account as-is for the time being.   As I had/have scholarships covering tuition, fees, and most of my housing, my parents paid the remaining amount for the first year out-of-pocket, leaving the account untouched. By the end of the first year, I was gainfully employed and able to live on my own in a more-or-less financially independent fashion (sparing family-wide accounts for convenience such as my health insurance and cell service) from there on out.   After the end of my first year of college, `BankA` announced it was ending its money-market account program, with services being transferred to `BankB`. As the two of us were unsure whether I would have the ability to manage a money-market account in the event of an emergency, my mother and I agreed to open a new joint money-market account between us. My mother (with my consent) opened a new money-market account with `BankB`, transferred the balance into the new account, and closed the account with `BankA`. The new account has remained untouched by the two of us since - the only deposits have been interest payments. My mother has previously stated she will remove herself from the account at my request when I feel the time is right. (Granted, this was a verbal agreement, but I trust her word on this.)  My intent for this account was to, at some point or another, take control of this account by requesting my mother remove herself as signatory and doing one of the following:  * Migrate my direct-deposits (payroll, tuition reimbursement, etc.) to the account, transfer the majority (approximately $30-$35,000) of my checking account with `BigBankC`  into it, and begin using the account as a general savings account. * Drain the account and the checking account with `BigBankC` into a savings account opened with `CreditUnionD` (opened as part of me signing up for my first credit card and currently sitting unused) and close the account with `BankB`.  As I simply haven't had time to do so, I planned on doing one of the above shortly after graduating from college in the spring of next year.   Unfortunately, I have recently learned that my parents will likely be filing for divorce before I graduate. While the divorce isn't a surprise to anyone in the family (my parents have had marital issues for most of my life), my mother previously stated that she planned to wait until after I graduate and her three children - were ready to fully ""leave the nest"" as it were. (For context, my brother and I are both biological children of the marriage, my sister adopted from my mother's late sister)  My mother has confided in me that, when her and my father have discussed divorce, he asked her to inventory and estimate value of her quilting supplies for consideration in dividing up shared property. (My mother and father both have their hobbies, each having a modest amount of property associated with them.) My father and I get along to some extent, but I believed him to be a man of better character than this. While I don't believe he will go after the joint account due to my mother being attached to it, I would like to make sure he has no legal standing to do so whatsoever should the divorce turn ugly.  ------------  All of that being said, I have several questions that I am hoping someone from /r/legaladvice can provide insight on:  * Is the joint money-market account with `BankB` at risk of being dragged into divorce proceedings because of my mother being listed as a signatory? * If my father does stoop low enough to claim the account is marital property, what can I expect to happen with the `BankB` account during the divorce proceedings? * Is there anything I can/should do to protect the account with `BankB` and its contents? Some actions that come to mind are:      * Removing my mother as a signatory earlier than planned     * Having both parents sign an affidavit stating my mother is a signatory for emergency/administrative purposes only and that the money is not and never has been hers (I will be traveling back home for Thanksgiving and could probably convince the two to sign one then)     * Considering the account as ""tainted"" and draining/closing it altogether  I have not discussed my concerns with either parent or a lawyer at this time. My university does have a a lawyer on retainer for students to talk to, but I don't believe he's well-versed in marital/divorce law. I know my mother has privately reached out to at least one divorce lawyer already, but as a young adult who hasn't had much experience with US civil courts (or any part of the legal system, for that matter) I'm unsure of whether or not I should be contacting them.  Thanks, everyone."	Yes
In Virginia (VA)  My coworker has a younger brother (we will call him Bob) that has gotten involved with a woman (we will call her Laura) who is separated but the divorce is not yet final.  She has another child with her ex that lives with them as well.  Laura still sees the ex twice a week.  Apparently Bob can't be put on the birth certificate (I think this is a good thing)  because she is still married to someone else.  Laura and Bob are living with Bob's parents,with the toddler, and she is now pregnant.  We don't 100% know that the child is his.  What should he be doing (and not do) between now and the birth, and after to ensure he is not on the hook for child support for another man's child, if it is not in fact his, until he can verify paternity?	Yes
What actions can she take? I tried looking up resources, but it seems like it's either the family court or calling the police. She's terrified for her life. Her mother doesn't have enough money to leave the situation.	Yes
(This is in Indiana)     So, my dad passed last April, and he was in talks for disability. After he passed I received mail from the Social Security office that I was able to receive his back benefits because he had been accepted prior to his death.     Now, I've filled out all manner of legal documentation, medical records, release forms, you name it, all addressed to me, courtesy of or on behalf of my father. Court is next week and the SSA is saying they need proof of kinship. I do not have the slightest idea where to look, as he's not on my birth certificate, and my (his) lawyer isn't exactly giving me great ideas. He had no will, nor any paperwork bequeathing anything to me, but after he passed I signed his estate over to my uncle because he's way smarter than I am and didn't, and still don't, have any idea how to deal with that.    What would work as proof of kinship?	Yes
I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit for this, but I wanted to get some additional info to look into about how to handle my current situation.  I live in Louisiana, if that makes a difference.  So, my mom's power of attorney is spending copious amount of money on herself and has had my mom put her second house in her name. I also know she's opened up several CD accounts, POD.  She also verbally and emotionally abuses my mom.  I was taking care of mom for 3 years, one of which was after mom's POA had been appointed, because she always had an excuse not to come down and do her job as caregiver, and I didn't wanna leave mom alone when she needed 24/7 supervision, and no one else in the family wamted to help, they would just shame me for wanting a break and saw that as me not caring about mom, even though they themselves did little to nothing to help.  So I have 2 questions:  1) Can a POA spend money on themselves? Would I be able to stop this POA from taking advantage of my mom just by having APS or legal aid investigate her paper trail? (They would not be disappointed if she is not allowed to spend money on herself- credit card bill has gone up from $2k/month when i was taking care of her, to $4k- $5k per month alone.... and all purchases are recorded by the credit card company, so thibgs like handbags, clothes, beauty products, a fuckton of junk food, hubdreds of dollars worth of food in general, whereas she took cobtrol of finances from a different city with her POA and would only send us $300 for the 2 of us to eat and get around per month, and even when she was out of state there were hundreds more than that spent on food, and she was living by herself across the state.... used mom's money to pay movers to move in, mom's money for the notary to get house transferred to her name, to be filed upon death, etc, etc.)  2) How can I protect myself from having the tables turned on me if I take mom's current POA to court? Because POA would definitely try to do this, as she has already projected all of her misgivings onto me to avoid responsibility for her actions and to threaten/shame/gaslight me into not holding her accountable... To elaborate:  Back when I was 18 (am now 21), the only option I thought I had to take care of mom's finances was to do stuff for her- including using her card for purchases and forging her signature for checks. It was mostly the essentials, but she was still of sound mind at first, and she would agree to give me living expenses, and also paid for me to go to driving school for practical reasons, as well as college, because neither of us knew my college fund information yet so I couldn't tap into that for college. I would also buy us, sometimes just me, fast food occasionally, always with permission.  As her Alzheimer's got worse, I saw that she didn't know what she was agreeing to anymore and stopped spending more than the bare essentials on myself, as I was living in-home with her and we both needed to eat and have gas, but that's all I'd spend money on in order to not take advantage. I'm worried, because it took me a while to learn how to budget and curb fast food impulses so there is a bit of money wasted on that while I learned how to grow the fuck up.  I'm worried this'll come back to bite me in the ass, even though she knew what she agree to pay for at the time.... but it's still he said she said and fact is that I used someone else's card at odd hours of the night occasionally until I started getting my health in check, losing weight, and working out for both our sakes(needed the energy).  I'm still going to pursue legal action, I just want to know everyone's thoughts on the steps I can take to protect my mom and myself, because the last thing I want is for mom to be at POA's mercy without even me as a buffer if POA manages to send me to jail or something...	Yes
Im Located in Florida, USA. Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old.   My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.   I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.    My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.   This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.   I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!     tl/dr: ex wife keeps winning custody battle even though she knowingly is filling false accusations	Yes
"Location Ohio  I have a friend(45 years old) that has a 16 year old daughter with a woman(42). He is not on the birth certificate, but has accepted financial responsibility for the past 16 years through child support payments and has been granted limited rights. ie 2 weekends a months and some holidays. The daughter and her father have a great relationship as in amazing relationship. The mother and daughter have a very strained relationship.  Part 1: Well it turns out, that he is potentially not the father. The supposed bio dad has shown up and apparently did a DNA test without a court order, but at a known medical facility, with the bio dad, daughter and mother present and ""claims"" the DNA test matches the supposed bio dad. No proof has been submitted to the court. Although the mother claims that the bio dad intends on fighting for his rights.  What could possibly happen to my friends relationship with his daughter. He's worried that he will lose his rights to spend time with her.  Part 2: My friend claims to now have proof that the mother defrauded my friend this whole time and knew that my friend was not the father, but allowed my friend to believe that he was the father because he is financially well off. At this time the Bio dad is MORE well off than my friend so now the mother is trying to get the Bio dad established as the ""father"".  Are there any options that you can explore if you have been tricked into supporting a child that is not yours, without jeopardizing any rights to that child.  Part 3: My friend wants to buy his daughter, now 16 a car, keep it in his name, pay the insurance and allow her to drive it.  Could the mother take away the car, not allow her to drive it and more importantly call the law if the daughter drove this car to my friends house, outside of the court ordered visitation?  TY =)"	Yes
Throwaway, just in case.  My wife has joint custody of her kids.  We live in another state, so their father has them for the majority of the time.  He travels for his job some times and she will go back to stay with the kids to keep them in school whike he travels for a week or more at a time.  Recently, he decided to move and sold his house.  They, he and the kids, currently live in a camper with no running water and only a generator for electricity.  The kids are taking showers at the Y and he said the can shower at school once it starts back.  He plans to dig a well, but it has been over a month and he hasnt even has someone come out to look for a site to drill.  He had been talking about sending the kids to live with us.  Nothing definite, but with the way things are going, we figured it would be for the school year.    Last night he said he was not going to let the kids come live with us.  I believe he pulled this last night because she was taking the kids to visit family today and he is leaving to travel  for work before she would be back.  Very passive aggressive.  He wont be able to appear in front of a judge because he will be travelling, so if a hearing is required, it will have to be delayed until he returns near the end of the month.    My wife is going to talk to her attorney there.  What can we expect, as she is going to be asking for emergency (lack of a better word there) 100% custody until their father has a place other than a camper with a generator.    As a note: both kids are teenagers and want to live with us.  They were 5 or 6 when the divorce happened.  I know some states take this into account, but it is not relevant to the issue of living conditions.	Yes
My ex and I have 50/50 custody. We both have to agree on anything related to education or else take it to mediation. Our kids go to private school. He has remarried and now has 2 step kids. He recently was fired. Our divorce paperwork stipulates that our children will attend X school. He said he cannot afford to send them there since he lost his job. I told him I would pay for X school. He said no and that he intends to enroll them in school in his district regardless of what the court order says. He said he wants both our kids and his step kids in the same school, and since he can't afford tuition for step kids, all of the children will go to the school in his district. Can he be held in contempt? Will a judge allow them to be pulled out of X school to keep our kids in the same school as his step kids? HELP!	Yes
Asking for a good friend who works with me-   He has 2 younger children with a lady in Maine now he's living in ny. She's on drugs and he wants full custody, he just got off the phone with a lawyer who quoted him 5k upfront and who knows how much total. Is this cost a necessary thing? He doesn't mind doing whatever leg work is required but he's not really good for that amount. Just looking for some advice in his situation. The mother has never been arrested or anything like that	Yes
"Let me start out by saying that I very much would never leave him alone while I ran an errand. Or went into a store. I just stepped out at the mail slot to grab the mail.   He is 6. He can open a door. It wasn't hot. Both doors are open. He is in a seat that he can get in and out of with ease (He puts himself in, in the mornings and takes himself out).   We live in an apartment complex and it has a roundabout, curve thing where you get the mail with no parking spots so people drive up, stop their car for a second, get out, grab the mail from the slot and jump back in.   I pulled up, turned off my car, got out and went around and opened the door on his side. He was playing his tablet so I just left his door open and stepped up on a curb where the mail slot is (maybe a foot away or two) and grabbed the mail in our slot and walked back to the car. The whole exchange took maybe 15 to 20 seconds. I even left my drivers side door open. So two doors were open.   During that time one of the other residents drove by and got her mail  and saw this and reported me to both the office (who said there isn't anything they could or would do) and called me into the police. She wasn't on the phone when I left. But my door was wide open where you could obviously she a 6 year old and no one else. But I didn't stay and chat. I was there just a few seconds.   No officer came by or stopped by. We were home about 1 minute later.   I actually didn't even know anyone called. I found out when the person left a note on my door saying she had my license plate number and had called it in. I also got a call from the office saying someone had reported me for leaving my ""baby"" in the car. They just wanted to follow up.   My ""baby"" is just a month shy of his 6th birthday.   I haven't gotten a call from the police.   What do I do? Do I call them? Are they just going to show up and talk to me one day? Do I have to worry about an arrest here? Losing my kid?"	Yes
it's a little complicated but my fianc√© has had his 16 year old son full time since pretty much right after birth. his ex-wife/child's biological mother gave him full custody, didn't battle it, and signed the papers from a lawyer in Kentucky.   the original divorce agreement has her agreeing to place money into a savings account for him and she never did.   Since 2010 his father and I moved with him (and her approval) to Ohio for better job and education opportunities.  She only sees him about 3 times a year, and doesn't really express any interest in him.    After the move we came to a verbal agreement (nothing in writing other than text messages) for her to chip in $150 a month to help him with school fees, health insurance and whatnot.  we had spoken about her eventually chipping in for car insurance and whatnot as well with a verbal agreement.   she's had some rough months (she's not the most dependable) and my fianc√© doesn't really push it, but with his junior year of high school approaching she's stopped helping her son out. she's moved to Atlanta. Myself and my fianc√© can afford our son, but his increasing fees for college, car and activities are becoming a strain since he wants to do more than what our means allow us to do at this time.   i know it's all on legally shaky ground since we have nothing in writing other than the divorce agreement. i'm just trying to figure out the best path for my son and my fianc√©. i really do appreciate it.	Yes
"My wife and step son have been given injunctions from his ex-fiance in a malicious manner. He was served first and we just worked out how to get him out of the house he owns with her. He was the one seeking legal advice from officers because she was being violent and destructive. Officer told him there wasn't really anything that could be done since she also owned the house. In response to the officer contacting the ex, she filed an injunction and won, taking away some of his rights and putting it on his record. After the injunction the ex was attempting to contact my wife and not leaving her alone, so my wife filed for an injunction against her. In the interest of trying to never acknowledge the ex again, my wife did not go to the hearing. In response, the ex filed an injunction on my wife. What is worse is the ex works for my wife's pain management doctor. Between that and the ex knowing how much the two are into owning guns and going to the range, this is clearly malicious. She is constantly telling lies to persuade the judge to grant these injunctions. I feel like the judge(s) would pass any and every injunction presented to them at this point.   What I am asking is will legal action be worth pursuing?   I left out a lot of detail for simplicity but I think I have touched on the main points. What this woman is doing is one of those things where you say ""there ought to be a law against this."" I found Malicious prosecution at the top of my Google search but am not sure if that applies here. From my point of view she is definitely abusing the system to cause harm. Location is Florida. Any advice would be appreciated."	Yes
Hi! Will like to seek advice on the above issue. My husband was diagnosed and warded for clinical depression and anxiety 2 months ago and remained uncontactable since.   From what I heard is that he has been staying with his parents and has been working since the day he was discharged from the psychiatric ward.   One of the last things he said to me was that he is not able to look after our 9 months old baby both physically and financially then became uncontactable.   May I know how long should I wait before seeking legal advice for maintenance? 	Yes
Long story short -  I'm 17 years old, the other day when i got home from chilling with some friends, i saw my step dad (who is an abusive alcoholic towards my mom and 4yr old sister) hitting my sister extremely hard, slapping her face and screaming at her because she peed herself, as well as punching my mom in the eye when she tried to intervene. I've known for a long time that he has been abusive but this is the first time i witnessed it firsthand. I pulled him off of my sister and kept punching him in the face until i got him on the floor, where i grabbed his head and kept hitting it against the ground as hard as i could until my mom, neighbour, and sister pulled me off of him. He was unconscious after that.   Seeing him hurt my mother and sister like this made my blood boil beyond belief. I have never felt such rage before, it was like i couldn't control myself. My friend said i was acting in their defense.	Yes
"A few days ago, my dad received a letter from some legal advice company (not an official court summons) that said that they could help with his case of domestic violence and a restraining order against him. We looked up the case number included in the letter, and it indeed did have his name on it, and that he's being sued for domestic violence by some woman that he claims he's never met. I do believe my father 100%, since he's never raised a hand against my mother or my siblings and I for as long as I can remember. (Though I am open to the possibility that he may be lying, but I really doubt that.)  We're not sure if this is a real fraudulent case against my father, or if this is a mistake that this legal advice company made. What we do know is that there's a court hearing a few weeks from now and that this was filed in the city that we live in. As of now, we don't have any official documents from the court letting him know that he's being sued. My hope is that this is all a huge misunderstanding.   Main thing that worries us is that my dad has just started the naturalization process to become a US citizen, and that this ""lawsuit"" could have a negative impact on that.   Regardless, we are going down to the courthouse later this week to make sure."	Yes
-This is in Arizona  When we first got divorced 6 months ago the child support order stated that although the amount on the child support worksheet was $1400, child support payments should only be $800 as to not put unnecessary burden on me financially.  Now, 6 months later, she wants to change that and filed to modify child support for the full amount.   Given that it has only been 6 months, and there have been no changes to income or medical or anything, is it worth requesting a hearing to avoid the increase, or is there nothing I can do?  Any options? Thank you for your help.	Yes
"My son's mother spent 2014 incarcerated, she only saw our son in January that year. In 2015, she filed her federal 2014 tax return claiming him and that she ""cared for him more than 6 months that year"". In addition to that, I have a Court Order from 2014 very specifically assigning me all physical custody, all legal decision making and rights to the EITC. Recently, her parental rights were terminated because she doesn't contact him. Now that Court is over (I handled custody, termination and adoption pro-se), I have the time to pursue the EITC issue. In speaking to a tax attorney, if I refile my 2014 claiming my son and showing proof she couldn't claim him, there's a significant chance they will prosecute because of the *clear* violation of federal tax rules (i.e. the fraud was intentional).   Would it be considered ""blackmail"" to send her an email telling her that if she doesn't agree to repay my son his EITC at $100 per month (for 10 months) that I will refile my taxes, causing her to be investigated for fraud?  I wanted to give her the opportunity to handle it without being indicted on federal tax fraud charges but am thinking twice because I'm afraid this might be considered blackmail. The law is pretty vague (to me)."	Yes
My 16 year old daughter is pregnant and I refuse to support her child, period.   She doesn't want to be emancipated, but I don't want to support her lifestyle anymore. I want her gone. I know I sound like a monster but I can't take this, I will off myself before I support her anymore.   (Drugs,sex, sneaking out, stealing from me etc...) I am a single parent, Father, mother is deceased.	Yes
My uncle (54) is a severe alcoholic, and he's had this problem for many years. A family therapist has told us not to enable his drinking, so when he checked himself out of rehab against doctor's orders, my grandfather (80's) would not go to pick him up. My uncle paid another patient who was getting discharged that day to take him to get his car, and he went straight to grandma and grandpa's house to confront them. They would not let him inside the house, so he spent the entire night drinking vodka in their front yard. In the morning my grandma had to go to a doctor's appointment. As soon as the garage door was opened, my uncle attacked grandpa, shoving him up against the wall and screaming in his face. Grandma and grandpa got in their car and fled. Uncle searched until he found the spare key and let himself into the house. He has been there ever since.  My grandparents were too scared to go home, so they went to their lake cabin in another city. Uncle refuses to leave their house and is just in there drinking and eating all their food. This has been going on for over a week now. I told my grandparents that I wanted to call an elder abuse hotline or the police to get my uncle out of their home. My grandma screamed at me that I had better not do that, and that she will just tell the cops that he is allowed to be there and that he didn't hit anyone. She says she will not ruin his life.  Obviously, this situation can not go on like this but I am at a loss what to do. Do we really have no legal recourse if grandma lies to the police?  Are there any resources for people in our position?	Yes
Hi,  Thanks for reading.  So my girlfriend's mom (M) has a very tumultuous personal life that has resulted in 4 marriages. My girlfriend (A) who is now 26 years old, is the daughter of husband 1. During marriage number two, M had a daughter (T) in Virginia and shortly thereafter, left husband 2 (H2) for husband 3. According to A, H2 was an abusive prick. M is now on husband 4 and travels back and forth between Virginia, Russia, and California.   A cares a lot for T who is now 13 years old. M and H2 hate each other, and their hatred plays out in the courtroom with T as their favorite game piece. At various points, both parents have instructed her to lie on their behalf, both parents have said damning things about the other to her, and all in all, she is on the receiving end of their cornucopia of insanities and has been since she was 6 months old. Both parties have broken many aspects of the Bill Of Rights For Children Who's Parents Don't Live In The Same Household. Both parties have broken many parts of their custody agreements.  For the month of July, T has been in California staying with A. As it turns out, M may not have let H2 know that T was staying with her sister only, and H2 has insisted on T cutting her trip short as this violates their custody agreement. (This may or may not be true, A does not know. Both parties have lied a lot for many years in an attempt to deny visitation and custody of T)  As of today, my girlfriend received a threatening text from H2's lawyer stating that if T is not returned early, they will be filing a missing person's report on T. M and H4 (husband 4) are telling my girlfriend that H2 is bluffing and not to send her home until the month is up, as M is entitled to custody for the month and has chosen to let her stay at A's apartment. H2 has been tracking his daughter's movements via her phone and has known where she has been the whole month of July.  Essentially, I think this is a textbook example of an Idiot Plot, a literary device in which the plot only moves forward because all parties involved (M and H2) are idiots. They're spiteful and hateful, and their daughter, T, is suffering through a very unstable childhood. Typically, I would avoid these types of people and situations like the plague, but I care a lot about my girlfriend, and she cares a lot about her sister and so I'm hoping I can get some good advice from fellow redditors that could result in an improved life situation for T, and peace of mind for A.  So here are my questions: 1) Is there anything my girlfriend can do to help her sister's situation? 2) Is there anything T can do to improve her own situation? 3) If H2 knows where T is, communicates with her multiple times a day, and is GPS tracking her at all times, can he file a missing person's report, and is that a legitimate threat that could in some way harm A?  Apologies for the drama and thanks again for your time.	Yes
"Louisiana.  I ask here because i have little idea about what marriage entails when it comes to money.  I dare not ask my sister since i've had argument with her about how much I dislike and wish they've broken up before they had kids. She was lucky to land a rich boy like him. She went from poverty to having their own house and got her nursing training, all from her husbands parents support. Her husbands parents are manipulative and evil, so, yeah. I worry they may have done something to secure their sons wealth from her in some way.  And as excited as i am to see her split up from him, it brings a very bitter sweet feeling and i am not fit to confront my sister about these details ""Currently"" as my emotions are a strong mix of relief and sadness because her children are going to go through exactly what we all went through, concerning low life, deadbeat and cheating fathers"	Yes
I'm a victim in a domestic violence case. Ex boyfriend punched me in 2013, so an order of protection was placed. He contacted me a few months later via phone. He did 90 days for the assault and criminal contempt 2nd in 2014. 2015 he violated again for calling me and being at my house. He got 1-3 Yrs upstate for aggravated family offense and criminal contempt 1st. He got out on parole last year and is currently still on it. He violated by calling me again in April. This time they charged him with a misdemeanor and RORed him. How is that possible ? He's already had 3 court dates and RORed each one. No d.a contacted me until today, the day before his next court date and told me its because he wasn't in my house this time ? I have a full stay away it doesn't make sense and isk what to do. He's never going to stop :-( help ...btw I have the entire call log as well as texts from that day but I didn't mention the texts in the initial police report.	Yes
I am in the process of the beginnings of a divorce in Oregon, and have a question about what I might be entitled to ask for in terms of debt repayment.   My soon to be ex husband and I have been married since August 2016, and in that time, he has been unemployed 5, coming up on 6 months. During that time, he has earned 1/3 of what I do per month through unemployment, and we have accrued 13,000 in credit card debt over the course of our 4 year relationship together.   Originally we were going to have an amicable divorce and not write the shared debt in the papers (to save our credit scores), but now I think I will need to. When he gets a traveling job (we are both occupational therapists), he will make 2x what I make at my permanent job. Originally, he was going to pay off most of our debt, and save 5k each for separate savings accounts over the course of the next year or so (we would still be financially intertwined after the legal proceedings).   Now, he's saying he will only pay off half of the debt, not contribute to 2 separate savings accounts, even though he has lived off of my income and support for almost half of our marriage.   What would be reasonable LEGALLY for me to ask for? I'd like for him to pay off at least 2/3 of the debt since he's used so much of my income. Side note, with our debt and his unemployment, we cannot really afford a lawyer, which is why we had our original amicable plan and do a DIY divorce.   If any more information is needed, let me know! Thanks in advance for your help!	Yes
"My wife and I are both residents of Indiana. I've been split with my wife for 9 months - not legally, just physically. We are still married. We moved into our own separate apartments and split all time and expenses with our child 50/50. She continually led me to believe that she didn't want child support or full custody - which I figured was a lie, but I really hoped for the best. In the last couple months I paid off the family car (2010, in my name) with the entirety of our tax refund and some of my own money, knowing and communicating that I planned on giving it to her. I've also sent unofficial 'child support' to her since I'm not there to split our son and his expenses 50/50. For many of those months I also paid her car insurance, and I've always paid half the babysitter bill.   When I'm at home I teach, and my margins are so small budget wise I can't afford to pay her a big child support payment after the divorce. I'm only able to afford it now because I'm making two incomes - my summer teaching check and my active duty money from the National Guard (my second job, I'm in MO at a branch schoolhouse).   She now tells me that she does want physical custody and child support, but our son will still be split 50/50 in whats called ""parenting time"". Her rich uncle has gotten her a lawyer and she filed right before I came here. It can't go through until I go home and take a mandatory children/divorce parenting class. I also am not home to be served officially/through certified mail (is my understanding)  My questions:    Does anyone know of an accurate child support calculator, or an idea of what I'd be paying if I lose custody but have 50/50 parenting time? I already have two jobs - she doesn't even work full time. Will the judge care? From what I've seen that doesn't matter - just the fact that she's making less than me is going to jack my bill up.   Are any of her text messages admissible in court?   What rights do I have to the vehicle? She is driving it and has the keys but I have the title in my name. Can I have it towed and scrapped? Would her lawyer sue me? Could the judge give her my car - the one I have in Missouri, even though that's in my name too (and that one's not paid off - would I have to give it to her AND pay it off?) Could I pay it off, put it in a friend's name and continue driving it? Could a judge touch that?  I know I sound vindictive - but I paid to put this woman through college, made endless efforts to get out marriage to work, was treated like absolute crap for a very very long time, have been lied to so many times, and now she wants to take my son too, and have me pay her, when I am a good dad, and she knows it.  I just got done taking her name off my insurance bill - what can I do about the vehicle, and what should I anticipate about child support?  Hopefully you guys are willing to help. Thanks for reading."	Yes
My uncle is married to a women who has a child. They were married when the child (F/16) was about 8 or 9. Her bio dad is not involved in any way (I am not even sure he has ever interacted with or paid support for her).   There have been a few concerning moments that I have seen in the past. When she was 15 she was dating and 18 year old, and having sex with him, all with her mothers approval. When he broke up with her over text because he was apparently also sleeping with a different 15 year old her mom's response was that it wasn't a big deal, and there was no reason for her to have to talk to the child. I have also seen the mother freak out at her for no apparent reason to the point that my cousin was in tears, and for years they have locked certain rooms in the home (like the master bedroom and some other general living spaces) just because they don't want her to have any access to their space. I know her mother also has another child that lives with bio dad and mom has not seen in 5+ years.   Now the current problem is that they have apparently kicked her out of the house. I have no idea why but knowing all parties involved it was for something ridiculous. My cousin is a great student and, besides the one horrible dating choice, is generally responsible. She isn't doing drugs or anything like that. I only found out about this because she was meant to come to a family event and told me that she couldn't make it as she was currently working two jobs and crashing with friends.   Is the correct person to contact about this CPS? or the RCMP? They live in a very small community in BC, Canada.	Yes
"I divorced my spouse July of last year and part of the settlement involved being awarded a portion of their 401k, which was operated by the local chapter of their union.   In December of last year the provider of the 401k merged with the international chapter's 401k provider and since then noone seems willing or able to help me.  I've been told to basically stop calling/emailing the international chapter's investment department as ""we've not received the final calculations from the previous provider and cannot give you an update""  What, if anything, can I do to compel them to follow the court order?"	Yes
In the final stages of a divorce as the defendant. She has a lawyer but I cannot afford one. Things have been pretty simple. Agreed on most of everything and planned on signing papers out of court. The papers arrived yesterday and there are a few things I don't agree with mostly being taking my son off of my insurance. Thought this was a harmless act but it added $150 to my child support. She won't budge on keeping him on mine. I really just want this all over with but I also want to stand up to this because I feel taken advantage of due to my ignorance. Is there anything I could do? Would I even have a shot if I took this to court without a lawyer?	Yes
So, 24yo, about 6 months pregnant.  Long story short, I was dating this guy and found out about his child pornography charges. I left him and then later found that I was pregnant. I am pro choice in the sense that it's none of my business what another woman does with her body, but abortion is not for me.   At first we were on the same page. He told me his side of the story with the porn and agreed that he would sign over all rights to me as long as he still got some kind of supervised visitation. I more recently was given access to the full federal file and found out that the story he gave me was super watered down and straight up false in some cases. Since I've found that out, he's been super wishy washy about whether or not he's actually going to sign over the rights.  For a while I was considering adoption. He went and sent in an appeals to the federal judge here to have his restrictions lifted (he can't be alone with anyone under the age of 18 without supervision, can't step foot on school or day care properties, etc.) so that he could get full custody. He won't tell me whether or not the appeals was actually granted.   We've since gotten back on the same page again and he's agreed to sign everything over, but I'm concerned that he'll change his mind again at the last minute and I'll be thrown into a legal battle unprepared.   I can't really afford a lawyer right now and I've never had to deal with anykind of legal issues in my life. I have no idea where to even start. Help, please?	Yes
 Was married a bit over 4.5 years, separated in Dec 2014. I filed in June 2016 for dissolution. We have no kids, she had a BA from UCLA before we married, didn't work during our marriage,  got her MA while we were separated, and got everything she asked the court for. I supported her for 13 months while we were separated. In that 13 months, she got $42,000.00 worth of support. I am active duty military, we don't get paid that much, so this amount of money is pretty big to me. Before we got married, she was arrested for assaulting me inn my barracks room. She took a plea for disturbing the peace. The judge still ordered I pay half of a college bill, which I never benefited from since she never worked, and pay her $1,800.00 a month for the next 14 months. I literally can not afford that. I provided my bank statements, for the last 3 years, as evidence, but I don't think the judge even looked at them. They had cover sheets with everything already calculated as to who got what, and highlighted. It would have been very easy to look through and see what I had paid her already. How can I be ordered to support someone so much when they were arrested, and convicted? How can I appeal, our file a motion for reconsideration, when I literally can't afford any of the options? How am I going to support my current wife and two step sons? Please, help me!	Yes
This is currently a hypothetical situation for the sake of discussion so thank you for sticking with me:  I was wondering what happens to the allocation of assets between two partners (A and B)  I suppose this extends to multiple situations, an answer for any would be appreciated:  1) partner A brings in the sole income for the household, partner B works around the house (no children)  2) as in situation 1, but partner B also looks after children almost exclusively   3) partner A brings in significantly more income than partner B (around 8x) who also works around the house  4) as in situation 3, but both partners share housework equally.  For all situations assume no substantial personal assets prior to marriage.   I suppose these situations would also be influenced by prenuptial agreements, would these influence the outcome?   Thanks for your time!	Yes
I'm a 17 year old, extremely smart (not bragging) O-levels student studying in Pakistan and currently in Bahrain for summer holidays.   At the age of 11, my parents took me out of school and put me into a Quran teaching institute for 5 years, during that time I got extremely depressed with having the same routine 7am to 12pm and 3pm to 7pm everyday for 5 years.   Every year I tried to convince my parents to let me go back to school but they never agreed and just beat me, until the 5th year when they realised I wasn't interested in finishing the Quran and it was getting too late.  After that I spent the next 3 months finishing the 5 years worth of syllabus of 5 subjects so that I could get into school. After 3 months I moved to Pakistan to live with my brother (who turned out to be a sadistic asshole)and left my family behind in Bahrain.   My brother wanted me to get into the 8th grade of the Pakistani education system but since I was 3 years behind my former classmates, I went behind his back and barely got myself into the first year of O-levels.  At the end of the first year, I topped all of my subjects getting all A's and A+'s except I math and ended the school year with certificates in Business, Economics, Accounting and English for the best student of each subject over the year. I did all of that in my first year of school after since the 5th grade.  After that I was still behind my former classmates who were in the 12th grade and I asked my brother to let me skip one year of school and get myself into the 3rd year of O-levels straight after finishing the 1st, my brother didn't allow me and gave me no reason as to why he didn't and said I should take my time, so once again I went behind his back and got myself into the 3rd year of O-levels all by myself. I had to finish the whole 2nd year syllabus in 2 month and, after I was done with 2 subjects out of 5, my brother caught wind of my plans to skip a grade and took away my laptop, phone and everything else knowing I needed the internet to study as I had no teachers.  so now I'm stuck. I opened up to my mother about how my brother treats me and how he's an asshole, and she replied by beating me and telling me how I disrespected my brother. Now my only option is to go with whatever my brother has planned for me which is gonna ruin my future. I know I have great potential. The students who got the same grades as me in 12th grade as I did in 10th are getting into top universities like Stanford, Harvard and Pennsylvania on full scholarships and stipends. It's been my dream to move to the US to study an to pitch an amazing app idea I have that has impressed many of people but my parents would never allow me to move there because of religious reasons and other reasons.   Other than my education, I had breathing problems for 10 years from the time I was 7 to the time I was 17 and my parents never took me to a hospital,this year, I convinced one of my brothers to take me to a hospital where I was diagnosed with either Bronchitis or asthma (full diagnosis would be done if I visited a specialist which I probably never will).  I just want to know my options, what can I do to leave my abusive and careless family behind and move to another country? If I have the option of getting into some education programs abroad I would have no trouble getting into them because I have exceptional grades in all my subjects. I have a lot of potential but I'll never be able to achieve it if I stay with my family.	Yes
(Portland, OR) My transgender partner and I got into an argument. The argument continued to escalate to the point where I made a really horrible comment invalidating her gender. In response to this, she lunged at me and started punching me, pulling me down to the ground and beating me with a broomstick. I managed to constrain her and make my way out of the apartment. I called 911 and they arrested her.  When the police arrived, I made the mistake of talking to police who recorded a statement (I was completely jostled and nearly out of it when he was asking me questions). My apartment management also convinced me to call the DA and give them the case number. I have not yet been contacted by a prosecutor.  I do not wish to follow through with prosecution. While in this one instance she initiated the attack, I believe there has been a mutual pattern of abuse in our relationship. There have been times when I have yelled at her or made physical contact (such as grabbing her and trying to force her out of the room or pushing her when she was in my face). Usually this happens after we have been arguing and it quickly devolves into shouting matches. We are both to blame for raising our voices, talking over one another and escalating these arguments. We both say horrible things to one another. It's just a mutually abusive relationship that I want both of us to be out of because we've tried it for so long and it does neither of us any good.   tldr; me and transgender girlfriend got in fight, she was arrested for domestic assault, I called DA with case number. What can I do to have them drop charges / not continue with case?	Yes
Current location: Colorado  Original birth certificate: Virginia  Name change:  Illinois  During a recent move, my birth certificate got destroyed.  To do some recently-moved legal things in Colorado, like switch my license, I need to order a certified copy.  Do I need to contact the Virginia vital records for my original birth certificate, or do I contact the Illinois vital records because an Illinois judge signed off on my name change?  Thanks!	Yes
My sister is pregnant and she wants to get an abortion. In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.  So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.  Ideally they wouldn't ever know about it but let's assume they figure it out somehow, can I (or her) be in any legal trouble here?	Yes
"Short  backstory: My husband has a 9 year old son from a previous marriage.  He and his ex-wife have joint custody, but due to the distance between our houses, we see his son every other weekend during the school year and every weekend in the summer. He and his ex-wife are amicable and co-parent without problems. His family hates the ex-wife and have been at odds with her since they were engaged. We all live in different suburbs of a city that straddles two different states; the ex-wife and his family live in one state and we live in the other. We're all about a half hour drive from one another.   A few months ago, I received a panicked call from my husband's aunt stating that she had filed a suit in family court for full custody of his son, alleging that his son had been abused over the past nine years and was in urgent danger for suicidal ideations. She also said she had attempted to get emergency sole custody and was denied. The only reason she was telling me this was because a guardian ad litem had been appointed and he was asking where his son was. She was worried he was going to remove our son from his mother's home and place him in DFS care, and she wanted us to know.   My first question was 1) what made her think our son was suicidal, 2) if she felt this way, why wouldn't she either tell us this so we could take action, and 3) why didn't she file to have my husband and I take custody, as a third-party suit seemed unnecessary when there was a perfectly good set of parents available to take over.   Her answers were: 1) she said that while showing her and another aunt Minecraft, our son got upset that he had made a mistake and then said, ""It's no big deal, because if I mess up again I can just kill my character and start over.""  2) She felt like if she told us we wouldn't take it seriously, and 3) She claims she had asked if we could be given sole custody and the courts said no, because we had moved across state lines (with his ex's permission).   Since then the situation has gone from baffling to very hostile.  The aunt forwarded us her suit, expecting us to give our blessing to this. Her filing was filled with a large number of exaggerated events, things completely unrelated to our son (he has step-siblings who live with his mom as well, and about half of the allegations were about them), several of the allegations had already been written off as unsubstantiated or no evidence by DFS (she has sent them to the ex's home 4-5 times over the last nine years; the first three times the social worker said there was absolutely nothing to investigate, and the last couple of times they refused to even go to the house), and the rest were based in misunderstandings that would be been easily cleared up if they had talked to one of us before freaking out.   My husband has talked to the guardian ad litem, they've all been in front of the judge twice, and we have been encouraged to get our own lawyer even though no one has really involved my husband in the suit beyond asking him what he thought about the situation.  His ex-wife's lawyer feels there is a case for a harassment suit and is recommending an order of protection when this is all done.  The judge was very harsh with his aunt (used to be a lawyer and is acting pro se in the suit) and told her to stop being melodramatic and working outside of the scope our son and his current situation.   The GAL said at the last court hearing there wasn't much else to do except ask some follow-up questions at our son's school once teachers are back. We felt like everything was pretty much wrapped up.   Throughout all this, both of the aunts have been texting us and emailing the GAL asking for access to my stepson as well my daughter from a previous relationship. We have stated several times that we'd like to wrap up the court case and get guidelines from the judge as to how to proceed with visitation.  Our son has been having panic attacks since being interviewed by the GAL because he's worried he'll never see him mom again, he's aware the suit was brought by his aunts, and that his aunts have mentioned his mom was a bad parent.  My husband and I feel like them seeing him now would really mess him up.  We've tried to explain this, but they say we're just being vindictive by withholding the children from them.   In our last exchange, his aunt who filed the suit said the GAL had told her things were working in her favor and that we were delusional if we felt like things would stay the same.  Prior to this I felt like this last round of interviews and the upcoming court case were formalities, but now I'm kind of worried.   I guess my questions are the following:   1) Can third party custody be granted in a case where there's a perfectly good set of parents available?   2) Is it true that we can't be granted full l custody bc we crossed state lines?   3) Can a petitioner asking pro se get information from the GAL that wasn't also given to us?   Note: We've seen a lawyer, but she won't talk further to us until we pay her initial fee, which we're doing tomorrow. This is more to set my mind at ease than to direct action.  Thank you in advance for any advice you have!"	Yes
My husband has decided to leave me. Even though I don't want or agree with a divorce I have to accept that it is happening. We don't have kids, house, etc. Very little in the way of assets and we mostly agree on how to split everything.  We have decided that an uncontested divorce is best. My husband thinks that we can share a lawyer but I wasn't sure. I have extensively googled and not gotten a definitive answer. Any idea?	Yes
Hi,  Ex and I have parenting agreement that allowed our to move to texas from california with her. As the father, i retained 50/50 legal custody and have visitation during school breaks.  Ex and i have amicable interactions. Daughter is 12 years old. Decided she wants to live with me in Cali. Ex is agreeable.  Is there any value in getting ex to sign a letter stating xyz, or is it useless unless I file a new parenting plan in court - and would CA even be the right jurisdiction since the child has resided in texas for the last 4 years. I don't exactly have the money to file it if it's the same 500 bucks everything else is to file in family court.  If there is value in getting ex to sign/notarize an agreement that says she gave me permission to take the child back to cali to live with me, would any of you have some things i want to include?  I don't feel like i need to cover my ass here, but that's usually when i get my ass kicked...  Thanks!	Yes
Currently, a family member has legal guardianship of my sister who is not fit to care for her. I would like to obtain guardianship, but have not been able to get in contact with legal aid. CYFD claims that there is a 90 day window that I can use to gain the court's favor, but I'm not sure how that works. Where do I start?	Yes
Should mention before I start where I live. I live in Southern Arkansas, in the US.   I turn 22 in September, and I was recently talking to a friend who was able to get several years worth of missed child support from his father. As far as I know, my father hasn't paid Child Support at least since I was 6-7. I've been hurting for money for a while, and I was wondering if it were possible to actually do that without knowing where my father even is currently. Does anyone have any advice or any tips on where to get started?	Yes
we live together, have another child and i make a very good living, stable household. Her aunt is currently keeping her son in another state and naturally has grown attached to him, all signs and conversation sound like they want to keep her child. What legal actions should we take and what rights or actions can they take so we can be prepared when we go to court next month?	Yes
I'm an E3 in the Navy stationed on Naval Base Ventura County in California. I'm going through a divorce with my ex at the moment and we've agreed on all the terms and all the paperwork is filed.  We're still legally married until October 26, 2017, because of California's 6 month waiting period. The problem is one of our terms is that she would take half of the credit card debt, which is in both of our names, and I would take the other half, and she has yet to make any attempts at going to the bank to take her half or to even pay me back for the past couple months where I've been the only one making payments on it.   We're still legally married, but I was wondering if I could possibly have the start of a case against her? Could I sue her now? Or do I have to wait till we're legally divorced for all of our agreements to be put into place? We filed all of the paperwork back in April. I hope the information I've provided is enough to get good answers, I'll provide more if you need more details. Thank you for your help.	Yes
"Canada.  My niece and nephew are twins, age 14.  A year and a half ago my brother was roughhousing with my nephew, things got out of hand, and nephew got scared.  My brother explained to him he was never in any danger, apologized for scaring him, and hasn't played like that since.  Fast forward to three weeks ago.  Somehow (don't know how) child services got wind of the incident and ordered my brother to immediately go no contact with his kids.  They call this a ""safety plan"".  He has been staying with me since then.  Even though the incident only involved my nephew, he's also not allowed to see my niece.  He is however allowed to see my kids.  Between then and now, they've interviewed my niece and nephew once, my brother once, and they talked to my sister-in-law briefly.  Everyone including my nephew basically said, yes it happened, it was a year and a half ago, it was an accident, it hasn't happened since.  Child services reported this to the RCMP which closed the file without even speaking to my brother because they do not believe a crime was committed.  Child services tells my sister-in-law that breaking the safety plan could result in the kids being removed from her as well and being placed in foster care.  The social worker says it's unlikely he'll ever see his kids again without supervision.  This is, to say the least, overkill.  With the exception of this one incident, my brother is a model parent.  He coaches his kids' sports teams, he volunteers at their school, he's well-liked by everyone, children and their parents alike.  My brother has contacted a lawyer who advised him to work with child services as best he can and to call him back when child services asks him to agree to or sign something.  What can be done to hurry the process along so my brother can live at home again?"	Yes
"I have a [previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/6kcqte/can_he_actually_get_that_or_a_lesson_in_why/) that outlines the whole background, if anyone would like to peek at it.  But I have a specific legal question:  My ex believes he's entitled to half of our home's passive value increase due to the market demand.  We bought the house in 2012, but didn't marry until December of 2015.  When we bought the house, it was worth $148k.  When we married, it was worth $155k.  A month ago when I told him we were through, it was worth $160k.  And now, it's worth $168k.  (These are Zestimates - yes, I know they aren't accurate, I'll be getting an appraisal to get the right numbers).    So - for what time frame is he entitled to the increase in value (marital property)?  During our marriage?  Or the whole time we've owned the house?    Also, the value keeps rapidly climbing - what's the ""stopping date"" for the equity owed?  (Hope that makes sense).  Thank you for any help."	Yes

I could really use some advice. I'm in Texas and am attempting divorce my abusive husband. We have been married for 12 years and have a six year old daughter together. I moved out of our family home 8 or 9 months ago, and have been seeing someone else during that time. In the past he has been physically violent, but I never filed charges as he always showed remorse. I regret that now. He assaulted me when I told him I was leaving and the police were called, but they did not offer to press charges and I did not think to ask. He has assaulted me since then as well as assaulting my current boyfriend. I went and spoke to the D.A.'s office multiple times about getting a protective order (once with a bruise on my body he caused) but they stated that since he and I are still married and we have a kid together they thought it best to deny. I have had to get a criminal trespassing warning for my home, which local officers refused to give for a long time. I have been told by local authorities that I am getting what I deserve for cheating because were still married. My boyfriend pressed charges the second time he was assaulted, but the process seems to have stopped moving forward months ago. Nothing ever came of it and an officer just told him he should stop seeing me. I officially filed for divorce on February 21st of this year pro se as I could not afford a retainer fee. My husband counter petitioned and I ended up being bullied into signing over majority custody of our daughter to him, which I regret bc he is not a stable parent. At the time I was made to believe I had no choice, but time has proven that he makes poor choices for her emotional well being and she is in therapy. I am now paying approximately 45% of my monthly income, which is already small to him in child support, insurance for her, daycare for her, and other medical fees monthly. He makes good money and can easily sustain everything need for her without my extra payments. I am now on the verge of being homeless because even though I work full time and clean houses on the side I still don't make enough to cover rent, etc once my payments to him come out. Since November of last year he has stalked, threatened, cyber stalked (getting into all of my accounts constantly bc he works it security and changing info, etc) read all of my text messages, constantly hacked in and wiped/locked out my phone through google account manager, etc, and has begun to hack into my work's it network to post inappropriate pictures of me etc for all my coworkers to see. He refuses to give me a divorce now on top of it and constantly breaks the morality clause in our custody agreement. I'm at my wits end and don't know what to do. I feel like no authorities will listen to me and he never stops. I know that this post was very very long. I hope that someone can please help. This has been a total nightmare and I have no one to turn to. If you've made it this far, I appreciate you reading!	Yes
My mom suffers from bipolar manic depression. My wife and I went to go stay with her 7 years ago. She threatened to call 911 on me when she was having a manic episode. I called 911 to get them to come take her back to the hospital to get her some help. She lied to the police and told them they pulled her hair. My wife told them she didn't see me do that. They took me to jail anyway. I plead no contest to get out of jail because I was pretty ignorant at the time and had my ability to purchase a firearm prohibited. I still can't afford a lawyer. What should I do to get the false conviction off my record and restore my 2nd Ammendment right to purchase own and carry a firearm. I want to be able to defend my family and myself in an emergency. Please help. Thanks	Yes
I'm currently in a volatile relationship that is toxic and destructive to me. However, I've just started a new job and I'm undergoing training that is rarely offered, so I can't miss a day of work. I need a restraining order against my former significant other. If I fill out the paperwork and give them to a friend that is free during the court's normal hours can they submit the paperwork for me?	Yes
Hopefully someone here can help me out. I'm looking into adopting my stepdaughter. The biological father isn't in the picture at all. Didn't sign her birth certificate. At one point in time my wife had a restraining order out against him.   Are there any special steps that I need to take in regards to him? Or is it simply between my wife and I?  Thanks in advance for any help you might be able to give!	Yes
I'm wondering if anyone can point me to resources on family law with regard to mobility. My former spouse intends to move some distance away and make a mobility application, after we have been separated over a year with joint custody and equally shared time with the children (week on week off). I don't feel this move is in the best interests of the children. I've familiarized myself with Gordon v. Goertz, but I'm wondering if anyone can give me some other examples, or search terms one could use on CanLII.  Thanks.	Yes
I'm a foster parent living in Oklahoma and I'm adopting my niece. Half way through the process I got a call asking if I would be willing to help take in my nephew and knowing no one else in our family would, I accepted. I later found out that he has a serious mental health issues that my wife and I don't feel we are equipped to handle and he's tearing my family apart.  The only reasons why we haven't had a caseworker change his placement is because we still feel for him (I was a foster child for a brief period of time when I was about his age), the fact that our adoption finalizes within the next two months and the financial bind that put my family in without the stipend my state provides. We had to purchase a new vehicle since we were a family of five which is where the financial bind comes in. Is there a way that the state can take my niece so close to adoption? Also is there a way to sell back my vehicle or trade it for something with a lower payment for people in my situation?   Noteworthy items: My wife is a stay at home mother We've had my niece in our care for over a year I hate looking like the bad guy but his bio-father has had mental health issues since he was about 10 I am sure my nephew needs in-patient treatment	Yes
I live in Virginia. I pay child support, I dont make a lot given I am still in college. My ex is going to college too and needs day care for the kid. She said my child support will most likely go up. If I am already paying child support at a set amount relative to my income, is it really going to go up and how much. I am trying to talk with her about going together and finding a nice place we both agree on since i might be paying for it, I have a right in where he goes right? Speaking of rights, I havent been to court yet to establish my time with him, I work all the time and go to school and can see him only when I am free. It works, but should I go to court and get it all down for the record? I am 24 she is 25 and still lives at home with the kid her 28yo brother and her mom, I live on my own with roommates. What is best for the kid is for her to watch him, but once I graduate and get a job, I want to get 50/50 so I don't have to worry about being screwed in child support. What is my best option, I can provide further details if needed. Thanks &lt;3	Yes
"please excuse the ""my ex"" and ""child"" references, i'm just not trying to give too much away.    where can i find (if at all) in the Florida state statutes a reference to the type of health insurance required to be maintained on a child and also the statute  that references the amount of back payment is required to pay back child support?  if my ex quits their job and goes to one making less than the one that the current child support order is based on do they have to pay less child support?  a little back story: my ex got awarded 60% time sharing, we both got 50/50 parental decision making with my ex getting final say. my ex is also required to to maintain health insurance on our child.   i am currently paying my share of child support which includes my share of daycare and health insurance. our child no longer go to daycare and i just recently found out my ex quit their job and lost health care coverage for our child. my ex did not notify me that our child did not have coverage anymore within 60 days so i am not able to get our child coverage through the market until the first of the year.   my employer has open enrollment right now and will have it again at the first of the year (they are changing the dates coverage goes through) but to insure our child it will be an addl. $125 a week. my ex doesn't want to pay this.   i need to go back to court to get the child support changed anyways since our child doesn't go to daycare anymore so i'm going to file a motion as well to ask the judge to order me to be the one responsible for our childs medical insurance. right now my ex does have our child insured with Christian Health Ministries but from what i am reading there is a lot of things that aren't covered and it seems like we are left open to huge financial responsibility.   i'm wondering what the chances are that i get awarded the responsibility for that. also would my ex be required to pay child support based on her ability to have a better job with  more income?      thank you in advance for any help."

"I got my son back from his fathers 2 weeks ago (The divorce papers say he is to go to his dads every other weekend). He had bruising on both upper arms. (They looked like hand prints) I asked my son what happened and he said ""Daddy grabbed me by both arms and threw me on my bed because I hurt my baby brother"" I directly took him to the doctor and the doctor felt it was necessary to call DCF (Department of Children and Families). When I got home I called the police. The police came and took a statement from me and looked at my sons arms and took pictures. The cops felt it was child abuse. The next day I call the Child Abuse Detective and he said this was corporal punishment not child abuse. So I told my sons father, to protect my son from it happening again or worse, that he will not be seeing my son until he takes me to court for it. Of course he got mad and said my son was lying but the proof was there. So that's the back story. My question is that  I'm wanting to move to Oklahoma to be with my sister and her husband. I will give my sons father summers and every other Christmas for visitation. I need to know how I go about doing that. Does anyone have any experience moving to a different state from Florida? How did it work out and what did you have to prove? I'm a medical assistant and would have a lot more job opportunities than I do here. Most places want bi lingual (Spanish and English) or 2-3 years experience. I do not have this skill or experience. Im also certified as a phlebotomist (blood drawing). I could work in a hospital or doctors office. I have looked up the jobs in Oklahoma and there's millions. In Florida, not so much.  Any advice on how to go about relocating would be very helpful."

Hello!   My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the  past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment.  We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force. Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	Yes
hey, so to make this a short long story, my father has never paid child support even though my mother had got it in writing what he was supposed to pay (the amount slips my mind as I was 3 when this all happened and I have lost all the paperwork). but as of now I am of age of majority and still wondering if i have any entitlement to that money. I'm also in Canada, British Columbia. So I guess what I'm asking is where I stand with all this in a legal level, what my options are, what kind of lawyer to look into. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this. Will update with any info as needed.	Yes
My ex-and I have had a horrible divorce (like the majority of them).  He has caused many issues in my new relationship.  The strain has caused my new husband to leave a few times because he could handle the verbal abuse of my ex.  Me and my new husband have come to terms with our situation and decided to face that is our life and we are moving forward.  We are not going to separate anymore.  My ex is not happy that me and my new husband are staying together.  Has threatened to get a Guardian ad Litem for my 11 year old.  There is no abuse in our home and my son is loved.  Can my ex (who is living with his girlfriend an no legal place of his own) get custody of my child because of my new husband leaving before? 	Yes
I got married in 2012, divorced in 2014, and was in a related legal battle through May of this year (2017). As such, I have a LOT of paperwork left over... Original marriage certificate, letters from my attorney to myself and copies of what they sent to my ex, letter stating that we are legally divorced, etc.    How long do I need to hang on to this? The final court date I had was, as mentioned, back in May- and at this point everything has been completely finalized. No further issues to resolve in court. Can I shred everything, including the original marriage certificates?    Possibly pertinent information: I do NOT have children, there is no alimony, and no shared assets that were divided up at all (house or otherwise).   Thanks!  **TL;DR**: Went through a divorce + related legal battle, everything is finally resolved- can I shred/burn the papers, or is there some reason I would need them?	Yes
"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	Yes
I'm considering leaving my husband. I go back and forth on that issue, but one of the biggest points of consideration is that I am a stay at home mom and we live in Hawaii. There is zero chance I would be able to leave him and find a job that pays enough here for me to afford a place for my son and I. Even with child support, it simply isn't attainable or would be a quality of life I would want for us. I would really like to move back to the mainland. I'm not sure where yet; it will depend on where I find work.   Will I get into legal trouble if I move to another state with our son without my husband?	Yes
So my husband left me basically overnight for a coworker of his. I've tried to be nice and let him see our son and even take him to his house that he shares with his new girlfriend.  My problem is that he will not see him unless he can take our son there and I'm uncomfortable with this because I don't know where they live or what the house is like therefore I have no idea where my 3 year old is when he's with his dad. His girlfriend is only 18 (he's 26) and has friends over etc. I don't know any of these people so I'm uncomfortable with it.  I have no money for a lawyer yet don't qualify for legal aid. I don't know what to do. I understand I can do a temporary custody order but I don't know how fast those are effective or how to fill out the forms or anything... any help would be appreciated I'm lost. 	Yes

"Hello there Legal Advice!  So, last year I went through a custody battle with my son's mother. My new attained girlfriend at the time knew the fine details of the entire ordeal. Now that she and I are no longer together and went through a ""bad breakup"", she has taken the liberty of contacting my son's mother and made **accusations that** -  * I'm addicted to narcotics due to a foot injury as well as marijuana edibles. * Claiming I am emotionally and physically abusive in front of my son. * I apparently left him in a high chair for two hours while playing video games with a soiled diaper.   I had received notice from a judge's order that my parenting time has been revoked down from three days a week, down to eight hours a week with a licensed therapist. Thankfully it's only for a week, but now I have to build my defense case. I have a court date for this Thursday to prove my case  * I'm not an addict and am able to provide a list of all prescriptions. Last one being prescribed to me was three months ago. **I have a print out I will be submitting as evidence to support my claims** * I'm not addicted to marijuana edibles. I did take some, to help me fall asleep at night only when my son wasn't there. It's been about a month since I likely took anything. **I have my employer and who is able to be a character witness** * I am not abusive in any way. **Character witnesses** * I have never neglected my son in any way shape or form. **Character Witnesses**  **What other options do I have available to me to prove these accusations are false to the judge?**  * The last trial of the custody case, the Judge stated: The Court has some concerns about Mother‚Äôs ability to encourage the sharing of love, affection, and contact between Child and Father. The Court notes that Mother is overprotective of Child, which unfortunately has impacted his relationship with his father."	Yes
(Michigan)  Their marriage lasted from may 2015 to may 2017. He owns a pizzeria that I currently manage. He opened it with his own money in 2008. They were in a relationship at the time and she worked there with him and put all profit in their combined personal bank account. She's now suing for lost wages. Since their marriage he's allowed her to pursue her hobbies and be free from work. She had the affair in august 2016. He caught her. They gave it another shot. May 2017, she's at it again. He had to end it. She's also trying to sue for a piece of the business. Any advice would help.	Yes
*Location: England*  My parents are about to go through a divorce through no fault of my Father. My mothers alcoholism has gotten worse over the years and my dad can no longer take the emotional turmoil no more. She is stuck in a cycle and will not seek help or change her ways so my dad has to go. The turning point for me was my mother was diagnosed with esophagus cancer at 47 (very rare) due to her obsessive smoking and alcohol abuse. She was given a second chance after operating and was all clear but slowly slipped back to her old ways before getting much worse.  Divorce in the UK is a very financially toilsome outcome for the male party and I want to know how my dad can keep what he has worked hard for without my mam prying everything away? He is essentially the victim of years of emotional abuse and it is completely my mothers failings that have forced him into divorce so why should he have to pay for her failings.  Information that may be of use when giving advice:  - Three kids together. One 16, one 22 (me) and another 23. Only myself and my younger brother live at the family home. - My dad worked away a lot for the first 18 years or so of my life whereas my mam was a housewife.  -My mother got a job a few years ago as my dad needed help with the bills but then was diagnosed with cancer one year ago and has been on the sick since - She is able bodied and in my eyes should be in work - The house is up for sale and my father is in contact with the solicitors to go through divorce proceedings. I'm pretty sure both names are on the mortgage.  I would love my father to be able to part ways with this woman and get on with his life instead of paying my mother a 'lifestyle allowance'.  He has worked incredibly hard his entire life and shouldn't be forced into giving some alcoholic more money to spend on alcohol. I am not naive to the fact that my mother is obviously entitled to something but she certainly shouldn't be entitled to everything with this being her fault.  Please give me a solution to put a smile back on my Dad's face!	Yes
My partner and I are divorcing in San Diego California.  We agreed to go our separate ways, divide our stuff on our own, and just end it.  I moved out and filed the paperwork, and they lawyer-ed up and are now asking for more than agreeing to.  My question is can I, as the petitioner, amend what I am asking for from the court?  There are no children together, or anything too complicated like property or large 401K's.  We make almost the same amount of money, the marriage lasted 2 years.  Just dept and assets acquired during the marrage.  I have an appointment with my own lawyer next week.	Yes
My father wants a divorce (and all of us children want it too), but he hasn't filed one because he would have to give up half of what he has and my mother doesn't work. She will never initiate the divorce because of religious reasons. I honestly think it would be best if they split up. They have never been happy for their entire marriage and it has only gotten worse and worse.	Yes
I'll try to keep this short. My sister's ex-husband (whom she has a child with) is in the middle of a custody battle with his ex- girlfriend over a toddler. He called my sister and asked her to give a statement to his lawyer complimenting his parenting  style over  their own kid. Problem is that they've had some real issues precisely with co-parenting. One summer he came with all clothes that were too small and had to buy him a new wardrobe etc... She's been mulling over this for a while. Wondering about retaliation if she didn't. I think it's a bad idea and she should wash her hands all together of the her ex and his fight with the other woman. Thoughts?	Yes
"Hey, so I just turned 17 and am in a kind of predicament with my parents. They think I'm a ""sociopath"" and a ""conniving whore"" (long story) and basically they want to kick me out. I am able to move out around Christmas, but my father has just informed me that he wants me out NOW. He made it sound as if he could just wave his hand and have me either sent to jail or committed to a mental institution. I tried to explain to him that in order to do any of that I would have to have committed a crime or actually be insane, both of which are not true in my case. However, I'm not sure...I told him ""I have a right to live in this house until I'm 18 unless I commit any crimes"" but I don't know if that's actually the case. So what are my rights as a 17 year old in PA? I seriously just need 4 months to raise enough money and graduate from high school, and then I will leave and hopefully never speak to these narcissists ever again.    Thanks"	Yes
"My big brother has been chronically homeless and unemployed due to severe alcohol and drug addiction for many years. He was recently diagnosed with a serious condition that is unrelated to his substance abuse. He has also been diagnosed with depression and PTSD, and CTE stemming from a tragic car crash he survived as a teenager as well as sports related head injuries.  He has lived in a series of charitable homes and mental hospitals in Maryland in recent years. He recently got the first of a 3 part surgery, where they knicked an artery and had to operate on him a second  time. The botched surgery has caused further complications that have made him very sick.   He was approved for disability shortly before that, and was owed a bunch of retro disability. He assigned a ""payee"" who has access to the account and the money. He trusts this person not to run off with his money. He was afraid he'd binge on alcohol and drugs with all of the money.  He is constantly having to move from one facility to another because either he relapses or they have strict rules about leaving, but he will have to leave for follow up appointments at the hospital.   My family and I have made a ""no enabling"" policy in the last ten years, but I feel my brother's issues have gone so far beyond his addictions. I believe he is slipping further into mental illness from years of drug use and doctors seemingly using him as a guinea pig. He has had every anti depressant and anti anxiety med under the sun as well as ect (brain shock therapy) treatments.   His recent surgery complications have weakened and endangered him greatly. One more relapse could be the literal nail in the coffin, and I'm wondering if leaving him to his own devices isn't actually the correct approach anymore.   I have been considering trying to convince him to make me his payee and move him back home to NJ. I also wonder if I should get medical power of attorney, and all that that entails: ie, Would it allow me to admit him to drug rehabs or make medical decisions on his behalf, things like that. I think it would be better for him to live near his relatives and not bad neighborhoods in Baltimore, so even if he does relapse, we can be in the know about his whereabouts and condition, and he could have his housing funded so he wouldn't be living with us, but nearby. I also don't know if he could continue to get disability benefits in NJ based on meeting the requirements in MD.   If anyone can at least steer me toward some resources, even if you don't know of something I could work out, I'd greatly appreciate it."	Yes
Both my sister and I have undiagnosed ADHD. It's extremely apparent in both of us. We desperately need a diagnose so we can get help. My sister is honest to god a genius, but she can't focus in class and it impacts her grades. She also has anxiety. Personally I am high functioning, but it would really help if I didn't lose focus so much myself. We want to seek treatment, and my mom has been trying for years, but our dad intervenes, because we need his consent to start a diagnosis. He doesn't want to give his consent unless we go live with him full time, but we don't want to live with him because of the emotional abuse we have suffered there. Is there any way we can get a treatment without my dad having to consent?	Yes
"Hey guys, I'm a bit stuck right now. I got a message from a woman who claims to have my fiance's kid. They had talked years ago about the baby, and his mom told her she would pay for a paternity test; she saw it and ignored, then waited until the day before he left for basic to reach out again. His mom and the girl argued, then the girl ended up blocking her after saying military men do not make good fathers and she doesn't want him in the child's life, she just wants the child support.  So, fast forward to where we are now: two years have passed, and she just messages me out of the blue saying she wants to take legal action for sole custody and to get a paternity test, so she can get child support.  His name is not on any documents, or the birth certificate. Also, he has texts where she admits she essentially raped him. At a party while he was passed out, she ""went for a ride.""   He think she's just playing games again, and he recalls her doing the same thing to another man - trying to get child support from him.   Any advice? I'm super stressed about this. Can someone explain to me how the child support and paternity works? How does he sign over his rights? He said he would want to do that if it came to it.   We are in Missouri, she lives in another state but had the baby here."	Yes
"My ex-husband was ordered 3 years ago during our divorce to pay child support. Before I get a bunch of hate PMs -- I work, I didn't ask to keep the kid more. He didn't want more time. I don't enjoy never having any time to myself and always having to do everything on my own. It sucks, ok. I would gladly pay him the $350 he is required to pay me a month to get any sort of break on healthcare, child care, or even not having to use every single vacation day of work for a sick day or because school is out. Do you know how great it would be to just have to pay $350 a month for all child related expenses. It would all be worth $350 because that is nothing compared to the cost of a kid. I spent $100 on shoes the other day. Shoes. He needed shoes for school and water shoes for water activities and nice required shoes    for graduation. I swear to god I just bought him shoes 3 months ago that don't fit now. So before you come at me with the collecting child support shame just think for a second about how much it costs you to live and double that. Double all your costs. It isn't easy on one income. It isn't easy on two incomes.   My problem is my super pissed ex-husband who sees him kids the last weekend of every month likes to make it uncomfortable or hard to get my child support. In the last year, he has stuck the check in an actually bucket of slop, he has stuck it in a zip lock baggie of dog shit, he has taped it to my roof, he has tried to get me to play an elaborate scavenger hunt, he has driven to my son's elementary school on a day that isn't his custody day and stuck in my son's backpack and not told anyone and when I asked him where it was he has said "" guess where?"" which lead to an elaborate search of the house and two days of a guessing game (it was well hidden in a tiny pocket in the backpack and my son had no idea his dad even put anything in there, he has buried it in my back yard with my son's help, he has hand delivered to my HR department at work with ""for the bitch"" on the envelope, paid me cash in all $1, he has threatened to pay me in change (which he has not done yet), and he has written me 350 different checks for $1 each.   It is always something and it is getting old. I have not accept checks before (the ones covered in things) and he has eventually written me new ones after giving him a hard time.   I am exhausted. This is annoying. He doesn't work a consistent job so often times a garnishment would be hard. He always pays on time without hesitation but this is insane.   How much of this do I have to put up with? Is this just something I have to deal with for the next 11 years?"	Yes
Using a cell phone for privacy reasons so please have patience with the formatting. This is a multiple part situation and I will answer any and all questions to provide more detail and get better advice.  My girlfriend and I have been together 5+ years now. In that time we have purchased a home and had a child together. We have had several unsuccessful pregnancies and I have no desire to get married and it seems everything has taken a toll and we are on the verge of splitting. The marriage part was a well known fact. Before we became a couple I knew marriage wasn't something I wanted and was very vocal about that. Seems like this amongst other parts of our relationship were ideas she basically ignored figuring I would change my mind eventually.   Here were are with a two year old and a mortgage and things are unraveling. Her behavior has become erratic, hiding things, lying about situations, in general I can barely have a conversation with her without her screaming and storming off. I've told her several times if she isn't happy we should consider going our separate ways so our child doesn't have to grow up seeing us fight. This is why I am here. I already know what's going to happen. If I decide to start the process she will go off the deep end. Times when she has had too much to drink she has threatened to take our child from me. I know deep down that if I take the first step she is going to come after everything, our child, the house, everything we own just out of spite.   I am losing my mind, I can't function thinking about what's going to happen. We might have a few good days so I relax a little and then out of nowhere she blows up and I am worried she's going to show up with the cops and try to force me out of the house. Everything I own is here, everything in my life is here, no family and no where else to go. I started my own family and now I am waiting for it to be taken away from me.   What rights to do I have with our child if she packs them up and goes to her family's house? What rights to I have if she tries to kick me out of the house/accuses me of something so the police assume I am a danger (yes, a real thought of mine)? What rights do I have in Massachusetts that will make sure I get to see our child an equal amount of time when the dust settles.   Again I apologize for the format and rant. I didn't know where to begin, what not to say or how to finish. All I know is everything I have in my life could be gone and I have to know what my rights are so I can fight for them.   Thank you for your time...	Yes
"My parents were in the process of renovating an expensive historic home when they divorced, ten years ago.   The mortgage has been paid one way or another since then, but nobody has liven in it, but both are still on the mortgage.  Parent A would like to get the home to rentable condition, and start making income. A has already invested money in restoring the home.  Parent B would like nothing to do with Parent A, hence why this issue has not been addressed for so long.   Parent A is concerned about Parent B coming after A's rental income or the value of the property, and wants B to sign a ""quit claim deed"", eliminating A's interest in the property.   I advised B not to sign anything, after some googleing suggested that this would not eliminate the responsibility to pay the mortgage.   Would it be possible to informally draft a contract that covers these concepts? Or is an attorney strongly advised in this situation?  - While A pays the mortgage, B won't make any claims or interfere. - If A pays off the mortgage (or refinances), B will sign the quit claim deed.  Both have a large amount of illiquid assets.   Any other advice?"	Yes
"Hi, thank you for reading this.  At a young age I was diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. Had some help but mainly the help came to our house. When I turned 18, I locked myself up in my room and didn't go to school or outside my room other than to eat, drink and take care of my hygiene.   I voluntary choose to go to an institution, although abroad. The program was hard, but learned a lot. Until one day I got a letter from my mother explaining that she is now my financial guardian and has my custody (not sure how to explain it in English). Meaning I'm not capable of making my own decisions, transactions or whatever anymore without asking my mother.   The court did not ask if I thought I should be put under this because I was diagnosed with Aspergers syndrome and the institute claimed I'm irresponsible for my own actions/life.   Here comes the tricky part. I have been the fastest who completed the program, the owner speaks with big words about me to outsiders (that he expects a lot from me, etc). I know that I'm capable of living alone.   I also can not pick up all my stuff and leave as they have possession of my ID papers, bank papers and insurance cards.   I'm now two years further, 20 years now. I'm moving back to The Netherlands to another program. Also not in agreement with me. Now because I'm moving to a different municipality I have to move ""on paper"". This organization is asking me to lie to ask for funding from the government. As all of the organization has been paid by the government.   What should I do, what can I do?   I'm thinking of saying the truth to the municipality, that I'm capable of living alone etc. But how do I get my own voice back from my mom?   Thank you so much."	Yes
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A THROWAWAY  Long story short, we reconciled after a period of not talking and went out drinking with one of her friends. Me and her went home, both pretty drunk, and during an argument (after a sex/kink scene that went really poorly and I ended up bleeding and in serious pain with no aftercare on her part), she smothered me with a pillow in order to get me to stop talking so she could sleep. I finally stopped fighting and she let up, and we both went to sleep. Later, I woke her up telling her how much she hurt me, and she said if she hurt me so much, then I should just get out and press charges.  I know she wasn't serious about me pressing charges and she was just trying to be mean by saying that (she knows I have a history of being the victim in a violent relationship and being scared about getting legal intervention) but I'm thinking about it now a week later. I remember thinking I was going to die at the hands of someone who said they loved me and how scared I was. Every time I've confronted her about it since then, she's ignored it and I have the screenshots for it (all confrontations were via text).   I don't think I have enough evidence, especially a week out, but I'm really scared that she will do this again to someone else. I know she is seeing someone else and I already warned them anonymously, but I'm still scared that she will do it again to someone unknowing. Should (can I??) press charges, or do I have no power in this situation anymore?	Yes
"I'm looking to get advice on regarding what to do. I know the best way to get legal advice is through a bar approved lawyer, but I would like to have some second-hand advice on what I should do regarding this situation I'm currently experiencing.   My Grandmother has been ""ill"" for a while (see can't be by herself and someone has to always watch her) and currently has her house for sale. My Oldest brother has been taking care of her primarily (Being at home with her to watch her while he tries to live out his own life) and also my mother. (She can't be alone with my grandmother due to her inability to take care of herself.)(Tdlr she is a severe alcoholic and has really bad short term memory due to it.)   During most of the time, it has been my older brother taking care of her. He even transferred household utility bills in his name (Gas, Water, Electric, Comcast, ext) and additionally paying for other expenses. (Groceries, living expenses for my mother and grandmother to survive). A Few months ago, her oldest daughter (my aunt) started giving her vitamins/pills/ect in other words ""alternate medicine"" (Whatever Steve Jobs did before he sought out real help) and in my past couple months watching over them I've notice she gets a tad better, but a bit worst each time.   In regards to what I want to ask, just recently my Aunt made herself Power of Attorney (Even though she is not the oldest sibling) even when my grandmother is in current state of mind. Her current state of mind consist of ""flashbacks"", random hysteria episodes and the inability to do the basics of living (Getting up from her bed, using the bathroom, washing herself, ect).  When she became POA she recently informed me that when the house sells that she (my aunt) will get all the money and then presumes to tell me I have to find a place for my mother since ""I'm her son"" when I can't even take care of myself in the 1st place.    So tldr - Aunt makes herself POA, sells my grandmother house keeps the money for herself and then my mother, brother, and myself don't have anywhere to go. Honestly I'm pretty scared about this and I don't really know what to do so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit or if there's a better one to post under. Background is, I live in UT, divorced, 50/50 custody. 3 children, 2 teens and an 8 year old. My child just came to me with pictures of text conversations and pictures of the edible gummy marijuana that her Dad is using. Marijuana is illegal in UT and its really upset my kids. I am so far out of my element here. I don't know a soul who does drugs, let alone what to do since their Dad is now using them.   I have several concerns. First off, apparently the kids even know who is selling him them. My feelings on marijuana aside (I do beleive it should be legalized), I don't want someone who is obtaining a currently illegal drug and selling them around my kids. Second issue, aparently the 5 times he's admitted to being stoned the kids were with him. Add to the fact he just lost his job, and these seem like red flags to me.    Do I call the police for this? He seems in a downward spiral and no, a conversation won't work. He has no family here and the latest job he lost was working for a friend so I imagine he's low on a support network right now. Would the police even care about drug use with marijuana? He won't see a therapist of any kind, doesn't believe in them. But he needs some type of wake up call.	Yes
(KS) I have moved out to an apartment. We have been fairly amicable to this point. She has decided that she wants to go ahead and file for divorce now. She lives with her parents. She pays no rent. I have a fairly new job after going to school for two years and I am still getting my financial stability under me. Her answer to the budget stated in the DRA is a hypothetical budget of what she'd spend IF/WHEN she moves into a new situation. The state of Kansas utilizes third party child support and the sooner we file, the sooner I get a massive payment that will be tough to handle as of now. Any suggestions to what I can do to postpone filing or payments? I can try and clarify with any questions. We have been married eight years and have one child. Thank you for your time.	Yes
"Location: Allegheny County, PA  I am the non-custodial mother of a 16 year old daughter. Due to a very complicated back story, I was alienated from my child for the past 11 years and she has always lived with her custodial father.   I have recently began a relationship with my daughter (i lived in a different state for most of her childhood) which is going very well. I don't bring up the past or bad mouth her father (my ex husband) but I also will not lie to her if she asks a question. We have formed a very nice mother-daughter relationship after many years of me being forced away from one.  Well, now my daughter wants to live with me, which I am 100% okay with. She said that she hates her school (she goes to a very rough school district) and has stated that her father hasn't been treating her well and has alleged abuse. I have no proof of that, but she has said that he hits her. When her father remarried there were also allegations of abuse by her step-mother that was investigated by child services but step-mom is long gone.  Long story short, she wants to live with me. I want her to have the best chance at life and will do whatever it takes to ensure she has every opportunity to achieve her goals. She asked her father (my ex husband and I do NOT communicate) and he flat out said ""no"", which was fully expected. 24 hours later she texts me saying her dad is kicking her out because she wants to have a relationship with me, her biological mother, and that I have to come pick her up. She shared text messages with me between her father and her and her ex step-mother (no idea why she's still involved) which were absolutely inappropriate and quite threatening towards my daughter.  She was allowed to pack up a few of her belongings and by the time i picked her up he had already changed all the locks on the doors and she was waiting with her minimal belongings at the end of her street.  She's 16, going on 17 in October...what do I do. I don't want the police banging down my door because they report her as a runaway. He absolutely kicked her out, I saw the conversations. I assume I have to file an emergency custody motion, I just want some advice on how to go about this. I don't know how any parent could just kick their child out of their house, especially their MINOR child. I don't want anything from him, I don't want child support, I don't want anything other than the rest of her personal belongings, and even then, everything can be replaced. But I have to get her enrolled in my school district pretty fast and I have absolutely NONE of her identification (social security card, birth certificate, etc). He doesn't have any type of health insurance for her, so it's not like I can even ask him to do that minimal bit by keeping her on his plan. Sorry, I'm rambling....  Basically, what do I need to do to cover myself and protect my daughter's best interests in all of this. She's more than old enough to have some say in all of this, i assume. I'm just working with a very limited time frame with school and everything and I guess just need some advice on where to start first. Thanks for reading if you still are, and thanks for any advice you can provide."	Yes
Guys need your help. üí™üèº  Paternity test results came back &amp; says my DNA matches 0% with alleged daughter.   Shocked.  Wife says I'm the father (lie). But if the test was wrong &amp; it's true, let's take another test. She won't do it.   Takes my money, takes my music gear, runs away with daughter. Calls me from LAX airport trying to flee the country, but can't leave without my consent. I deny her exit. She hides. Still in USA somewhere under tourist visa. Scary. Just want this all the be fixed, and she's not cooperating.   Anyone know any good lawyers for divorce/visas?   A little embarrassing, but any help/advice is appreciated, please send me a message. üôèüèº Going through a crazy week right now &amp; need your support, please reach out to anyone that can help. She just threatened my life. This is serious.	Yes
Hi, I am an 18 year old female who lives in NJ. Recently my mom discovered that she misplaced an envelope with almost all my legal documents. I could use some help finding in which order I should replace them and how to do so. Things I have: Birth certificate Bank statements A debit card with my name on it. Things I lost:  Drivers permit Social security card Passport Student ID from high school Don't have a state ID  Should I wait until I get my college ID to start trying to retrieve my permit and SSN? I'm really stuck on what to do.	Yes
"Location is Quebec, Canada  I've been living with my girlfriend for a little over a year. According to Quebec laws, that would make us common-law partners. However, my ""official"" address is still with my parents.  I want to add her to my employer's insurance policy as a common-law partner, but I also don't want to commit fraud...  What's the situation? Would I be in trouble if I added her? Are we common-law partners? If I change my address in the following days, would I have to wait a year for us to be?  Here's the relevant condition for common-law partnership according to the CRA:  &gt;has been living with you in a conjugal relationship, and this current relationship has lasted at least 12 continuous months;  Thanks"	Yes
This is in Michigan. My sister's boyfriend left her in December for a women 10 years older than him that has 4 kids. My sister has two kids and works as a waitress. He is a marijuana grower and makes all his money under the table.  My sister hasn't done anything through the courts yet.   Since he doesn't have any reported income I'm not sure how much they would make him pay her in child support. I believe he makes around 80k a year and doesn't pay taxes. Not sure the specifics but he drives an expensive new truck and bought a house. They had agreed to an amount but he hasn't kept up with it, has paid less, or not at all some months. Once his excuse was that he was going on vacation to vegas and needed gambling money.  They had agreed to him seeing them every other weekend but sometimes he takes them other times too and he's inconsistent in bringing them home. Last weekend he said Saturday morning and my sister had a babysitter waiting all day. He didn't bring them home till the next day. Another time he dropped them off a day early at the bar she works at, while she was working.  My sister just wants there to be rules to when he can take them and bring them back. And she wants child support because she doesn't make much money compared to him. Now he is insisting on half custody and says he's talking to a lawyer. What are my sisters options? She doesn't really have money for a lawyer. Are there free options out there? Or will I need to pay for a lawyer for her? If the later how do I go about doing this. I'm only 24 and haven't used a lawyer or been to court before. How much would it probably cost or what are likely outcomes. I feel very lost and very bad for my sister. I'm the only person in my family that has finished college and makes good money, so I feel like I need to help if I can in any way.	Yes
My ex and I are divorced and have joint legal custody, and I have some physical custody of our daughter. Can I move out of state with her at anytime, or do I need to get permission from her father? Thanks in advance.	Yes
Long story short when I was younger my mother cheated on my father with a new man who would do drugs together with my mom and abuse her right infront of me. My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway.   What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all. Like get some sort of financial compensation, and move far away.	Yes
"Two weeks ago my ex-fiancee left me standing at the alter. I'll spare everyone the squishier details, but after not hearing a word from her since our wedding day, she has been texting me. I asked for the engagement ring back and she said no, saying she wanted to ""cherish the memory"". I then asked her about the wedding shower gifts and the money that was donated to our honeyfund (an online registry where guests buy you honeymoon experiences as a wedding gift) and she flat out ignored the question.   My question is that if I have a right to get the ring back (its valued at 8K) and whether I have any rights to the money that was donated to our honeyfund. I would prefer to return the money to whoever gave it to us instead of funding some stupid girls trip for her and whatever insipid friend she wants to take with her."	Yes
I'm divorcing my husband due to his alcoholism and verbal/emotional abuse, I have witnesses/recordings. We own a home, and had a joint savings account. He took all the savings, and wants to take over the house. He wants me to sign my half of the title to him, so I'm left with nothing. Plus he wants to jointly file taxes together so he gets half next year. I left a month ago. I paid my half of the bills for June, but he wants me to continue to pay my half. I'm lost and don't know what my rights are.	Yes
My Grandmother lives in Florida, I live in Maine.   For some context, my Grandfather has Alzheimer's Disease and my Grandmother is the trustee of all his accounts. More context, I sent my Grandmother my old phone a couple years ago, she just upgraded and sent me back my phone without resetting it.   While clearing the junk out I noticed some suspicious messages between her and another guy so I started reading more. She is in a long distance relationship with this man and he keeps asking for money for things, thousands at a time. This has been going on for 13 months and she has sent him over $48k, and intends to send more.   She has emptied out her own IRA for this, and has nearly emptied my Grandfather's IRA, and is now using his Social Security checks to send more money, sending them further into debt. Their car is about to be reposessed, their TV, Internet, and phone are being shut of regularly, she can't pay their bills because of this.  My mother (who lives in Maine as well) wants to get legal guardianship of my Grandfather and remove my Grandmother's name from his accounts, and bring him up here with us. My Grandmother has expressed interest in the messages with the scammer that she wants to get rid of my Grandfather as soon as possible, and my mother and I want him away from her now that we know what she's doing.  Problem is, I have no idea where to start. Please help!  If you need any more information let me know, my mind is kinda scattered at the moment.	Yes
Hello everyone.  I was divorced about 3 years ago and was awarded primary custody of two boys (11, 10).  During my initial court case the judge awarded me a very small amount of child support (less than 12% of his income for two children).  I recently received a letter from the state asking if I would like it to be reevaluated and I had them do it.  The judge changed his payment to $625 per month.  That was in February.  Since then my ex-husband keeps changing jobs, going on unemployment, etc.  I received a payment today of $69.00.  When I followed up with the agency they told me he was on unemployment but I know he has a job (he is late to pick up the boys every time because of it).  What can I do?  He owes me well over $3,000 and I am having a hard time keeping up with my bills.  I feel like he is doing this on purpose just to make my life difficult.  Is there any action I can take to get him to pay the money he owes his children?	Yes
My boyfriend has a 4 year old. On March 12, 2017, he was dropped off with us for 1 week, per verbal and written agreement. It was to be a one week on, one week off arrangement.   She neglected him, leaving him alone all day when he was little, resulting in him being behind mentally, emotionally and behaviorally. She passed him off to babysitters at random.  She has another child, a 7 year old that she did sign over her rights to the child's fathers sister.   I asked her to sign over her rights to me and our boys father, but she refused.   It has since been 17 months since she has had any contact whatsoever with her son, and he is to be enrolled in pre-k in a month. Legally, she can show up and take him.   I've been told that 6 months is abandonment, and to terminate rights you have to put something in the paper for 3 weeks to notify her. Being that it's been almost 18 months, is there any other way we can go to court without getting a lawyer and fighting?	Yes
Hey everyone,   Here's the situation. My mother is recently widowed and I'm unable to get her down into the bay area where I live (she lives 3 hours away from me) so that I can stay with her and look after her. My niece suggested that she could look after my mom but I need to get her over here into CA first. My niece is from the Philippines and I don't know where to start. I'm unsure what Visa she needs, what hoops I need to jump through/she needs to jump through, etc. Any advice or starting point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone! :D	Yes
My friend moved to Canada to be with this girl, and has been married to her for 2 years and 2 months. Now, she's saying she wants a divorce. Starting next week, he's going to be visiting friends and family for 3 weeks. Is leaving on a trip a bad idea for him right now? If not, are there any precautions he should take before he leaves? And can she do anything to have him deported now that they've been married for over 2 years?  The only assets they have is their condo, which is paid off. It's their registered marital home and is in both their names.	Yes
Hello, I was wondering if someone on here could help point me in the right direction.    Back in March 2017 my 18 year old daughter contacted me and asked me to come pick her up and asked if she could live with us.  She had been out on her own since Jan 2016 when her and her mom got into a fight and her mom kicked her out.    I jumped on a plane immediately and flew to NC to pick her up.  After getting her settled in and enrolled and transfered in to the local High School I decided to contact the OAG to file a change of status and termination of CS.   The OAG mailed me the required forms and gave me instructions on how to prove her residency. Which I sumbitted per their request.    Now child support was due to terminate in June 2017 so there was merely 3 months of payments left from a 17 year history of the order. I did not want my ex to have anything she did not deserve especially once I learned my daughter had essentially been homeless since Jan 2016.   The AOG placed the moneys on hold while they verified the change.  Months went by.  Finally received a status update from the AOG on June 20th 2017.  However it was not was I was hoping for.  They informed me that with out the other parents signature stating she is giving me credit for those three months the AOG states they can not return the money to me.    The OAG claims it is their policy but refused to give me documentation stating the legal procedure claiming it is not public record.    It has been one month since they mailed my ex wife the documentation and she never responded.  I called the AOG and asked them what the next step was and they told me they do not have an answer for me.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor who ended up just contacting someone else who is going to send another letter to my ex wife inwhich will go straight to the trash.    So my question is what policy is the OAG following that stipulates they must have a response from the other party to determine status change?  They claimed it is not public record when I asked about such policy.  Also if I were to file a suit in court on what grounds would I file since the court order has already expired since my daughter is 18 and has now graduated?    A lawyer would cost too much in comparison to what the AOG is holding.   Any advice would be appreciative.	Yes
When It comes to custody, can my girlfriend claim that my car is unsafe and I have to find different transportation for our son?	Yes
I'll try to keep this as short as possible... Divorce in 2012 - Ex Wife was awarded the home and signed a decree agreeing to refinance the home within 60 days and hold me harmless. She has never done this and is constantly late. She is up to 120 days past due now and I finally was able to contact her through a friend's cell phone and she says she's filing bankruptcy and to contact her attorney.  Is there anything I can do or should I just go ahead and file bankruptcy.	Yes
So I am 18 and will be starting my senior year and I have 3 classes left taht I want to take online. If I move out will my dad still have to pay my mother child support? If you have questions I will answer thank you. 	Yes

(Posting this for my uncle)  Some family friends (A&amp;B) have been taking care of their family member‚Äôs (C) children for the last 8-9 years. C has not helped A &amp; B with the children (age range 8-11) and has had very little contact with them. B has quite a few children, 1 of which they are responsible for (4 children in total). A &amp; B have decided that due to the financial burden &amp; C going back on the promise to help with the children, it is time to get proper custody of the children but they are unsure of where to start.   C‚Äôs home environment is not good due to C &amp; their spouse favoring the other children in the household, (spouse has 3 other children from another relationship) the children having to move schools, and C &amp; spouse tend to be abusive to the children and each other. A&amp;B have had guardianship of the children for the last 8-9 years, have taken them to all of their appointments, and been to all of their parent meetings with school and whatnot. The children‚Äôs teachers have never met C. C has stated before that if it‚Äôs too much of a ‚Äòburden‚Äô they can pick up the children and A&amp;B could wipe their hands of the situation. This is not in the children‚Äôs best interests due to them being treated badly in C‚Äôs household.   Where should A&amp;B start? A&amp;B are both older, and aren‚Äôt very wealthy. The children live peacefully with A&amp;B due to them not playing favorites and they were raised by A&amp;B. C has stated that they would help financially &amp; visit the children but have not done so. It has come to the point where the children don‚Äôt care for their parent and they don‚Äôt want anything to do with them. A&amp;B do not want them to go into a toxic environment nor have them lose out socially. I was giving them the advice to see if they could find a pro bono attorney, though I‚Äôm unsure if anyone would take this case. A&amp;B fear that the legal costs would burden the children &amp; them greatly. They are also scared that one day C will take the children away due to tax benefits and government assistance. That‚Äôs another reason that A&amp;B want custody (besides concern for the children‚Äôs wellbeing) C gets a good amount of government assistance but doesn‚Äôt help with their other children. Any advice is much appreciated.   TL;DR: A&amp;B have raised C‚Äôs children for the last 8-9 years. C isn‚Äôt helping as agreed. A&amp;B want custody. The 3 children don‚Äôt want anything to do with their parent (8-11 y/os) C probably has never heard of sterilization, at this rate they‚Äôll have enough kids to start a baseball team.  (A&amp;B are grandparents/aunt or uncle to C‚Äôs children.)	Yes
Hello,   I have a 15 yr old sister in Arizona who is being neglected. She spent the summer staying at my 21 yr old sisters boyfriends parents house and they were okay with that. Now that school has started they are not okay with housing a 15 year old. My mother is never home, she has a bad hoarding issue and the house is a terrible place for anyone to be living. She has said that she does not want my sister living with her and is not helping to try to get her situated. I am 26, work full time, engaged and living in Nevada. I would like to bring my sister here and enroll her into a new HS but I don't know where to begin.   Any advice?	Yes
"Okay, so there's this huge conflict breaking our family apart right now, a lot of information is being thrown and I have remained neutral through all this.  So a few days ago my cousin, let's call him Joe. Joe started sending the female cousins sexually explicit text messages (not too sure of the content, but they've all said it's dirty, inappropriate, and flirty. Joe is I'm his 30s married for 10 years with 2 kids. All of the female cousins are over 18, and we live in Illinois, the United States. Joe also helped the eldest female cousin involved, we'll call her Sally, by helping her with her r√©sum√©. She sees the r√©sum√© being bait for starting to message her. The messages went on for a few days and even spread to other female cousins. Yesterday, Joe came on to the Family Whatsapp group chat and said his phone/account was hacked and to disregard any messages accordingly. His phone passcode is pretty easy and doesn't do 2-step verification. Joe and his wife left the group chat shortly and blocked a lot of people on social medias. Soon after another cousin, ""Simon"", said he was ready to kill someone, and me not knowing about the situation yet thought he was joking. So I commented, he then said now is not the time implying he was serious. Simon has a firearms license, but doesn't own any of his own (that I know of). He lives with his parents still. This morning, a few sentences were said that especially needed legal backing:  ""The police can't get involved, everyone is over 18 so there won't be a case""  ""Whatsapp encrypts all their data, if the government can't get in, a hacker can't""  Is there anything I can do to clarify anything? Especially those last 2 sentences were especially peculiar. Please help by any means. Thank you. I will answer any extra questions needed."	Yes
"Location: Colorado  I'm in my mid-20s. My mom was recently served with a ""Petition for Dissolution of Marriage"" document by my stepdad. I went over to talk to her about it, and she started handing me things to bring back to my place. These include legal documents for the ownership of several valuable horses that she owns ($20k+) as well as two guns that she uses for horse-mounted shooting (if it matters, they're crippled guns only capable of shooting blanks).  I have a suspicion that this was the wrong decision, but I just took the items from her and put them in my car because she was crying and I just didn't know what to do in the moment. She also tried to get me to take my half sister's passport (she's a minor), but I refused to take that.  What sort of legal risk am I at for being in possession of these items? I believe the Dissolution of Marriage document states that she's not allowed to hide assets."	Yes
She said that it will automatically default in divorce this month unless we do something.  What are our options?  I haven't signed anything to be clear.	Yes
" My friend's parents got divorced 2 years ago and she's now living with her dad and brother. She's told me that they smoke weed and she's allowed to drink underage. I'm worried about her safety because of obvious reasons. I know the police have been to their house multiple times (not for drug related reasons). I don't know if I should give an anonymous tip to the police or call Child Protective Services. Is there any way to tip CPS anonymously? I don't want to be known as ""That Asshole"" that reported the drug use."	Yes
I'm filing for divorce in TN.  We have no children, I bought a house before we were married and car in both names. We are  filing but can we do agreed divorce? He wants the car but is fine with not asking for anything from house.  What all do I need to do besides fill out paper work , get it notarized and file at court house?   I'm trying not to get lawyer being it seems pretty straight forward	Yes
Throwaway for obvious reasons:  I'm writing this on behalf of my sister whom after over 10 years of marriage is faced with a failing marriage. I would personally define the relationship as abusive on both sides. However the Husband physically has abused her on occasions and has basically financially dominated the household, where my sister gets what she gets and that's it.  There is also a business involved. I can get specifics as needed however I wanted to start a discussion.  My Sister was informed by her Husband that he's gone to a lawyer and has removed a good portion of the business account to an account in his name - apparently under advice from his lawyer. He's also cancelled all of the credit cards of my sister as well.  She still has access to the buisness account and asked me if she should take the money a lawyer on her side would want (5k is the number I was given) however I'm not sure on the specifics again.  Her plea to me is honestly, she doesn't know what to do. She's depressed all the time in an abusive relationship. There are two Children involved in their teens. Their assets look good from the outside however there is a mortgage that isn't getting paid apparently. Like I said, she's just overwhelmed and does not know what steps she can take.  Also - just as to why I'm doing this - he has keyloggers on all the computers in the house, tracks her moves through her phone. The only reason why I haven't gone numerous times to deal with him is honestly the legal ramifications. So I want to help my sister but honestly I don't have the answers so I feel I'd reach out here.  I wish I could give more but obviously my sister is ashamed of all this, as we come from a divorced household she views this as a huge failure on our side.  Thank you for any advice and I will do my best to answer followup questions if there are any.	Yes
So, I'm probably about to take a position as a server and wanted to know how paying child and tips works. I know I can expect normal garnishment from my check, but I want to be able to get ahead and put a good dent in my back owed.	Yes
Hello, I am a father who loves his daughter in the state of Florida. However, my ex-wife is trying to take my daughter away from me on the grounds that there is marijuana in my home. In the past 6 months, I had to move back in with my family as I had been facing, like many fellow Americans, the harsh reality of unemployment. I do not smoke personally, but my family members do smoke marijuana. My daughter is unaware of the smoking and lives a comfortable life with her own bedroom, a lot of toys, and a lot of healthy, organic food.   My ex-wife is trying to obtain full-custody as she is uncomfortable with our daughter living in a home where marijuana use occurs. I am now employed and trying to move out, however, I am afraid that in the mean time my pride and joy could be taken away from me. I have tried to do my own slipshod research and have read that I may need to get a house study done to help my case.   Lawyers of Reddit, could you please give me legal advice on the situation so that I may legally keep my daughter? Any advice is greatly appreciated. Thank you!   (TL;DR: I live with my family who smokes marijuana and my ex-wife wants full custody of our child because she disapproves of the drug use. How do I keep partial custody of my daughter IN FLORIDA?)	Yes
My ex husband recently allowed our 17 year old daughter to get a pit bull. The animal was free because the owner didn't want it. My daughter has paid for the things it needs (food, crate, collar, etc.) Ex husband has not paid for anything.   The dog is living at his house. He got mad at my daughter and told her she needed to take the dog to my house. I said NO. That's his dog, his responsibility. Ex husband believes the dog is the property of our daughter and therefore the animal is her responsibility. I said he's wrong.  I made it clear to my daughter that the dog cannot come here. I already have 2 dogs, which is the most my rental contract allows me to have.  Also, I am not interested in replacing either of these animals if/when they die. Pet ownership is expensive and time consuming. I have already obligated myself to these two dogs as long as they live and that's that.  I told my ex husband before he got her the pet that it would not be coming to my home. I also told him I didn't think it was a good idea to get our daughter a dog at this point in her life. At age 17, she has a lot going on with schooling and work. Also, if she wants to get her own place to live, many landlords will not allow aggressive breeds.  But since she is a minor, can she legally own the dog? Or is the dog the property of her father?  For example, if the dog were to cause damage to another person's property who would be liable? I insist ex husband is liable because it is a pet he harbors on his property.  So what happens when my daughter turns 18 and her dad gets mad at her again and tells her to leave and take the dog with her? Whose dog is it then?  We have shared custody and live in Ohio.	Yes
"I am 18 years old and decided to change my name for a fresh start along with starting a new college and moving away after coming to terms with how traumatized I've been for years because I was repeatedly trafficked and exploited at 12 years old by a stranger and wasn't honest with myself, my family, or the authorities about it up until it started eating me alive once I turned 18. Luckily I'm alive and healthy. There is currently an open case against him. When I testify, will he find out my new name?   I wrote this as the reason why on my petition and the lady judge said to me, ""not only am I granting this- my clerk is going to seal it""   I appreciate that. I didn't know that was going to happen. I have all my copies stating it. I'm happy because now I can start my new college under my name in 2 weeks, but how sealed is sealed? Like nobody at all can access this?   My father is actually a criminal lawyer but since he doesn't agree with this name change regardless of the reason I haven't been able to ask him for any advice and the clerks aren't really that friendly so I was in and out."	Yes
Hi all, so I'd appreciate it if I could get some advice on this situation. Some context, my grandmother has had three husbands. The first one died when my mother was 3 months old. The second was found to be cheating, was kicked out, and divorced. Her third husband, however, took serious advantage of her being a single mother so he could sexually assault my mother. Unfortunately, this wasn't a one-time thing. He was charged in the early '80s for it. There was a condition for him not to go near anyone under the age of 16 unless they were accompanied by an adult, and a restraining order put on him to not go near my mother. In '85 he built a brand new house, and he wanted my grandmother, uncle and mother to move into this new house that he built, but they all refused because the house they were living in (which is the same house my grandma still resides in), was built by her first husband - their father. So he (her 3rd husband, not her 1st) got drunk one day and sold the house he had built, for pretty much nothing, in an attempt to gain permission to move in to my grandmas house (he still had the restraining order on him at this point), which was successful.  After he moved in, he sexually assualted my mom continuously right up until '96, then he proposed that same year to my grandma, which gave my mother a 6 month respite. What was really odd though, was that he married my grandmother on the same day that is my mother and fathers wedding anniversary. He started sexually assaulting my mother again in '97, right up until 2 years ago. It's a real long, unpleasant story. Nevertheless, he's in jail as I'm typing this, and my grandmother is actively seeking a lawyer to remove him off her house title.   My question is; could she get this marriage anulled in order to make the separation easier? She is willing to let him have all of his belongings, including his boat and the only vehicle they have, as long as she gets to keep her house. She see's how twisted this man is now, and wants nothing more to do with him. She wants him and his children off her will, and she wants her relationship restored with us. This man, only last year had another 'peace bond' applied to him, stating that he must remain at least 100m away from my mother and sister at all times. Oh yea, did I forget mention he had done this to my sister ever since she was 4? But that's another long, uncomfortable story. Any help would be appreciated. Please help.	Yes
So there's a non-zero chance that I might have to try and get custody of my daughter from my ex-wife to me in the next couple of years.   This will be due to abusive behavior by my ex to her, documentation from the school counselors , and my daughter's wishes.  (And she's old enough to have input with the court.)  I'm more than willing to have this fight for my daughter and acknowledge it won't be an easy one.   However,  there's a clause in our decree that states the kids have to go to a specific school district that I no longer live in.  (Cannot afford it with child support / daycare)  Would that be overridden as a part of the custody change or would the court want me to move back?	Yes
My brother and his wife are raising 7 kids in poverty (we're not from a good area).  My fiance and I recently graduated from college and both found high paying jobs in a different state.  If possible, we would like to have one of the girls live with us through high school (currently about to start 8th grade) and help make sure she gets into a good college.    What is the process to make this happen?  I have been researching obtaining guardianship, but it looks like it would involve a full investigation and I don't want to risk him losing all of his kids.    Ideally, I'd want them to agree with this and sign over rights so that she can legally live with me, be under my insurance, etc.	Yes
Hello, my name is logan I am fifteen and about to turn 16 in two months and I have a very important question. Me and my mother have been constantly fighting for three years she has put me through abusive relationships with boyfriends, took my money, did drugs and slept for a whole two weeks while I got raped while i was walking to gas station and much more that has ruined my life due to her immaturity. She lost her job for pepper spraying me and she blames me for ruining her life all the time. I suffer each day and I just want to be free at this point. I am about to get a job at wall mart and I get a social security check each month (haven't seen a dollar of it since I was born). My plea to the judge will be that I want to be Emancipated so that I may be released from my pain of having to live with this monster and start my life. She has not had a job in 8 months and isnt getting one and just lives off my social security. I also have a sister who is 31 and is willing to give me a place to live till i can get enough money to go on my own. Yes I know this sounds like every teenage plea that their parents are horrible and that they are mature but this is different. I have attempted suicide many times and my childhood is basically over and I dont really see a point to go on at all but either way I just want to get out. Do you think I will be accepted for Emancipation in your opinion or not I just want some sort of reassurance. Thank you for the read and im willing to answer any questions.	Yes
Long story short, he has had the same job 2-ish years, has had it set up to be withdrawn from his paycheck automatically, and for some reason it's not deducted in full, and we have had to constantly pay the $6 or some odd low denomination manually as we get notices... This alone is infuriating.  We also receive constant notices from the DMV about his license being revoked due to lack of payment despite not being late and paying in full, monthly.   There seems to be an endless loop of no one to call and miscommunication but it reoccurs monthly or every three months, rinse and repeat. he is at the pint of just paying whatever comes in, and that I can't really get behind. I understand he is just tired of fighting, but really, what should I have him do to sort this out and get these letters, the run around and the miss communication to stop?	Yes
I haven't seen my soon to be ex and my daughter in over a year. I have no clue where she is. What can I do to be legally separated from her while unable to communicate with her?	Yes
Hello. My father is abusive not physcially but is down right evil and awfull.  We are stuck in this shitty situation. My parents never taught us how to drive. And we never went to college. Cuz no money. Now im wondering the house was given to my mom from her father. All the bills are in my fathers name. My mom and dad have a shared bank account but hes the holder. I dont think if we went to any law for help it would be in our favor because of that. Any help? Do i need to start recording his crazy antics? 	Yes
As the title states, my evil MIL let it be known today that she secretly obtained a DNA test on my 8 month old daughter without mine or my husband's consent or knowledge while she was babysitting our child for an hour. I don't know what she thought the outcome would be, I suppose that part doesn't matter.   Apparently, she obtained a cheap drug store paternity test and swabbed my daughter and her husband's (my daughter's grandfather's) cheek. She must have forged mine or my husband's signature because neither of us knew they did this. My husband has explicitly stated he did not consent to the test and I obviously did not either.   I am angry and I feel completely violated on behalf of my child.  From what I've read, a lab needs one parent's consent before performing these tests. Again, my husband did not consent and I did not consent. Either they forged our signatures or the lab they used is up to some super shady stuff.   I live in Missouri. I plan on filing a restraining order against them first thing in the morning as well as speaking with an attorney about any charges that can be filed. Am I just reaching here or is what they did truly illegal and reprehensible by law?   Can the lab be sued for not obtaining proper consent?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
My husband and I are getting a dissolution.  He has a lawyer and I don't.  We have two kids.  His will stay in the house and maintain primary residence.  I will get he kids 2 Monday and Thursday 5-8 and every other weekend.  My question is about child support payments.  The dissolution paperwork stipulates that I will be obligated to pay $645.94 and half of the daycare ($1300) costs plus half of any extracurricular fees and medical fees not covered by his insurance.  Just the child support and daycare would be just shy of almost half of my monthly income.  My ex makes roughly $20,000 more a year than me.  Is this typical in terms of payment or is he trying to screw me?	Yes
This was first posted under r/relationship_advice but it was suggested that I might want to post it here too.  My mother been a total Bitch to both me and her husband for over a year. This has got me worried that my stepfather who is the nicest person I know might say enough and leave.   My mom has mental issues and she doesn't always take her medication and that can make her paranoid and really grumpy. She has been really bad this month and when I asked her if she was taking her medication she told me she doesn't need me to tell her when to take her medication.  She has been very hostile towards her husband ( at supper last night he asked her to pass the salt she threw the salt container at him. She said she was sorry later but worried he is going to say enough and I will be stuck with her being even worse because I he helps keep her acting out sometimes.  I don't know what I can do. My stepfather is the best thing ever to come my way. He helps me with so much and treats me like his real daughter. He loves me. He doesn't just say it ( he says it lots ) he also shows me by his actions like never lying to me helping me with school and when I have a problem I know I can tell him and he won't freak out on me. He has family time once a week most of the time my mom doesn't even participate.  My mom never tells me she loves me and most of the time I am sure she would be happier if I wasn't there. This is not new for me. I have been dealing with my mom's shitty parenting all my life but I don't want her to chase away the best thing in my life. I know she should be that and I want her to be but she doesn't care about me half as much as my stepfather. He has been my daddy for 4 years now and I don't want to loose him.  TL;DR My mom is not talking her medication and she is making both me and my stepfather unhappy . I am afraid my stepfather will leave me with her.	Yes
"Firstly I'm on mobile and my apologies if this is the wrong sub.  I have trouble cutting long stories short sorry. I have a 4 year old nephew who is the son of my sister. She is still legally married to the father but they haven't lived together since before nephew's first birthday. Husband lives with his mother in a house full of garbage because they're hoarders. There's literally garbage trails throughout the house. The dog goes to the bathroom in the house and it isn't cleaned up for days if at all. Husband has a minimum wage job and I believe his mother does as well. She is severely bipolar.  My sister, nephew, mom, and moms boyfriend all live together in a 3 bedroom 1 bath house. Sister and nephew share a room and a bed because my mother wants her own room. My 71 year old disabled grandma lives in the in law suite that used to be the garage at one point before we moved in. I'll call my grandmas part the ""downstairs"" and the main house the ""upstairs"" for less confusion and it's easier for me.  Nephew has to go downstairs to eat because no one upstairs feeds him real food. They give him chips or cookies if he says he's hungry. My grandma makes him actual meals and sits at the table with him. He also is still kind of potty training and he goes downstairs to go because my grandma doesn't yell at him to hurry up and stands on the other side of the door to reassure him, which he likes. Grandma is also the other one that takes him outside to play. My nephew doesn't go to any kind of school and he isn't vaccinated. He had almost all of his teeth pulled due to rot before he turned 4. The rest are capped and he's due to get a couple more pulled and capped. Kids got like all his teeth already. He hasn't been to a doctor in more than 2 years because of his unvaccinated state.  Everyone upstairs smokes weed and cigarettes constantly with the windows closed. That's another reason nephew likes being downstairs. They're careless about leaving things out where nephew gets to them. More than once he has picked up a bong and put his mouth on it or picked up a joint and ""smoked"" it. They yell at him for touching their stuff. My mother has burned him on the face with a cigarette and claimed it was a cold sore and then when she was called out she said she didn't realize he was behind her when she was talking. Nephew was 3 and he isn't a quiet kid. She also let him climb on the furniture and when he fell she yelled at him and made him lie down. When my sister and I got home 2 hours later his head was swollen and he had thrown up. We took him to the hospital and he had a concussion; he was also 3 at this time.  My sister just got a real job for the first time in 4 years after her second denial for disability happened. She worked under the table for a couple people through the years but claimed that she hallucinated and couldn't drive. Said the reason she left her husband (he left her) was because she couldn't get out of bed sometimes and needed her family's help to raise nephew. Heh.  My issue is I live out of state now and have for a year. I talk to my grandma and sister everyday so I know what's going on in the house. I didn't call when I lived there because I was in the house and I didn't want my nephew to be sent to a foster family or have cps come against me. I don't think if he was taken from my sister that he would go to his father because of the hoarding and animal issues. He has an uncle on his father's side but I don't think his wife would want to take on the ""burden"" of my nephew. She isn't a nice person. I will trek across the universe for my nephew in a heartbeat and have the space and means to care for him. He knows my fiance and I and we FaceTime about once a week. My fiance and I lived downstairs with my grandma for over a year before we moved here and everyday I took care of my nephew. My fiance works full time and makes good money to where I don't have to. I am worried though that my calling the state will come back against my grandma or worse they'll take nephew away and put him with a foster family because I am out of state but only a 5 hour drive."

Hello Legal Advice, Thank you ahead of time for your time and help.  In short, my mother is going through a divorce with her abusive husband, and is at the stage where discoveries for both parties has been made, and before any court dates.  The strange circumstance is that her husband gets away with lots of different crimes due to his mother working in the courthouse. This is a small county with a very small county courthouse, and everyone there talks to each other. I realize that it sounds slightly outlandish, but both lawyers and judges have been swayed by her, and it is not a fair court system for my mother to get divorced in. He has been pardoned of his fifth DUI today, and my mother is now that she is afraid to talk to this county judge about having what is fair to her from the divorce.  Therefore, is there anyway she can have her lawyer move the case and any future court appearances to a different county courtroom, with different personnel?   Thank you all again, and have a good day!	Yes
I'm in the middle of getting my flight (China Eastern from US to Japan) cancelled in order to attend my great grandmother's funeral. In order to get the full refund, they're asking for legal proof of relation in addition to the death certificate since we don't have the same last name. Her grandson (my father) doesn't have the same last name either. Any tips for how to go about this? When I google I only see stuff about immigration.	Yes
I was at my ex's house, long story short he started to beat me and I told him if he didn't stop I would break his laptop so I did. He ended up throwing me out(literally) and beating me, while he was beating me his mom jumped in and started kicking me. I went to the police today to press charges.  I guess basically I'm asking what happens next and can I get in trouble for this as well even tho I was the victim ?	Yes
Ok, so I'm going to use 'wife' b/c that's how we considered ourselves, but we never filed a marriage license.  My wife moved out June 21 and took our nearly 5 yr old daughter with her.  I've seen my daughter less than 8 hours since then, spread across about 3 widely separated days.  Tuesday I had a massive panic attack due to everything that's going on, and apparently my texts to wife were too much for her. She cut off all communication and told me not to contact her.  Previous to this, even that night, she would have our daughter call me almost every evening ranging from about 9-11pm.   Well, last night, no call.  My wife has untreated depression, and while were together she would often stay in bed all day, barely, if at all, supervising our daughter during the day. I have multiple people who can attest to this.  She has also said to me that she has had suicidal thoughts, but she doesn't act on them due to not wanting to abandon our daughter.  I have reason to believe this is still the case where she is staying.  I have been told that I have enough reason to call 911 and have her committed. I have not done this b/c I believed she was not a danger. But w/o contact, I am much less sure.  I do not want to take such drastic action, as I believe that would destroy any possibility of us reconciling, but if I become convinced that our daughter may suffer, then I must.  She currently has my car, b/c when she left she did NOT tell me she 'was leaving' but that she was going to spend a few days at her dad's, which isn't unusual. I haven't asked for the car back yet, b/c I love this woman, and I believe that we could rebuild the foundation of our relationship and work things out.  My basic question, however, is that w/o having daily contact with my daughter, I do not know what level of care she is getting, and that worries me. What can I do?!  Super stressed, so this was a bit rambling. I'll answer any ?'s I can.	Yes
First post, but I'm at my wits end. My ex (divorce final 3 1/2 years ago) is now on trial for lewd and lascivious acts against a minor. The child is a relative, but not one of our children. I have repeatedly refused to get in the middle of the case, in order to keep my kids out of it, and to maintain my sanity for their sake. Our kids have been solely with me for almost 2 years, and blissfully unaware of what their father has been accused of (I don't speak negatively about him to/in front of them, but I believe he's guilty).  The alleged acts are from 2009, when we were together and my oldest was less than 2 years old. He and his attorney just served me with a subpoena to be in court, along with my now 9 year old child.  My kids have been with me 100% because of an order from superior court (California) that their father cannot be with any child without supervision by another adult, and his girlfriend doesn't qualify. Our divorce got settled with 50/50 custody, and that still stands, as I lack the funds to hire a lawyer to go for full custody at this point.  All I want is to keep my kids out of this whole drama - they (and I) have no involvement. Wtf can I do???	Yes
"Apparently my ""father"" paid $800 for child support within the last month, after being almost 4 years behind, and I just now found out after telling my mom I was going to ask him where my money was, that she spent the $800 on my grad party without even telling me he paid it. My dad keeps giving my mom money now and now that I'm 18 it should be going to me.   I'm pissed because that's my money now that I'm 18, she didn't tell me about it, and I'm trying to get things paid for college, and trying to buy a car. Do I have a right to be pissed? Is there anything I can do legally?"	Yes
I have never liked my first name and recently I have undergone some emotional trauma related to it, so I want to legally continue using my second name instead. I'm a 23 year old senior college student and I would like to know what would be the legal repercussions and what I should start to do in order to stick to this identity. I have read about some people being able to do this without changing their name but I fear that I might do something wrong in the process. I will greatly appreciate any and all feedback.	Yes
Baby born in Canada, shared between parents. Court looks inevitable at least eventually. What should she do to protect herself and save on legal expenses? How is it determined where court happens?   There are so many questions but really we just don't want her blindsided and having to fight for custody (even shared) in the US. Also what is to stop her partner from taking her to the US and not bringing her back? I believe without some agreement in place the police can't really intervene, correct?	Yes
TL;DR My uncle stole ~$1000 from my father after his final social security direct deposit and we have proof. We want to force payment since we don't think he will cooperate, but we don't want to put his ass in jail. Can someone comment on whether we could seek a judgment to garnish his wages in a civil suit and not a criminal suit?  Long version: My father died at the beginning of July and my uncle helped himself to his final social security deposit afterwards, we believe by way of forging checks.  We wish to recoup this money and apply it to funeral expenses. On principle I'd rather not let him get away with this. But my brother and I agree that we don't really wanna put the fool behind bars for this and we're not sure if this would be criminal or civil if it came to court. My brother is in the process of getting executorship because I am overseas and it's easier for him.  My question is, could we press charges and keep him from being incarcerated? We both had the thought that since it's related to social security and that's federal, this could blow up in a way we don't want.   We're of course trying to settle this out of court first and foremost, but my uncle stays unbelievably intoxicated between alcohol and prescription pills he gets from the VA. He is almost never in a sober state of mind and therefore next to impossible to reason with. In some stupid way he was actually trying to dupe us into believing the bank was at fault for the money he withdrew and that is the reason he actually mailed the bank statement proving his guilt to us.  Thanks in advance.	Yes
I'm a mother of a super awesome three year old girl. I married my husband one year ago.   My daughter's biological father was abusive and an alcoholic throughout our entire relationship.  I have been her sole caregiver since birth, but for nearly a year I did allow supervised visitation 2 days a week.  During that time, he lived with his mother, and by her own admission, she provided care(meals, baths, etc) during his visitation.    He has never held a job longer than 6 months.  Recently, he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and other various drug related charges.  He is currently in drug court, is unemployed, and seems to be completely spiraling out.  Prior to his meth spiral, all visitation was facilitated through his sister, who is a social worker. I went no contact with him because his verbal abuse persists regardless of our relationship status.  Three months ago, his sister refused to facilitate any type of visitation with our daughter because he insisted we allow him to take her to his girlfriend's house overnight.  His girlfriend is a meth addict, covered in fresh track marks who lost her own children because of drug addiction and neglect.  Even if her bio dad DID beat his addiction issues (he won't, but hypothetically) he will still be inconsistent, verbally abusive and dangerous to my bubbly baby girl if he ever has access to her alone.   I was lucky to marry a man nothing like her bio father. He is absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to us. He's involved in every aspect of her upbringing, responsible, and brings peace and consistency to both our lives.  He and my daughter are the best of friends. She's nuts over him. She's a mommy's girl, but if she cant have me, she chooses my husband (even over her grandparents that spoil her to pieces). She deserves this father. She does not deserve a lifetime of inconsistent, likely very psychologically damaging and physically dangerous situations her bio father will put her in if given the chance.  How do we begin the process of terminating bio dad's rights/step-parent adoption?  What proof is needed in the event bio dad contests termination of rights?	Yes
"Ftp, on mobile, please excuse formating.   I need some family law advice. Here's the situation: me (37f) was named god mother to 2 lovely young women when they were born. Now the younger of the 2 (17f in AR), is working 2 jobs as a Senior in HS, lost over 10% of her body weight in just 3 months (140 -&gt; 110) and still losing, she losing hair, doesnt sleep. Shes helps pay rent, buys school clothes for herself and younger sibs, and buy groceries. Her mom (the one who named me godmom) works while her POS step dad doesnt. Im terrified that if I cant get her out, she may attempt suicide because (and Im quoting here), ""I dont wanna live anymore."" Added complication, I live in a different state. What, if anything, can I do?"	Yes
He has an attorney.  There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her.  Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	Yes
I'll try to keep this brief.  My parents' divorce paperwork from 1989 in MO says that my father is supposed to pay for my wedding, if I have one. My mother says it is in there because she is very poor (she works for a non-profit), and my father's very wealthy, (He retired at 40).  While my father and I aren't super close, we're not estranged either. I live in CA so we see each other once a year, unless there's a major family event. I didn't know about this being in my parents' divorce agreement, so I'd saved up the money to pay for my dream wedding myself, but when I called my mother to tell her about my engagement, she immediately brought it up, even sent me pictures of that section of their divorce paperwork.  I'm not sure whether or not to ask him to honor that part of the divorce agreeement, but my mother is practically SALIVATING about it. (Their divorce wasn't exactly amicable.)  So while I'm weighing other options, I figured I'd ask so I have a clearer view of the situation. Is something like this enforceable? And if it is, what are the steps for pursuing it if he refuses when asked? If I don't ask him to pay for my wedding, and just pay for it myself, does my mother have the option of going after my dad?	Yes
I'm 20 years old. I have one little brother, he's 8. He's with me right now. All of my relatives live in South Africa. My aunt and uncle are flying out to help me but they won't be here until Friday morning. I just need to know where to go to get the ball rolling.   My parents spoke of a will but I haven't been able to find it. My mom was an attorney so they didn't use one that I can contact. I know my parents had money, but it was all tied up in real estate. There are tenants living on 3 of their properties. Two sets I'm sure will be respectful but my parents were trying to evict the other set and I'm afraid they'll use this to take advantage of me and try and get some kind of claim to the house. Please don't think I'm selfish for thinking about money, but I need to take care of my brother.   I have both my parents credit cards and bank cards so money isn't an issue for the time being. But can the bank/credit card companies freeze the cards if they find out that my parents passed?   Most importantly I'm worried about my brother. I think my aunt will try and take custody of him. She spoke about bringing him back to SA with her. Can she do that? I have no job. I guess now I have money but I have no figures right now.  One of the reasons I'm worried about custody is that I regularly smoked weed before all of this. Now that I have to take care of my brother I obviously won't be doing that anymore. But I'm afraid that they'll drug test me and say I'm unfit for custody. With the amount I smoked it'll probably take 3+ months to get out of my system, maybe up to six. I've also been in two at fault car accidents this year, but I wasn't under the influence or anything. Can my aunt use this against me?  I don't even know what else I should be asking. Just a point in the right direction. This is the first time I've been able to sit down and think. I'm about to start doing some googling but I figured I'd post here first.   Thanks.	Yes
"I'm in Illinois in the US. My two brothers and I want to obtain Power of Attorney on my mother as she gets older. I have 3 questions:  1. I found [these (1)](https://powerofattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Illinois-Durable-Power-of-Attorney-Form.pdf) [two (2)](https://powerofattorney.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/illinois-medical-power-of-attorney-form.pdf) forms online. Are they sufficient or is there an ""official"" form that I should use instead?  2. The above-mentioned forms indicate that my mom can't name co-agents. Does this mean that only one of us can have PoA at a time, and the others would only get it through succession?  3. Do the forms need to be filed with any government agency to be official, or do we simply keep copies and present them as needed?  Thank you for your help. I know I'm just another stranger on the internet, but this will mean a lot to a group of real people that will benefit from it."	Yes
"[Throwaway for legal reasons]  Hello everyone,  As the title says. I'm looking to divorce my wife. I've been out of the military since June 2016 and am now on Inactive Ready Reserves. We got married in October 2014. In April of 2015, she gave me 6000 dollars to put down on my vehicle. While in the military and once I got out I have been financially supporting her while she attended college full time. I am working full time and going to school full time. In March of 2016 we co-signed a vehicle which I am the primary holder. We have two dogs. I have been paying all the bills  Move Forward to now. I have moved out of the house. The house is her aunt's. I met a woman who I kissed(which will be talked later). That's it. Now she found out, and is threatening to take me to court if I don't pay her back the 6000 dollars and pay for the damages the dogs did to the house. She is also threatening to call my commander and tell them I committed ""adultery"". I am receiving VA benefits, and a disability check which she wants to take away. She wants me to pay for her bills until they add up to the 6000 dollars plus the damages. I am just looking for the best way to handle this because I'm honestly unsure of what to do. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much."	Yes
"Hello, sorry for the poorly worded title.  My girlfriends sister is married to a sergeant on the local police force.  I don't know the full story between her sister and the husband, however he was extremely verbally abusive/manipulative last night.  He took her phone, her money, cards, purse.  Unsure how, but she got out of the house with the kids, borrowed a phone and called my gf to help her.  They went to a hospital because the sister was having a panic attack.  She was cleared and the doctor told her to leave our city because she cannot use our police if something happens.  She is in a neighboring city and is staying in hotel with the kids.  The husband called my girlfriends home, her dad answered.  The brother in law repeatedly said ""where is she"".  The dad repeatedly told him that she's safe and that he will not tell him.  I don't know anymore detail on the call other than that it was a long call and the son in law kept repeating ""where is she"".  This was at 1230am.  Then at 130pm the son in law shows up at the home and tries to enter!  Luckily the doors were locked.  He did not break anything but was there for an extended period of time shaking door knob! He's about 6'5"" 250lbs, so he could easily break it if he wanted.  A little more backstory on him.  He has an ex-wife that he always told us was crazy.  Never met her, don't know anything else about her except that he got everything in the divorce and their daughter is at his home every single time I've seen them.    I just found out about him showing up.  My girlfriend said in the text that she is afraid he is going to do something.    So far I have told her that the sister needs to contact a divorce attorney as soon as possible, but that was prior to him trying to enter my girlfriends home at 130am.  With him being a sergeant, will the police even do anything?    We don't know what to do, please help."	Yes
I left NY to go stay with family out of state for what I originally thought would only be a few days (due to extremely unhealthy fighting with my fiance.) I'm realising now that the relationship isn't salvageable. I have my child with me as I'm a stay at home mom. I would have to stay in PA with family as I don't have a place to stay in NY. Do I have to file for custody in NY since that's where I lived or do I file in PA since that's where I'd be moving? I appreciate the advice.	Yes
Hello,  My father recently found out about trips his spouse has taken with another man. He received travel documents. I am wondering how asset division would work in the case he filed for divorce under adultery in Alberta.  They have been married for about 10 years. Previously, my Father owned a house with about 150,000 in mortgage equity. He has since refinanced his mortage twice and has a little under 100,000 in the house. This money was primarily used to pay off debt associated with businesses his wife started. This included planning, construction, etc, of said establishments.   How would the business assets and house be distributed in such a divorce? The equity in the house is less than before the marriage, does that mean the wife is not entitled to the house, and must give up some business assets?  He wishes to part amicably, I'd just like to know how this would go if it got dirty.	Yes
My parents and I have a rocky relationship. I live with them. I was recently gifted $10,000 by grandmother, and they told me to give it to them so that they could keep it in the bank for safekeeping. They told me that I would be able to use it whenever with no questions asked. Now, they refuse to let me use a single cent of it saying that it's theirs and that since they're paying for my college and letting me live under their roof, I don't need it. They have had the money to pay for college before the $10,000 because we are decently well off, and it's obvious that they just refuse to give it to me. If I ask for it, they say that they don't have to pay for my college, my phone, or let me live under their house. What can I do to get my money back if I can even do anything?	Yes
My ex husband (38) and I (35) included a morality clause in our divorce agreement.  That he nor I should have someone of the opposite sex not related by blood or marriage spending the night when the children are present.  He recently told me that he plans on moving in with his girlfriend (23) of a year this fall.  In fact, they have already been spending the night together when the boys are there on visitation.  I have expressed to him and her how this upsets me and that it goes against our divorce agreement.  I don't have a problem with people in general living together while not married.  I just don't want it around MY children.  We are raising them in Catholic schools and they are taught this is wrong.  What are my legal options?  I can't afford an attorney because we are barely getting by as it is.  This isn't the first time he's broken the divorce agreement.  I feel like I'm being walked all over.  I'm willing to save and try to talk to an attorney but I don't want to waste my time if the clause is not likely to be enforced.	Yes
Throwaway Account  I [19] recently found out from my sister [25] was molested by our father when she was a child, leading up to high school. I won‚Äôt go into detail about it, but it was bad, and hearing her tell me about it, listening to her voice and looking in her eyes, was one of hardest things I‚Äôve ever had to listen to.  Me, my sister, as well as older brother grew up in an abusive house. I was beat as a child for almost anything, as were my siblings. I always knew my father to be a bad man. I always just carried on so I could do my own thing; so I could do good in high school, so I could go off to college and get my degree and not get involved with police and such. Never told any authorities about the abuse we endured, and even lied when CPS got involved when I was in 6th grade and asked me about being abused. There was no follow up.  This is entirely different though. My sister asked me to tell no one, and I haven‚Äôt (except this post of course). Its not something that I can just let go of, and know that he can get away with doing that to her. She‚Äôs 25 now, married and extremely successful, and this happened when she was younger, up to around 14/15.  She doesn‚Äôt talk with my parents at all, and has been seeing a therapist for a while now as I understand.  I don‚Äôt know what I can do even if I can convince her to act against my father. I‚Äôm not familiar with how the stature of limitations works, or how police would proceed with a 10-year-old case of child molestation, as well as not having any evidence other than my sisters word. And for those raising questions if it even happened in the first place, I assure you my sister would never lie about this	Yes
Hey /r/legaladvice,  I'm a young trans woman, currently in the process of changing my name. While I already have the papers required, I still can't do it because of the local laws. You have to settle for a neutral name until you get SRS (sexual reconstructive surgery). The name I want and have used for quite some time now is considered exclusively feminine unfortunately. I consulted my situation with an expert witness, who told me there is a legal workaround. All I need to do apparently is to prove that there are men somewhere in the world with the name 'Daria'.   I tried searching through ancestry and found about 17 birth/death certificates and marriage licences there. On top of that, one of the people there have a son with an identical name. The son got in trouble with the law and I found and downloaded about 64 court documents from his trial (footprints, warrants, etc). The expert witness says it's not enough, apparently the documents need to be verified.   How am I supposed to get them verified if I'm not a US citizen? Is it even possible?	Yes
Ok so i am dating someone who is still in the foster system they are over the age of 18, and they have to be supervised by a gaurdian or case worker on our dates(usualy only able to last for an hour due to caseworker schedule) i need to know what can be done to be able to spend more time with them if not help get them out of the bs	Yes
"Hi all, my wife and I bought a house in Silicon Valley almost a year ago.  I was on deployment so I was not home.  We used my VA loan, I put down $10k and she put down $72k down payment; this was after we had a joint account.  He family, mother, father, brother live in their house rent free for almost a year now.  Her uncle lives there with $1,000/month rent.  I'm back home now, and our relationship is very rocky.  I can't handle the constant verbal abuse and her caustic nature day in an day out.  I want out.    The problem is she cut down 4, 70ft birch trees in our back yard while I was gone, tore up all the grass and did the same to the front yard.  She wants to remodel everything.  I feel suffocated in this this house.  Should I wait to finish the remodeling and file divorce or do it now?  I'm going to get a divorce, but I want to hear your advices too.  I can't pull equity on the house until one year and as it is, the property price probably dropped due to her ""renovations""."	Yes
"My ex-girlfriend and I recently split up, we dated from March - June. We found out she was pregnant in May. She wouldn't tell me how far along she was and didn't seem too worried about going to the ultra sound or doctor's appointments and had a different story every time I asked her anything about it. She indicated that her and her ex had slept together a week before her and I got together, no condom. Her and I have never had sex without a condom. She even tells me that she ""knows"" that it couldn't be mine (I never came in her.) and is sure it's her ex-boyfriends, but is threatening to take me to court to pay for the test, out of spite. Is this legal?"	Yes
I am currently in the process of leaving an abusive partner. One of my hesitations is that they have threatened to turn in a family member of mine for being a pedophile if I don't stay with them. For my own reasons and really the time elapsing, I have no intention of pressing charges. He is not around children and does seem to have reformed.   I am asking because if my dad is to get contacted about abuse, he will lose his shit and I want to be prepared.	Yes
Virginia  Note: I ask questions often for different family members/friends. My life isn't as crazy as it would appear in my comment history.   I have exact 50/50 joint custody with ex wife. Her new husband left her and now she is getting a job where she works third shift and will not be able to keep child for half of her week and wants me to take him. I agreed as long as we can switch to me having primary custody and get it down legally.   What is the best way to get this in writing legally? Mediator? Paralegal? Notary? Most cost effective would be appreciated. Originally (5 years ago) we went to a mediator, but this time there isn't anything to meditate since we have already come to an agreement.	Yes
My mother is terminal and has drafted up a will leaving me all of her money and future money she hopes to receive from a malpractice lawsuit.  However she has a husband who has been a piece of shit in a lot of ways.  She cannot divorce him because she needs him as a caretaker for the rest of her time, but she doens't plan on leaving him any money.   However, I've been informed that he is by law entitled to a third of her estate regardless of what her will says. I looked it up and it seems to be the case.  Is this true or is it more complicated than that?	Yes
Background: My soon to be ex and I are in the process of a divorce. We have a toddler. I have a lawyer, but they won't be able to talk until later and I'm freaking out a bit.   Current agreement: I have primary custody, my ex has visits twice a week for two hours, and an overnight on the weekend. He doesn't actually take the overnight on the weekend, instead he just sees him twice in the weekend. His is because he doesn't feel ready for an overnight yet, but he  wanted the option on paper. We also have a first right of refusal clause. So if either of us are gone for more than three hours, we have to offer the other person the child. This arrangement was working great! We don't get along at all, but baby was happy and visits were going okay. Baby is watched by grandma while we're both at work. We finished the custody portion of the divorce, but not the child support. We mutually agreed upon an amount he would give me, not much, but something to put away for baby. I didn't WANT child support, but my lawyer suggested that it's good to get since I make less and I could save it for baby's college fund or something.    Issue: My ex was fired for inappropriate behavior at work, and hasn't been able to get a job since. This wasn't an issue since I was on vacation anyways. Well, I went back to work this week and now my ex wants the baby everyday I'm at work, plus his scheduled visits.   This would be fine with me if my ex was a normal person. Usually, I'd say that a child should be with their parent because it's important for them to bond with dad as much as they bond with mom. I'm all for father's rights. However... my ex is crazy. He hit me while we were married, he's tried to have me fired, he's really unstable (I would go into more detail, but I don't want to be too specific and have him find this post). Don't get me wrong, I WANT baby to have a relationship with him! However, I want the majority of baby's life to be stable with just a sprinkle of crazy from his father. I don't want half of his life to be insane instability, alcoholism, emotional abuse, etc.   So, my ex has now formulated his master plan. He will have baby when I'm at work, thus establishing more custody, since his income is now below mine, I will pay him child support...   What on earth can I do? I feel like I'm at a complete loss. Our agreement dictates that I MUST offer him baby while I'm at work.... How is it fair for him to just sit at home and not work and not support baby?...	Yes
I'd like to apply for legal guardianship of my girlfriend's daughter, the father is out of the picture and in prison for molesting a child. I'd like to apply for guardianship but I'm not sure which form to use. I found all these forms [here](http://www.nycourts.gov/forms/familycourt/custodyvisitation.shtml) but I'm not sure which one is the right one. I'd like to eventually adopt her if that's of any help. I'm also in Queens county.	Yes
This will probably get long. Sorry. All names are fake.   &amp;nbsp;  When I was younger and stupid (19 in fact), I married Chris. Chris and I had a long history reaching back to when I was 13. Chris is mentally ill in several ways, on and off drugs, has no respect for women, about 30 different charges in his arrest record over half of which are assault on a female, kidnapped his child with another woman at one point two days after the child had serious surgery (it took a week for our local police to get off their asses and do something about that one, and in the end I only think they did it because the child was on a prescription diet and Chris could not purchase it).... I personally was cheated on, hit, trapped in my home, emotionally abused, infected (deliberately) with an STD, financially destroyed... I have horrific stories of things that he has done to me, which I've never told anyone.    &amp;nbsp;  The reason I've never told most of these stories - not even to my therapist or my current partner - is because Chris seems incredibly normal to most people. He is very, very good at manipulating, lying to, and confusing those around him. Without getting into too much identifying detail, our marriage fell apart over the course of a couple months, and I left. Then he came to where I was staying, convinced me to talk to him, and ended up putting me in a situation where I could not physically stop him from having sex with me even though I told him no, nor call for help. Yes, I know what forcible sex without consent is called, and I don't like to call what happened that. Mostly because that was the night my daughter was conceived.    &amp;nbsp;  It took me a long time to completely sever ties with him - I am not proud of that - especially when he was able to use my daughter as an 'in'. He has now not seen her in over two years, almost three. It became very clear that he was not interested in seeing her, he was interested in using seeing her as a way to manipulate and torture me, bum money or a place to stay or rides, control who I saw and what I did, etc. I stopped the visits after one where he picked her up at 1 pm; we had clearly agreed she would be back before 4 pm, and he texted me after he left and said he'd decided he wasn't going to bring her back until 7 pm, and threatened to not bring her back at all. He had lashed out in that way because I'd told him he could not take my then-2 1/2-year-old to a comic con out of state for 3 days, where she would have been staying in a hotel room with him and 5 of his mostly-male adult friends, all of whom made clear their intent to drink heavily (not that it would have mattered if they were Mormon virgins, because there was no way it would have been appropriate for her to accompany him to that), none of whom had a legal license and insurance. Thankfully, he is not on her birth certificate, and as far as I am concerned, never will be - there has been no DNA testing and no legal establishment of paternity. So I was able to tell him to bring her back or I'd call the police.    &amp;nbsp;  Another thing that helped me be able to finally stand up and set firm limits was my budding/new relationship with James. James and I had a brief fling when I was 16, hadn't spoken for quite a while, and things just kinda sparked just under 3 years ago. Our relationship is wonderful in so many ways. I am with someone who respects and loves me, who doesn't hurt me or scare me, who tells me the truth... He is everything I could ever want in a partner. In addition, although I neither intended or expected things to end up this way, he is a wonderful stepfather.    &amp;nbsp;  We have had no contact with Chris for a very long time (other than one recent attempt to get some medical information for a geneticist visit for my daughter - he said he'd look over the forms and email them back 'tomorrow', a week later I gave up and filled out what I could myself). However, we do hear quite a bit secondhand from a mutual friend who Chris doesn't know keeps tabs on him, and a couple of my &amp; James' friends who he thinks are somehow his buddies. This is a small town, so it's less wierd than it sounds. About six months ago, one of my friends ran into Chris at a bar. He hung around for a few and overheard Chris spreading the rumor that James, my boyfriend, was a pedophile.    &amp;nbsp;  My friend specified that it seemed to be a sort of shitty joke, playing off James' chubby-guy-with-beard-in-glasses look. However, I was pretty ticked off, and I'm very aware of Chris' 'jokes' and how he likes to pretend he's just joking when he's really either being cruel or trying to manipulate people. I spoke to Chris' sister, who I do have a fairly good relationship with, and she gave him a pretty big dressing-down. The issue seemed dealt with and done.    &amp;nbsp;  And then a couple days ago, Chris called our mutual friend and was chatting with him. At some point in the conversation, he started trying to claim James was a pedophile, and his 'proof' was that I was 15 and James was 20 when I first met &amp; had sex with him. This is not true, I was 16 and James was 19, Chris knows that I was 16, it was 100% legal in our state (NC), and regardless it was a consensual teenaged fling that lasted all of two weeks! James and I are 2 years and 5 months apart, for the record. I am currently 25, about to turn 26; he turned 28 a couple months ago.    &amp;nbsp;  Our mutual friend is not patient with Chris' continual lying, and happens to quite like James, so he brushed it off and made a joke about 15 year olds being mature enough to make their own decisions. Chris became angry that he wouldn't play along and hung up on him. The mutual friend then told me about the conversation, and added that in a group chat he was in on Facebook with Chris's friends, Chris has brought this topic up 'jokingly' repeatedly.    &amp;nbsp;  If this was just harmless gossip, I'd continue to ignore it. However, again, I am a single mother of a five year old, living with my boyfriend - stereotypes are definitely against me. If the wrong person hears these 'jokes', I could lose my child while it was being investigated - Chris knows this, because when I was pregnant, he deliberately incited someone else to call CPS with similar spurious accusations, in the hopes that I would be under investigation when my daughter was born and lose custody, which led to my younger siblings not being allowed at my mother's house (where I lived) for a month while they investigated whether or not my pregnancy was the product of incestuous rape of an 11 year old male sibling. Again, not exaggerating this in the slightest. Chris is well aware of the intricacies of the CPS system and the ways to abuse it due to the fact that he spent most of his childhood and teen years in and out of it.    &amp;nbsp;  Knowing that the jokes/accusations have continued and that he is deliberately twisting dates/ages/events, it's clear that he is actively trying to make people think James is a pedophile, thereby implying I am putting my daughter at risk (there is probably also an element of jealousy that my daughter has another father figure). There is 100% no truth to this. However, we have no clue how to handle the deliberate slander, nor if we even should do anything. I doubt I could involve the police; they are notoriously lax in our town for anything that doesn't involve physical violence, and there's no proof he's saying it (or that it's meant maliciously, not a 'joke'). I can't prove anything he said over the phone to someone else, nor can I obtain Facebook chats in any form that would be legally admissable. I feel that any contact with him, whether direct or through an intermediary like his sister, would merely fuel the flames, so I don't necessarily want to try that again.    &amp;nbsp;  But, I also feel that something should be done. James is leaving the decision up to me, although he did say if he runs into Chris in public he's probably going to break his nose. Considering even if this went no further than gossip, James could have his reputation ruined - which in a small town, could also lead to him losing his job - I can't really fault him. In addition, whether deliberately incited or otherwise, it is 100% within the scope of possiblity that Chris' less savory drug-addict friends would attempt to corner and attack James. They have, at his behest, stalked and assaulted people in the past, including myself. Chris again has also kidnapped a child in the past, although I don't believe he has the financial/family resources to do that again and as he is not on the birth certificate it would not end well for him.   &amp;nbsp;   R/relationships felt this fell under a legal question, and suggested I post it here.    &amp;nbsp;  **tl;dr: My abusive ex-husband Chris has been systemically and deliberately trying to spread a rumor that my boyfriend James is a pedophile (he is not). Seeing as I have a 5 year old daughter, this goes beyond possible damage to James' reputation and puts our day to day lives at risk. I am not sure how to proceed or if I even have any recourse to handle this.**	Yes
"Here's my story, I'm sorry it's very long. Might need several parts. I just really wanted to share after reading some other posts here. I've missed some details, otherwise we'll be here forever.   Also, I would really appreciate some friendly legal advice, reason why will make sense as I explain everything.   Here we go:  My mother left me with her family when I was 2 and moved to a different country. My father went through a battle to get me from them (they're a family of absolute nutters, poor reputation wherever they go). Eventually my father kidnapped me.  A little about my father: He's from a poor family in Africa, but he's dad did all he can and passed on work ethics and educated his kids with the little he had. My mother and my father met when he was 19 and she was 18. Her mother married her off (she was abusive towards her). They had me when she was 20 and he was 21. My dad quit his studies and joined his father in the line of carpentry to provide for us. When I turned two, my mum left my dad and took me with her to her family because there was an opportunity for her to migrate to Europe. Shortly after she left the country, my father came looking for me at her family home and my great uncle chased him away with a shovel.  My dad eventually found an opportunity to kidnap me and take me with him. Our homes were only 10 minutes apart, so it was a constant battle of kidnapping.   Fast forward: I'm now five. My father had been struggling financially for as long as I was old enough to notice. But he did absolutely everything he could to have me privately educated, get me a nanny to take me to school and back home, to cook for me etc. etc.  My father and I  spent every evening together after dinner. We'd usually spend it with him teaching me maths, French and other subjects, then we'd do some reading before bed. On the weekends when off school I used to follow him to work and play outside. We were best friends, he respected me and I was free to tell him everything and anything. When I was naughty, he used to take the time to explain to me why he's mad and would very rarely shout.   When I turned 6, he began dating this woman and once when dad was at work, she slapped me (I don't remember why), I told my dad when he returned. All I remember is my dad hitting her, packing her stuff and kicking out. Dad apologised to me for leaving me with her.   One weekend when I followed dad to work, I was playing outside and my dad was talking to someone. I noticed a cousin of mine from mum's family, I followed her and they kidnapped me. They took me to my nMum's family home. I never liked them, they were so loud and disrespectful; so very different to the calm life I lived with dad. When my father came for me I started crying to go back home with him. They kept me in the house and were shouting at my father. He's response was, ""I'm sorry you're feeling very upset right now, but I need to take my daughter, she has school tomorrow"". They kicked him out. They kept me at their house and away from school. (I now know it was at the request of my mother, because she was planning to come and get me).   One day, (after what seemed like forever, but was only probably a week) I said to my grandmother (nMum's mum) I was going outside to play, she let me. I took the opportunity and ran to my grandfather's house (dad's dad). My dad came for me and we moved away to stay with his friend in a different district. He's friend was pretty well off, and I think his the one that enrolled me in a new private school.  By this time I was 7 years old. One day my dad came home from work and he said ""PeePee, we need to talk"". He told me my nMum's back and he asked if I'd like to see her, I said no. He convinced me to at least say hello. So we went to see her; she was having a beer and she tried to give me a sip whilst I was sitting on her lap and my dad snatched me.  Discretion: my dad had never taught me hate for my mother or her family. He'd always say ""family's family and you can't change them, what's important is what and who you are"".   After some time, my grandmother came to take me, presumably because my nMum and dad wanted to talk. She proposed that she takes me to London for better education opportunity. My dad being an academic junkie, agreed.  That night I didn't want to stay with nMum, I went back home with my dad. He explained what nMum had said and asked what I wanted to do, I said I didn't want to go with her. We both cried and he begged me to go because I'd have a better opportunity in the UK. A week later we were preparing for departure. I spent the whole with my dad, we took pictures and I cried ‚Äî a lot.    I'm now 8 living in London with nMum. At first she'd allow me call my father, but she became increasingly jealous of our relationship and started making comments (jokingly) about me and him being in some sort of witchcraft pact.  I'm now 9, nMum left me at her aunts house so she can have her free time as a 29 year old. I didn't mind, there were other kids there. Never really saw nMum. I started going to a school nearby great aunt's house. The school used to ask me a lot of questions (I now know it's because I used to come into school dirty and no one ever came to pick me up until 5-6pm, schools here finish at 3:15pm). I think my great aunt asked my mum to come and get me because she didn't want trouble. The day nMum came, my dad called (coincidentally). He asked to speak to me. nMum's aunt grabbed the phone said some disrespectful things to my dad, and told him to not call the house phone again because I'm no longer his daughter, nMum just laughed. I was quite baffled.   I'm now living with nMum, the abuse gradually starts. I once heard her say to a friend; ""I'm like the devil, I'm the type of child that would shit in your house"". Paid no notice. She used to snap a lot and give me dirty looks, I became scared of what I can and cannot say. She enrolled me to a school locally, the school instructed that I must be taken to school and picked up because of  its distance from home address. This did not go down well with nMum. One morning I'm getting ready for school and she snapped at me for putting on tights the wrong way and gave me a morning beating.  I'm now ten and finally allowed to go to school by myself. I had no friends because I was this creepy kid with weird clothes, so I'd walk to school by myself. By now I had a new routine, when I get up in the morning I have to clean the house before I go to school, and god forbid if I messed up.  I once did the washing and left the plates and cutleries out to dry, nMum lost her bollocks; she called me over to the room, sat me on the floor, grabbed the knife, pierced it on my thigh and said ""what happens if somebody comes in here to fight me and sees this knife, they will stab me, and before that happens, I will stab you first if you do not put them in the draws next time"" then she proceeded with the beating. Her favourite was stripping me, laying me on my front and whipping me with a skipping rope or a belt on my back until she felt it was enough. I remember once she swung me by my hair and banged my head against the wall and I had a blood clot in my eye (somehow).   I had this aunt on nMum's side, me and her grew quite close. She used to come pick me up for the weekends, or I'd spend school holidays with her. When nMum noticed how close we were getting, she began causing problems. I was no longer allowed to go to her house, or any of her other relatives. nMum said to me ""those people do not like me, and if they do not like me they will never like you either"". Then she proceeded to telling me all these deep dark secrets about her family.    I'm now 11, we move into a bigger house and nMum's boyfriend moves in with us. He was a lovely man, and whenever nMum would start hitting me, he'd step in. One day, nMum said to him ""she doesn't like you anyway, she told me"" I was so confused. Absolutely confused.  The stress of being in the same house as nMum was too much for me, I started thinking of different ways I could end it. I once took a knife to school, went to the bathroom and contemplated about stabbing myself. I chickened out. I then thought taking a mixture of 5 different pills and mashing them in my cornflakes would do the trick. After eating it, I laid under my bed and waited to die. Nothing. So I thought of slashing my wrist like in the movies, it was too painful.   I'm now 12. At this point nMum would only hit me if her partner is not around and if I ever dared utter a word, boy would I get it.   So this is where things start getting interesting.  We once went to a family gathering (wedding I think) and so I took the opportunity to tell my aunt everything my mum had said (above). My aunt told her mother and the whole family started calling my mum to ask her questions. That night she hit me for so long (skipping rope and all sorts) that she'd even take breaks in between.  In the morning as I was getting ready for school nMum came to me and said ""if anyone asks say (insert aunts name here) is the one who told you all those things"". I had no choice, so I did. Aunt's mum and everyone started calling and made it seem as if I'm a problematic child. They said I should never step foot in their houses again, I'm a liar blah blah. Aunt still stood by me.  The following day I woke up and decide I'd had enough. Called my aunt and said I'm running away. She said ""come to my house"". Silly me packed everything in black bags, so getting on a bus was a hassle. As I was getting on my second bus, the driver stopped me and called the police. Police came, I said ""I'm visiting my aunt"", they asked my mum's details, I cried and begged them and showed them the whooping from night before. They call nMum anyway. Social service came and took me to aunt but said I had to go back in a week.   This continued until I was about 13. I decided to runaway again. I had a boyfriend (14) by this time. I stayed with him and his mum for almost a year. I wasn't going to school, so my aunt and I came to an agreement (against her mum's wishes) that I move in with her and enrol at the local school. So I did.   I'm now 14 and studying again. nMum comes by and manipulates me into moving back in with her ""because those people will never love me the way they love their own children and only she loves me"". I agree, but decided to stay at the same school. Not long, nMum strikes again. School tried to get me into social services, not happening. Doctor even saw my injuries.   I'm now rebellious. Get involved with the wrong crowed, began smoking and just doing what the fuck I want. I had enough of her. Eventually social services placed me in foster care for 6 months. Following their assessment, they deemed I was not at risk. They sent me back home  I'm now 15 and began shop lifting because nMum never gave me money (luckily travel for under eighteens on bus is free). I got arrested many times. She started calling my dad telling him ""I told you she's like this and that"". I spoke to dad and we both cried and he apologised and said ""I should never had let you go with her, I should have kept you here no matter the struggle, it's all my fault, I'm sorry"".   I runaway again, social services refuse to help and old my mother I said ""I don't like her and her kids (with partner) because she shows them love"". So they fucked any chances of me ever going back there.  I stayed on the streets, I made friends with some older girls (16 and 19) and they both had their own places. They allowed me stay, but I had to fend for myself. Eventually I had to leave their places and started staying everywhere and anywhere. Sometimes in strangers houses, or I'll just take buses from start to finish. I ended up getting raped by a guy I knew, and then again by another guy.  I'm now 16, I got a solicitor to help me with social services (through legal aid), they accept to house me following further investigations. They placed me in a shared accommodation with another girl, whom I became best friends with. I felt a little settled, so I enrolled in a college. 6 months later S.Services drop me again. I'm now lodging at former housemates and dropped college because I had no money.  I turned 17 and decided I have no choice, but to go back to nMum, apologise to her and just do whatever she says. Not a great idea, but I had to, I really wanted to go back to school.  So I did exactly that, I'd grounded myself and went back to college. Once I'd turned eighteen, I convinced nMum to give me my passport because I had to apply for work; instead I was working with a charity behind her back, they were helping me move into a hostel.   I'm now 19 and decide to leave the hostel and go off to university. I went, and lived on campus. nMum is suddenly my best friend, not because I was studying, but for my student loan money. She told me several times to quit and just get a job. Not happening.   20 move in with mates from uni, still speaking to nMum but very rarely.   21 I meet a guy from a very wealthy, educated, yet grounded family.  At 22 we move in together and nMum pops up again. She visits and brings over my partner's favourite meal. She'd always want to speak to him on the phone to say hello. She'd guilt trip me into buying her things ranging from holidays, perfumes and give her money. Honestly, my partner and I were doing it out of the kindness of our heart, we didn't think much of it.  23 I've now graduated (I'm the only graduate in her entire family tree) and nMum says we should go to Africa and see my dad and her family. I guess she wanted to play the good mum card, y'know, ""the I raised her"", but my father is too smart for that. By now I was no longer scared of her and would often say whatever came to mind.  My father asked her about my partner and she said, ""oh I don't know if I'm sure about him, but I guess if she likes him"" I flipped, told her next time she needs something she can go fuck herself. It was our trip to Africa that made me realise she was only using me and my partner. When we came back I cut all ties.  Back home in London I began drinking a lot (never used to drink). My relationship started falling apart. Won't go into too much details about that, but we broke up.   I'm now 24 found a well paying job and moved to an apartment of my own in a nice area in SE London, started my Master Degree, began funding my two sibling's (3 and 5 ‚Äîdad's kids) private schooling in Africa and providing for my father as well. By this time I was still heavily drinking. I was lonely, had no family and I was never the type to confide in friends. I lost my job last year (unfair dismissal) and fell into a depressed state. Began binging and spending all my savings.  I became worried that I would fail my studies due to always being hungover, so I told the university and they put me on sick leave. My siblings had to leave school because I could no longer afford it. It made me feel even worst  In November (last year) I decided to seek help with my doctor. She put me on medication and advised I be around people. In came nMum. I called her. She came over and brought me some food. But then she started again with saying ""you'll always need your mother blah blah"" I guess it was a high moment for her. By the end of November I began self harming, attempted suicide twice and admitted in hospital. She said to go and stay with her. Worst mistake, but I needed someone, everyone probably thought I was crazy and a burden, because they'd all left. I move my stuff to nMum's garden and stayed with her. She started financially exploiting me again. My ex partner told me to leave and go stay with him. So I did. nMum stopped calling.   It's January of this year and I attempt my final suicide. Ex partner found me foaming, called ambulance and I was admitted. We call nMum and her partner said they didn't want to hear it. I later found out she'd demonised me to him and told my siblings I'm not their sister.   It's now March, and I've been moved to rehab for depression. Not having heard from nMum or her partner.  In June, I got in my car and went to get my stuff from nMum with my ex Partner. When I tried to ask her why she told my siblings such thing, she began pushing me. Adrenaline took the best of me and I pushed her back. And started shouting at her. She pushed me and shut the door in my face, so I continued shouting through the letter box. I told her exactly how disgusting I think she is and that she'll one day pay for what she'd done to me.    My psychiatric nurse suggest I may have PTSD and borderline personality disorder. I will start seeing a therapist soon for a final diagnosis.   I'm now 25 and as we speak, I've left the rehab, changed my number and not in contact with anyone from my past. I go to my local gym and library just to get out of the house. I'm taking swimming lessons and trying my hardest to stay active. Being unproductive makes my depression worst. Doctor has advised I stay away from work for a little longer due to frequent anxiety attacks and paranoia. She's been the most amazing GP anyone could ever ask for. Does all she possibly can to help.   I'm due to return to university for my master's degree next year. Maybe once I start therapy it'll get better. In the meantime I'm working on a charity project to support lone students estranged from family. Hopefully it'll work out, if so, then I'll probably dedicate the rest of my life on that as my prime job.    So yeah, that's my story. I think I have a much more positive outlook now.  As for her ‚Äî I pity her .I think she just blames me for everything. She has a dark heart and it must be difficult for her. I'm just glad I spent my crucial years with my dad. I really wish she'll one day seek help. Whilst she is not abusive towards her other kids (she has 3 now), two of them dislike her.   The legal question:   I've been thinking of taking legal action against the local authority due to neglect. Much of this could've been avoided had they helped me. All the physical evidence of abuse were there and school headmasters tried desperately to help me. What are the odds?   Forgive me for my poor grammar. I wrote all this at 3am, having already taken sleeping pills. Very tired!    Update: spoke to dad today.‚ù§Ô∏è"	Yes
"Hi legal advice, let me first say thanks for any help you can give me! Secondly, I want to be clear I have done nothing yet, and I'm not sure I should, hence why I came to you.   My ex girlfriend and I have two kids together. For the most part we get along, but we have some serious flare ups from time to time. We didn't go to court because she has a past with DYFS (NJs more extreme cps) and we feared that we might both lose the kids if it came to a court fight. During our most recent argument I was at her apartment arguing with her over texts while she was at work and she had left her iPad there. While I couldn't access it, the main screen still shows texts messages as they come in to her.   So I'm sitting there fighting with her and I see her 2 sisters start texting her advice to take my ass to court, nail me to a cross, take all my money in child support and, best of all, ""we will have him with a gun in his mouth"". I of course took pictures and all. The sister advocating most harshly to break me and force me to suicide is actually a registered therapist.   I have a two fold question: first, she's registered in NJ, can she actually do anything besides provide advice to her sister?   Secondly, with the texts can I do anything to stop her? Last I heard she worked with at risk youth, so would her job do anything if I showed the texts to them?   Let me be clear, I DONT want to do anything, up until this situation I got along with my exes family. Even if I can do something, would it be worthwhile, as I'm sure there would be a serious shit storm? But are my hands tied?   TL;DR: my exes sister is a therapist and wants to make me commit suicide. What do?"	Yes
About 20 years ago I divorced my husband. Since I was a stay at home mom during our marriage I was awarded the equivalent half of his retirement for the years we were married. The stipulation was I couldn't cash it in until I reached retirement age. Well that age is approaching in 2 weeks, so I would like to start the process, but I have no idea where to start. I no longer live in the same state as he does and cannot find a copy of the original divorce decree.	Yes
Someone is contesting the right to my daughter. He claims to be the bio father after 15 years.  I just want to learn as much as I can about this guy.	Yes
"I posted another topic a few days ago and while reading over more, does this mean just registration for hockey is split or any expense with hockey.  Para 1 and 2 seem to be hand in hand but para 2 says hockey expense as in general and not hockey registrations.  Just wondering if someone gets new equipment does that fall under not needing consented expenses or doesn't need consent for shared expenses because its hockey.  17.	The parties will pay their proportionate share of children‚Äôs s.7 special and extraordinary extra expenses that they both consent to in advance ‚Äì Cindy‚Äôs share is 37% based on her 2016 annual income of $26,271.00 and Henry‚Äôs share is 63% based on his annual 2016 income of $44,059.00.  The parties agree that all registration fees for hockey, including summer hockey camp will always be paid by both parties proportionate to their incomes.    18.	The party paying the hockey expense or other extra expense (consented to) shall provide the other with the receipt and the other shall pay their proportionate share within 7 days of receiving the receipt."	Yes
"Long story short: my uncle forced my grandmother into letting him claim me and my sister on his taxes, claiming if she didn't he'd call cps because my sister doesn't have a room. (he's ""renting"" it)and because of the arguments my grandmother and sister get into."	Yes
I have an LLC which has never made any money. I wanted to make video games, and did, but nothing sold. There's like $300 in the bank account for said LLC.  I'm going through a divorce, and we'll put in that I own everything about that company, but obviously it's at most going to be a sentence, the lawyer is not IP specialist, and I don't want to use lawyer time on this.  I'd like to continue making games, but I don't really need to use the same LLC,I could open a new one. (There's no name recognition, nothing really of value except it's already there.)  If I keep using this LLC would my ex have an easier time claiming that she part owns it in the event I actually ever make money on it in the future?  Basically should I close it and open a new LLC, or since there wasn't anything in there at the time of divorce it won't matter anyway?	Yes
She also needs to get checked up at the hospital, but her mom isn't paying for any type of insurance for her even though she has the money, and shes not taking her to the hospital. My girlfriend has social security checks because of a family members death that she has been recieving since she was 12, but she can't use them because she's only 17 and they go directly to her mother's account which she spends on jewelry and food for herself instead of things like insurance etc... Theres also occasions where my girlfriend literally cannot eat because her mom won't buy her food, and her mom always tells her to get a job but won't take her anywhere to get the things required for a job. (Shes been accepted after an interview 3 times but things keep shitting up) CPS has been called multiple times but her mom fixes the issues before they get there since they apparently need a day in advance and they see that everything is okay. Is there anything we can do about this?  (We're both 17)	Yes
We live in Ohio, and my mom said if my stepdad found out she was cheating he would get a divorce settlement and not a disillusion.  She told me he'd get half of everything she owns - her savings, her retirement fund, and most importantly the house. She'd have to sell the house so she could give him half of its worth.  The thing is, they've only been married for two years. She makes house payments to the bank, but she's not renting. We've had this house for 17 years, so I feel like he would have no right to get any of it since he only moved in two years ago, but I don't know if that's how the legality of it works.  They bought two cars during their marriage, and he's a car salesman so they came from his place of work. How would this factor into the settlement?  I'm going through a lot, so my mind is just flooded with confusion. I tried googling this stuff, but I think information attuned to my situation would be the most helpful.	Yes
My wife and I are filing for divorce, and we're keeping the debts that are in our name after the marriage. I'm currently filling out the forms and it's asking for us to list all our debts, before and during the marriage.   Can we just keep this blank or should we fill it out? Does this become public information? I know you can get things sealed, but I'm doing all of this online and I'm not sure the online application has the option of requesting this. I'd rather not pay any lawyer fees as otherwise this really is a peaceful separation. Thanks!	Yes
I'm a divorced mom of 3. My husband took me to court and got temporary custody of the children, because I was abusing adderall and meth. I moved away and went through outpatient treatment and was able to see my kids every other weekend supervised. After I completed treatment, I received my portion of my ex-husband's 401k from the divorce. Well, that money led to a relapse and the temporary custody order was finalized.   I went further away this time to an inpatient rehab. I signed up for a year but decided to leave early. Right now I'm living in a halfway house. I've been clean almost 6 months.   My ex said he's willing to reconcile whenever I'm ready to move back. He's forgiven me for everything.  The problem is, I fell in love with a guy in rehab. He's been clean for over 2 years though, because he was in prison for over a year. My ex found out about it and isn't too happy.   So, my question is....if I move back to my hometown and live with my new boyfriend, would family court take into consideration his criminal history when deciding on custody?  I love my children, and I would do anything to get them back. But I don't want to walk away from a potentially amazing relationship. Any advice would be much appreciated.	Yes
My girlfriend has 3 kids from her previous marriage with her abusive ex-husband. After they divorced they continued to share the house week on week off, so the kids would stay in one place. After more and more mental and physical abuse against her (never the kids) she left, no money, car job, etc and because of her circumstances and her ex's access to money and a good lawyer he became primary gardian, and she has been seeing the kids every weekend.  Well last month her ex husband up and moved to NY, 13 hours away, without filing a request to move with the courts, to live with his new girlfriend. The kids are 8, 14 and 15. They have no friends or family there. There are miserable.   My wife has been applying for legal aid to try and get custody (money is tight, we're trying to save up but it's taking a while)...   So last night the 14 year old boy got into an argument with his dad and his dad threw him against a wall. Huge well across his back this morning. So when the kids called their mom crying last night, we had the cops go to where they are in NY. The cops did nothing. Said he acted out and basically got what he diserved.  My wife isn't a perfect person. She hasn't handled everything right, but these kids are miserable, and being mentally and now physically abused.   If anyone has advice, or a template for what we have to do to petition for emergency custody, we need it. The kids want to be here with us and are being held away just to spite their mother. I know the best thing to do is get a lawyer and we want to and are trying but just need some help now. Thank you everyone.	Yes
Oklahoma is the place.   So, friends of mine are dealing with their mothers death. She passed last week. They are pretty sure that their parents were not divorced but have been separated only for 20+ years.   The father(or widower) might be married to someone in another state for around the same time of the separation to now. He is also starting to try and call the shots on many things with the estate.   Anyone have any advice on what they should expect? This is confusing me to no end but I'm not a lawyer.	Yes
"Not sure what to do at this point but I'm hoping for some advice.  My mom is in a marriage with a guy who seems to be mentally unstable. They have been married for almost 9 years. He verbally abuses my mom, saying very nasty things to her, of which some have been recorded. He has an extremely bad anger issue and will literally get mad over anything and everything. She had him arrested once for getting extremely angry and throwing her phone against a wall. He has even told my mom that he will ""beat the sh*t"" out of my brother and I if we ever go to the house that is in my moms name.  My mom had left the house about three weeks ago due to him being angry. She lived out of a hotel for about 2 weeks and is currently living in a RV. Today, he closed all the bank accounts, which have a fairly large sum of money and told her that she has to come back and be a ""good little wife"" or she will never see the money again. The accounts where joint accounts. He also started to throw out her property since she left the house.  She had hired a lawyer around the same time she left the house and yesterday had to fire him due to his office taking too long on the paper work and barely responded to her phone calls and emails.  I'm not sure what to do and I'm trying to figure out what my mom should do next. She says she going back to him because she has no other choice, financially. My mom is 70 and he is in his late 60's. Any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
I caught my husband cheating today. I'm still in shock so please excuse my grammar and other mistakes. We have a 2.5 yo son and I'm afraid of how this could affect him. My husband has been carrying on an affair with a coworker who is also married. I do not work and have no skills or means of supporting myself or my son. My husband is threatening that he can take full custody and deny me rights to my son for this reason. He is using this as leverage to prevent me leaving the state to seek comfort in the company of my family. Or to even leave the home we share because he insists he should get to see his son every night.  My little boy means everything to me and is all I have now. I can't lose him. My husband would likely lose his job if I made this public but would also beat me to death. (He has beaten me before but I have never had the courage to report it or save photos). I don't know what to do or how to get away without risking my life and my son's. I want to leave but I'm so  afraid. Please help. 	Yes
"In the ugliest of all ugly custody battles: The mom accuses the dad of stalking (not true), and says he's not allowed to go near her house.  There is no court order to enforce that, but she's said in text messages ""you are to stay away from my house."" There was one time he went to drop them off and didn't see until afterward that she had texted him to stay away, and she told him ""you are now harassing me, you have been reported to the police.""  The kicker is - he never goes into her driveway (because of past demands to ""GET OFF MY PROPERTY""), he parks on the street to let the kids out.  So if he doesn't go into her driveway, is he doing anything wrong? Isn't that city property?  He obeys usually, it's just that one time that he honestly didn't see the text that worries me because she said it ""was reported.""  And all he ever does there is pick up or drop off the kids so they don't have to walk.  Can he get in trouble for this?"	Yes
Hello r/legalavice, You have been helpful in the past, and I am now one the verge of solving a major headache in my house.  Here is a little background: My daughter was born when I was 17.  I am now 33.  I was able to pull my life together, her mother was not.  Approximately three years ago I took full physical (shared legal) custody of my daughter in order to remove her from a toxic environment.  She is now 16 years old.  We have been dealing with a wide range of behavioral issue, some which got better and some that did not.  It boils down to that we have high expectations and rigid rules in our house, and she is either unable to unwilling to follow them.  My wife and I are constantly fighting with her, and our marriage is also taking a lot of collateral damage because of it.  My daughter's mother is a very toxic person.  She has 9 children to 4 men, she has stolen money from my daughter, she give my daughter panic attacks when my daughter refuses to let her borrow money now, she lives in a very small 2 bedroom house with a rotation of unpleasant men etc. etc.. When my daughter moved out of her moms, it was because her mom was drinking heavily, having intercourse loudly in the living room, and yelling incoherently at my daughter.  This has been documented in our previous custody modification.  Since she moved out of her moms house three years ago, her mother has had very little contact with her and rarely gets her on her scheduled weekends.  I will answer any more questions that anyone has, but for the sake of brevity I will move on.    My daughter, me, and my wife are constantly fighting.  My wife only really got to know my daughter when she moved in three years ago, and despite their best efforts they have been unable to form a relationship.  My daughter is constantly lying to us and breaking our rules.  She came to us last week with a proposition.  A mutual friend has offered to let Jasmine rent a room at her house.  Our friend's daughter is also best friends with my daughter.  I would pay the $300 a month rent, my daughter would be about two miles away from where I live, and she would not have to change schools.  The family friends suggested we try it for six months and see how it goes.  I am familiar with her house and neighborhood.  She lives in a well appointed condo.  She is a single mom with a teenage daughter of her own and a 12 year old.  I am presently working out the details, but it looks like this could be a good solution for everyone involved.  I texted my daughters mother to let her know about the arrangement, and instantly she went on the offensive.  When I took custody of my daughter, I removed a chunk of child support from her income stream.  She has never quite forgotten it, and I think she would jump at the opportunity to get the income back.  The problem is that she is an absolute nightmare of a person, and my daughter living in her home would guarantee my failure as a father.  I have screenshots of the conversations where the mother is trying to borrow money and my daughter is begging her not to be mad at her.  I have the original documents I filed telling the story of how we found her on the side of the road at 11pm the night her mom had alcohol fueled intercourse in the living room.    If I allow this move to happen, am I opening up the potential for losing custody?  If this goes to court, what are the chances a judge would side with the mother?  Can she stop this from happening at all?	Yes
Is this possible?  I understood the order to read that my child's father is to pay $xx each month or it could be withheld from his pay.  Got a very angry couple of phone calls today that they are forcing him to have it held and a call to the Attorney General confirmed this.  I never asked my lawyer to put that in but what's done is done.  Is it expensive/complicated to change the order to say it won't be withheld?  The support has always been paid on time from his VA disability.  I don't see the sense in doing it through his employer.	Yes
My ex-wife and I have 50/50 custody of our 14 year old son both legal and physical. Circumstances have changed in her household and we have both agreed to a new living arrangement for him. We want to just submit a notarized modification to the court, so its on record and we are both held accountable for it. What is the easiest form to file (there are sooo many), we both agree on this for our son and have no intention on letting the court decide what is best. We just want it on file. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
My 27 y/o brother was in a car accident last Thursday. It's pretty serious. He has some fractures, broken bones, and a severe head trauma that has caused him to fall into a coma. He is currently in stable but serious condition in a neuro ICU room.  My family and I have been left in shambles because of my brother's accident. We are trying to collect all of his things to store away since we know he's going to be in recovery for a long while.   My brother is 27, unmarried, and living with room mates. According to the police station and tow company, the vehicle cannot be released nor the items removed by anyone but my brother or his power of attorney. The storage rental place said the same thing as well.    my brother did not have a living will or other documents pertaining to if he were to be unable to make his own decisions. We can't access any of his personal belongings to get necessary items like his keys and glasses. We aren't allowed the code to access his unit despite my brother having the same last name as my brother.   Is there ANYTHING we can do to be able to access my brother's belongings, there are several very important and sentimental items that will be lost forever or stolen if we don't get access and some of that means a lot to my brother and I.   If it helps, my mom, my father, and I all signed at least one medical document since the accident. My father is handling the insurance and health insurance portion, my mom is going back home to Florida because she still has a job and needs to keep it so it leaves my dad and I as the remaining two who can take responsibility but I'm fully ready to let my dad handle the legal aspect of my brother's recovery.	Yes
He left her via text and I was wondering about the procedure to help her get child support payments. He says he wants to be involved but does nothing so he may just want to waive all parental rights. I'm just a 17 year old with an immense passion for law and politics and I want to seek justice for her. 	Yes
I am a foster parent and have been getting increasingly frustrated with the way DSS is handling my daughter's case. It has made it abundantly clear that there isn't enough oversight. They make decisions on behalf of the kids that have a great, and sometimes permanent, impact on them and there is no higher entity signing off to ensure that the decisions being made are in the best interest of the children (spoiler alert: in my kids case, they're not!)  I want to propose some kind of legislation making it necessary to get a judge or guardian ad litem or someone to sign off on these big decisions before they can be implemented. And they need to be able to provide a GOOD reason for something as extreme and permanent as separating siblings into separate pre-adoptive homes. IMO this kind of decision should be made by a judge the same way a judge is who decides whether or not they go home to mom and dad. That isn't something that 2 people from the county DSS should be able to decide on behalf of a child. There needs to be more oversight.   I am in the state of Virginia. How can I go about suggesting a change in our laws like this?	Yes
Ever since we came to USA, my dad has been handling the finance and will not disclose it with my mother. He said its because she does not understand English very well so she don't need to know. They own a small ma and pa store here in NJ and have a house. She work +12 hours a day 6 days a week but does not have freedom to spend, drive(he wont let her drive at all. His excuses he is afraid she might get into car accident and cost $$) and can't stay out too late.They work in same place but she works more and have to cook and clean for him.  She has not gone back to native country since we got here or any vacation for over 15 years. The biggest issue is that they are always in debt. My mother wants to know why but he won't tell her what's going on. Finally she got fed up and wants to leave him. She said that's the only way she will see any financial documents. He has already handed over store's tax and other documents to her but not all of them.  They are getting divorced by mutual consent. After they talked about divorce, he  handed over store's tax and other documents to her but not all of them.She said she will have the store and he will keep the house because he refuses to sell the house. She does not want to get a lawyer to fight for the house because we cannot afford to spend a lot of money on lawyer.   I read online that a divorce lawyer will cost about 15k-19k but mediator will only cost few hundred so she wants to go into that route.   The concern is that we do not know if he is 100% honest about where all the money is and going. We are looking into free consultation with lawyer but I wanted to get some quick feedback first.   Will the mediation lawyer be able to find and let my mother know how many bank accounts he have and anything else he is hiding? How much can I help without my mother being there? I have to talk to lawyer alone and such because she does not speak English very well and cannot leave the store. I will help her run the store after he is out of the picture. She suspects he might be cheating but she has no proof so I assume its no-fault divorce?  I am already moved out and married so I will not be affected.   **tl;dr:** My parents are getting divorced by mutual consent. He handled the money so she has no idea whats going on.  Can the mediator find out what my dad is hiding financially? Can he/she make sure there aren't any hidden debt under my mother's name? She suspect he might be cheating but she has no proof so I assume its no-fault divorce? We are looking into free consultation.	Yes
She spoke to the local sheriff, and he claims that since she left she has no legal right to any of the possessions left in the house or the joint property. The sheriff and my ex-wife don't really care much for one another, and it sounds like he's filling her full of bullshit out of spite. She and the husband are still married, and I don't see how she forfeited her claim to her belongings when she moved out. I think the sheriff is full of shit and just being petty.	Yes
I'm 17 at the moment and want my baby's father in the delivery room. My dad threatened me saying he will call the cops if my baby daddy showed up and I'm scared because BD has statutory rape charges since he is 21. After my baby is born I know my dad wont let my BD see his child either. My mom is on board with my dad. Is there anything I can do? I don't want to be at home because my parents are emotionally abusive but I can't move out since I'm 17. I know in Texas it is legal to move out (I love in Texas) but I have to be financially responsible for myself and my baby. I rely on my partner, but my parents have and will try everything they can to make sure my partner is in jail. Is there anything I can do? Or he can do, considering he has statutory rape charges?	Yes
My wife and her ex husband have joint custody, after a fight broke out between her ex and his father while the children were in his company, and witnessed the event she filed a restraining order (for the children) and was granted emergency full custody.   We then filed for a custody modification. However all legal council on both sides have been dragging their feet endlessly causing the restraining order to expire before we even get to go to court. Now the children are being forced to resume the previous custody arrangements the existed before the incident.  My question however is a little confusing. Since her ex (the children's father) had a restraining order his lawyers had him sign control over the case to his parents. (Who are narcissistic) This whole time we haven't been going up against the grandparent, not the father.   Now that the restraining order has expired, is their a motion we can place to have them remover from the case?	Yes
I was wondering if I gave up parental rights if I still had to pay child support in Arkansas? 	Yes
So long story short. The final document was supposed have me taking Thanksgiving break parenting time on Odd years and her on Even but somewhere between all the drafts it got switched i didnt notice. It may not sound like a big deal but My Fiance's family always has their reunion here in GA (they are from Texas) on odd years. We were also planning to get married this year the Saturday after Thanksgiving.  Needless to say My fiance is pissed that I made a legal mistake that has compromised our plans and my Ex is pissed just because.   My Ex has been really easy going ever since she was granted permission to have the kids visit her for 3 weeks in MA. They just returned from their visit and everything has been civil until we recognized this error.   What can I do to fix my fuck up?	Yes
"First off I live in Australia and I'm on mobile (and I'm kinda tipsy so I apologise if this is incoherent).  When this happened the ambulance was called but the cops showed up first and they've deemed my brother as the ""aggrevied"" and myself as the ""respondant."" I'm not really sure what this means or how he's managed to play the victim (the police filed this not him which I don't really understand either). He had no wounds from this incident beyond cuts on his hand from the ceramic breaking on my face. I've since filed a protection order for myself against him but did not show up to the first court hearing as being in public with my fucked up face causes me great anxiety. (I already had problems with going into public but this is a major setback with my mental health situation).  First I was wondering if I should show up to the next court hearing and how to get some sort of compensation for the loss of work and as I'm  currently looking for another job, loss of being able to find a new one while the stitches dissolve and past that, because well, my face is fucked up now and it likely will be that way for a long time. Also compensation for the setback with my mental health.  As much as I want to get a restraining order, we both live with my parents and if I do that they'll likely kick me out (my mother is a narcissist and I am not the golden child).  I also haven't gotten any sort of apology from him (it's been 10 days) and feel extremely uncomfortable in his presence. Mostly, I just want a written apology. He's fucked up my face for life and hasn't even said sorry or shown any kind of remorse at all. Some sort of compensation for my face would be nice also (he makes more money than me) but isn't necessary.  I'm also worried for his current girlfriend and future partners because if you can do this kind of crap to your own sister, I'm sure he's capable of much worse to others.  I'm not completely sure of the advice I'm asking for really but thank you in advance for any replies."	Yes
"This is in Nevada, Clark county.   I am helping pay for a relative's divorce. It is not going smoothly, but I don't need to get into the relationship part of it here. What I'm concerned about is that I am not being told the truth about the legal proceedings, court dates, etc. I would like to verify a few things without relying on the word of this relative.  For instance, this relative has said he has appeared in court a number of times due to the soon-to-be-ex ""filing things against him"" and ""dragging him into court"". So there should be a record of that somewhere, right? Can I look up that kind of thing online?  There have definitely been custody hearings for their minor children. Are records of those publicly available?  Their court date for the divorce hearing has supposedly been postponed several times and is now allegedly scheduled for October. Again, is there a way I can verify this without going through my relative (or his lawyer)?  You may have discerned by now that I am not happy paying for this relative's divorce, and you would be correct. There are lots of relationship issues going on in the background and perhaps I will make another post to discuss those. This post is just to learn how I can get more information to verify if I am being told the truth or not about what is going on."	Yes
My ex recently talked to a friend who mentioned that some night shifts pay up to 10% shift differential.  Based on this, she wants the child support recalculated to reflect any incentives that I am being paid.  Is this a standard procedure or is support calculated on base pay only?  I mean, what if I start working tons of over-time?  Will support payments be calculated on that?  Where does this end? PA resident.	Yes
"Throwaway for (as much) anonymity (as is possible in this day and age).  I gave birth to my son in 2015 in Arizona (Maricopa County). At the time of his birth, my wife and I were legally married. The birth certificate forms only contain spots for mother and father. AZ law requires a birth mother's legal spouse to be on the certificate as the baby's father so my wife is listed as his father. So far, we have had no issues with any public or private agency recognizing her as our son's parent. From research I did before he was born, we were expecting to have to do a ""second parent adoption"" in order for my wife to be his equal legal parent. However, due to the Obergefell decision and presumptive paternity, we did not do so. I would like to know if it is recommended that we go through with this adoption now.  I have 3 main concerns with going through with this process right now.  1. We can't easily afford it. Hiring a lawyer would drain our savings of our often needed emergency fund. 2. There are 2 court cases in AZ courts right now that could resolve this issue in either direction. [A case started in 2016](http://apps.supremecourt.az.gov/aacc/appella/ASC/CV/CV160266.PDF) that ruled in favor of a lesbian partner having equal parental rights. [The most recent one](http://apps.supremecourt.az.gov/aacc/appella/1CA/SA/SA170028.PDF), however, ruled against the presumptive father rights applying to lesbian parents due to gendered language in the law. This ruling is what prompted this post. The 2016 case is headed to the supreme court and if it is upheld, will overturn the recent case. These cases should be resolved by the end of the year but it looks like it will be 50/50 whether the resolution forces us into the adoption route anyway. 3. As far as I have read, you normally need to sever the original parent's rights. The only original parents my son has is the two of us. As far as his donor, we used a known donor who chooses to remain anonymous in all ways. This donor coming forward to get rights, and then sever them, is totally out of the question. I don't even know how to contact him. Will this be a problem?  Thank you for any and all advice, and thank you for reading."	Yes
I recently filed a petition to change my name, and checked several times to make sure I had the spelling right before submitting anything. Come to find out when searching the case on the court website, my current middle name was entered incorrectly. Is this something that could have an actual impact (since the whole point is about changing my name), or would it just be dismissed as a data entry error?	Yes
"My parents were married for over 10 years, but have been divorced now for almost 15. Recently my father was hospitalized and somehow my mother found out about it, came to the hospital and present herself as his ""wife"". She still uses his last name.   This caused some confusion as I was already there making decisions. I am his oldest child and his next immediate next of kin. Once I found out what she was doing I asked her to leave and requested the hospital not allow her back in but this has gotten me to thinking- how can I prevent this from happening in the future? Do I need to carry a copy of their divorce decree with me at all times? Is there something similar to a will my dad needs to have done clarifying that I'm his next of kin? He doesn't have a will now, and doesn't really have any assets to speak of, which is why I think he's never taken care of getting one."	Yes
"Hi r/legaladvice.  Important background info: I am a minor who will be applying to colleges starting in November. I have 5 months left until I turn 18. My mom is disabled and her sole income is from SSI.  Two years ago, my dad told us that him and my mom have been divorced since 2003; however, she did not recall ever signing dissolution papers. He had also been living with us this whole time and taking almost all of my mom's money. He gave us a big binder full of unorganized papers and left us with almost no money. Upon rehashing the papers, I showed my mom her signature and she said that is was not hers. So at this point, she had been unknowingly divorced for 12 years.  My dad had paid for my brother's college education, but he told me last week that he would not be contributing anything to my education. I do not expect my mom to contribute much, however, because she has a small income. So, growing frustrated with this whole mess, I drove to my local courthouse and asked to open the file in case there were some papers we didn't have.   As I went through the file, I discovered that a judge had ordered all of the petitions and papers ""void ab initio"" only a month after them being filed. The reasoning was because they were all prepared by a lawyer who was not licensed to practice in Illinois.  I went to a lawyer to ask him to just decipher the language for me and he told me what it all meant. He was also concerned why I was doing most of this alone, and it is because my mom is deathly afraid of my dad. When he left, he threatened us to not file anything in court, or else he will kick us out of our own house.  I told her today what is going on. She is speechless but has agreed that, with my support, she will go to the court to file the petition for dissolution, as well as a petition for college expenses.   We are both wondering now if we should get an attorney before we file the petitions? Should we go file them first? What happens if this case is not resolved once I turn 18--does it all go to dust? Can we call 911 if he comes to our house to threaten us again?  Thank you in advance for any advice. I am a little overwhelmed as I am the supporter for both my mom and myself, but I would really like this to be solved and done with before next autumn."	Yes
Hey all. My girlfriend's brother (17) is currently in custody dispute between his mother and father. His father is abusive both physically and emotionally, but has the legal right to him. He moved with his mother at the start of the summer and was supposed to start school in the fall. The father now wants him back.   The mother is convinced that there's nothing to be done about the situation, and he has to go back with his father. He has lived with his mother his entire life, but he had been struggling in school and was held back a year. The father lived in a better area as far as schooling for children like him was concerned, so the mother gave him to his father and paid child support last year to see if things would turn around in school. Her brother now wants to live with his mother again because of the abuse, but his father wants him back.   The father is also in custody of a baby girl whose mother is a drug addict, who is not in the picture. Her brother does not really want to go to anyone and say he abuses him because then he could lose custody of the little girl, whose mother doesn't want her.   I had asked him to talk to his father and tell him that he wanted to live with his mother, and he needed him to sign the papers or he would get the courts/law involved. If he wanted to keep the baby, he would have to sign, and if he didn't, then that's not a parent the baby needs either. He is now convinced that if he were to do that, the father would tell everyone who is in his house (a few other people, mostly adults,) that he was lying and he's not abusive at all.  What can my girlfriend's brother do about this? LEgally, if he does go to the cops and say he's afraid to go back, and the father had people vouch that he wasn't abusive, what would happen? I want to be able to help him out, but I don't know what rights he has, and what he can do at this point.    Thanks for any help. This is in Michigan if that matters for state laws.	Yes
My spouse kept her last name after marriage (outside the US). Then, a few years later, she became a naturalized US citizen and she changed her last name to mine during the application process (in Los Angeles, CA). Now, she's applying for Green Card for her parents, and USCIS asked for a evidence that the person applying is the same as the the one on the marriage cert (different last names). They allow proof by affidavit, but only if I have proof that there's no other evidence. What is the best evidence to present (old driver's license &amp; new passport, or just affidavit)?	Yes
I (28M) was involved in an altercation last Sunday morning with my boyfriend (28M) that resulted in us both going to jail. I need to know how much trouble I am in and if self-defense is an option. Here is the backstory:  Saturday was a great day for us both. We had been to the pool with friends and decided to go out later that evening. Once we got to the bar, he noticed some friends and asked if we could buy his friends a drink, so I ordered 3 drinks and a water for myself. Once the bill came, he noticed the total and started yelling at me because he thought I was only paying for water and the rest was a flirtatious tip for the bartender.  Not true.  He forgot about the three drinks I ordered for him and his friends.  That was enough for me to say I wanted to go home.  Upon leaving the bar, he was still irate with me because of the bar tab, which was US $18... I ignored him which set him off even more so he sideways punched (think slap, but with a fist) me in the face, twice.  Trying to get away from him, he ripped my shirt off of me. I ordered an Uber and he grabbed my phone and cancelled it.  I was able to use my Apple Watch and ordered another one.  Embarrassed and heartbroken, I just wanted to get home.  Once we got home, I asked him to leave.  I didn't care about my phone at that point.    I thought he left so I went to my guest bedroom and locked the door.  I thought being in the guest room I would hear him as he would enter the master first.  I was wrong, he broke the door down and pounced on me while I was asleep punching me repeatedly in the face.  Scared to death, I reached around for whatever I could find while he was choking me and grabbed a metal table decoration and began striking him.  Blood started pouring everywhere.  The decoration caught his forehead and backside of his hand.  Once he realized I wasn't backing away he got off of me.  I begged him to give me my phone or his so I could call 911.  He refused so I immediately started to run outside to get help.  He stopped me and said he was calling them from my phone.  I went out into my courtyard to wait on the responders, with the decoration piece in hand because I was afraid he might try to harm me again.   Once they arrived, he told them I was trying to kill him bc I was mad at him due to a bar tab... I couldn't believe it.  The guy I thought I was falling for was absolutely trying to ruin my life.  We were both arrested.. me for aggravated assault and him for battery.    Fast forward to now.  He has been trying to communicate with me through friends and directly.  He still has my phone and wallet but I was able to get a new phone.  He has told me he was going to be honest and let the prosecutor know I was defending myself but he wanted to talk to me first.  I have not responded to a single message nor have I sent messages through friends to him.  We both have no-contact-orders.  If he tells the prosecutor the truth, will the charges be dropped?  A few details to consider: He is at risk of being deported to Brazil.  We have only been together a few months.  Yes the signs were there and I just thought we could get past it.  I have a previous charge of failure to report an accident and currently on probation.  I have never been involved in a fight or an abusive relationship until this.  I have been financially supporting my bf and he is currently involved with another case where is seeking support from Georgia Victims of Crime. I think he's trying to do the same using me.	Yes
"A couple of months ago my girlfriend came home blackout drunk and was out of control breaking things and eventually bit me (no blood was drawn) because I wouldn't give her the keys to her car. Not having been in a situation like this before I called the police because I didn't know what else to do. Looking back, I should have just got in my car and left and let her drunken-ness run its course. Instead, the police showed up and asked if I wanted her to go to jail overnight to ""dry out"" and I said yes. I, naively, didn't realize what would happen. Now we have to go to court next Monday and I have no idea what to do. I don't want anything bad to happen to her such as going to jail. I'm a fairly new California resident and have read that it's nearly impossible to drop domestic violence charges even as the victim and I don't want to say anything incriminating towards her.  It's worth noting that this is the one and only time she has ever been physical with me. She doesn't remember any of it. She has her AUD (alcohol use disorder) under control + is going to AA + going to therapy weekly + she's taking Naltraxone which has been working wonderfully. She has had a really rough past few years while going through a divorce but she's finally turning it around to live a healthy, happy and productive life once again. I don't foresee this happening again because she knows I won't stay with her if it does + I know she *really* doesn't want to go to jail. Everyone makes mistakes and I have forgiven her and we are moving on from it.   Regardless, we still have court next week and I would be very grateful for any advice.  Thank you for reading."	Yes
As the title suggests, my dad is... well, not the nicest of people.  About a month ago, I ran away after a two week long series of events that included him tackling me to the ground in a parking lot, slapping me repeatedly in the face, and wrestling to wrench things from my grasp on a near-daily basis.  After my untimely and unwanted departure, I was committed to a psychiatric hospital for a few weeks.  Well, I've been out for about that long now, and things aren't much better.  Yesterday, after a yelling match, he kicked me, and out of panic I called the police.  I ended up telling them I felt safe at home because I wasn't sure what they'd do if I said something different, but he's physical often enough that at the next opportunity, should I elect to notify the police once again, something could absolutely be done.  My reservations surrounding this are probably obvious - I'm not exactly thrilled at the prospect of entering foster care, even though it'd only be for eleven months (I turn eighteen next July).  At seventeen, would they put me into foster care?  Could I request emancipation?  Would it be under the jurisdiction of my father to decide whether or not I deserve emancipation?  Would he lose custody?  Would my mother RETAIN custody if they're still married, or would they both lose it?    I guess, although I do have a few specific questions, I'm more confused about the general situation, its implications, and my options surrounding it.  Thank you in advance for the help, and I'll try to answer any questions in the form of edits!    - L	Yes
Hi, I'm new to legal advice and being in trouble in general, so please let me know if I'm missing anything.  First things first, I'm going to turn myself in obviously, I'm going to have my lawyer set up a time to do that.  About 5 years ago, my drug addict father showed up at my mom's house, after I hadn't seen him for over a year. In my opinion, he was messed up on prescription painkillers when he arrived. He was parked in the driveway, I yelled at him to leave, we yelled at each other. He tried to open the car door and I closed it back on him. I ran inside, called my mom, and he backed out of the driveway, called the cops and said I was threatening him. We were the only two people present. Honesty, I have no idea what I said to him. I was 20 at the time, and pretty upset that my abusive father showed up at my house without warning. The police arrived, assessed the situation, and told me something about how in domestic cases they usually arrest someone no matter what, but that my father wasn't going to sign a complaint and they told him to not come back to the property. The next day, apparently he called the police to sign a complaint. A warrant was issued for my arrest at the time, for misdemeanor domestic abuse  Here's where it gets fucked. I was never notified I had a warrant. Nobody ever showed up at my house. I never got a letter in the mail. I've had my ID ran by multiple police departments, including the one wanting to arrest me now (never in trouble or any other charges ever, just verbal warnings), applied for jobs, school, new passport, left the country and went through customs, etc ect. Nothing ever came up, so I had no idea.  About a year after that, my father passed away because his liver failed, due to the ridiculous amount of prescription pills and alcohol he was consuming.  Cut to just now. The police called me, saying they were going through old warrants and needed me to turn myself in. They explained that they tried to have the state's attorney quash the warrant, but the attorney refused. I'm not walking into the police station without a lawyer obviously.   What the hell happens next? The cops are saying that they'll transport me to court, I get booked, and then the bond court will PROBABLY throw it out. I don't believe them at all. I have bail/bond money, but I'm just afraid as fuck of jail.	Yes
Hi there,  I am writing this on my Fiancee's behalf and looking for advice on how best to deal with the situation mentioned in the title.  My fiancee is currently living in Texas with her mom and her daughter and is looking to move to the UK to be with me. He daughter is 4 years old and my fiancee has sole responsibility to her. The father is in another state, Mi to be exact, and is completely uninvolved with his daughters life.  Even when they were in the same state about 18 months ago, he had very little contact with his daughter, so much so, that he's not spoke to his child in over a year now. My fiancee has always tried to get him to speak to her, but has never had any luck, and now she just doesn't try anymore. He makes absolutely zero effort in her life. He does not pay any child support, never speaks to her, nothing. He is named on the birth certificate though, so as far as I understand it, as she was born after 2003, and him being in the birth certificate, he has full legal rights as a parent. His daughter no longer asks after him, and is at the point where she is calling me Dad, and this wasn't something we pushed her to do at all.  Now, we're trying to get a Visa completed so they can both move to the UK to be with me. As it stands, he verbally agreed to this, so to make sure we had something in writing, we went him a letter with all the details on it about the plan to move to the UK, and asked him to sign in and have it notarised in the local courthouse. He said he would get this done, however we've yet to receive back a copy of this letter which he said he has sent, so my fiancee is getting very stressed about this, and rightfully so.  I don't fully know the US legal system, well at all really, but wondering what our next step could be. I wanted to suggest that a visit to the local courthouse in Texas could be on the cards for her to request that she has full parental responsibility, even though he is named on the birth certificate, and try and allow her to make all decisions regarding her daughter. Or at least get court permission to allow her to move her daughter over here, even without his permission.  This guy as far as I know does not have a fixed address currently, and mixes between staying with his girlfriend and his mom, does not have a telephone or at least a number we can contact him on, contact is attempted over Facebook messenger, and that's about it.  Any advice on what our next step could be would be appreciated.  Thanks in advance.	Yes
My husband and I have been separated for over a year and living in different states. All finances are separate and neither relies on the other for any assistance. We have not even been in contact for over 6 months. I recently became pregnant from my boyfriend. I know my husband is the assumed father and I should put him on the birth certificate.   I have tried several times to get in contact with the husband to try and proceed with a divorce but he hasn't returned any texts or phone calls. I also know that he has moved at some point and I don't know his address or if he still works at the same job.   Could I just say that I am separated on any paper work and list my boyfriend as the father? I just want to do this with the smallest amount of stress and financial burden on myself and worried about legal fees adding up with having to try and track the husband down and having to do paternity tests. 	Yes
I can give details if you really need them, but the short of it is, I want to leave my husband but he's threatening me with taking away financial help (for me. He says he will provide for the kids). We have two small kids under 6. We live in a high cost state, I have been a stay at home mom all this time. I am lucky to work from home part time and currently bring in $600-1000/mo depending on how busy my client is (job is in administrative medical field). While that may seem like a lot, I use this money for all my own personal stuff (I'm talking clothes, shoes, sanitary items, even occasional medical care as I am uninsured), and all activities with the kids, some clothes for the kids, I paid for everything for their recent birthday party, etc, you get the idea. Husband now pays all bills (I previously made more, he made me pay a lot of bills, long story). He has been ragging on me about GROCERIES. What happened is I had to stop paying for bills and food because I don't make that much money anymore. I do ALL cooking, cleaning, chores, doctor's appointments, grocery shopping, etc.   Sorry getting too long just trying to give you an idea. I am leaving, and he's threatening me with with holding financial support. He cancelled my credit card today (literally the ONLY access I have to ANY financial info. He has everything on lockdown. Getting a clue why I'm out?!) He now is threatening to turn off my phone, take me off car insurance, etc.   I know this cannot be legal. I do not have money for a lawyer. I was denied legal assistance through a program in our state. I feel paralyzed. I applied for housing but there is a long list. I have the divorce paperwork ready to go, asking for interim spousal support, but that takes time too. I have a job lined up, but I have to take a certification exam and that isn't until July 31. I do have family I could stay with an hour away, but with no car and no money how do I make money (can still work from home, but would like to start a really good job with good pay)? I am willing to start applying for assistance but I'm at a loss. The first thing to do is divorce but with kids it's this huge web! If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be helpful.	Yes
My grandma is 88 years old, and despite having three children, she suddenly only feels comfortable sharing her finances with her eldest. My grandparents had major dollars in the bank a few years ago, the last time my mom was allowed to see their accounts. My aunt has always been under financial pressure, and we believe that my aunt is taking advantage of their fortune to pay off their huge debts and allow her son to pay down his gigantic mortgage. My aunt, who was given power of attorney, has her own debit card under my grandmas account and sold our cottage without notice or allowing us to see any documents. Despite the will showing that the cottage should be split evenly between the three children, we only received a fourth, and no explanation. When we ask were the other fourth went, my aunt told us that it was going into my grandmas bank account (the one she has full access to), even though my grandma used to have more than enough money to cover living expenses for the rest of her life a few years back.  Before my grandpa passed away a few years ago, he warned us that there was money missing from his bank account, and told us to sue my aunt. He informed us that someone was making purchases with his money. After he told us this, my aunt and her family shut down all communication with us. Then my grandparents stopped talking to my family, and grandma has barely contacted me or my family for years (mental illness is a huge possibility). Every time we go over, my aunt insists on being there, not giving us a second alone with her. The scariest part of this is that is could have been resolved easily, had my aunt brought us to the bank and showed us that she hadn't taken unfairly from my grandparents account. My uncle has tried to sue them in the past and has not yet been successful. When I see them at family events they can barely look us in the face. It is very clear that they had been getting away with taking large sums of cash from my grandparents bank account without them or us knowing. Do we have a case of elder abuse or abuse of power of attorney?	Yes
My wife came to the US 2 years ago on a K1 visa. We got married soon after and obviously changed her name. Her married name is on her green card but her maiden name is on her Brazilian passport. Now she's going back to Brazil for a visit and I'm confused about which name to put on the plane tickets. I'm assuming she'll need to bring our marriage certificate for proof either way but does it matter which name I put on the tickets?	Yes
Please point me elsewhere if there is a better place for this question. My girlfriend was adopted shortly after her birth in late 1994. Her adoptive mother is very defensive about any questions she asks about her birth/adoption and as a result my gf doesn't even know where she was born, although so carolina is most likely.   Are there any resources I could be directed to that could help determine her history without having to go through her parents?	Yes
Hello all, I'm based in the UK, my grandmother recently underwent a lung transplant, things have gone south as she had a heart attack and is now in a critical condition. My mother is looking after my cousin (as she lived with my Nan) and my Aunt who has downs syndrome. I'm posting on behalf of my mother on if the power of attorney (or what is it and we aren't completely sure) would apply. This is because my mum's step-father has been taking money off my aunty (with down syndrome) for himself whilst they've been staying with us, and we believe he may/ or may not, have taken my grandmothers stash of money she hid away in the house alongside her will. What I'm trying to ask is if there is anyway we can hold/take ownership over my Nan's and aunties bank accounts (as they're both in my nans name) 1. whilst my Nan is in her critical condition 2. If she doesn't make it through. Mainly to stop him getting ahold of any of their money (my mum is the executor on the will if that means anything) as he's began to say that he is looking for my nan's pin to pay for stuff whilst shes away (they had separate accounts for a reason and he isn't in the will whatsoever).  Any advice on what to do in the situation would be greatly appreciated- once again we are in the UK. Thank you.	Yes
Hi my dad is abusive not physically but its enough. I cannot take anymore of this and feel like doing extreme measures just to get away. I wont go into detail to derail the post. The bills of the house (water,electric,ect) come in with his name. My mom and dad share a bank account and he is the holder on it. So he has to make the decisions my mom cant.  I dont think if we ever went to the law if would be in our favor because of this. Hes a good manipulator to others. Im afraid anything will be in favor of him. Is there anything i can do? Do i have to start recording his psychotic episodes for evidence. He does not listen to anything we say ever so talking to him is not an option for he will not listen.	Yes
Location: Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and maybe Florida  Background: When my 2nd? cousin went to apply for a credit card, we found they had a number of loans in default from several years ago when they were under 18. We're about 90% sure their biological father stole their identity and have already filed a police report and they frozen their credit. They're on their way back to some semblance of normalcy, but the new issue is they have a large number of half siblings from their biological father, my shitty cousin. We aren't entirely sure how many, but my uncle, his dad, had met 17 of them, though relatives estimate around 25 to 30 altogether scattered through various states.  Problem: We realized if my cousin had stolen his oldest child's identity, it was likely he had done so to his other children as well. Unfortunately, as none of the others lived in that town, there was nothing the police could do to help. He works under the table to dodge child support, and can only be reached at a PO box in Indianapolis. Unfortunately, he would only respond to his dad. (After walking out on his family, he made it clear he wouldn't be around them. We decided to keep inviting them and he never forgave us for wronging him so horribly, but his dad was out of the picture at the time) Unfortunately, his dad was recently arrested  for selling meth and decided to skip town on bail.  Is there any way we could try to track down the other kids to let the mothers know to check? I know this whole thing sounds absurd, and quite frankly I would rather not air out family laundry online, but it would be inexcusable to allow him to rob his kids.	Yes
I have a friend, and due to the fact that she is gay, was kicked out of her home. She right now with family in Virginia, but thinks that she might get kicked out of there too, and might have to live alone in NYC or DC. Her location is in Tinton Falls, NJ, but now I don't know where in Virginia. Is she able to legally get back home? Or press charges on her mother if at all needed? I just want to know what her options are. Thank you	Yes
(California) My father was suddenly hit with a brain aneurysm 2 weeks ago and did not survive over the course of the next 10 days. He was transported in an ambulance and then airlifted to a hospital with an available neurosurgeon. My mom and I are expecting a 200k+ bill and afraid of what comes next. My father was a simple man. No assets (other than a used car/rents an apartment) and no debts whatsoever. Would my mom be legally responsible for his medical bills? Could not find any information similar to this situation so TIA.	Yes
"I live in Southern California, moved back in with my parents about a year ago with my 2 kids. I am a single parent my oldest does have his father in the birth cert. which he was summoned as well youngest does not. I recently received papers that my parents are seeking guardianship stating that they have the kids most of the time and they provide ""mental, physical, and emotional support"" neither of them have jobs my dad gets disability and my mom doesn't work ..my kids do spend a lot of time with them because i work 12 hrs shifts 6 days a week Night shift but i do pay them weekly I believe they want them for the ""financial"" aspect of it  ..will i need a lawyer? do i need any documents for court is so which ones. any advice will help"	Yes
My ex-wife filed for divorce last year, and at the time I felt like the marriage could still work and she was just giving up way too easily on something in which we'd both invested 15 years of our lives. Because mentally I was still in salvage mode (and because we weren't well off financially despite my making a really good income), we went the mediation route. During mediation, we put together a spreadsheet listing every asset and debt, which included the house, the mortgage, all property therein, the credit cards, the cars... everything. When all was said and done and divvied out to each party, the only thing left to divide was my 401k. It just so happened that, to make the property division equal on both sides, we split the balance at the time 50/50.  Fast forward a month, and we're down to the wire. I've already paid a lawyer to review the documents, and my ex-wife and I had gone back and forth a couple times. At the last minute, she has the mediator slip in the following clauses in the PROPERTY AND DEBTS portion of the decree:  Petitioner (that's her) will received $X,XXX for equity in the marital home payable upon refinance or sale of home by Respondent (my dumb ass).  Further down in the LIABILITY OF OTHER PARTY/DEFAULT section, this verbiage appears:  The home mortgage note shall be Assumed by Respondent. Application for Assumption shall occur within thirty (30) days of this Decree being entered. Respondent shall obtain release from mortgage lender releasing Petitioner from mortgage note. If and when Respondent refinance or sells marital home, Respondent shall pay Petitioner $X,XXX for her respective share of equity in the marital home. The payment must be made within forty-eight (48) hours of closing of sale or refinance and must be paid by certified funds or EFT.  At the time I was sick of the back and forth, sick of paying out the wazoo for seemingly arbitrary changes, and still in the mindset of not wanting any of this to be happening, yet being dragged along anyway kicking and screaming. I didn't think anything of it, I didn't pay an attorney to review the documents again, and the mediator seemed to think everything was rainbows and unicorns, so I went along with it.  Fast forward to present day. I'm looking at everything that happened with the property division, and I'm realizing that, if my understanding is correct, she has already received her share of equity by virtue of how the property division was calculated. What I want to know is, am I interpreting this correctly? If so, I want to move forward with getting that portion of the decree nullified, written off, or whatever. Thanks in advance!	Yes
Hello all, This is a pretty straightforward question, just not really sure where to start.   My wife and I can't make it work and we're looking to file for divorce. The complication is that she is a Japanese national, I am a Canadian national and we both currently live (for the last two years and for the foreseeable future, at least in my case) in California.   We got married in Canada, about 9 years ago. No kids, 2 cats. We still have a few assets (investments) tied up in Canada, and a few in Japan. I can't speak for her, but she would be very likely moving back to Japan after all is said and done.   What would be the correct avenue to file, in this type of case?	Yes
Abusive husband knows i wont report him to the police because due to reasons CPS gave us two strikes. (first time was during the time after i gave birth, he lied to the doctor and told her tht i didnt feed him- had to be investigated by the CPS; the second time one of my kids told her teacher that she was hit - she was talking about when you slap a kids hit for trying to touch a hot stove- but she didnt understand that scolding =/= abuse) and so we have 2 strikes on our house.   I finally decided to go through with the divorce but my husband wants to keep up with his abuse (he left the house for 2 weeks taking his stuff, now he is threatening to call the police if he isnt let in) He knows fully well that if his domestic abuse is reported or if the police get involved the kids will be investigated and there is a highchance of them being taken away.... i have 6 kids under the age of 16.  Any advice on what to do when he calls the police? how to handle CPS? the divorce process hasnt fully began cause im still waiting on legal aid.... plz any suggestions are appreciated.	Yes
My boyfriend has to pay child support to his child's mom. He paid through Western Union the first month (last month) as per the agreement, and the money was supposed to start being taken out of his check this month. They never told his employer to take the money out, did not send his child's mom a card to receive the money on, and now today is the day she's supposed to receive the money. She's badgering him and we're not sure what to do.   Should he send the money through Western Union today and have a copy of her signature saying she got it? What do we do if he sends the money today, but next week she receives a card and they take the money out of his check?  The Child Services number for the county she lives in has not been answering their phones, and she apparently didn't have gas to go up there to talk to them in person.   Redditors, please help!!	Yes
So my wife and I just had our second child yesterday and now because my wife told our doctor that she had used marijuana throughout her pregnancy they want a social worker to talk to us. The baby was full term and she is healthy as can be. I would just like to know what my rights our in this situation. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you in advance.	Yes
My son is currently in an inpatient psych unit. He may be discharged within the next couple of days because his insurance doesn't think he needs that level of care. His psychiatrist disagrees, but insurance has the final word. It has been mentioned to me that his father and I could say we aren't taking him home because we couldn't provide the care he needs and then the state would step in. This is called a 51A I'm told.   I have no desire to do this and will only do this if we feel he will hurt himself or others once he is home. This is one of the reasons he is inpatient at the moment. He is absolutely no better today then when he went in there 2 weeks ago.   Anyone have information on what happens if we do this? How do we get control back of our son? Who would make his medical decisions? Would we be able to see him?	Yes
My ex is court ordered to pay child support in addition to half medical and half school expenses. He was laid off and instead of looking for work has decided to go back to school. He said that he can no longer pay the child support or maybe pay a minimal amount (less than $35/week) which is hundreds less than he's ordered to pay.  What are the chances a court will calculate his income based on minimum wage? His earning potential is way higher. I really can't afford an attorney so I'm trying to determine what to do about this.	Yes
"Setting: I live with my parents, over 18years old. My sister and her husband drop their 2 kids off at my parents' house @ 6:30AM on certain days of the week for my parents to watch them while my sister and her husband go to work. It is known by many family members that her husband has anger problems, he has been on lithium because he is bipolar, and he takes Vyvanse for ADHD.   History: Last year he choked me out over a slice pizza in front of his kids with 2 witnesses (both my siblings) present prior to this event. No police report was filed.  I had a copy a my sister's house key because I was staying at their house a few times last year. Her husband decided to rudely wake me up and take the key off my key ring.   Her husband wanted their house key because I used it to get MY charger from their house that my sister had been reluctantly wanting to bring to me for weeks. So because I grabbed MY charger they start making threats that they will call the cops claiming I steal things from them (totally incorrect) I only took MY charger. So when her husband tells me to bring them their key I say, ""if you're going to treat me like a convict you can go and get new locks for all I care! I'm not going out of my way to bring you anything!"" Then on the phone, he threatens to beat me up the next time he sees me.  As her husband takes my keys and  leaves my room shouting you are not welcome at our house! I literally had been woken up by this and I was naked on my bed so I get up to shut the door so I can dress myself. He then throws his arm threw the door shouting which one of these keys are mine! I'm just trying to close my door and get dressed. Then he started hitting me because I shut the door on his arm, he starts beating my head and I fall to the ground. My mirror breaks right above me and shatters all over my legs. He hit me on the right side of my face because I fell on my left side. There were 10-15 punches to my head while I was on the ground. He put me in a choke hold and I almost pass out as I try to get him off me. Any attack I made was based out of self defense. His children were on the other side of him and eventually the door swings open and both children are watching him throw a barrage of punches at me.  After everything we call the police and I go to the hospital. I have 3 hematomas with huge amounts of swelling but no hemorrhages or broken bones.  I'm pressing charges for assault and battery and getting a restraining order. Please give me any advice to help me ensure that this does not happen to anyone in my family especially the kids. The kids are already starting to show signs of violence. They hit and kick people especially their mother 100s of times a day."	Yes
This is post ended up having quite a few questions but they're all  in regards to money.  I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ?   My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?  This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.  Please help me, I want to live my life on my own as soon as I can, I don't live with physical abuse or anything too bad but there is some problems and it's just one of those homes where you don't want to stick around past your due.  The day I turn 18 is going to be a great day and I want to get an idea of what I have to do.  I appreciate anything you can help me with even if it's only one thing, thank you in advance to/if anyone that can help.	Yes
I'll try my best to keep this brief, but I am looking for some direction.  I was born in 1978, by 1979 my parents were divorced and my dad bailed on us and moved to Florida. My mother re-married several years later and had 2 sons with her new husband. In the early 90's when I was 12/13 years old my mother asked if I wanted to be adopted by my step-father. I agreed, and they took the legal steps to adopt me and change my name.  Now, one important factor here is that step-father was extremely abusive to me specifically. I have no fond memories of this man. In fact, I chose not to burden my children with the same last name as it's synonymous in the town I grew up in.  Also, when I reached the age of 21 my real father reached out to me for the first time. I've since built a good relationship with my real father and have come to regret the adoption that occurred when I was young.  The adoption took place in NJ, where I was born. I currently live in PA and would like nothing more than to reverse the adoption, or at the very least, get back my original name.  My step-father died nearly 15 years ago at this point. My real father is very sick and I'd like to get this done ASAP but I have no idea where to start.	Yes
I was looking at scholarships and student loans, and noticed that there were a lot more options for people with spouses. Is there a way I can marry myself to qualify for this without actually marrying someone else? Would I divorce myself somehow before getting married for real?	Yes
Hello. My fianc√© (30F) and I (37M) have been together around 4 years. We live together and have a 2 year old daughter. We have joint accounts including checking and credit cards. For the past 3 years I have been supporting her and our daughter exclusively. My fianc√© was a full time student and recently graduated from college. I'm currently only making $30k annually. In the 3 years my fianc√© had been going to school, I payed nearly 100% of all living expenses including rent, utilities, food, etc. After she graduated she was offered, and took, a teaching position making around $44k a year. She talked me into buying her a new car last month. The car is in both of our names as I am a co-signer. Our current credit card debt is around $25k. All credit card debt is in my name with the exception of one credit card, which she is an authorized user.   So a few days ago things got weird with her. She started going out partying and yesterday tells me she wants to split up because she's not happy in our relationship. This has devastated me because now I'm loosing everything. She's sticking all of our accumulated debt directly onto me while she will be also taking our daughter. She said she hasn't been happy for around 6 months and was contemplating on leaving, meanwhile here I am digging myself deeper and deeper into debt, living almost off of credit cards. She basically used me to get through college and now that she's accepted a job, she's going to leave.   I'm not sure this is relevant, but she's currently on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, of which lately she has been throwing away. She has become unstable.   So here I am. I'm asking for advice on what I can do legally to force her to pay for half our accumulated debt? Do I have any legal recourse? I know I should seek an attorney but I really really cannot afford it right now. Please, please don't berate me on my situation. I know I messed up. I made many mistakes financially. I can blame my fianc√© for her continuous false promises of stability financially, but at the end of the day, it's all on me. You have to understand, I'm in a really really low end of my life right now. The bottom just suddenly fell out. In the past 72 hours we went from talking about buying a house next year and living comfortably financially to: my family being torn in half, my daughter being taken away and being on the hook for $25k in debt plus a new car loan on top. I'm asking for advice not asking to be belittle for being a dupe. I already feel like crap and cannot handle anything else. Thank you for what help you can provide.	Yes
Hello, Long story short I am divorced and my ex signed papers giving me sole conservatorship of our child. He still see her regularly and we have been on good terms until recently. When we were married he was mentally and verbally abusive to me, and lately those behaviors have slowly started resurfacing. I have realized that for the past few years I have been battling terrible anxiety Bc I have still not gotten away from him.  My current husband and I have talked of moving to s new place, just two states away, where there are better schools and opportunities for my child and we can raise her in a smaller city than the one where we currently live. I believe I am within my right to do this but my ex is threatening to take me to court to get me to stay in our current city. Does he have any legal recourse to make us stay?  As I have explained to him, I am willing to tell the court he no longer has to pay child support so he cAn use the money instead to visit regularly. I would work something out where he saw her every month.  Am I legally allowed to just move away?	Yes
After many years I finally decided to cut off contact with my mother a few months ago.  I'm well into adulthood, but the abuse has had some pretty lasting effects.  She came to my house tonight, unannounced, at supper time to give my children birthday gifts.  While she was here she mentioned that she was thinking seeking a lawyer with the intention of suing for visitation rights.  What legal rights does she have to my children?	Yes
Ok, so a few months back I met this white girl from GSU on Tinder. I fucked her ONCE but nothing serious and haven't heard from her since. Now she messaged me on Facebook and says that she's pregnant and that I'm the father which is BS and she wants me to pay for the expenses and pay child support. She's a huge slut and has probably slept with dozens of guys and there's no way I'm the father I used a fucking condom. Anyways I'm broke and here on a scholarship and can't afford nothing and even if I could I wouldn't as I'm not the father. She said she'll get a lawyer even though I don't know how her redneck ass can afford one. So how can I deal with this bitch?????	Yes
I don't know if this belongs here or if any of you can help me but I live in Florida, I got married in November of last year, and I recently decided to change my name. My husband has two last names and I only wanted to take the first of the two names. I got it taken care of at the Social Security office last week, my name is changed on my SS card and it is exactly as I wanted, it went great.  Well,I had my appointment with the DMV to change my license today and they told me I absolutely cannot do that, Social Security shouldn't have let me just take one of his last names because he has two last names on our marriage license. They told me either I need to take both names, he has to change his name, or I have to petition the courts.  He's an immigrant and can't change his name in this country without a ridiculous amount of problems, I don't want to take both last names for personal reasons, and It's like $300 to petition for a name change here.   Something about this feels not quite right; I'm not changing his last name, I'm just electing to take only one of the names. Is there anything I can do or any law about names/changing that I can reference to hopefully prevent me from having to petition the courts? Is this fishy to anyone else? Do I need to just bite the bullet and petition for the change?	Yes
My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.  My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?  Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.   I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!	Yes
Step siblings are 16F and 15M. My brother is 11. I'll be 18 next month. Our dad married their mom 3 months ago.  Our bathroom has a changing room (which doesn't have a lock) and a bathroom (which has a lock). Since it's very small, we leave clothes in the changing room.  My brother was taking a shower today. The step-siblings decided to be funny and went into the changing room and took everything out. His clothes, towels, whatever else that was there. Told him that he should come and get them from them outside. They kept this going for two full hours until I got home and put an end to it.  My brother was shaking when I brought him his clothes. He was very cold too as you'd expect. He's been crying and begging them but they didn't stop. That night we told the parents and they laughed it off. Said that kids play pranks on each other and it's totally fine.  I later talked to my dad and he told me that my brother needs to grow a pair and learn to protect himself. Not helpful at all. Today, the 16F step-sibling told my brother that I won't always be around to protect him and this was just the beginning.  I'm thinking of what the best way is to protect my brother here. The step-siblings clearly think it's fun to make him miserable and parents are not being helpful at all. Should I contact CPS? Police? Anyone? Any other suggestions?	Yes
"My wife has brainwashed my children and they now have fulminant parental alienation syndrome, clinically speaking. What can the courts do to help beyond ordering parenting classes and specialized counseling for the kids? What are the possible repercussions and what recourse could there possible be? The court does not currently see or recognize the alienation and I am wondering what I have to gain by spending the time and money establishing this fact. The court initially chose to not call it parental alienation because I'm transgender and  ""I am the one who deviated from the family structure we established""...   Thanks in advance!"	Yes
If a couple is married, can one person file bankruptcy on their own? I'm married but have past premarital debt. My spouse doesn't have debt or bad credit. Would it be possible for me to file bankruptcy on my debt that occurred before our marriage without him having to file with me or be effected in any way? He has a security clearance to think of and his job depends on having good credit to keep his clearance. I need to protect my husband from my debt. I have a disabled child whom l stay home and care for, so me working to pay off the massive amount of medical bills and hospital stays my childs disability racked up with me being a single mom before I got remarried and got health insurance is impossible. My credit is shot. I'd really like to start new if could. My ex-husband doesnt contribute a dime for our son and never has. I've had hell trying to get the court to enforce support beyond the order, so all the bills are on me and hurt my credit. I can't afford to take the ex back to court again, not that he'd get a job and contribute anyway. What can I do?	Yes
Ok this is my second posting of this and I'm legitmately serious how can I seriously prepare for a divorce? Are there secret bank accounts? Legal loopholes for evading alimony?	Yes
"Going to try to make a long, complicated story short.  I had a brother, will call him ""Luke"", and his wife whom I'll call ""Lois"". Luke and Lois have been together since they were in middle school, and have had a long, happy relationship that resulted in their marriage. For years, they tried to build a family, and due to his low sperm count were unable to. Luke died in a car accident over a year ago, which devastated Lois.   Lois approached me recently, telling me that she and Luke had tried really hard to get pregnant, and were about to try fertility treatments. They had allegedly discussed the idea of asking me to provide sperm in case Luke wasn't able to. Lois says she still wants to have a baby, and wants it to be as close to being Luke's as possible... That's where I come in.   Lois wants me to be the baby's father. She says she wants nothing else from me, just the sperm.   Lois and I discussed this with my parents. They both seem really eager to get this done. You see, I never want kids of my own. I hate kids, and I hate relationships/women in general, so I'll likely never get married or have my own family. If I don't do this, our family's bloodline ends, and Lois will never have a baby related to Luke.   We haven't ironed out the details legally, and would like to know if it's possible to sign all my parental rights over to Lois, and if I can avoid mandatory child support and visitation. Again, I don't want to be involved in the child's life, and neither does Lois. Lois stated the child never needs to know that I am the father either if I desire it.  So any help/advice on this front would be great. I'm leaning towards doing it, mostly to help my parents and Lois out. State is New Jersey."	Yes
"My grandma had a stroke, she is fully paralyzed on the left side. Can not function mentally. She can not go to the bathroom without the help of someone else. My Step grandpa will not help her because he is physically unable. My step grandpa is also very emotionally abusive to her, yells and cusses at her when she needs her diaper changed or is hungry. I do hold recordings of my grandma complaining about how she is mistreated and never wants to ask for food because she doesn't want to be emotionally abused.   My mother has power of attorney, yet my step grandpa declines her the call list when tonight my grandma was admitted to the ER. My grandma says that she doesn't want to be around her husband (my step grandpa) because he is ""not nice to her"". My grandma has medicare in Arkansas and a supplemental plan.  My step grandpa will not go, by any chance, of selling his car or any bit of the house (half my grandma's) to help her with her medical treatment....   APS has been called and no progress has been made. My grandma needs better TX than she is provided. APS in Arkansas does not take an elder individual out of the home to be cared for.  What can I do for my grandmother to be rightfully taken care of?  I am a bit beyond my understanding of this situation and am looking for any words of guidance.  Thank you!"	Yes
"So my little sister attempted suicide due to Cyber Bullying from multiple people her age (15-16yrs old) Obviously my family and I will be pursuing legal action but the kids are in a different state. We have account data and screenshots plus a phone number and documented conversations where she is told to ""kill herself"". They are from Michigan and we are from Florida. The internet doesn't seem to be forthcoming with information on how to prosecute between states and it would help put my family at ease if you guys could give advice on how to charge them in some way and also listing what the potential punishments are."	Yes
 I am a grandmother trying to get my granddaughter out of foster care. I'm trying to become party to the case by filing for intervenor status. I fit the criteria. I then want to file for probate guardianship. The atty I consulted asked for a $5000 retainer which is beyond my means. How do I do this myself? Forms? Examples? Help! 	Yes
Little backstory is important.  We obtained our green card (mom and her son (me)) through marriage with him. He has started drinking last months more and more and he is just gettibg more aggressive. We don't know what to do. This morning he threatened my mother and she was able to record it. He said he is going to her work place and drag her out and that today we will see who he really is. I'm currently in my car couple blocks to where I live and I'm scared I don't know what to do. This isn't the first time he blows up but I just can't keep it. He keeps threatening my mom since we got our greencard from him and we want to stay here ( they've been married for almost 5 years). I'm afraid to escalate but how am I supposed to sleep knowing he is living in the same place as us?    How can I protect my mom's and I's status? He keeps saying he will say the marriage was a sham (it wasn't). How hard is it to win if he does this (we do have photo evidence and many people that can probably testify).   I'm sorry This is probably not the right place to have a meltdown but I can't keep pretending this isn't happening. I know this will make it way harder for us financially(if he leaves) but at least we can sleep fine	Yes
I'm currently waiting the 21 days until I can request for a default decision to be made for the complaint of annulment I've filed (my STBX has been served and is not signing). We had no children, assets, nor debts to share, so it should be straightforward.  Has anyone ever either filed to move forward in default for complaint of annulment or divorce in Nevada, and how long did the turnaround take to get the decision? Were you requested to appear in court to verify anything? I have evidence I will submit with the affidavit to prove the annulment is valid--is there any chance that for some reason it wouldn't be granted to me? I want this over asap and I'm just trying to gauge what kind of timeline I should expect to continue having to deal with this.   Also, if there is anyone out there who knows how I can add divorce as a backup option within my affidavit, like an addition within my complaint statement, maybe in an exhibit, that would give me a bit of reassurance. Thanks so much!	Yes
when i was about 8 or 9 my dad and I would stay with his GF who was an exotic dancer who used heroin regularly. he is very abusive to my family and I. whatever whatever. I am trying so hard to not see him anymore. i live in MI, USA.   like I was saying, when i was 8 or 9 my dad and her and I would all sleep in the same room. they would be having sex while i was in the room! (didn't completely know when i was younger due to a lack of knowledge, but now I remember their convo and the noises they were making. pretty easy to put 2 and 2 together).   i was just wondering if i can bring this up and tell anyone and have him get charged with SOMETHING. i know it's probably a no since there's no clear evidence, just my word against his. but i'm just wondering. he does have a bad record of DUI's and domestic abuse.  TL;DR- can my dad get charged with anything if it's just my word vs his	Yes
"Looking for advice/a restraining order. This woman has done nothing but torment my wife and my children and constantly enrage me. Wife has said she'd take care of it multiple times, but she still hasn't, years later. Now I do have some idea of the time-frame of the following events, but not all of them. Some of them were last year.  Here's a fun story about my Mother-in-law:  12/2015 It comes out that she's been cheating on her husband for ~3 years with her husband's best friend, it comes out her daughter did the same thing for 4 months. Threatens his life multiple times to everyone who'll listen, for five months lies to everyone around her about the whole situation because of ""what he did to both of them"", comes out that she's still seeing the bf, divorces husband and marries bf so he can get his green-card.  -Multiple times has run up to my wife in the store, immediately berating her over not letting the kids come around anymore. Kids now refer to her as ""scary monster lady who yells a lot"".  -Corners my wife when she goes to pick up the kids at her grandmother's house, again immediately barging into the house screaming at the wife.  -We literally move an hour away, just to be in a different area  where there's ""no chance"" of seeing her or bf ever.  -Wife graduates college, specifically tells friends, family, etc. not to even tell her mother about it, so obviously MIL shows up but hangs around in the back so nobody sees her until halfway through, then nobody tells me because they know exactly how I'd react. Thank god for family, right? Wife breaks down about it later. Great job guys.  8/2/17 0915 Shows up at my front door, knocks, gawks at my daughter, then son as I'm coming out of restroom. Is already almost in her truck by the time I reach the front door. Pulls out in a hurry. Kid says ""why was monster lady here? I thought she couldn't find us anymore.""  She has been told on all of these occasions by my wife and I both to stay away from my family to the point that she knows what we'll say before we say it. She is consistently and actively harassing, stalking and taunting us causing us to have to watch over our shoulders when we go out, as a result not really wanting to go anywhere. Would love for this bullshit to stop and for this bitch to stop getting away with trying to insert herself into our and our kids' lives. It's disgusting and disrespectful and I wish she'd drop dead.  **TL;DR** Need crazy MIL to stay away from my family."	Yes
My ex, and father of my youngest child, was arrested in May of raping a 15 year old girl that was in his care.  He also had drug paraphernalia in his home, and had been allowing the girl to get drunk with him on a regular basis among other things such as cold showers with our son and things that CPS wouldn't divulge.  Instead of sticking it out to stand in front of a jury, which from my understanding there was plenty of damning evidence that he would be found guilty, he decided to take a plea deal of Felony 2 (that is info I have gotten from him and he has been sugar coating, denying to me while telling others he woke up with his hands in her panties and remembers nothing as he was blackout drunk, I have yet to hear back from my lawyer but only 2 weeks have gone by and he isn't allowed to have contact with our child at the moment) My question is this, how worried do I have to be about him seeing our child again, he has only called once talking to me as he isn't allowed to even talk to him on the phone.  Even though he isn't allowed contact with his daughter, he has seen her though.  My worry is that someday he is going to be able to get visitation again to our son, putting our son in dangers, whether sexual or otherwise, and I wish to terminate his parental rights in order to protect him until he is old enough to make the decision to reach out on his own (child is 6 right now).  I would in no way terminate his rights if I didn't honestly believe it was in my son's best interest.  The guy has gotten to where he is mentally unstable to boot, he says he is being required by law to seek therapy as part of his sentence.  I am really just worried for my son and know that my lawyer is a busy guy, so looking for some opinions on what I might be able to expect if I pursue this matter in court.	Yes
So my cousin has a child from a previous relationship when she was around ....20 I think. The parents kept it a secret and our family kind of turns a blind eye to it. I am not sure what happened to the child...I am assuming she is being taken care of by her father and is being given child support (or some form of support by my cousin's parents). My cousin met a good guy and has him totally whipped, I believe they are set on being wed in about a year from now or sooner. The guy rebounded hard after a breakup and believes my cousin is his soulmate (FYI she is a BITCH). I do not believe they told him about the child and because the guy is a pretty successful the parents want him to marry her. Also I am not too fond of him because he is like a sponge and just totally soaks up my cousin's evil personality and waits on her like a servant. Anyways...long story short...can he divorce her if he finds out? or is there some legal loophole he use to prevent this trickery? If I told him, I am pretty sure I would get shut down quick and he would not believe me. Hes an ass (most likely due to my cousin, otherwise he seems likes a nice, shy guy), but I do not want him to fall into this trap laid out by my evil cousin.	Yes
My (ex)husband and I have been separated for two years. I moved to Ohio (Cleveland area) from Pennsylvania (Pittsburgh area) and have resided in Ohio for the entire two years. I started paperwork for a disillusionment, but he refused to sign the papers because he says he can't make the trip to Ohio for the final court hearing. Papers were never filed.  We have no children, we never purchased anything together, and we have agreed on our debts.  My question is am I able to file for divorce here in Ohio without him? Or do you I have to file for divorce in Pennsylvania? Am I able to do this on my own or would it best for me to hire a lawyer? Is there any legal aid available for this if I do need a lawyer?  Okay that's like four questions, but I have no idea how to proceed and I just want this to be over. Help, please.	Yes
Today has not been a good day.   For the last two years I've been dating a mentally unstable girl, and for the past couple days she for reasons unknown to me ghosted me and refused to talk to me. So today I went over to talk to her and see what was up,  and she looked me in the eye while laughing and telling me that last night she had sex with someone and cheated on me.  I was obviously angry as all hell, I punched the bed and squeezed her arm in anger (she was sitting in my arms). I calmly asked who it was with, she rolled her eyes saying she wont say. I asked for my things back and left. I knew my best bet would be to just block her, not post anything and be the bigger person.  She's now posting things saying I'm abusive and beat her when I never would and may report me to the cops.   I'm really scared, I'm 18, about to go to college and I'm terrified my life could get fucked over for something I never did.	Yes
I have a friend who recently divorced and moved into a new house with her children and new boyfriend. She is listed as a tenant on the lease.  A couple of weeks ago, the new BF gave the youngest child a smack on the butt and apparently the children told the vindictive and sadistic Ex-BF/Father of the children and he wasn't very please. Eventually, a couple weeks went by and the Ex decided to file for a protection order, on behalf of the children, based mostly on lies and fabrication (they feared for their lives) against the mom's new BF.  Well, the protection order was served and instead of the new BF finding a place to crash, he essentially said that her and the kids needed to find a new place to stay until the court hearing.  Is there any legal recourse or way around this? She's listed as a tenant on the house, but I believe the BF is the lease holder. The Ex is trying to make the mom's life miserable and really gives no cares about the welfare of the children, as is evident by the fact that they are likely going to have to sleep in the car until the court date as the protection order is keeping them out of the same house as the new BF and he won't leave.	Yes
(AZ) I'm overwhelmed on how to fix my name on my birth certificate to match my maiden name I used most of my youth. Anyone with information or ideas on where to start or knowledge of attorney near Tucson Arizona	Yes
My father was diagnosed with a form of dementia three years ago. He had also some problems with his heart and died approximately six months ago. My mother is also elderly and my sister had moved into their house under the pretense of helping my mother take care of my father.  My father had a whole life insurance policy which he'd been paying into since my sister and I were young children. He had always told us that the value was 600,000 and that we would each receive 300,000 upon his death. When I politely inquired my mother and sister about the policy, my sister told me that she was sole beneficiary of the life insurance policy and would get all of the proceeds.  I was very surprised since I had been promised the proceeds my entire life. My mother told me that she and my father could not afford the payments, and that three years ago my sister took over the payments and started giving my parents money to pay off the value of what my father had already put into it. This was in exchange for being made the sole beneficiary. My sister showed me the paperwork under extreme duress.   She didn't even get close to putting in the money that my father had put into it. I think that she took advantage of my father's dementia and my distance from the family and manipulated him into making her the sole beneficiary. Is there any way I can get the half of the policy that was promised to me, because she took advantage of the situation?	Yes
Long story short.  My wife and I separated for a short time and filed for divorce, divorce was dissmissed.  We have a minor child and there was a child support order issued.  We worked things out after about 6 months and have been back together for several years.    I have been paying the child support all of this time up until 6 months ago when I took a new job.  Our question is how do we request the child support end?  The only forms I was able to find were if the child turned 18 or was emancipated.  I know to dismiss the divorce all we had to do was write a letter to the judge requesting it, is that all tjjat we would need for this?	Yes
"Ex wife agrees to pay mortgage and is awarded home. States in decree that she is responsible for all things cost related to home, and that she will indemnify me. I sign quit claim deed. We agree I must be refinanced off by Jan 2019. Long story short, she gets pregnant with some guy she just met, and they moved into his house a town over. She tells me throughout the year that she will be selling the home. Has a buyer, but she took a modification out on the home, and the deal falls through last minute. She can't sell the home without either raising that amount or getting someone else to pay difference. She then drops on me, hours after this falling through, that ""well I took an extra month of maternity leave"" and that she has ""no future plans to make any payments."" I have no document of her saying this, but I called the bank that day and let them know that I was told she will not be paying.   Not sure what to do about it, or what this means. I told her that I would be willing to extend the amount of time it takes to get me off of the loan, but it was agreed that she has to pay the mortgage. She stated that she will not do so. I explained that she will be in contempt of court, which she laughed at me and said ""what is that going to do for you?"" She has a car that I have to pay.   Can I petition the court to take the car back? She wants to stop payment on the house, why does she get to keep the car? What kind of punishments might occur as a result of this? Taking the car back would free up 300 dollars a month. We currently have a 50/50 custody agreement with the kids with no payments to each other. I'm getting sick of the irresponsibility that she keeps exhibiting. I know courts don't care - caught her cheating. She spent an 8k tax return I gave her at Disney World/Vacation instead of taking care of the kids/responsibilities. Not sure if I should even bother with any of this or just let it all go.   Please, I really need help in this matter. I'm tearing my hair out.   Thank you"	Yes
"So this has a ton of backstory, but I guess its all important.   My mother got me diagnosed with Autism syndrome at a very young age. She believes vaccines caused my Autism, and had to go through EIGHT DIFFERENT doctors to actually get me diagnosed. (I am convinced you can get anyone diagnosed with anything, especially when they are young and do what their parents instruct them to do during evaluations)  When I turned 18 I started having to do stuff like pay taxes and etc. I was working full time while going to highschool. I had a very strong social life with many friends, and was well liked throughout school. I am the opposite of what you would call ""Autistic"" and when I did eventually explain my situation to my school, they offered to help me get my diagnoses fixed. Even the special ed director quietly told me ""I'm not legally allowed to say this for sure, but you do not come off as autistic at all""  Anyways, I came across something that led me to believe I was receiving SSI for my disability. I confronted my mother about this on 3 separate occasions. The first two times she denied it. The third time she says that I used to receive a minuscule amount (less than 300 a year) I had called the SS office and they confirmed I was receiving disability, but could not specify how much.  The nearest SS office was a bit of a drive from me, and I did not have my license, so I couldn't get there any time soon, especially with working on graduating highschool and work on top of that. Everything I do/get I do on my own, buying food, clothes, my asthma medicine. The only thing I didn't pay for was rent. I never had any help with getting a permit or learning how to drive.  When I finally got an appointment set up and a ride to the SS office, my mother caught wind of it. 3 days later I am kicked out (2 hours after my graduation) and move to Texas with my father. Now that im here I am getting all sorts of shit done, and just recently went to the SS office. I received a statement of Disability benefits and realized I have been receiving $532 a month since early 2015. With my mother listed as my beneficiary.  This money has 100% NOT been being used for me or my wellbeing. And she has been collecting it for a full year after I turned 18. on top of that apparently she did something to disable the payments after she got last months payment (the month after I got kicked out) So I no longer receive the SSI ( something I shouldn't have even been receiving in the first place)  Do I have any legal recourse??? Is there any way I can prove she used these funds  fraudulently? I know that she will fight in court, she is insane and not the smartest person, but very stubborn. I didn't pay rent while I lived with her, and wonder if she will say thats what she used SSI for? (even though she is married to someone that makes over 100k a year, and she just started working full time for the first time since I was a kid, and only because my stepdad forced her to)  She blatantly lied to me that I recieved SSI, and this is mindblowing.  Sorry if this post is all mumbo jumbo, I just learned all of this withing the last 30 minutes and my mind is in a million places right now. If I didn't explain something well enough just ask and I will be happy to elaborate."	Yes
I'm sure there are a ton of posts like this on here but non of my searches turned up anything. So to start off with I reside in the state of Nevada. My SO and I are currently separated. I have moved out of our apartment and am currently in custody of our infant son my SO visits with him a couple times a week but is pushing for more visits. We are currently in marriage counseling but it is not going well and I am thinking of divorce. What would I be getting myself into as far as custody goes if we divorced and I sought sole custody? Is there such a thing as having majority custody of him? I would like to move with him out of state, would I be able to do that if we shared custody of him?	Yes
Posting for my friend. She's in California.   She's finally gotten out of her abusive and toxic marriage (uncontested divorce, he served 18 months prison time for dealing drugs and is now out)  Ever since he got out he's been showing up at her parents home (where she currently resides with their 6 year old daughter). At all times during the day and night. Yelling, throwing bricks through windows but vanishes after 20 min or so to avoid the cops.  He's threatening to cut her up and needless to say she's terrified. They filed for a RO which has been granted but he seems to be dodging the cops so they can't serve him? So they don't want to do anything really since he can't break a restraining order he's unaware of?   They have security cameras and video of him flipping out and terrorizing the whole family. But the cops won't do anything.   She just wants to start over and get her daughter away from her ex and his violence and the drugs.   What can she do now? I'm at a loss. I know these posts occasionally show up here but I've never really paid attention to it. I'd love to be able to actually help her figure out her next steps and not only be there to be a shoulder to cry on.  We talked about getting her to come to us for a couple months (Texas) but she's afraid he'll flip out more or she'll loose custody like he threatened to call the cops on her for Kidnapping his daughter if they were to leave the state. I'm waiting to hear back what her divorce decree says about custody.	Yes
"So my Great-Aunt(We'll call her Mary) is in her 80's now. She has wrecked two cars within the past year, and recently purchased a third one. Fortunately, she recently fractured her pelvis(I know, it sounds weird to say ""fortunately"" in this context), so she's not currently able to drive. Her younger sister(20 year difference) has offered to bring my Great-Aunt Mary to live with her in another state, but she would have to sell her own house so my other Great-Aunt could build her a small guest wing. Great-Aunt Mary can hardly see anymore, and is constantly repeating everything as if she didn't literally tell us the same thing five minutes ago. Nobody really knows what to do at this point. Great-Aunt Mary has no husband or children. We've offered to drive her to places, so she doesn't have to drive anymore, but she doesn't want to give up her freedom. She does her own yard work, which is how she broke her pelvis. She clearly can't really do all the things that she thinks she can, and we're just not very sure about how to proceed. None of us have ever had to deal with this before. We almost got Great-Aunt Mary to live with her sister last year, but she backed out at the last moment. Her money is going to run out at some point, as she got a reverse mortgage a couple of years ago, so we do need to get her house sold if we want to move her to her sister's house. I know part of it is that she's stubborn, but she's never lived anywhere other than this area as well.   What should we be trying to do? Is there anything that we can do? My mom seems to think that we can't really do much, since we aren't her children or grandchildren."	Yes
I'm going through a divorce right now and I was hoping to get some guidance here. Im currently stationed in Virginia but was married in Alabama and thats where my soon to be ex-wife is currently living with our 2 children. So we have a mutual agreement contract which states she'll be taking all payments of the second vehicle and Ill be giving her a certain amount of money for child support until our children have reached the age of 18. The contract is signed by both of us and is notarized as well.  So on the beginning of this month when the contract was supposed to take place she told that she didnt want to buy the car from me because she doesn't want it.  So now Im stuck paying for another car I cant afford and was wondering if itll be worth getting an attorny to help with that along with the divorce paperwork. Like what would happen if I got an attorney to press that case for me? What would be the negative consequence of her breaching a contract? Or would I be out of more money than before because I now have to take that route. I was also hoping someone could tell me how long we have to be separated in Alabamas laws in order to file for divorce. Ive googled and I cant find anything on an amount of time we need to be separated. I know Virginias laws and they're easy to find but thats not the case for Alabama since we were married there.   Im planning on getting an attorney but I want to have as much knowledge as possible before I do. If you have any questions please ask. I'm activr military and Ive already spoken with legal quite a few times but it always comes down to then telling me to find an attorney in Alabama without any real guidance.   Thanks in advance!	Yes
Basically this situation is really fucked up and my GF is losing her sanity from her psychotic neurotic mother.   &amp;nbsp;  I was told that I should open a case for the mother to request that she should be put in a home under the states care.    We are in Washington County, Oregon.   &amp;nbsp;   The mods asked me to remove the link to the google doc I have written up, so I will be posting it at the bottom of this post.   A user to the original post wrote  &gt;  *If you are drafting and filing something on behalf of another you are engaging in the unauthorized practice of law*  But I was told that in a circumstance like this, when the person is unfit to make the decision to be put in care, you open up a court case and let the state take over and make the decision to put the person under the states care. This person is unaware of her own mental state and the situation, is unable to comprehend what is happening.   Furthermore, I don't have any idea how to write a legal document, so there is no way this post in its current form is a legal document. It's just a document.   Since I didn't make it explicitly clear, there is no personal information here. at all. all names are fake.   &amp;nbsp;  Anyway, I guess my specific question is what steps to take to open up this case, and what kind of actual legal document I should send over to the court to get this going.  Civil court I think.   Really I'd just like advice. Okay here's the post:   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;   REQUEST FOR CASE TO BE OPENED FOR Bonnie Smith  CONTEXT:   &amp;nbsp;  Jenny Smith (Female, 32) lives with her 4 children, mother Bonnie Smith(Female, 64) and Joe Lee(Male, 23, author of document).   &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie is the current caregiver of Jenny‚Äôs son James Smith(5), who has a rare debilitating disability [redacted too specific]. Jenny took care of James when Bonnie was not working.   &amp;nbsp;  The situation a few years ago was that Bonnie had her own apartment, Jenny had her own, and she came to the home only for her shifts, though she continually refused to leave the house.    When Jenny moved to another house last year, Bonnie stayed at the new house longer and longer until she became considered a resident. Bonnie now takes care of James at all times. Bonnie also pays around half of the household bills.   &amp;nbsp;  A DHS case was opened last year, where Jenny expressed that for several reasons she could no longer take care of James, among the main reasons being her mental health and that she could not live with Bonnie anymore.   Different options were discussed, the main consensus was that Bonnie would move out of the house and continue taking care of James.   &amp;nbsp;  We no longer believe that Bonnie is mentally sound enough, nor physically healthy enough to take care of herself and James.  We also do not believe she is capable of holding a job.  We believe she may benefit best under the care of the state.   I (Joe) am soon going to attempt to take over the expenses of the house and Jenny is considering options for James including putting him in a home.   &amp;nbsp;  We were already planning to open this case, the timing of when has sped up to now as  Bonnie is currently threatening me (Joe) with a restraining order which would trap Jenny with her longer and affect my career, Bonnie is acting increasingly mentally unsound,  and Jenny is having a mental health crisis from prolonged exposure to this situation.   &amp;nbsp;  &amp;nbsp;  REASONING:   Jenny says she feels she has no control over the house.    Jenny says she feels that she cannot take care of the house while Bonnie is living here.    Jenny says she feels trapped in the house and unable to leave.    Jenny often feels she has to lock herself in her bedroom to avoid Bonnie.    Jenny says her mental health is suffering from Bonnie and adds (paraphrased);    ‚ÄòBonnie has driven her past the limits of her sanity.‚Äô   she ‚Äòcannot handle this anymore.‚Äô   she ‚Äòis unable to begin healing until Bonnie is gone.‚Äô    Jenny says she feels she cannot parent her children.    We both worry the children have been damaged psychologically by Bonnie.   &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie does not respect Jenny‚Äôs authority in any way.    Bonnie refuses to leave the house. She makes it difficult for Jenny to leave the house.   Bonnie follows Jenny around the house and will not leave her alone when asked.  &amp;nbsp;  Bonnie acts ‚Äúneurotic‚Äù(as an adjective) and believes that what she has to say must be said to Jenny, believing that there is an urgent matter to the point that she will stand outside of a locked door if Jenny is on the other side for long periods of time,   growing increasingly worried and paranoid as time passes,  more convinced of the urgency of her messages, raising her voice, beginning to whine cries, and changing the inflections of it ( it can sound like 3 people are talking).    If Bonnie is left feeling like this, she will begin pacing around the house mumbling to herself and repeating phrases in a scared tone, then grow angry and yell at anyone nearby including the children, in between randomly chuckling and shaking her head.    Bonnie will not sleep or rest during these times, and gets worse the longer she doesn‚Äôt sleep.    Eventually she will begin threaten Jenny (normally that she will turn off Comcast) if she does not do what she wants.   Bonnie is not aware she is acts like this, and grows increasingly defensive if accused, shaking her head and laughing while saying ‚Äúno, no, no‚Äù followed by threats.    Bonnie will refuse to leave the house when she decides she needs to leave for the same reasons.   &amp;nbsp;  The only way Bonnie will leave Jenny alone is if Jenny screams at and name calls her at the top of her lungs, and Bonnie will then calm down afterwards possibly for the rest of the day.   &amp;nbsp;   If Bonnie cannot talk to Jenny, she will tell her paranoid thoughts and worries to the children.  During any fight with anyone, Bonnie will yell in front of the children.  One of Jenny‚Äôs children now screams and cries during these fights.   &amp;nbsp;  If Jenny attempts to punish her children,  Bonnie says the children have done nothing wrong, begs ‚ÄúPlease stop Jenny, please stop‚Äù, then tells the children that everything is okay and that something is wrong with their mother, then rewards them.   &amp;nbsp;   The children have learned that they can manipulate Bonnie, screaming at her and name calling her until they get what they want because she will whine and beg them to stop until she does what they say.     If for example, Jenny tells Bonnie her daughter cannot play video games because she‚Äôs grounded, Bonnie will allow her to play when Jenny leaves the room.    Bonnie believes that she should not listen to what Jenny says because Jenny is being manipulated by me(Joe).   &amp;nbsp;   The children have come to know Bonnie‚Äôs behaviors as normalcy.    Any attempt at bringing outside family help into the family results in Bonnie yelling at them,    leaving them often traumatized within five minutes as they are not used to this kind of person.   According to Jenny, Bonnie‚Äôs physical health is failing and she is barely able to take care of herself.    Bonnie‚Äôs mental state has been the direct cause of her to get laid off at every job she has worked in the last decade before she began staying here.   (for example, she was laid off at the most recent company because she repeatedly insisted that not having the American flag raised high enough was illegal.)  &amp;nbsp;   ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS FROM Jenny:  The only time Bonnie acts decent is when she is attempting to manipulate someone.    Bonnie manipulates the children with gifts, and has taught them that if they are not being treated they are not loved.   Bonnie poops and pees herself everyday and rarely bathes.    Bonnie acts abusive and entitled after cleaning the house.   Bonnie spends frivolously spends her income then claims that Jenny has taken her money.    Bonnie attempts to make Jenny and the kids form sentimental attachments to trash so they will never throw anything away.(Note, she is a packrat)   Bonnie makes every situation miserable, is horrible to everyone even in public, no one ever feels peace.    Bonnie denies and immediately forgets anything and everything she does.   Bonnie does not believe nor is aware that she is not wanted in the house.	Yes
Hey, the STBX and I have filed and we were hoping to take care of things ourselves, but I'm getting more and more nervous about some personal decisions she is making, and may need to try to get majority custody. Either my google-fu is weak or I'm having a bear of a time finding decent listings for divorce lawyers/mediators. Is there a website out there that has a comprehensive list of attorneys in my area? To be more specific I live in central Wisconsin, near the Wausau area.	Yes
Hello, I'm not quite sure if this is the best place but I need to start somewhere. I, 24, have been living with my dad, his wife, and 4 kids (ages 4 and under). I am about to move out and my dad needs help with handling these children. The mother is almost non existent (stays in room and makes minimal contact), as she has a prescription drug problem... He is out of money, out of time, and almost out of his mind trying to find a helping hand somewhere to turn this situation around. My dad can't go out and make money because he is stuck at home taking care of the kids full time, almost 15 hours a day.. this situation is ridiculous and I don't know where else to go. Obviously she needs to get out but what is the fastest way to do so. My dad is afraid of reprocussions for calling CPS or setuing similar. The wife is a master manipulator.   We are in North county San Diego  Thank you, anybody, for your help.	Yes
My new husband and his ex-wife have joint legal custody of their two children, 10 and 11. He is the parent with primary physical custody, however, and they reside with us the majority of the time, with her receiving standard 1st, 3rd, 5th weekend visitation, as well as other holidays, etc., as noted in their agreement.   She is, however, a very high-conflict individual. My husband receives many texts blowups, sometimes almost daily, which usually escalate to her calling him over and over, or emailing him long diatribes if both of those avenues fail. Sometimes this will slow for about a week until the inevitable flair blindsides us again.   These communications can range from demands for him to provide her my social security information to run a background check on me since I reside with her children, to detailed questions about things in our home; do we have parental locks on all electronic devices? Do we have a gun safe? What is the ‚Äúsafety plan‚Äù for her children now that my son (13) also resides in the home? We need to provide her with the children‚Äôs cell carrier and plan information so she can monitor those accounts (in our name, which we pay for). Where are their shot records, right now? Why aren‚Äôt we making sure those phones aren‚Äôt on every minute, every day, as they should be reachable to her at any time?   These are just some of many examples of demands, all given in command form, ‚ÄúYou need to do this, RIGHT NOW.‚Äù They‚Äôre interwoven with name calling, verbal attacks, bullying, and total emotional meltdowns in which she has once even insinuated she will take her life, tell her children she loves them!, or a time when she had the children and refused to commit to returning them at the end of visitation, saying she‚Äôd be in another state, or maybe another city (although she DID return them, after we both were insane with worry and stress). The emotional breakdowns when calls aren‚Äôt answered or texts aren‚Äôt replied to, or information she wants isn‚Äôt given, can also come with threats to show up on our door at 3am to take the kids because we are unfit, to call the police, or just standard legal threats of all of these refusals to her demands or communications being ‚Äúdocumented‚Äù for her records.   Emotionally demanded or not, she has the rights she has as ordered by the state to her kids and information about them. Having joint custody means, (I believe?) she is supposed to have a say in their day-to-day life, but I‚Äôm not sure what our responsibility is on that front, or what the actual actions are to carry out abidance to that looks like. We do know WE have the right to have a life that isn‚Äôt plagued with these demands and emotional attacks under the guise of it being about the sake and safety of the children. We are planning on communicating our intent our ground rules and guidelines about communications with her, including we will not communicate on anything but things which are about the kids, and further than that, that we will only communicate with her about things about the kids which we are LEGALLY bound to do.   With all of this said, even generally, what are we legally bound to do? I know most of this rests in what‚Äôs in the custody agreement, but it‚Äôs pretty standard for the terms listed, no special previsions or demands made and signed to. Is there a place to start before we make is serious by heading to the lawyer for legal counsel? We‚Äôre willing to do so eventually, but dang‚Ä¶ we just want to know if we‚Äôre overreacting when we should have been saying, ‚ÄúLOL yeah right!‚Äù from the get go before we get official.   Thank you in advance if anyone out there is with me this long. I appreciate any pointers or guidance on this issue for my family.	Yes
"After three years together, my wife (32) and I (36) have decided to get divorced. This is her third marriage and my first. She has 4 children by her two ex-husbands (we have no children together, thank God). She moved out a few weeks ago, and I haven't gotten a divorce attorney yet.  Yesterday I received a settlement proposal from her attorney. I'm pretty much dumbfounded. She wants $40,000 cash and spousal support. I make a very good living, and when we got married she quit her job (working as a hairdresser) to be a stay at home mom to her children, which I was fine with. We have no joint assets. She and her children moved into my home, and I paid for all of our bills and most of her kids', although she gets a decent amount of child support each month from her exes.  I'm more or less in shock over this. I am hiring an attorney asap, but what can I expect from this, realistically? I've never gotten divorced and neither has anyone in my family, so I don't know what's standard. Would I really have to pay her ""support""?  She quit her job by HER CHOICE to take care of HER CHILDREN while I supported her to do that, so I didn't think I would have to be paying support for the decision she made. I can understand and expect it if she wanted to stay home with our children. I figured we would just go our separate ways with the things we brought into the marriage (no big purchases like homes or cars were made while married), and now I feel completely naive.  tl;dr: Getting divorced from wife of 3 years; she wants spousal support and $40k even though we have no children together"	Yes
Please let me know of any errors and things that I can improve upon. Sorry in advance.   I can't take this anymore. I want to leave this house and be my own person. I am tired of being threatened to leave by my parents. I do so much for them and they hate me.  I am 20 years old, unemployed, and have no car or drivers license. I was adopted unofficially and have no legal paperwork and have no idea if I even have a SSN or any means to get legal help in my situation. For all my life I have been treated as a glorified slave and nanny. I have pretty much raised all 3 of my younger siblings because my parents always had to work (which I understand) but it's way past the normal help here and there. I watched them as babies and fed and bathed them, I took them to school and all of that since I was 8 or so. For 20 years I have been the backbone of my family.  Although I didn't provide financial help I did do pretty much every thing else even cooking and cleaning after my siblings parents and grandparents. They don't even seem to realize how unhappy I am. I asked my parents for my information so I could get a job and they don't have it, they  flat out refused for 20 years to help me change that. Since  I graduated HS in 2015 they've been telling me to leave the house and to get a job but I simply can't because they all ask for my ID and what not and I don't have it. I hate not having my own identity to prove who I am to future employers. I want a change and I am totally helpless and powerless. I have no control over my life and it's already taken a toll on my mental health. I need an escape badly.   I've attempted suicide more than 5 times from 13-20 years of age and I always change my mind because these people are not worth my life. Yes they did raise me but it feels like they only did so, so they could keep me as free labor. I'm basically just a tool to them they don't even let me stay over family members houses or go out simply because they want me to watch the kids so THEY can go out or sleep or whatever. It's so maddening and I do it only because I love my siblings they need me and I need them especially the youngest one, she loves me more than our parents or anyone combined and I can't bare to leave her with them.    I'm so conflicted because they do this to me but on the other hand when we go out together and do family things I feel loved. But the good is only about 10% while the other 90% makes it not worth it in the long run.  Please if anyone knows what I can do to get myself as far away from here as possible, let me know. I'm going to die if I keep living like this. I will gladly give any information I can if you need it. Just please I need advice asap.	Yes
My sister's dad has had custody of her for her entire life, with my mom only having visitation. My sister just turned 18 and has a year of school left. She has moved out of her dad's house and is now living with our mother. We took her to her old school today to withdraw her and get her records sent to the school in our district, but the guidance counselor told us that since she's still in school, the custody agreement is still in place which means she can't withdraw herself or transfer herself, 18 or no. Her dad's cooperation is not an option. Are we going to have to go through the emancipation process with her?	Yes
I can support myself because I get SSI and now I could be my own payee.  I just don't want to be conserved again.	Yes
Hi. My sister is 15 years old and I'm 24. I live on my own and have a stable job. Our mother recently remarried to a decent man, but he has three kids (18M, 17M, 13F) from an earlier marriage. The two oldest are constantly picking on my sister. They take stuff from her, go through her drawers, keep tampons and pads from her, feed her hamster things it shouldn't eat, the list goes on and on.   She's so broken up about this. I've tried talking to my mom and her husband about it, but they just brush it off as my sister overreacting and trying to get mom's new husband in trouble, which isn't true.   So, what I'm wondering is if it's legal for me to let her stay at my place? I won't be taking her out of state or keep her from seeing her family. Our mother will still be her guardian.   It's my sister who's suggested this, but I just want to make sure this is on the up and up. I don't want to get in trouble, but I desperately want to help my sister.   Thanks in advance!	Yes
Current Custody is 70/30 with my ex husband.   Transfers are only delegated by Mother (myself)or Father.  The majority of the time his mother has our 2 daughters ever other weekend during the school year.  He is suppose to have the girl's during the summer.  But with the current conflict of my 6 year old stating grandmas boyfriend 'touched' her down there I refuse to let grandma do the transfer.  There's a DV case open with our current custody battle enforcing a restraing order against this man that the girls had spoke of touching them down there. First in 2015 and now 2017  Needless to say the father hasn't shown to pick them up after school ended. That was nearly two months ago. In alaska I know after 3 months of no contact with the kids is considered abandonment.   But I'm afraid the judge favors the father over the best interest of the children.  The fathers statement on why he wants his mother to pick up and drop off is that he has to work.  And he's not willing to co-parent.  But I know plenty of parents that wake up early to drop their kids off at day care and pick them up after. Or dropping them off with their family members for help but do their duediligance and pick up their kids and take them home. He refuses to do this.   Leaving the girls in his mothers care for nearly 25%-29% of his custody.   But yet the judge says if he doesn't come and get them on his physical custody during the summer and stay with me, he is not doing anything wrong?  I don't mind having them.  But its not fare to our daughters and I don't understand how this has gotten out of hand. How is it legal to do so??   I need further legal advice on where to go or what to do. We have our next court date on 08/07 but I have a feeling nothing will become of this.   Thank you.	Yes
I filed for custody for my 2 year old daughter in June 19. I received a letter from respondant's attorney stating that I failed to provide blank forms for a continuance. After going back to court they confirmed that I did not include it and advised me to contact a lawyer on how to respond. I do not have $2500 to hire a lawyer and they don't allow a payment plan. I'm not sure what to do. Please assist. Thank you.	Yes
Just a few days ago, on the 26th, my wife assaulted me and my 8yr old daughter and jeopardized the well being of our 1yr old daughter.  She was recorded as threatening to kill herself if her daughter was taken away.  She was charged with assault in the 3rd degree and domestic mischief in the 4th degree in King County, Washington.  The next day I left with my girls for my father's house in Oregon while I processed what happened.    There is a no-contact order the state put in place for me, but currently nothing protecting my daughters.  I will be going to court tomorrow to file a protection order.    For the last two days she has been contacting me through her third-party advocate, which she's entitled to, to try and schedule visitation with our daughter.  When depressed and angry she has taken our daughter away unannounced and without telling me where she was going or when she'd be coming back (never overnight and no official record of this) and because she is Turkish and without a job or any family here I'm exceedingly concerned that she will try to take our daughter out of state or out of the country.  She is saying that I am preventing her from seeing our daughter and am violating her motherly rights since there isn't any court order preventing her from being with her daughter.  I want to facilitate their visitation, but I believe it needs to be state supervised because there is no order in place preventing her from leaving with our daughter.  The volunteer state advocate I spoke with this morning assured me that I do not need to provide visitation and didn't think that it would look bad in the eyes of a judge who will inevitably be ruling on custody to wait one extra day to see the court.  My daughter is my #1 priority and she is doing terrific without her mother here.  She is sleeping and eating well and in good spirits.  Her mother called an officer to my father's house yesterday morning to perform a wellness check on our daughter and he verified she was well.    I can't help but be terrified that I'm doing something wrong and jeopardizing the upcoming custody battle.  Being Sunday I can't talk with an attorney, so I'm reaching out to you, Reddit.  Am I doing the right thing or is there something else I could do or haven't considered?	Yes
My wife served me with divorce papers last weekend. I have 30 days to file a response with the court in the county that she lives in.   My quick question is: when they say 'file a response with the court', does that mean I have to go in person, or can I mail it in? It'd take me three hours each way to get to the courthouse, so I'd rather not go there in person if I can avoid it.   Court is Washington County, Oregon.	Yes
My stepfather is highly emotionally and verbally abusive, but he has never hit the family. His threats range from breaking bones to killing my mother if she tries to leave, and otherwise he is always belittling everyone in very mean ways. He has caused me and my mom to have both anxiety and depression. My mom has four children with him and wont try to leave him for fear that he'll get custody and manipulate the hell out of them.  I was talking to my mom and she said that emotional abuse holds no grounds in court for a divorce or a custody battle because there is no physical proof. Is this true? If both my mother and I stated that he is emotionally abusive and gave a plethora of examples, would there still be no help for us? We need to get out of this toxic environment, but my mom says we cant get help unless he's physically violent.	Yes
Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.  Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.)   She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.  My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention.   The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.  After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)  The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family.   After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up.   This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation.   I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.  I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.	Yes
For context, my friend turned 18 at the end of October 2016. This drama didn't begin until well after that, around March 2017.   Her mother and step-father are not nice people, nor are they particularly intelligent (I'm putting this very, *very* lightly). For years, she's been told by doctors that she has both depression and anxiety (unmedicated until a couple weeks ago), but due to religious reasons/political differences, her mother insisted she be tested for autism. So she was, and the results came back saying that she has provisional aspergers; this means that she showed some symptoms, but those could just be byproducts of her unmedicated depression/anxiety combo. Her mother does not seem to grasp this at all, and insists that she 100% has autism, treating her as if she's a young child.   During a certain event a month ago (far too long to explain here, as it goes too far off topic), police were intervening, and her mother was howling about how she had paperwork proving that my friend cannot make her own decisions (we were trying to pick her up to take her to a comedy show), so she cannot decide to leave with her friends, and threatened to press charges on us for attempted kidnapping. She merely showed the cops the paper that diagnosed my friend with provisional aspergers and the cops had her go home with her parents, no other arguments permitted.   However, after chatting with someone this week whose parents/younger brother have actually gone through the process of gaining legal guardianship over someone 18+ years old, it came to my attention that her mother might be lying, or that she's forged some documents. We're not sure. I've done some light digging (some of which was very confusing to read), and it seems that, on the basic level, certain paperwork needed to be submitted, court dates needed to be set up/attended, and above all else, my friend should have been informed that all of this was happening (if it actually was). She received no notice whatsoever of anything like this.   So my big question here is: Is it AT ALL possible that her mother was able to sneakily obtain the legal stuff necessary with ZERO consent or knowledge from my friend, since she is not a minor? (And a second less pressing question, which you can ignore if you want since it's not the main focus: Are there any important things we should keep in mind if her mother presses this further, or if there's a confrontation over it?)	Yes
"Before passing, my husband's grandfather made his son (my husband's uncle) the executor to his estate to help make sure bills were being paid on time etc. In doing so he added Uncle to his bank account. Grandma does not have a bank account nor is her name on Grandpa's bank account.  He started off by paying off Grandpa's $10,000 credit card (which he quickly maxed out over the limit to $15,000 + stating it was insured and would be paid off when Grandpa passed so he thought he'd just blow through it - all stuff for himself and his family / some purchases were made day of / day after Grandpa's passing.)   Grandpa was in the hospital for a little over a month and then placed into in home hospice before passing. When he was released from the hospital Uncle informed Grandma that the hospital bills were over $3,000,000 and insurance barely covered anything so they were putting a lien on all their accounts and assets. To me this raised a huge red flag because I've never heard of anyone leaving the hospital with a bill - and even if so wouldn't they give you a chance to pay your bill before trying to seize everything? Anyway....sounded like bullshit to me. He has yet to produce any proof of these liens. No letters, nothing.  Grandma and Grandpa had 2 CD accounts that Grandma is the beneficiary of - one was $50,000 and the other was $115,000 - Uncle suggested they cash the CDs out early so the hospital/insurance couldn't take the funds for Grandpa's bills. After fees they cashed the CDs out for $47,XXX and $112,XXX - the day they were deposited into Grandpa's account the funds were transferred into Uncle's personal savings account. We know this because my husband decided to set up online banking for Grandpa's accounts to try and help Grandma figure out what was going on.   Grandpa also had around $30,000 in his savings account and $5,000 in his checking account before the CDs were released. One day when Uncle was over at Grandma's house she decided to call the automated system to check the account balances. There was about $2,000 in each account. Shocked, she asked her son where all the money went and his response was ""Oh, uh, I don't know. I gotta go."" and promptly left her house.   We've estimated he's taken around $180,000 that was supposed to be left to Grandma to live the rest of her years out without having to rely on anyone. Grandpa worked very hard to make sure he was able to leave her money and all his kids and grand kids money.   Grandma babysits for Uncle every week and has noticed he purchased a new safe, new RV, playground, used cars, home improvements, packages showing up every day ""Uncle's Name C/O Grandpa's name) etc. She also noticed that every time he has someone over at the house doing work he goes to the safe and pulls envelopes of cash out to pay them.  To me it's pretty obvious he's taken the money for himself and is leaving her high and dry. What's not obvious is what we should do about it. We are scared that if we are not prepared when going to the cops and they speak to him that he's going to hide/get rid of the rest of the money that's left.  Please keep in mind Grandma is on a very tight budget so finding a lawyer to help for little to no money will more than likely be very tricky.  Since we do have online access to the Grandpa's bank accounts we have printed out the statements, transaction history, and check images. Grandma also has the letters stating she is the beneficiary of the CD accounts.  If it helps, we are located in Oregon."	Yes
"Before I start, this is not about me.  I know a certain someone, let's call this person T, who just got married.. Let's call the person T is marrying ""SO"". Maybe like 3 days ago. NOBODY approves or know about this marriage, besides a handful of people. I found out that the ""SO"" cheated on T. There are a lot of other signs that screams NO to this marriage.   I'm wondering what are the consequences of T getting a divorce. What can T do so that there are a minimal amount of consequences for T? What are some advice for this fool?"	Yes
"I have sole physical and custodial custody of my children in California. My ex-husband lives in Wisconsin and has supervised visitation rights only. I want to move with the children to Oregon. I've verbally told my ex-husband of our plans, and he has no objections to this. Our current parenting/visitation plans will all remain the same.   Since this seems very simple, I don't think it should require an attorney and seems like it should just be a form I submit to the court, or maybe a form or official notification I submit to my ex-husband. I've tried to Google for some kind of ""intent to move"" or ""address change"" form from the state of California, but can't find anything like that. Maybe I just write my own letter?   What do I need to do to for this move? Thanks!"	Yes
My wife and I divorced 2 years ago. During the divorce she signed off on the house we owned jointly giving me sole possession. Since then I have had a new deed prepared in my name only so now, as far as the house is concerned, I'm the sole owner. However she is still on the loan which I've been making the payments on since she moved out in March 2013. I've never been able to refinance due to terrible credit and though it's improved since I'm still having issues qualifying. She wants me to refinance ASAP so she can be removed so that it won't show on her credit (she's trying to purchase a home elsewhere). Totally understandable and I'm trying to get it done but I'm curious as to my legal obligation to do so. For instance if I cannot qualify, does she have any legal right to challenge my possession? As far as I understood that when she signed away the home during the property division and a new solo deed was processed her rights to the property ended. Is this correct? I live in California for reference.	Yes
"Hello everyone,   I'm primary custodian and both the Dad and I have joint legal custody. Dad has married so our child, ""Sarah"", has a StepMom. Sarah is 11 years old and is at Dad's house about 3 days a week.   Here are some examples of what Sarah is fed at her Dad's house:  -A single hot dog for dinner  -A single small turkey sandwich for lunch (no mayo)  -One piece of pizza for dinner  -A granola bar for breakfast   She also has told me stories of being yelled at by StepMom for sneaking a piece of cake at birthday parties.   It's important to note that Dad/StepMom are weight obsessed. StepMom is very underweight and Dad makes multiple comments about how thin women, a la Audrey Hepburn, look best. They think Sarah is too big because she has a small stomach. Sarah is not overweight (per Doctor) and the stomach is something normal that happens before puberty for many girls.   When I try to speak with Dad/StepMom they claim they offer Sarah side dishes but she won't eat them. Sarah, while admittedly a picky eater, says this isn't true.   Sarah has developed a very skewed vision of herself. Keeps telling me she's fat and now works at losing weight (she's lost 4 lbs). I'm EXTREMELY concerned about her mental health. However I'm not sure if this qualifies as neglect because they are feeding her, just not much. Thanks for any and all advice."	Yes
"2014 I went to court filed for custody. My oldest I was able to keep. She was living with me anyway since cys got involved due to drugs in the house and some abuse. At the time my youngest who was 15 at the time also had a live in 19 year old BF. The constable found him in the closet in her bedroom. This all went to court including the constable. Why they let her stay with her mom I don't know.  At the time they said she was old enough to decide. She liked to party with her mom and now she's in rehab. Butler county juvenile has her in for the second time. The first time she went in she was 18 and she was still in high school. I was paying support to her mom. I stopped paying support to her mom since she was not living there. Soon as I did that butler came at me for support. She got out and I was paying the arrears for that while again paying her mom. The arrears were paid off and then my support juSt stopped because washington county domestic relations emancipated her as she was 18 and graduated. The week they stopped the support she ran to butler saying she was hot for drugs. THE WEEK MY SUPPORT ENDED! I figured this would happen. Anyway I enjoyed about a month of not paying support and just got the letter from butler setting up suppprt for ""the minor"". I am in the process of getting an attourney and would like some advice. She is now 19 and butler says they can make me pay support while she is there until she is 21. I'm trying to stay calm. "	Yes

I know somebody who lost parental rights to both of her children in 2009. Her boyfriend had beaten one of the children while high on methamphetamine. She also tested positive for methamphetamine and was arrested for paraphernalia during that incident.  She had a baby with somebody else in 2012. They separated in 2014. The father is now fighting for sole custody after receiving calls that the mother was using drugs again.  How much of an impact will the past terminations have on the mother's custody going forward?	Yes
My husband has no name of father on his birth certificate and his mother has passed. We found[ this document](http://imgur.com/a/Peunt) among her things. We believe that the letters in section A stand for Bureau of Vital Statistics, and that CSE is likely Child Support Enforcement. My husband emailed someone who was initially trying to look for records but then couldn't find anything and didn't reply when the document itself was sent.   My question is - is it worth it to go there in person with the document? Would they actually be legally allowed to give my husband any information, particularly if this was his mother trying to get child support from this person unsuccessfully?  Alternately has anyone seen a similar document? Are we incorrect about what it is? Can you think of why it seems there are two documents sort of scanned on top of each other it looks like?  Any help is appreciated. Sorry if this is the wrong place to post.	Yes
When I was 17 I worked at a theme park, and my mom had access to my bank account at the time, I still am not sure I could have kept my money from her, it was in my name.

"About two years ago my wife found out that she had an older sister from her father and an old girlfriend predating her parents marriage. She was excited to meet this older sister. Her father decided to take her out of state to meet her. Upon arival she was greeted by his ex-girlfriend of 30 years prior, who he had told my mother-in-law and wife would not be there.    During their stay they had decided to go out ""for dinner and a few drinks"" which turned out to be a swingers club.. My wife witnessed her father cheating on her mother with his ex in this sleazy place and was nearly in shock the entire time. They ended up staying longer than they had told my wife and she was very shocked the entire time and having panic attacks. She has been close to her father and neither I nor her would have ever expected this from her father, who was a seemingly cool guy before this. I have known them for 11 years.    A month after the trip back home the ex-girlfriend and older daughter moved to our same state, in the same town. The divorce ensued at nearly the same time, and then her father went to vegas with his ex and they remarried.. A shocking and tragic end to a 30-year marriage. The father continued to move in with the new/old family in the same town/same state as us.     He used my wife as an excuse to keep her mother from thinking anything fishy was happening. She has suffered greatly from this, after having been closer to her father than her mother her entire life. She has been diagnosed with anxiety disorders amongst other things and was rushed to the ER for trying to take her own life about a year ago..    He hasn't paid any child support the entire time, he didn't show up for court, they went and got him, he still didn't pay, according to my mother-in-law, for support per my underage sister-in-law. My mother-in-law got the house, he kept his truck, he gave his old truck to me before the divorce...He was also lying about how much he was getting from disability, while my mother-in-law worked two jobs to support them for nearly 10-20 years.. He remained on disability and got checks for each child and ""managed the money"" by lying about how much he actually got, and spent nearly all of it on his own personal interests. We found out he got a lot more from papers he left behind in the house..    We found online he was linked with an address out of state where his 'secret family' had stayed - it actually says it was in his name, and in the old truck he gave me we found dozens of reciepts spanning years for possibly rent for his secret families apartment(money orders to the same out of state town of his secret family). He also didn't give me the title to the truck, just a bill of sale saying he sold it to me for one dollar, and my mother-in-laws dad was the previous owner.. I don't think I have a way to get the title, but that's for another question..    He seriously messed up his whole family emotionally, and the older daughter is a crack head whore prescribed adderall and xanax bars, and tried to bribe me with drugs to sleep with her.. That's when my wife ended her relationship with her, while she was still visiting her dad after the divorce.. Her dad also supposedly has a painting that my wife made when she was 9 years old that was very sentimental to her, and some other personal posessions..    My mother-in-laws lawyer has cut off contact with her for whatever reason.. My wifes dad has done a lot of work for the state and city politicians here, like manual handyman stuff, and supposedly he has some kind of dirt on the lawyer.. I reccomended getting another lawyer, I'm just tired of all the drama and would like for her to get her stuff back and for him to pay child support.."	Yes
"My biological father left my mother when I was about 1 or 2. I've met the man a total of 2 times in my 22 years on this Earth. This man, still owes about 8k in arrears. Since I am now over the age of 18 and living on my own and now that he has 3+ other kids, he wants me/my mother to sign away the remaining child support balance so he ""doesn't have to deal with us anymore."" All I want is for him to leave me and my mother alone and to pay his dues. I will not sign anything away, because I firmly believe he needs to act like an adult and take care of his problems instead of trying to take the easy way out.  Since the initial contact months ago, he had managed to find out where I worked (I have a new job now) and had harassed some of my coworkers, trying to get information about me. He has also tried on multiple times to pay us off a portion of the money so we will sign away the remaining balance. Do I have any option of taking this to court since he is essentially trying to bribe us into signing? Or is my only option to get a restraining order/no contact order to stop the harassment?  TL;DR Biological Father trying to avoid paying arrears by trying to bribe my mother/myself with a lump sum of cash."	Yes
I'm looking to change my name and gender marker. It costs $435. I looked into waiving the court fees and I'm not sure if I can qualify because I'm a dependent. A foot injury from 6 months has prevented me from getting a job in case anybody says I should just get a job. Does being a dependent affect the possibility of waiving the court fees?	Yes
Okay, so I really don't know where to start with this. I am 17 years old and living in Texas. I recently moved out of my mother's house to live with my sister in my father's home. My father used to live here with us, but after getting a job in another state, he moved and I went to live with my mother. I lived with my mother from ages 15-17. As I lived there with my mother I started to realize how unstable the living situation was. There were times when she would yell at me so much that I had to leave to go stay at a friend's house. This happened multiple times. The incident that occurred that made me feel that I needed to move was when I came home one morning from spending the night at a friend's house to find all of my belongings thrown on the floor in my room. The entire house was in disarray.  She said that her friend was the one who was responsible for this, but now claims that she did it. I don't know which to believe. This all happened in the midst of her coming off of Xanax, so her words were slurred and she just wasn't making sense in general. This is not the first time she has had trouble with addiction. I was fed up, and decided to take my important belongings with me and move into the house I grew up in with my sister. I also feel that it's important to add that I go to school in the same city that my mother lives in, but I have plans to commute there while still living here. I really do not want to move in back with my mother. It is an unstable living environment. So I'm asking if, legally, I'm allowed to stay here. What rights do I have? Does she have any power over me? I'm very anxious that she might try to make me live with her. Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
The title  pretty much says it all.   	Yes
So this is about my fianc√© and his two kids (7) (4). she left all three of them back in march 2015 and in the divorce decree he waived child support but she's required to pay half of everything for them. he has primary physical custody and they split custody though she very rarely comes around. back in Nov 16, they went to court to make her pay half of day care by court order, so that's all she's been paying since.  now, it's been well over two years, she never has them, never offers to pay anything and we are wondering how easy changing a divorce decree in regards to child support will be. This is VA.	Yes
"I am in the process of a 730 evaluation for primary custody of my kids.  Two kids 7 and 5 Today, was another doozy of an exchange...and I am fearful for the kids  I don't know what my options are here... if any  My Ex was 53 min late to the exchange today. at 4:24 she sent me a text stating she was exiting the freeway That is 2 miles from the meeting spot arranged in Co-parenting for today. she doesn't show up until 4:53  Exchange goes ok. But I know something is coming, because if she is ever in the wrong she has to lash out and blame someone else or invent a scenario where she is the victim.  I had to wait all of 4 min.  I got a text stating ""I just drove by your car, and the back seat was empty. where are the kids?""  I said ""Wasn't my car. I have two kids"" then knowing where this was going sent a picture of them in the car.  Response: ""when did you have time to take this? because I had plenty of time to look at the stoplight. You were alone. It's ok if Donna (my current wife) has them. It's totally legal, just weird to hide it.  I then called her. She answered. I said. Hi, she said Hi, and then I asked the kids to say Hi. I then asked the kids ""where are we at kids?""....at this point She started saying ""hello, hello? is there anyone there?  I then got a text ""Thank you for the phone call. But there was no sound  I responded. ""I am turning off my phone now. these accusations are bizarre""  I got back: ""Not as bizarre as pretending to pick up our kids. Just tell me who has them""  I called again. Immediately with the ""hello? hello?"" I knew for sure it was a game at this point. I just ended the call  She responded ""You can't just keep ending conversations because you don't want to deal with the facts."" ""If this turns into another 49 hour abduction like New Year's, I will definitely filing a report"" (Read the last post on that [incident here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5lfqi6/legal_rights_surrounding_a_primary_custody_parent/)  This is next level insane. I am terrified for the kids. This is like raising to the level that she needs to be committed.  Thoughts apart from just continuing with the psych eval I already have going?"	Yes
"I'll try and keep this short. My 15 year old son spends a week with me, and a week with his mother. Neither of us pay any child support to the other, we split all medical expenses, and I get to choose where he attends school. We've had this agreement since May of 2007, with previous more fragmented times at each house and so on. His mother and I were actually getting divorced before he was born, so we've never really been in the same hour. We live less than a mile from each, and both have children from current marriages.   He doesn't have history of abuse at either house. His mother and I, while having a rocky past, have tried to co-parent the best we know how. Especially lately.   Our son has been displaying very angry moods, and outburst towards his siblings at both houses, but most notably here at my house. He told his younger brother the other day that ""he wasn't his real brother"" and so on (he's 11 years old), all over anger stemming from an xbox game. This type of behavior has gone on since about January, including outbursts towards his mother, saying he doesn't want to stay with her, then he does the same with me, throwing fits over his girlfriend...and so on. He told me other day his life would have been better had I just stayed out it.   So here we are, and I'm worried about how this plays out if he just tries to stay away for good because he isn't getting his way over here, and doesn't like the discipline and consequences he's now facing.   We now have him in counseling and we all go together when necessary, but I can't help but wondering if I'm being played.  There has been no material change of circumstance to change our custody agreement, other than his behavior, and it goes back and forth. I'm just the bad guy at the moment, and I'm worried about him trying to suggest this be a permanent solution, and having to fight for my custody all over again. If I'm being honest, I can't stand the thought of basically being  told ""I hate you, now pay my mom for the next 24 months."" He thinks he deserves a truck and all that...I won't get into that.   Like I said, we are seemingly working together (his mother and I), with the counseling and our communication....but he's still getting to do things over there at the moment because he's ""acting normal"" for her. Why would want to come face the consequences, right? I'm not bashing her or the way she runs her house, im just saying. And we've some conversations about this. It's just a little overwhelming.   How should I prepare myself?"	Yes
"(Florida) I had our parenting plan modified in court and there is a paragraph that my ex and her attorney claim is ""open to interpretation"" I think that it is crystal clear but I would like to get some opinions.  Do I have to meet her half way when she picks them up AND when she returns them home or only when she picks them up (initial exchange)  Here is the paragraph in question: ""The father shall assist with the travel only for the initial exchange and  the mother is responsible for returning the children home. The father shall meet the mother at [location] to do the once per month exchange; the mother is responsible for picking up and returning the children for the summer and holiday timeshare.  The mother did not file a petition to relocate so shall bear the brunt of the burden of continuing the long distance timeshare."""	Yes
I share a home in New York State with my significant other of six years. We have lived in our home for almost four years. We are not married so my SO bought the house and everything is in his name (mortgage, insurance, taxes, deed, and so on). He and I came up with an agreed upon figure that I would contribute every month towards the mortgage and expenses. The mortgage is about $1,600 every month and I contribute $700.   Because I am contributing to our home I'm starting to feel as though I should legally own part of the house. My biggest fear is that if my SO, heaven forbid, dies that I will have no legal right to our home.   Where should we start? Would it be better for my SO to leave me the house in a will?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
Hello, first time posting here.   I have a 5yo child whose father has never been in her life. He wasn't even there for the pregnancy because he never cared for the child, nor did I want him there because he honestly scares me.  A few months prior to her first birthday, I met a wonderful man who has since then raised her as his own. This man is now my husband as of 6 months ago, and he would love for my daughter to have his last name. However, I fear I would have to get into contact with her bio father for this, which I'm dead set against. Her last name on her birth certificate is my own as, like I said, he has not been present AT ALL since before her birth.   Do I need to contact him for this? Has he lost his rights? Advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
My stbxMIL is suing me, she already sued me for something else and won (mostly because it was considered a martial contract that was violated) but has since agreed to drop it in exchange for me relinquishing my half of ownership on the cars. This suit is for a bunch of stuff, most of it is money she gave to him for various things before we got married and the money never went through my hands. There was one thing that we were married for but there was no agreement attached to it like her first suit and a couple of other things that I probably won't be able to get out of. She is also pursuing almost $1,000 for emotional trauma. Earlier this year she kicked me out, pushed me to my limits and ended up calling the police and filing a protective order. I want to countersue for emotional damages but I'm not sure for how much and all of that. It is small claims. Any advice is much appreciated	Yes
I'm 17 and live in NJ  My mom wants to get me and my dad drug tested because of a custody battle and I smoke weed  What can happen to me if I fail this test?	Yes
Recently, my mom and my stepdad broke up, there were a lot of problems, but I want advice on a particular one.  My former stepsister(age 14) lured my nephew into her room, waited until he fell asleep, then took pictures of her making my nephew touch her inappropriately.  She then snapchatted a few of those photos to her friends.    Among the picture of her making my sleeping nephew touch her inappropriately, we also found nude photos of my nephew.  Her phone was taken away from her, but I'm not sure if she got it back since my mom and I left, and she may have deleted the pictures; BUT she has an iPhone which stores pictures in the cloud, so they may be in the cloud.  Is there any way my mom and I can go to the police and they can issue a search warrant to look through her iCloud photo's and/or past snapchats?	Yes
Hi, I'm hoping to change my legal name and I currently live in New York. For various reasons, I do not want to publish my name change in a newspaper (which NY requires).   Is it possible to change your name in a state you don't live in?   For example, the state I resided in for 15 years does not require a publication of name change, and I'd prefer to complete the name change there if possible. I haven't lived in this state for several years, though I visit often and have family there.   Thank you all for your time.	Yes
"I am currently a 15 year old female living in Nevada and I'm having some problems with my family. My parents have hit me occasionally (never hard enough to leave a mark) and my older brother is verbally abusive. These issues have lead me to self harm (I have stopped thanks to some wonderful friends on the internet) and I have also had a single suicide attempt. I have a friend that lives in California who is 23, who often says he would take me away if he could in a heartbeat. Is this possible? I don't know if my parents would agree either, since I have brought up the idea of letting me go during fights and they have said no. What are my options here? I do not know if I am capable of living on my own, but I also don't know how long I could live in that house before I'm driven to self harm again or even possibly another suicide attempt. Could I get my friend or his parents (if he isn't financially stable enough) to adopt me? Could I find a friend's parents to adopt me? Could an adult friend adopt me? Could I even marry said 23 year old? (I dunno I think I came across something about marriage while I was looking up emancipation laws) I'm even more at a loss because of the whole ""different states"" thing. Remember, I live in Nevada, but my closest friend lives in California. My other possible options live in Seattle."	Yes
I am a naturalized citizen and have been planning to change my first and last name for quite a long time. Unfortunately, I am currently going through a divorce in the state of Illinois.   Will the court reject my request for a name change if I am going through a divorce?	Yes
Im kind of in a bind and really need help with my forms. I live in Massachusetts but im filing for divorce in Rhode Island. The residency requirements there are that one spouse must have lived in the state for a year prior to filing, which my spouse has. However, the first line of the Complaint asks me to verify that ive lived in the state for that period. Do i leave it blank?   Also, we don't have children so do i need to file the forms regarding children with N/A or not file them at all.   My last question pertains to the financial form. I filled it out to the best of my knowledge but there is a part on the top for total liabilities but seeing as i didn't list any Im not sure whether to write N/A or leave it blank.   Im sorry to put this on you guys but im filing Monday and haven't been able to afford a lawyer so doing it myself has been tough. Any help would be awesome and Id be soo grateful.	Yes
"I received a summons for divorce and it has a part that states "" for an order awarding plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and cost of suit."" What does that mean and what does statutory amount of Child Support mean? Any help would be great. "	Yes
 This is a throwaway account to protect our identities as much as possible but this does take place in the state of California. So a few months ago, my twin sister was raped after our high school graduation party. She's not in a good state of mind right now and is extremely angry at me because I was actually their target. I don't blame her in the slightest because the group of boys said my name a few times during the ordeal.  My grandparents and parents are both extremely traditional people. They hold strong to their traditional Asian values of practically blind worship to the senior generation. My grandparents were extremely against the idea of abortion while my parents were on the fence but leaning towards my grandparents because of that respect towards the elder generation. Eventually, my grandfather found out that I was coordinating with my sister's best friend on how to get my sister to an abortion clinic. That night my grandfather kidnapped my sister and they were missing for almost a month before the police found them. My grandfather was trying to fly her to China.  During that month, we discovered the identities of the rapists and we also have the semen samples from the rape kit as further evidence. I got in a rather heated exchange with several of the perpetrators but now I'm being threatened with both my and my sister's integrity. They realize that we can easily ruin their lives forever and send them to jail which is why they are threatening to release a video of the entire rape to the student body of the university that we will be attending after the summer. The group of boys dragged me into a room and molested me while forcing me to watch the video. I was forced to give one of them oral sex in order to keep them quiet about the video. I tried to keep a semen sample but they took it away. They didn't penetrate me and my hymen is still intact so I don't have any evidence to prove this happened the way that it did. They did video me doing everything and I was forced to say it was consensual. I'm sad I had to do this but I want to help my sister however much I can even if it's just to shut this group of boys up so that event isn't revealed.  The entire incident has been kept very quiet because my parents insist that our momentary desire for vengeance is much less important than the stigma such an incident will cause if it becomes public. My sister hasn't said a single word and I'm very worried about her. She isn't mentally stable right now and while so far not suicidal, I am very worried. My grandfather has since returned but now after realizing that there is a high possibility of the father being black, he is insisting that she abort the baby. We just got back from the abortion clinic a few hours ago but they are refusing to help because my sister won't reply to anything that they say and that she isn't mentally sound.  I don't know what to do and don't know who to talk to. My family wants to keep everything quiet. My sister has not said a single thing. She did yell at me for a few minutes but quickly stopped talking. It's been over a month since I last heard her voice. I don't know what to do! I should be an adult right? I'm already 18 but I don't feel like an adult. This whole thing feels like a guillotine hanging over our necks.  How can I report those boys to the police without everything becoming public? They already said that if we take them down then they will take us down with them. One of them said he will help me if I have sex with him but I don't want to.  What should I do about my family? Right now they are against everything that I think should be done and my sister has not replied to anything that we ask.  I'm so angry! My grandfather kidnapped my sister causing everything to be delayed so long and now he has completely changed his point of view. First he was trying everything to prevent the abortion and now he is trying everything to force her into it. He even threatened me while holding a coat hanger because I pushed him away when he was trying to enter my sister's room. I also can't stop crying every time I hear my mom and dad regret having daughters.  The reason I'm posting here is because I was hoping a lawyer could give me advice on what to do. I feel really alone right now. The group of rapists is threatening me from the front while my family isn't doing anything to help from the back. My sister is completely silent and I'm worried about her committing suicide even though she hasn't shown any intent to.  Am I even in the right place? Can a lawyer even help me? I want to sue my family and get protective custody of my sister but can I even do this? My sister hasn't said a single word and has no response to anything that anyone asks. All she does is sit there. The only person who knows other than the related parties is my sister's best friend. Not even my best friend knows.  Please help me. I don't care if my video goes public. I only want to prevent my sister's video from becoming public. The problem is that we are identical twins so either video becoming public would be bad for my sister. I tried fighting back against the group of boys but they responded by posting a short clip of my sister's video to this website and everybody on that website is showing crazy enthusiasm for it. I tried to use that to my advantage but nobody on that website has an account only a bunch of numbers where their name should be. I've bookmarked the link to that website but I don't even want to look at it anymore because I cry every time I read the replies.  I don't even know if I can ask a lawyer to help me. My family obviously won't pay for it and I only have a few thousand dollars.I read online that there are lawyers who might do this for free but how do I find them?	Yes
My husband left for an overseas job when he found out that my daughter had AML. Because he has been overseas I couldn't serve him with divorce papers and taking care of my daughter took precedence over everything else. Sadly, things have taken a turn for the worst and now he's been blowing up my phone after four years of no contact, begging to come see her. I told him no and that I would do everything in my power to prevent him from seeing her if he tried to force a visit. Apparently he's planning to show up anyway but I don't know when.  I haven't decided whether or not I want him to see her. That's another thing I'm battling out with myself. What I want to know is if I have any right to legally stop him from seeing her if she doesn't want to see him. He hasn't contributed to her care much if at all, hasn't supported her emotionally, and if he hadn't been overseas, I would have divorced him by now. How can I best protect my daughter if she doesn't want to see him?	Yes
Long story but here is the short version. Just turned 17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings (13 year old twins)  and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.  He reached out to teachers for help so she made him drop extra curricular activities.    He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	Yes
My grandfather has dementia and my mom and him set up my mom to be his financial and medical POA. Located in Illinois.  It's been 4 years and my mom has slacked completely. She hasn't done his taxes, some bills have gone unpaid, and last but not least his debit card bounced because she didn't transfer money to it (really confused him and was a bad day).  I'm not sure my mom wants to give up this title but it's at a really bad point. It won't be an easy conversation but something needs to be done.  What are my best / worst case scenarios?  Thanks.	Yes
Michigan - I moved out of the marital home approximately 7 months ago. My wife still lives there. My legal address on my driver's license still has the marital home address, although I filed a change of address with the post office so I could get my mail. I am still paying part of the mortgage each month. We're in the process of divorcing, but it's taking a long time. Is there any reason I can't just move back into the marital home? We have no children.	Yes
"Hello legaladvice! I am a long time reader, but this is an obvious throwaway because my main account is easily connected to my real name.   I have a 10 year old. ""M"" They are diagnosed with things that make their life a little more difficult, including being on the spectrum.   M called me upset over the weekend to tell me that they had been ""kicked out"". I asked M to clarify, thinking it was a game. M explained that they were having a disagreement with their stepparent ""SP"" and the SP got frustrated and threw M's clothes all in a bag, and then outside the door. SP then told M to go outside as well. When questioned further, the other parent was in full support of this action. M was brought back inside, after being asked if they were ready to be a good person now. They proceeded with the rest of their evening and M called me per our usual schedule, and that is when they let me in on what was happening.   There is more to the story - but that is the gist of it. When M's therapist was informed, the therapist reported M's other household to Child Protective Services. From what I understand CPS took the report very seriously, and I should expect contact from them.   Onto the current issue. As I was tucking in M just now, they stated that they did not want to go back to the other home. They said ""I am scared to go back, I don't feel safe there, and I don't want to get kicked out again.""   Our legal custody agreement is that M goes to the other parent before art camp tomorrow. Then afterwards we are all go to the regularly scheduled therapy session.   I can't really contact his therapist for advice, or even call a lawyer because it is so late. Hand off is before things open in the morning as well - so there isn't anything I can do between now and then.   The only two options I have thought of is: a) to take M to the pediatrician when they open and let M go in alone to tell the doctor how they are feeling.  b) to take M to the courthouse with me in the AM, missing the hand off, and getting an emergency order from the DA.   I also thought of just heading to the police station now to see if I could ask an officer what to do, but then my spouse reminded me of this sub.   So... am I totally screwed? How can I protect my child?"	Yes
I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday.   So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably.   She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony.   Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers.   That sparked a heated argument.   Long story short;   *Sshe got in the car with her kids  * I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers   * She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety  * I stand in front of the car as I call the police  * She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way  * I jumped on the hood  * She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably   * She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me  * Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures    .................  This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed.   Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?  What charges can I have against her?  I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.	Yes
Background info: My mom is an alcoholic and has been for about 4 years. She got arrested about 3 years ago for a *dwi* and earlier this year she got a TIPS surgery because her liver is shit.  6 day's ago my mom picked me(16) up from the cinema and my sister(14) who was in the car along with my step-sister(15) and cousin (8) told me that my mom had bought some alcohol when she when nobody was watching her (this is like the 5th time she has relapsed since her surgery). I got in the car and she drove off, heading home. I called 911 and told the operator the situation and an officer pulled us over and arrested my mom. She stayed in jail for 24 hours after her parents bailed her out. Now, 4 days later, she is getting her license revoked for 5-10 years and going to jail for a year if she doesn't get a lawyer. What do we do?	Yes
I'm not 100% sure if this belongs here, but I have a friend with an abusive husband and I haven't heard from her in 3 weeks. The last text I sent mentioned a shelter for women and children who are victims of domestic abuse and I don't know if her husband saw it. I'm not sure if I should call the police for a wellness check? I feel like that might make the situation worse if he's home when they do it.  If a different sub would be a better fit for this question like /r/legaladviceofftopic , please let me know. I'm just looking for advice on whether police should be involved or if I should try to find another way to deal with this.  I have her address but I think she's moving in 2 days last I heard so I need to do something pretty soon here.  We're located in Washington state.	Yes
Earlier this year, my ex husband stole money from me ($600 to be exact). We were still going through the divorce when he took the money. We ended up going to mediation for the divorce, and the money he stole was put in the mediation papers. Those papers later went into the judgement of divorce. The divorce was finalized a month ago, so now he legally has to pay me back. The agreement in the papers was for him to pay me back within 90 days of the date of mediation, which was back in April. He is refusing to pay. What should I do? Should I go through small claims?	Yes
My boyfriend has a 6 year old son, we'll call him John. Bf has a very strained relationship with his ex (John's mom) and exes bf. Up until a year and a half ago, John lived with my boyfriend, ex got him every other weekend, and she paid child support. Bf's company shut down, lost job, and lost his apt.  Now John lives with the ex and her boyfriend with her other children. My bf for the last year has been in and out of apts, homeless for a few weeks at a time, and occasionally lives with his parents who are EXTREME hoarders (so not a legal or viable option for John to stay).  Now my bf has a steady job for last 3 months. Is making child support payments and sees John only sat and Sunday.  In the last few months my boyfriend also called CYS because ex's boyfriend put his hands around John's throat. He has proof and pictures. Took him to police station they took pictures, John told them is was ex's bf, CYS case worker said they couldn't label it as child abuse because there was no hospitalization and no lasting marks (the hand marks eventually faded after a few days)? So they didn't do anything and John had to be returned to his mom. This is not the first time the ex's boyfriend has placed hands on John but I believe this is the first time we have proof.   My bf also has reason to believe there may be some sexual abuse happening in that house as well. John was caught taking very obscene, inappropriate picture of his genitals, and taking videos. It could just be a sexual exploration thing but I can't remember doing that when I was 6?  My bf is trying to keep up with his child support payments, get an apartment (for him and John), and find a lawyer but it seems impossible when he's literally starting from scratch.  His payments for child support are less than $200 a month, most apartments require a credit check (he has shit credit) and first+last/security which he doesn't have, a lawyer is so out of the question financially.  My bf doesn't want to put John in foster care but we're at a point where we feel strangers could be safer then leaving him with his mom. We would have to do an emergency custody hearing which would cost him around $400 just to file. He also did this a couple years ago and this resulted in zero punishment the last time the ex's bf hurt John so it feels pointless.   He just feels so defeated with the whole situation. I can tell he's at a point where he would rather beat the shit out of his ex's boyfriend just to get rid of him, end up in jail, rather than his kid stay there another day and risk more abuse/injury. I can't really blame him. He's terrified the boyfriend is going to take things to far and seriously injure or do something worse to his son.  I'm not sure if this is the right place to post but he needs legal help. This situation has been escalating on a weekly basis. I can tell that my bf is feeling cornered, desperate and that his kids life is being threatened probably on a daily basis. Does anyone know of an organization that can help a parents with low income? We live around Philadelphia.  :TL;DR son is being abused. Need to get him out of mothers house. Very little access for funds or resources.	Yes
I'm hoping this will be coherent but my head is still kind of spinning so we'll see.   My brother(M21) and his fianc√©(F26) have twin boys (6 months). They are not married, they rent an apartment together. He is sole earner, she stays home with the kids. He is an alcoholic, he's textbook abusive (gas lighting, emotional abuse and two weeks ago he pushed her around enough to leave bruises) and it has come to light he's been cheating for who knows how long.   My SIL (for lack of a better term) is at a loss of what to do. She's at her mother's with the kids, but apparently there is nothing legally stopping my brother from forcefully taking the kids and going to NJ. SIL is concerned for the kids safety, my brother consistently drives drunk. She has photo evidence of the bruises he left, the cheating, the horrible things he says to her. But she doesn't have the money to retain a lawyer. And he has grandparents who are well off and have paid his way out of trouble for 21 years. He keeps threatening her that if she leaves, she'll never see the boys again and that his grandparents will pay for the best lawyer to destroy her.   Please help me find resources for her. What options does she have? Will she lose her kids to someone so toxic and harmful?	Yes
So, I slept with a friend of mine a while ago, and she hasn't talked to me since we broke up four months ago after dating for about a month - the day we broke up, she told me that she was pregnant - and long story short, it's starting to look like there's a good chance that I'll be a parent within the year.  I've met with a few family lawyers in the area, and thankfully, it sounds like there's a fairly good chance that I can swing joint legal custody when I'm sued for child support in the next six months to three years, as long as I don't make any major mistakes.  However, the friend that I hooked up with is still incredibly upset, and never wants to see me again - I spent the better part of three months trying to get in contact with her, but, it's no use - every time I try to talk to her, she tells me how foolish I was for leaving her.  That being said, if a joint legal custody agreement is reached, but we assume that she retains primary physical custody, can she arbitrarily move anywhere that she likes without my consent? That is, could she move hundreds of kilometres away to avoid me, and not be worried about things like parental child abduction?  Would my only recourse be to spend tens of thousands of dollars in court to get her to move back, or move closer to her?	Yes
Hello all. I am in Indianapolis, Indiana. My sister was recently arrested for a domestic dispute with her boyfriend. She has twin babies that are eight months old. Long story short, she has a long criminal history and the babies were placed in foster care by DCS. I have obtained kinship guardianship of both children and they are currently living with me.   The issue I am having is with my sister's father (we have different dads) and his wife. Let's call him Scott. Scott is a convicted child molestor. He is also an alcoholic who gets drunk and beats his wife. I was around 5 when he was married to my mom and I witnessed him to do the same to her. He would get drunk, they would argue, and he would beat the hell out of her. Some of the more extreme examples that I remember include him hitting her in the head with a 2x4 and her having to get stitches, busting a beer bottle across her face and breaking her nose, pouring boiling hot soup water on her, and repeatedly slamming her face against the counter making her eye so black that she wore an eye patch for weeks. Mostly what I remember though is waking up in the middle of the night to my mom screaming and crying and running to find her just to see him mounted on top of her punching her in the face repeatedly and seeing her face covered in blood. These experiences have had lasting trauma on me and my sisters as you can probably imagine.   Anyways, Scott and is wife are requesting to see the babies. I am obviously not allowing them to. However, I am worried that they are going to contact DCS and force me to.   It seems pretty obvious that DCS should be on my side and allow me to keep the children from him. However, they gave approval to my sister to allow her to live at his house with them! As I mentioned previously, she has a long criminal history and has had issues with DCS in the past. While under investigation by DCS, she moved into her dads house and brought the babies with her. DCS completed their investigation, which included an inspection of his house, and deemed it a SAFE environment for her to raise her children, despite his criminal past!   That is part of the reason I am worried that they are going to force me to let him see the babies. I have read the documentation I was given about kinship guardianship in Indiana, but it seems to only specify policies for visitation with the children's biological parents. I am wondering if I have any rights to block him from having visitation? Does he even have any right to see the children under kinship guardianship? If DCS does tell me to let him see them, will I get arrested if I refuse? I am unsure of my rights in this situation.	Yes
Bare minimum details, a family member is harassing my Son. The family member lives in another state (Washington or utah) we will call her gina There have been numerous texts and phone calls made to my son harassing him. Gina is tring to goade him into believing false and inflammatory information about my son's mother. It hasn't stopped. What can we do?	Yes
Here's the deal, I've got 50% physical custody of my kids. Initially she stated she wanted no child support, and the divorce decree was written as such, with the issue of child support reserved. Six months after that was final, she filed for child support and our court date is Wednesday. She insisted the children go to school near her, and instead of going to court, we had a mediator act as an arbitrator. The kids school is 25 miles from me, we both live in a suburban area, so it's quite far. Currently, for child care, I have my mother take the kids to school and get them home, and watch them while I work during the summer. I pay her $5/hr, and reimburse her for the tolls and $0.535 per mile per the IRS rules. Not wanting to be caught off guard if something were to happen to my mother, I used Care.com and described the hours and mileage required and I'm getting salaries back that are twice what I currently, actually pay.  Will the courts consider what actual market rate is for my necessary child care or do they typically only care about realized expenses?	Yes
"Maryland. I ride a motorcycle. last summer i took my son (was then 9) for a short ride while we went out geo-caching. his mom doesn't want him to ride the motorcycle. she threatened to take me to court so i agreed to not put him on the motorcycle until we further discussed it. I intentionally left it open because I wanted it to be a possibility in the future. My son has now expressed interest in riding the motorcycle and also a small dirt bike that I own that is suitable for a kid his age.  I have informed my ex that I intend to allow him to ride my motorcycle as a passenger and teach him how to ride this dirt bike next summer. He will be 11 going on 12 at that time.  Dollars to doughnuts I will get a letter from a lawyer saying I am not allowed and that she will take me to court if this happens.  If she does take me to court I am fairly certain I am well within my rights here to have him ride with me. I still have parental authority, and the only reason we dont have shared custody is because she moved to maryland and it is too far to have shared custody. most likely this will be filed in a maryland court, but the riding will all take place in quebec. he is legally allowed to ride with me in both (and everywhere actually) locations.  what kind of legal grounds do i have here? I know family court can be a grab bag of ""depends on the judge"" but I dont have any traffic tickets, and have been riding a motorcycle for over 20 years now. though this current license is about 4 years old."	Yes
Trying to make this short and sweet. My husband has two sons from a previous relationship (not marriage). The older one lives with us and the younger one lives with their mom. This was her choice. Before my husband and I got together she decided she no longer wanted the older boy to live with her, she gave no reason why. My husband told her that he wanted both but she would only give him the older boy.  She makes no effort to visit with the older boy. She'll call him and tell him how much she loves and misses him and promise that he can come spend the night at her house soon, which never happens. She just gets his hopes up then crushes him. I really want to adopt him, but I don't know how to do that. If his mom has to sign some sort of document, it won't happen. She cares about her image too much. She's always posting pictures of him on facebook (pictures that my husband and I take, she takes them from our profile) and saying how much she loves him. She just does it so her facebook friends will praise her on what a good mom she is. I really don't think she cares about him at all.   My husband and I regularly pick up the younger boy and he stays at our house for a few days. Whenever we go to pick up the younger boy, the mom gives the older boy a quick hug and maybe a cheap toy that breaks in an hour, and sends us on our way. Also, the younger boy is absolutely filthy every single time we pick him up. He stinks of urine and feces, and his skin and hair is always sticky. His teeth are yellow so I don't think she ever brushes them. (Side note, the older boy only has 7 teeth because she neglected to brush them and they all rotted out, and she always had him sleep with a bottle of formula). He has horrible manners, he hits and bites everyone. Her home is full of cats and dogs and the entire house just smells like urine. She lives with her boyfriend, her mom, and her two brothers. One of her brothers has cerebral palsy and no one takes care of him. He always stinks because no one bothers to change his diaper. They lock him in his room where he soils himself all day and they all ignore him. Once she called my husband in a panic because her boyfriend hit the child brutally, then later said it was nothing and he's fine and its none of my husband's business. She is still dating that same guy. My husband desperately wants to get him out of there but he doesn't know where to start, because she won't willingly give him up like she did her other son.   TL;DR: I want to adopt my older step-son but I don't know how. My husband and I want custody of my younger step-son but we don't know how we can because their mom won't willingly give him up like she did her older son.	Yes
I don't know if he ever changed his legal/ mailing address. I never evicted him or anything like that. He was free to come and go as he chose. I filed for divorce, he signed the papers and has since cut off contact with friends and family and stopped showing up for work. His current location is unknown.   He spent most of his time in the basement. I am trying to clean it. It was filled with empty beer cans, broken glass, tobacco, and piles of dirty clothes directly on the cement floor. I want to dispose of these clothes. Can I do that legally?  He has other items in my home (a home in my name, purchased before I was married. His name is not on the mortgage.) including a couch and many golf clubs.  I live in Connecticut, USA.	Yes
Hey, LegalAdvice!  I don't know if another sub is better suited for a post like this, so if there is let me know so I can fix it.  So, this inquiry is regarding a bit of family law. The 16-year-old in question is my girlfriend; I'm 17 at the moment. A little over a year ago, she finally got away from her home and parents back in California and was able to visit a friend here in Arizona. At the time it was just temporary. However, that ended up changing. She was crashing at her sister's house, but when the moment came both of them decided she'd be better off not leaving, and to no opposition by her parents (her legal guardians) she didn't.  For the record, the desire for her to stay was not unfounded. The long time she spent with her parents, she spent living in borderline unlivable conditions, jumping from hotel to hotel on credit alone. Her mother's mentally ill, her father's disabled, she was suicidal and surrounded by drugs and bad influences. The only things she has vocalised missing are her brother and 10+ animals. Come today, her mother got kicked out for stealing, and her father and brother got evicted. If going back before was somehow an option, it isn't anymore.  Ever since moving in with her sister and brother-in-law, she's done exceptional in school, stopped smoking cigarettes/doing any drugs, made friends she finally plans on keeping, is a much happier and optimistic person, and is looking for work to become more self-sufficient.  Of course, though; nothing is perfect. The sister is in her mid-twenties, but living with four biological children ages 2 to 10. Previously, sustaining everyone was easy because her sister and brother-in-law had decently paying jobs, and knew how to live affordably. However, just a few months ago the eldest daughter confided that her brother-in-law had been molesting her. He has been kicked out, an order of protection's been approved, and he appears to be gone for good. The case is still getting investigated, but it welcomed something my girlfriend was familiar with to her new home; CPS.  Now generally they almost have entirely un-involved her and me from everything, be it the case, the therapy, or any questions. But lately, her name has been popping up in the case workers mouths a disconcerting amount, specifically in regards to custody. Why she's living here, why she's not living with her guardian, why she doesn't have custody, etc. She has made it crystal clear that she does not want to go back, nor does she want to get fostered. Of the options available, she's only happy living on her own, with her sister, or with my parents and I.  Granting her sister legal custody has proven irksome since her disabled father and brother are currently reaping the benefits that come from her perceived care and social security, despite her not living with them. Which while fraudulent, would be hard for her to take away from her struggling family knowingly.  My question; What is the worst, if anything, that could end happen? And if it's bad enough, what options can we pursue to make sure they don't? (Minor emancipation, etc.)   Out of all of this, I want to know what I should expect, but especially want to be well informed. So if there's a place anyone thinks would have useful information, I'd love to have it. Thank you for reading!  **TL;DR**: 16-year-old GF living with her sister, can't go back home to her parents (legal guardians), CPS starting to make us anxious about her living situation	Yes
My friend has a 3 month old child. The father is someone whom she was in a relationship with, but they broke up before she found out she was pregnant. She didn't want his help so she didn't tell him, but a couple of months into her pregnancy he found out and begged her to let him be with them. She decided to give him a shot. He moved in with her a month before she gave birth to help out. He didn't help at all, actually the opposite. About 2 months in he hasn't fed the baby, changed a diaper, or got up once at night to help. She kicked him out a week ago after finding out he had been cheating on her. He made a huge scene and was refusing to leave. She had to call the cops to get him to go. He is now threatening her that he has a lawyer friend (this is true) and that if she doesn't see him every once and a while he will take her to court to get full custody. Does she have any outs in this situation, and what are the chances of him getting full custody if he does take her to court? She cannot afford a lawyer.	Yes
So my mom is in nursing home here in Los Angeles. I want to take her home with me, but my siblings want her to stay in the nursing home. If I were to take her home and she dies in my house, they said that they were going to sue me for everything that I own. Is that legally possible?	Yes
My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	Yes
[Iowa] She'll sometimes not let me leave the house and take my phone so I have no way to talk to my friends, lately I've just been using my 3ds to message them. If I just left the house could she call the police and make them take me back? She also won't let me ride in friends cars but I can't find anything that says it's illegal for me to do it without her consent even though she says it is.	Yes
I left my ex may of 2013. I ended up walking out of his house with 3 kids, pillows and blankets under my arm and a backpack full of clothes for all four of us. I stayed with my sister for a month. Found an apartment, started fresh after 11 years with the guy. Went to court a couple of months after I left. Judge said equal custody, 1 week on 1 week off. Did that for 2 1/2 yrs. Met my current husband. Married April 2015. More problems with ex. He got arrested for child endangerment, drugs, and battery. Went to jail for 9 months.  I got a lawyer have had him now for 3 1/2 yrs now and haven't stepped into a court room. Did mediation before he went to jail, came up with an agreement 1/2 custody. He got arrested, lawyer revoked the mediation agreement. Filed a petion on full custody. Ex got out of jail filed counter petion. I have court on the 15th order to show cause. My lawyer said we need to do another mediation before going to court. My lawyer also said we are back to square one with 1/2 custody. I am willing to share time with him every other weekend. Other than that the kids stay with me and my husband.  Dcfs has been called 3 times on him for different incidents.  They open then close. Why I am writing this is... how long does it usually take to get into a courtroom and get something like this resolved? What are my rights as a mother and where do legally stand? Do I have to let the kids go with him even though dcfs has been involved and currently there is a open case. Do I have to do mediation again? Any advice helps. Thank you.	Yes
I have court ordered supervised visitation with my daughter with mom being custodial parent.   My visitation is Saturdays, however, mom called visitation monitor Friday that we can't meet because she was home in South Carolina for a funeral. I received a call from the visitation monitor Saturday afternoon that mom and daughter had not yet left for South Carolina.   Can I request proof that she is going to a funeral or a validation of an airline ticket. Its just odd moms story has changed three times.	Yes
I'm a Canadian citizen studying in the UK. I'd like to come back to Canada (and more specifically to Quebec -- I don't know if this makes a legal difference) in a few years (2-4) with my girlfriend, who is a British citizen. I'm under the impression that we could both benefit the legal advantages of being married (which I'd be happy to know more about; I'm thinking visa, scholarships, etc.), but we don't have the money or time to organise a wedding (my girlfriend's parents live in Australia).  Q: Can we get married now (in secret) and get married once more (not religiously) when we arrive in Canada?	Yes
"My mom left my stepdad after months of complications and having problems from raising his intolerable kids for eight years.  The day after she left she went to pick up her stuff; they had hidden mostly all of it, such as her laptop, iPad, mini iPad, her work iPad, and all of her chargers.  To make matters petty, they even hid her coffee, which she needs for her strenuous job.    She said she'd be back to pick up my great grandmothers china and china cabinet, and, quoting my stepdad, ""You'll get what I tell you you can get.""  My mom works hard; she raised three out of five of his kids, who did nothing but disrespect her the entire time; and when she got sick of it, she left, and now he's basically stealing from her by not letting her get priceless family heirlooms.  Any advice on what we can do about this?"	Yes
My parents are only concerned with establishing paternity before I go off to college, but I'm trying to consider the legal/financial side of things as well. For someone clueless about how this process works, is getting ahead of this thing as sound a decision as it seems? Child support is kind of a boogeyman, especially in Texas, and I don't want to jump out of a pan and into a fire so to speak.	Yes
So we are both early middle age, and overall I see this as great news since I can afford it, and probably wont have kids another way.  She has a lot of family help available and both of us have family roots keeping us in the area.  We want to coparent.  Mostly, my question is: am I foregoing any rights by not  lawyering up at the moment?  So far, it has been amicable and I would like to keep it that way.  What should I consider in terms of legal options?	Yes
The guy thinks he's the father of the an infant (3 weeks old) but the mother says he's not.  Can the guy or the court compel the mother to allow a DNA test?  **Thanks**.	Yes
"Im 13 and live in missouri. My mother has hit and threatened to ""pound my a** into the ground"" and one day it got so bad i had to grab my knife because i feared she would attack me where my life could be at risk. Because of these things, i was extremely suicidal for a time, and tried to kill myself twice. But then today, she had scissors because she said she would cut the cords to my tv and xbox. This was because she lost her keys to the fridge (they keep a big metal lock on the fridge). She always does this, yelling at me saying i took something, then 2 minutes later ill see her pick it up off the counter. She always tries to find some excuse to yell and argue and fight. In the morning, its never ""good morning, son"" or ""how are you son"" its ""son get your a** in here and get me something to drink"" (im saying son here in place of my name, i wasnt comfortable putting my real name publicly). Anyway, she had the scissors, and as i went to unplug my tv and xbox and throw the cords away from her (so she wouldnt electricute herself trying to cut them), she sliced down with the scissors, and cut my hand, badly. It was about half a cm deep, probably needed stitches, and she said ""if you give me my keys, i might do somethin about your finger"". So shes literally neglecting my need for medical attention because of a stupid f****** key. I want to file child abuse against her, but i dont want her to go to prison. She has a metal rod from her hip to ankle so her leg doesnt bend, and i can see her making it in prison. I just want to either live with just my dad (but he and my mom are still married. He just stays out of these things because he doesnt want to be yelled at), or have my mom lost custody temporarily so we can try to fix all this and have a normal family. Please help with this if possible. Thank you"	Yes
I about to start process of trying to get custody of my child. I've never had a lawyer before, but I always hear they're expensive. My job has a work life program that connects you with a lawyer, gives you a free 60 minute first meeting, and then gives you 25% off their normal rate if you choose to hire them.  I've talked to a few lawyers through this program and their rates all hit around the $210-$225 range after the discount. They all request retainers.  There is one big difference between two of the lawyers. I asked them how much of a retainer will I need to get me to the point just before a court hearing... One lawyer told me $1000 and the other told me $2000.  Is $2000 too much? ...or is that common? I do understand that this can be a lengthy process and that once reaching court, it can get pretty expensive. I just want to make sure this is a fair rate.  I was originally working with the $1000 lawyer, until their communication got spotty and he didn't reply to my email. This lead me to the $2000 lawyer, who I've met with twice and seems a bit more invested in my case.  The $2000 lawyer had a few super minor qualities that raised my eye brow. We met half way a little after hours between my job and his office at a McDonald's. He was dressed in a t-shirt with a hole in it and jeans. He also took a call during our meeting. Maybe I'm reading too much into these things.   Any advice?	Yes
Both of my biological parents are deceased and I'm looking to find out more information about my biological father.  None of my relatives knew much about him so I can't really ask them anything.   I was able to find out that my parents were divorced in 1980 in Nevada (when I was a baby).  Through online searches I've found out which court, date, and certificate number of the divorce decree.   I'd like to find out the date of birth of my biological father and any other information about him.  Would the divorce record contain much information about the defendant or the spouse?  At the very least I assume his D.O.B. would be available?	Yes
I FINALLY got my divorce papers in!!! It only took 4 years üòÜ  Now I want to be rid of this horrible daily reminder and change it to something new. I don't want my maiden name back either - was just going to drop last name entirely (first &amp; middle)  How difficult is it in the US to change my last name and about how much should I expect to pay to do it?	Yes
For several years I had a relationship with an abusive man. He never hit me but he threw things at me and was verbally abusive. I always wondered if he would graduate to hitting me. I found out he was recently arrested for domestic violence. I have no proof of his behavior because I deleted everything, however, I want to let the prosecutor know that this was not an isolated incident as he is probably saying.   Is there any benefit to me contacting the prosecution when I have nothing to prove what I am saying is true?	Yes
My mom has schizophrenia. Her brother is the trustee of a large inheritance given to her by her Dad. This inheritance is her main source of income. He's also the executor of my Dad's estate who just recently passed away.   My uncle wants to sell her house and put her in a assisted living home. She's only 60. She wants to stay in her home, where we she is currently being taken care of by a caregiver.   He's not providing her any sort of autonomy or transparency about the decisions he's making. He also refuses to allow me to have any  knowledge of how much she has and how its being invested. I know she has (800k+).  Right now I'm trying to figure out where her rights start and his end. And also if it would be worth applying for guardianship, I'm only 25 and not exactly that established yet. Would applying for her guardianship allow me to hold him accountable for decisions?  I just hate the idea that he's making these life decisions she doesn't agree with. He's doing this under the guise of it being in her best interest, but if that were the case he would allow her to be apart of that decision and would be sensitive to the fact that her husband just died four months ago. He wants the sell the house she's lived in for over 17 years and put her there within the next few months. From my understanding he wants to do this to lessen his responsibilities of taking care of her.   I'm also concerned about him making decisions about the kind of medical care she receives. She has the mental capacity I believe to make her own medical decisions. With other family members in the past, he has prioritized money over care, and I would hate to see him do the same thing with my Mom.   Does anyone have any idea about how to approach this? I don't where to start or how I go about any of this. Am I asking the right questions?	Yes
"GF and I broke up. I confronted her about her affairs and told her I would report her [unrelated] illegal activity. She got an order of protection. She went out of her way to tell me in an email that her police report included that I ""shattered a light switch.""  I have a family court hearing coming up. This is what I plan to include in the memo. (I know you'll tell me to talk to a lawyer but I can't afford one and none of the free legal centers answered their phones today. And the public defender doesn't see my case until the day of.)   &gt;The evening of July 2 I confronted X about her affair while we were in the bedroom. I moved out of the bedroom into the living room. As I was passing through the doorway, walking away from X, I open-palm slapped the wall, and then sat down on the couch. The bottom edge of my right hand hit the top left corner of the light switch and broke the top left corner of the light switch. This left a superficial scar on the bottom edge of my hand. The top edge of the light switch is about two inches below my elbow. I didn't raise my hands and I didn't throw a punch."	Yes
"The bio father has never been involved except with court ordered child support that started a year and a half after birth. I've been with my husband for 2 yrs, married for one yr. My toddler chose to call my husband daddy while he was still my bf. My husband loves my child as his own. We decided we didn't want her to be adopted due to her deserving the child support she currently receives. It was mostly my decision and him agreeing. He would adopt her in a heart beat otherwise. I have set up her child support in a direct deposit savings so she can use it when she's all grown up.   Now that my husband and I are fully settled in and thinking of the future, we want to change her last name so that we can all be one family unit. She is starting to learn how to spell her name but have difficulty with explaining the last name situation. Soon she will have siblings and they will all have my new last name. I don't want her to feel left out later on and personally it sucks for us when we sign her up for anything with her different last name. Maybe it's selfish on my part for wanting us all to have the same last name, but my own experience growing up with step parents I always felt like a step child and not a real family member. The odd one out. I don't want that for my child. I wish I could have had her with my husband but life is shitty like that.   I know in order to change her last name I need to fill out a petition for name change and technically I can avoid asking the bio fathers permission and just rely on the judge to decide if it's in the child's best interest.  After a brief google search, the term ""back door adoption"" came up. Would our situation be considered as such? I didn't think about it that way and hope that it wouldn't affect her ability to receive child support.   We are a military family, so I don't know how that would affect things legally. We are no longer in the original state  of California. We moved to Louisiana.   So my other question would be, will changing my child's last name to my married last name cancel out her right to receive child support from her absent father? I don't want her to lose that."	Yes
Original post:  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6onosd/ga_can_my_stepdad_get_custody_of_me_in_a_divorce/  So, my mother was able to turn my stepdad against me and I'm being constanty threatened to be sent to Realdads house. He's a meth addict with no electricity so if they do I guess I'll run away to a LGBT homeless shelter. Not sure what options I have anymore so I'm kind of defeated. I appreciate all your kind words and advice on my previous post :)	Yes
Hey everybody My fianc√©e has the greatest kid on the planet and i want to know what I gotta do to adopt her in the state of Georgia. I have read that the dad would need to sign a form relinquishing him of any custody. My issue is that he hasn't been present for a long time. He doesn't hold down jobs or pay child support. He is violent and has been arrested for it more than once.he has also had to stay in psychiatric hospitals more than once. When my fianc√©es daughter was younger, he abused and neglected her and when my fianc√©e found out, she left him. She didn't press any charges or anything like that unfortunately, but what I'm wondering is, if we could prove as much as we could,would we have enough to go on to bypass getting his signature? I wish I could write all this out better. I'm sorry. Thank you so much in advance for your input.	Yes
I'm a 14 year old girl in Mississippi. My parents have been divorced all my life and family for a long time have had a good friendly relationship. The custody agreement was that I would stay with my mom on weekdays, and I would stay at my dads on weekends, but it has always been very, very loose. The past year or so my mother has become more and more touchy, and she yells at me quite often. She gets mad over the tiniest things and starts yelling, and then I start crying, and then she'll yell at me for crying, and then I cry harder, and then it kinda keeps going from there. Usually after that I go hide in my room and cry for at least another hour thinking about how much I hate her and stuff like that. My father is literally the perfect parent. He actually has a job(Mom doesn't), gets stuff done(Mom doesn't), is actually responsible, gets me to school on time, volunteers for all of my band stuff, etc.  and most importantly he never ever yells. Not once in my life have I been yelled at. I practically idolize him and I respect him, whereas I lost respect for my mother a long time ago. About a year ago, I was practically suicidal because of her yelling at me. For the past year, but especially this last week, I've been thinking about going over to dad's and simply telling him that I'm not going back. Today for the first time I actually said something when my dad told me to pack up, and he really does want to help in any way he can. What would happen if I refused to go over to my moms? With the fact that she has yelled at me this much, is a pretty bad parent in general, and that I'm an older kid who has a clear opinion, would there be any chance of changing custody to primarily if not completely my father? Are there any other paths we could take? Can someone help me please?	Yes
Hi there, this is really sad and scary, but I think we've reached a point where we would no longer be helping our kids or ourselves to continue living together, and our goal will need to be divorce for everyone's happiness. That said, before I talk to my wife about this and we formalize a plan, I am looking for some advice about things I need to pay attention to to ensure equitable treatment around custody and financial wellbeing should things ever get to a contested divorce or otherwise acrimonious.  Children: My wife and I have child together (2) and a stepchild (7) (she is bio mom). We are on good terms with the father and he sees his child on weekend days.   Finances: We have separate accounts. My wife holds over $30K in debt on various cards and student loans. I have a few thousand debt on a line of credit. My name is on all the house papers and mortgage etc., hers was left off at time of purchase because we couldn't qualify for the mortgage with her debt. I can't see either one of us being able to hold onto the house if we divorce, we will need to sell it.  My fears are specific--that my wife will go on an out of control spending/gambling spree (she has a historic gambling problem) during a year of separation. She gets bitter and grudgey and this clouds her thinking when she is angry. Or, that my wife will play some unbeknownst to me card that allows her full custody of our child.   Any advice about steps to take before, during, or after discussions of separation would be appreciated.	Yes
"My child support payments are going through a review and I was wondering if anyone would know how the net resources are calculated. I've already searched online and found numerous ""calculators"" but they don't explain what percentages are deducted as far as federal and state taxes. Is this a simple math question or is there more to it?  For example, if a person makes $50,000/yr and the state needed to find out net monthly income, what would it be? I live in VA so state taxes are 5.75% and according to TX federal tax rate is whatever it would be if a person filing as single with one dependent plus the standard deduction would be.   I just don't want to sign anything and not know what I'm looking at, then regret it.   Thanks for any help and I apologize if this isn't the right sub."	Yes
New account for privacy.  Some background: I am 17 years old. My mother is a narcissist who thinks the world revolves around her. She and my Stepdad have been together for ~14 years and have a son that age. They've been married about 7 years.  It's clear they've only stayed together for financial reasons and for the three children. My Stepdad loves me and my sister like his own, despite him not being our biological dad. He takes care of us financially by himself and has built a beautiful life for us. Over my lifetime we've gone from poverty to upper-middle class solely because of him.  My mother, on the other hand, has never worked a day in the past 16 years. She spends child support checks from my Realdad on weed, alcohol, and things for herself. (Clothes, takeout, etc.)  About a year and a half ago, Mom was arrested for domestic battery and obstucting a person trying to make a 911 call. I made the call after she attacked me and Stepdad after taking unprescribed oxycodone and mixing it with a LOT of vodka. She was in jail for about 2 days before stepdad bailed her out. We made her stay in a hotel for a week before she swore to change. We dropped the charges. ...and....she didn't change. She's always been emotionally abusive but it started to get worse. My sister, 17 at the time, just had a baby. He was ~5 months at the time. Moms bullshit caused her to move out Feb. 2017 with her fianc√©. This caused Mom to be okay for a while, as she blamed Sister for all of our problems. Recently it's been bad again. It's clear she's on pills again as we know how she acts on them. (more background: She was arrested for prescription fraud about 7 years ago) NOW: Last night Mom and Stepdad got into a big fight. Stepdad had one drink with Bossman before coming home, and Mom freaks and calls him a drunk. This angers Stepdad so he tries to go to bed. Mom decides to go fuck with him and turn on the lights and slam the door to their bedroom. Stepdad breaks the lights out of anger. Mom keeps antagonizing him. Stepdad decides it is in his best interests to leave. I have video of Mom pushing Stepdad out the door. But Mom took all of Stepdads keys, including his work keys issued by his company to his work truck. She claims he's intoxicated and won't let him leave. She finally gives him his keys but won't let me leave with him because Stepdad isn't my legal guardian and claims he has no rights over me.  Stepdad is done. He's filing for divorce but we're scared of what is going to happen with me. I refuse to live with Mom but we don't know if Stepdad can get custody. My Realdad is a homeless druggie, all my grandparents are either blind or deaf, and I refuse to live with any of Moms family.  What are the chances Stepdad will get custody? What are my rights? All 3 kids agrees we would testify under oath that we fucking hate her. Is there anything we can do to give us a better chance? Stepdad is willing to give Mom alimony and half of what we own with no argument. He just wants me and my brother under his custody.   Tl;dr: Stepdad and crazy narcissist Mom getting divorced, trying to be in his custody despite no biological relation.	Yes
I am living in a house with my half sibling (we can call Richard) we have been living together for 3 years. Currently working on getting Richard evicted but that is another story. My main concern is I don't want retaliation against me living in the same house with Richard when then notice of eviction comes around. Since I have lived here Richard has threatened to hit me once. Broke the cable on the outside of the house that give us internet twice. Told me to move my stuff out of my room by Saturday of last week or that Richard would move it himself. Threatened to kick me out twice. Yelled at me to stop talking to our grandmother. He has decided to repeatedly pull the power for my internet modem (I alone pay for.) And has now slid open house flyers under my door. (I assume he wants me to move.) I am having a lot of anxiety because Richard has been known to have anger issues. I also know he owns a firearm and I really am afraid of what would happen when the eviction notice comes around because he will take it out on me. Do I have to wait for something more to happen, what can I do?	Yes
TL;DR: my father is mentally ill, his wife tried to kill him and has beaten him up in front of his doctors. Can I sue her?  I posted some time ago an AmA regarding my father's abusive relationship.  The situation has been getting steadily worse and worse until he has (finally) been hospitalized in the psychiatry department to treat his sever anxiety. Over the past month he has been staying in a psychiatry facility to continue with his therapy.  Last friday, his wife was there. His wife is extremely abusive and violent. She has already beat him up in the past, and has always been psychologically abusive. On friday she became furious over a discussion they had with the doctors. She took my father out of the facility for the afternoon (a temporary leave with the doctors' approval), and once they were out of the facility she tried to steer the car off the road. The car was damaged but luckily nothing happened to him. Once they were back in the parking lot, she started screaming and beating him.  He is mentally ill and completely unable to break out of the abuse. He will not press charges nor try to avoid her (in fact, he hoped he would be discharged soon to go back home with her).  What can I do? Can I sue her for attempted murder over the car incident? The doctors are on our side, and just yesterday the MRI results came in indicating that his brain is starting to get compromised because of the illness: can I get the court to declare him unable?  Thanks.	Yes
Backstory,  we've been married 14 years.  We/He just bought our first house in another state.  We are moving with the intention of getting divorced in the next year. He agreed to move to my home town but said if he decides to purchase and not rent, he wants  me to not fight him for the house in the divorce.  I haven't worked significantly in the last several years to care for our daughter.   Will this document he wants me to sign hold up in court? I have no access to any money to hire legal help I'm not sure if I should sign.	Yes
We live in Southern California, USA.  Firstly, I know, I know, talk to a lawyer, and I‚Äôve sent an email to a family lawyer, I just want to make sure we tap into every available resource before moving forward.   What happened:  My Mother-in-law and father-in-law have had a very dysfunctional relationship. Father-in-law slept on a mattress in the living room for almost a decade, both estranged, living under one roof, until we finally convinced him to sell the house that my wife grew up in (house was originally under MIL, but had it transferred to his name because of a bankruptcy, or so I‚Äôm told.)  From the 6 years I‚Äôve known my wife, I‚Äôve seen how he is; Huge egotistical, narcissistic, bully who has verbally and physically abused my wife in her teens, and my mother-in-law, so of course he‚Äôs having a huge ego/power trip now that he supposedly netted over $200,000 from the house (he‚Äôs not telling us exactly how much).   He says the check is ready and wants to give half of my MIL‚Äôs money now and half after she signs the divorce papers. They both want a divorce lawyer, so it seems like a really dumb excuse. My cynical side/bullshit meter is telling me that he‚Äôs holding onto the money as a power move and that he won‚Äôt give her the rest of the money when she signs the divorce paper work(he confided in my wife his intentions, instructing her not to tell my MIL, which of course we did). My MIL told me that he‚Äôs been pressuring her to have sex with him for the money, going as far as cornering her and tormenting/sexually harassing her.  Disgusting shit.   I also suspect that he‚Äôs ready to run to Mexico, since he‚Äôs Mexican, has been visiting Tijuana, and has been talking about purchasing a house down there for $35,000.   I‚Äôm sending this to a family lawyer, and have instructed my MIL to record any conversations between them if they talk. Besides that, I‚Äôm at a total loss for words or what to do, all I know is that I hate seeing my wife and my MIL suffer from such a monster. My MIL and FIL are going to the bank tomorrow so that he can ‚Äògive her her money‚Äô, again, my cynical side is telling me that he‚Äôs gonna shortchange my MIL and keep more than his fair share, or just give her half now and half possilbly never.    I just want to be prepared to act to any possible scenarios.   TL:DR FIL is holding money gained from them selling their family home hostage, and tormenting/sexually harassing my MIL, and I‚Äôm trying to be prepared for worst case scenarios.   Thanks in advance for reading this and for your help.	Yes
Hi there!  I'm looking for anyone who may have gone through a similar situation to what I'm about to go through and can tell me what my options might end up being.  Here's what I have now: A husband who at best doesn't care about me and at worst is emotionally and verbally abusive to me. A young daughter who relies on me for everything, and who my husband and I both love dearly. A job lined up 2000 miles away in AZ (my home state). Two amazing friends who are willing to help me get from here (GA) to AZ and get me set up there.  My biggest issue now is that if I make the move and take the job, I'll have to leave my daughter behind.  I won't be able to immediately afford to take care of her, and I know long-distance divorces and custody battles can be particularly nasty.  What I'm worried about is that it will look like I abandoned her- otherwise, I can almost guarantee I'd get custody.  I've been wanting to get away from my husband for a long time- my anxiety and depression have run rampant here with him, and I'm at the end of my rope.  I have no family here I can go live with, they're all either just as toxic as my husband or in no position to be taking me in.  I haven't left previously because moving takes money, which requires a job, and this job is the first I'll ever have, if I take it.  My options here are to stay and be miserable until I can manage to get a job that will support myself and my daughter, or I can go, be happier with my life, but leave my daughter behind.  Any perspectives on the legal aspect of all this?	Yes
[Virginia, USA] Throwaway.  I do architectural surveys and while I was on one, I saw what I think is evidence of child neglect.  Ant infestations everywhere, the child's feces in the trash can (like they were using it as the toilet. not cleaning up an accident), trash on the floor throughout the home (that they rapidly tried to clean up while I was there), stains, and otherwise disarray.  Obviously I want to help the kid.  But I'm I concerned about being there because I was on the job.  I know I'm not a mandatory reporter by Virginia's standards, but if I do report I can remain anonymous with the reporter (and that I'm protected on the report even if I do give them my name and information unless the court wants me to testify).  But I'm concerned the mother will know it's me (since I don't know how many other strangers came into the home) and try to get me/my company in trouble.  My boss is not particularly understanding.  It's a small family business, and I'm debating even telling him about it if I do report.  I believe I am protected from retaliation for this, but I'm not sure how far it goes.  What is my best course of action to legally protect myself while also reporting this to CPS?	Yes
"Hi all,   This is my throwaway because obviously. This all happened in NYC.  My ex and I had a tumultuous relationship, we separated in May of 2015 after a year of marriage, a full no-contest divorce followed in early 2016.   We had a huge wedding (100% her choice/decision, I wanted something smaller and much less grand). Neither of us were making much money at the time, and she had received a large inheritance from her grandmother previously which she used to pay for the wedding.   When we separated and ultimately divorced we stayed friendly-ish, but she always carried a resentment over the money she spent on the wedding. I told her (though never in a documented format) that should I ever be in a very comfortable financial situation I would be happy to repay her a portion of the wedding fund.   A little current add on, I am technically homeless, make very little money, and although I have prospects on the horizon by no means could you call my situation comfortable, something closer to strained.   She emailed me recently about a ""financial situation"" she wanted to discuss with me, after some pressing she explained that she was threatening legal action to recoup half of the cost of our wedding as well as interest starting from our separation in 2015.   I'm sure the main advice would be to get a lawyer, which is rough as I literally have little to no money. My main curiosity is, is it even possible for her to sue me for that, especially since that's something she would have had to have handled during the divorce, and without any documentation of me stating explicitly ""I will pay you such and such"" does this threat have any real validity? My main assumption is that she's hurting for cash and knowing my situation thinks if she threatens legal action she will be able to squeeze a few pennies from my well.   Thank you all in advance for any advice you can offer."	Yes
"My son was born in July 2013, the mother and i split up after a year due to me putting my kid first and her putting herself first. We both lived in a small south eastern town so driving a few blocks to exchange him wasn't all that hard.   At first we had an ""every other day"" he stays with you, then me, then you ectect. That worked out fine for us, but was a hassle for him i would assume. Constant change of environment and what not. Then when the time came for preschool, it was ""he stays with you tuesday and thursday and me every other day of the week, then we flip flip days the next week (2 days/5 days alternating). We happily made that work.   now a short bio about her and myself. I'm a registered pharmacy tech working at the same pharmacy for the past 5 years, same community he's grown up in all his (and my) life. My mother owned a daycare so it was exceptionally nice for him to be around familiarity every day. I've never smoked and the only drink i have is once a year when the New Orleans Saints lose a playoff game. Went from the breakup to living with my mother for about a year with my son, to renting my own house for the past 3 years.   His mother on the other hand... She has been in and out of jobs for years now, due to failed drug tests or just plain getting let go, currently working a food chain. (rib crib for a month or 2 i believe) In and out of homes between her mothers, sisters, whatever current boyfriend of the month she has. Current home residence is with a sister who still lives in the same county as myself. About 60% of HER days to have my son, i end up having him because shes out partying, ""too busy"", forgets to pick him up from my house, ectect. The other times on her days she just pawns him off on some friend or family member so she can go out. (she likes to post on many social media platforms when she goes to bars and such)  Today out of the blue she hits me with, ""i'm seeking legal action, i want our son on weekdays and you can have him on weekends. He will be going to school 30 minutes away (insert town) [from his home, school, and friends] due to it being easier for me to see him. i want child support. get an attorney.""  phew..  i'm curious as to how all this will play out. what you guys' think. Should i have any concern? Besides getting an attorney, what other steps i should take? If the judge asked me what custody arrangements i would prefer, id tell him 7 days a week with me, every other weekend with her, that way i'd only have to worry a few days every 2 weeks if he was being taken care of or not. (trust me, he comes to my house not bathed, always hungry, sometimes not even clothed..just wrapped in a blanket, always has some form of new cut/bruise/gash somewhere on him)  All i want is what's best for my son, to be happy with his friends and family all here in his hometown. To follow in his fathers footsteps and make all-state striker in soccer one day. To live a happy and fulfilled life with the person who cares about him most and has been there for him every day of his life.  Not to mention kindergarten enrollment (same school he was at for preschool) is also next week, should i go ahead and enroll him?"	Yes
My lawyer has only given very general advice. I want to know specific advice and examples from individuals who have gone through these. 	Yes
Wife and I are splitting up and filing for a dissolution. However, the process seems kind of complicated. We have already worked out all division of property and assets (we are 25 and 23, so there isn't a whole lot). How do we file from here? Is it worth using an online service to fill out the paperwork?  Also, residency might complicate things. I'm keeping my permanent address in Ohio, but I'm going out to college in Utah for the next year. Should I get residency in Utah or keep my Ohio license and permanent address? We've been living with her parents and that's the address on my license.   Sorry if this isn't super coherently written, but any follow-up questions are welcome.	Yes
My friend's parents are finally getting a divorce. The wife has been abusive of her husband/her kids for a long time, and the husband is finally going to file. However, my friend just told me that they're going to be settling in court since the wife refuses to agree to terms.   Most importantly, she wants her soon to be ex-husband to keep paying her money so she can continue to live in her house (the husband will move out once the divorce is final). My friend is concerned that she'll get the money because she'll claim that she was abused by her husband. My question is, is she legally allowed to do this, considering her children are over 18? (My friend still lives with her mother.) Regardless of the legality, is the judge likely to award her money? I want to reassure my friend/offer her courses of action she can take, but I have practically no knowledge of law.	Yes
A friend is married in both Brazil and California. She got married here then registered it in Brazil. Now her ex is paying for the divorce in Brazil- does she have to pay again to get divorced here? Or will California recognize a divorce that is completed in Brazil then Officially translated? Divorce in Brazil was only $200, in California over $700.	Yes
Child support in Washington state. I was paying support for 2 kids. The temporary order was just that temporary it had no foresight into my oldest aging out or graduating high school. My soon to be ex wife tried to change support in April due to my new job and wanted more money. The judge opted not to change anything then because I was supposed to have trial in July. The trial didn't happened solely because she failed to give her discoveries in time to review them. Two boxes of accounts on Friday after 2pm and trial scheduled for Tuesday morning. I went thru the paper work that weekend and found their was 7 additional accounts listed in the transactions of deposits and withdraws. It is believed that she is hiding money in these accounts. It's been now 60 days since the formal request and two weeks since the request for additional accounts and my trial rescheduled to November. I have read that in most cases when paying support for more than 1 child if the order doesn't specify it is understood that you stop paying support for child if they age out and only request to change the temporary order to prevent confusion. 	Yes
"Today I was told by one of my other siblings that my sibling (let's call him Joe *alternate name used for privacy purposes*) who is less than 7 years old tried to kill himself. Twice. My mother withheld this information from me and the rest of my siblings who are not living in the house because ""it is none of our business"".  My mother has a documented history of physical child abuse, and has mentally and emotionally abused my siblings and me for most of our lives. She has BPD, but any time she meets with a therapist she fires them because she refuses to accept that she is the problem. I don't think she or my stepfather are physically abusing him, but I definitely know they are mentally/emotionally abusing him. I'm trying to get more information about what happened, but I think my mother is freezing me out.  There are three other siblings in the house with him, two of which are 6 months old babies. I know the babies are okay because they're little and cute and that's how my mother prefers kids. I don't know how the other sibling is doing, and I suspect he's getting the same treatment as ""Joe"".  I am a junior in college at the moment, living with my boyfriend of 3 years. We share a car, but my income is primarily based off of a financial aid refund (but I'm more than willing to get a job). He earns about $40k a year. We live about 2.5 hours away from my siblings. I don't know what to do, but I know they aren't safe. They may not be in any immediate danger, but I know that something is wrong in that house.  I don't want them to go into foster care. If they're going to be anywhere, I want them with me. I know this is going to keep happening. Where do I start? What do I do?"	Yes
"I'll try to keep this short since as probably all marriage endings go, this is complicated.   My wife and i (of three years, together 9) have had problems for a while but I thought things were getting better. End of June we had a fight and she left to stay with her family in TN for ""space."" We talked every day and things were getting better. The 30th of July she came home. I thought things were good. Long story short she said she needed more time. She left August 2nd. I tried to talk and message but she was kind of distant. August 5th she told me there  was someone else. Cue start of drama.  Since then, I've tried to reconcile, now on to divorce. Now I just want this to be over as quickly as possible. There are no assets. We lived together in my mom's house at the time, so no house. No kids together. The only thing we shared was a car loan. She has the car in TN. The car is upside down on the loan so no value. All our credit cards are individual. We have health insurance under ACA but I'm paying the bill.   I packed her belongings and asked what she wanted of our shared things from a previous apartment. She said nothing except one of our TV's which is fine by me. She wants to trade the car in but its upside down and I'm the primary on the loan. Anything that happens with the car has to happen here and she and it are still in TN.  I tried to get some info for the lawyer, she stopped responding to texts the night before last. I texted her this morning and now she wont speak to me directly. Her new ""boyfriend"" responded in her place saying now they are hiring a lawyer as well and to not try to contact her again.   I thought I could get her to sign an Appearance, Entry, and Waiver so we could move this along fast and each be on with our lives. I have no idea what they expect to gain from making this more complicated. Like I said, there are no assets and we haven't been married long enough to warrant her really getting anything from me, besides the fact I don't really have anything to give her. Plus well, she's the one that cheated.   [TL;DR] Wife left for ""space"", cheated, divorce, now won't speak to even communicate what she wants out of divorce. There are no real assets and debts are individual. How does this work beyond just letting lawyers take time (equals money I don't have) to fight over stuff that's worthless? What can I expect from the process? Any insight or advice is appreciated."	Yes

Tim and Barbara have a marriage ceremony in 2007 in South Carolina, and fill out the applications for a marriage license (one for the judge, one for govt agency, and one for their own records), but do not file them because they want to continue receiving social security benefits from Tim's first wife who passed away. Instead, they opt to store those filled out by unsubmitted documents in a box in their closet.  The two live together, but do not file taxes together, do not share bills for many years, and have almost entirely separate finances.  Tim has recently passed away. Would they be considered married by common law in South Carolina, or would their not filing a marriage license application and continued receipt of social security for Tim's previous wife be sufficient evidence that they did not intend to marry? If so, how would this be presented to the court that makes this determination?  I apologize if my understanding of common law marriage is lacking, I'm still researching the subject and don't have any legal knowledge outside of what I've picked up on Reddit and a few other sources. Thank you for your time!	Yes
I don't know where to begin to get this done and if it will interfere with what my parents are doing since I have two kids with my wife who ran off.  My parents are going through the state to get custody of kids, who are living with them. What I really want to know is how do I file for a divorce with a runaway wife with children involved while parents are trying to get custody? And if it means anything there are court orders for both of us to pay child support. She's been avoiding it and I have been paying mine steadily every month. Sorry for poor punctuation and format I am on a bad phone. Is it going to cause a problem since I'm in a different state or do I have to contact the state the marriage took place? If it helps I'm in CT,  marriage took place in CA where parents and kids live.	Yes
"My wife left me for another man and filed for divorce on May 1. The 60-day waiting period came and went, and she has still not signed the decree. I have removed her from the car insurance (including the vehicle she is driving) and various other household services, and will be removing her from the phone plan on Friday.  She is claiming that because we are still legally married, I am obligated to provide her with car insurance.  I have offered to pay her legal fees and provide six months' spousal support if she signs by Friday, which she is considering ""blackmail"". I have let her attorney know of this offer and my terms. (I am pro se.)  I have also told her to see her attorney and get a hearing date, and I would cover her insurance up to the hearing date.  There are children involved; I have almost-full custody but am providing her with nominal child support once the decree is finalized so she can take the kids. I am also making the payments on the van as a form of spousal support so she has means to take the kids somewhere. She currently is renting a room and does not have a ""house"" to take the kids to during her custody periods. She cannot currently afford her own place and expenses; she works a near-minimum wage job (by choice; she has turned down at least three job offers since the separation).  I believe I have a leg to stand on here; she doesn't. Even though we are still legally married, I can't imagine anybody would consider us married and force me to put her back on the insurance. I feel that she is milking me for money intentionally at this point, whereas I just want her to sign so I can move on."	Yes
My childhood was a messy one. Both parents lost custody of me and my grandmother took custody for my entire childhood when she wasn't supposed to. I want all the records from back then. Am I entitled to them?	Yes
We married in 2016. She has about $50k in student debt. She has family about an hour, hour and a halfish from her school, where she also works part-time. We have split rent about 75%:25% since we moved in together.	Yes
So...I have 2 kids (3 and 6), bought my first house, and want to move in with my girlfriend of 3 years.  My kids have known her for quite a bit (2.5 years).  Now I wanted to make this a trial run to see how we get along as a family, but I have a standard visitation with no overnight guests rule.  ....do we have to get married to make this happen?  It seems crazy. We want to write up a lease agreement to make a 45 day safety period if it doesnt work out, but I don't want to violate my order.    How can I make this a trial without violating anything?	Yes
The deed is still in my grandfathers name but he died 8 years ago and my grandmother took charge of the house. A few months ago  she passed away also. I lived with my grandmother all of this time and she never put in her will, nor my Grandfather, to pass the deed over to the child if they died(my Mom). We have been able to get money/estate and car transferred over to us.   my question is do we need a lawyer to transfer over the deed of the house? and if not where do we go? the clerk of courts? if any of you had to do this before, how did you handle it?  Thank you for taking time to look at this.	Yes
She talked me into staying with her because she said I had commitment issues.  She made herself my personal caretaker isolating me away from professionals, church, friends and family.  I trusted her more than myself because of dogmatic Mormon views of Husband and Wife and benevolence of mental health professionals.  She talked cryptically about gas lighting, life insurance and suicide protection but ducted out at the idea that she pay it incase I am instituted and can't.   She lastly brought up a polyamorous marriage. I said she was cheating when she left for weekends without contact. She gave me 30 days to get out of her parents house (she was already pushing her parents into nursing homes for).	Yes
I'm asking this question for my boyfriend. Several years ago through a one night stand my boyfriend got a girl pregnant. About two years ago he found out it was his and has been paying child support since, but has not had or wanted any interaction or custody. The mother was fine with this arrangement and would still be. However, it turns out she has a pretty serious drug problem. The child has been taken from her and dcyf is demanding that my boyfriend take custody. He does not have the means or the ability or the inclination to care for this child. If it were up to him he would give the child up for adoption. He works full time and is about to start going back to school. But they say he has to or neglect charges will follow. I'm hoping somebody here can tell me what his options might be from this point and what possible consequences could come from those actions. Should he bother with a lawyer (We don't really have the money, but could probably fit it on a credit card)? The mother is being given a year to get right before having her rights terminated. The child is currently in foster care	Yes
"My fiance and I have been together for 4 years.  My daughter and I lived with him here in AZ for about a year before he had to move home to IA to take care of his sick dad. Since being there, he has inherited the family farm from his grandparents since no one is able to take care/run it.     In the meantime, I have been here with my daughter.  She is now 8 years old.  My fiance moved about two years ago, and yes I have procrastinated a bit on trying to move but it was only because I have been scared to confront my daughters father about moving.  We split up about 5 years ago but he has an anger problem.  Considering that I have triggers of people being angry and yelling at me, is why I haven't confronted him until recently.  I did mention the fact of moving last year which he seemed to be more willing to try if I went without her first and then after settling down, she would then come out there.  At first I thought it would be a good idea, but then I realized I felt like it was a manipulation tactic so I put it on hold.  I also wanted to wait until I had a job lined up so that way if it does go to court, I had something to argue for.  Earlier this year, I was offered a job about 20 minutes from where my fiance lives.  An amazing opportunity and one that I couldn't possibly turn down. . About a month ago, I confronted him that I was wanting to move and that my daughter is in fact wanting to come with me.  Now I know she is not at the age to where her voice and opinion matters, but she has stated many times that she does in fact want to move with me if I go.  Her father of course the first day was not happy.  About 3 days later, he seemed more open to it, especially after explaining what the job opportunity was.  4 days after that, we got into an argument because he doesn't understand why I want to be with my fiance and not him.  Then it turned into a fight of how I apparently have done nothing but cause him so much pain and suffering the past 5 years that it has made him live such a terrible life.  This is what hurts me.  The fact that he said this, I feel now is just another manipulation tactic.  I have done nothing but give him what he wants.  He wants more time with her? I give it to him.  He needs me to pick her up because he unexpectedly has plans?  I pick her up.  I pay for all the childcare, school things such as pictures, clothes, lunches... I pay for all of that.  He very rarely offers to pay for anything and even that usually doesn't go through.  He's supposed to pick her up from school every day and bring her home after dinner... half the time that doesn't even happen.  He doesn't even have a proper bed for her at his house.  Found out he didn't even have toothpaste for her.  All he has done the past 5 years is continue to make me feel guilty for his misery because I don't love him back and in result, I've given him anything he wants.  I started saying no more.  At the end of this argument, he gave me back a note that I handwrote him when I was 17.  That was almost 10 years ago!  Every time I try to move on with my life and live my life, he comes back with all of this, continues to make me feel bad so that way he can get what he wants.  He stated that he really doesn't care if my daughter goes.  I left the conversation feeling like I finally would get what I deserved and that he would let me go.  I was wrong.  Not even 2 days later, I get served with papers that he's wanting custody and for ME to pay HIM child support! Oh and he also stated in the papers that to the best of his knowledge, there is no job and that there is no other reason for me to move other than ""I just simply want to"" and that I'm not caring about the ""best interest of the child.""  This hurt more than anything.  I have not once asked him for child support.  The fact that he's going on paper to basically say that I've been lying to my own child and that I don't care about her is appalling.  The FACT that the papers were signed the DAY BEFORE we had that last talk, I feel was once again another manipulation tactic.  He had that conversation with me about me not loving him and blah blah blah already knowing he already signed papers. Including the fact that he even told me he really doesn't care if she goes.  He's made this a ""If I can't have you, no one can"" situation and it's not fair.  So now I have to go to court.  I don't have a lawyer at the moment for relocation because I don't have any money.  I did go and file my response the next day at the court house granting ""Joint Legal Decision Making"" as well as child support, but stated that I wanted her primary residence to be with me considering that that is how it's been her whole life.  I have also stated that I am willing to go to a mediator.  I also completed my Parenting Class Certification which the court has.  Now my issue is, I have not heard anything back.  It's been past 20 days since I filed my response and there has been no update online.  It says there was an ""Affidavit of Service"" filed on July 6th with a docket date of July 10th but I'm not exactly sure what that means considering I've gotten nothing.   So my question is, what is my next step?  How can I find out what's going on?  Also, if I make a list about the relocation and why it IS in the best interest for her to go and why it's not a good idea for her to stay with her father, would that help?  I want to get all my eggs in a basket before I go to file a petition to move.  I just want to know if there's any advice or tips on relocation.  TL;DR: My ex filed papers for custody, child support and opposing my relocation.  I filed a response the next day and it's past 20 days since then and I haven't heard anything.  How do I go about finding out what's going on and what are some tips on how to get a successful relocation?"	Yes
"Family lawyers of Reddit (or anyone that can help or advise.). I was in a relationship with a Spanish girl 5 years ago, I am in the UK, she became pregnant almost immediately or so I thought. When we went for a scan they said the she was 12 weeks pregnant but I had only known her for 9 weeks. Things soon started to fall apart between but obviously I wanted to find out if I had a child and obviously to be there for it and support it. Despite several attempts by myself and family members to get her to agree to a paternity test she flat out refused and ultimately asked me to leave her alone. A lawyer at the time said you would be surprised how often this happens and we all assumed that there was a high chance that the child isn't mine. 5 years later, this week she gets in touch with me. Saying we need to speak about our daughter. I of course reply and ask if she is now willing to consent to the paternity test, she agrees initially. I start to organize it with her between the two countries. Then she starts to flip out, saying that I will doctor the results so that it is negative (not something I would ever do I just want an answer and to be there for my child if they are mine). She then starts the familiar insults and randomness of old. ""Maybe it's better if we don't have proof."" ""She looks like you."" ""I will tell her you want nothing to do with her."" I repeatedly ask her if she will consent to the paternity test to which I get a no, a maybe, you haven't asked about her or for more photos (a route I'm trying not go down until I know and I think that she's trying to trap me emotionally) and then I ask one last time urging her to think about the child and not her pride and to drop the insults and negativity and I get no reply, it's been about 7 hours. Now yes it certainly looks like she's not sure if I'm the father, maybe knows that I'm not or has something else to hide. But ultimately I just want to know, what actions can I take, if any, as a potential father to get a paternity test agreed to or enforced. How would me being in the UK and mother and child in Spain make this more difficult? Thank you in advance for your comments and help."	Yes
I left my violent and abusive ex months ago. The system completely failed me and she ended up with physical custody because of the refrain order I got against her. Long story short the attorney for the child didn't like me. I get to see my son now, which is more than the original temp order so I've been content, in the interest of my son not being dragged through the family court system anymore.  Today I'm talking to him and he drops a toy and starts apologizing and saying please don't be mad. I told him it's okay we can fix it and I asked him if he had been getting yelled at. He said Mommy yelled at him for going down the stairs too slow and she kicked him down the stairs (6 carpeted stairs, not a huge staircase thank goodness). I told him he was good for talking to me about it and praised him for being brave. When I asked about it again he got frustrated and he WILL NOT talk about it now.   What do I do? He has to go back for 2 days tomorrow morning but I'm terrified something is going to happen again. I feel like if I went to the police then her lawyer spins that I'm drumming up bullshit. What if she snaps and something terrible happens? What can I do? I have a recording of him telling me a second time. He's only 5 he can't call 911 if she goes off on one of her rampages.	Yes
Is there any difference in the process of giving up a child if it were to be ill or disabled? I'm aware of the safe haven laws in Texas which allow 60 days for a parent to give up a baby, but was unsure if this also applied to ill/disabled children.  Additionally, if the baby shows normal development for a few months/years and then develops an illness/disability, would this be a barrier to giving the child up later in life?	Yes
I'm 27, out of school, and not well versed in this type of stuff. I do have a fianc√© and my mom (my dads ex-wife/friend) that can give me support mentally thankfully. I do have power of attorney for if he is incapacitated. He needs someone to pay his bills on time, keep track of doctors appointments, and paperwork. He currently lives with me, but is on a waiting list for a senior living place nearby.   I just found out today his license was canceled on July 5th, due to not reporting any updates on his vision. He used to have cataracts but had surgery for them in June. They gave him 30 days to reply to the letter but he forgot about it. It says he could have filed a petition to get it back with an eye exam, but he didn't. He did not show me the letter until today, more than 30 days later. It says his license is canceled indefinitely and the letter says if he doesn't give his new eye exam he has to surrender his license. This was sort of the catalyst for this discussion. Also, what do I do if he tries to drive? Can I just hide his keys? I wasn't keen on him driving in the first place cuz he is really frail anyway.   We live in Glendale, WI.	Yes
A friend of mine recently married a man who had a rather questionable past with the ladies. To my knowledge, he's never had any run-ins with the law, but he has 7 children from 3 or 4 different women.   It genuinely seems that he is maturing and wants to develop a relationship with all of his children.   He has a child from a one-night stand who is 9. A paternity test was done when she was an infant and he has been paying child support since then.   He doesn't have a relationship with the child though. As I have been told (for whatever that's worth), the mother won't allow him to see the child unless it's just the three of them (mother, father, child). She has a history of only wanting him around when he is single. When he is with someone, she won't allow him to see the child unless the 3 of them go out (very reminiscent of a forced date), and she will not allow him to bring any of his other children or his wife.   He doesn't really have a relationship with his daughter, and the mother refuses to let him introduce the girl to her siblings.   For awhile he just threw his hands up, and said whatever. Now that he's married, and really focusing on his family, he's upset that his daughter isn't a part of that, but he is also not sure how to approach this, as he's not had a real presence for the greater part of the 9 years she's been on this earth.   What are his options? What is the best way to proceed? And what obstacles will he likely face, given the lack of relationship?  Thank you in advance. I genuinely appreciate this sub, and all you offer.	Yes
[IN] moving out of state custody issue   Serveral years ago my girlfriend, let's call her Jamie, divorced her ex husband. They had joint custody and remained in their home living there week on and week off with the kids to try and preserve normalcy for them. After sometime, he started coming home on his weeks off and one night hit her. He was arrested, and she left with the kids to a relatives the next state over. Her ex husband having money took her to court and was awarded custody as she had no home or car at the time.    In the year since then she and I met, she moved back here and we have bbeen living with my family, getting jobs, getting a car and recently a home. She was spending weekends with her kids every week.  A couple months ago her ex said he met a girl in New York state and was thinking about moving, he told her he would tell her more if it was gonna happen. Well he didn't and we found out from the kids that he was moving in 7 days, and he did. He said he wanted the youngest boy 8, bit was going to allow the older two a boy 14 and a girl 15 to stay with their mom here in our home. My wife was always going to fight for the youngest too but we were gonna have to have time to save money up...   Well the kids went to visit him and now he won't let any of them come back. He says she is an unstable mother because of the past year and he is currently the custodial parent.    He did not file anything saying he wanted to move. The kids have no friends or extended family there, and driving 13 hours to visit is impossible for us. They are all living in a one room apartment with their dad, his girlfriend and her 5 year old with serious behavior issues. They all want to be here with their mom.    What do we do now? Can we do anything since he didn't file a notice that he was moving? Should she just apply for legal aid? Any input will be great. She knows she hasn't done everything perfect, her life went into a tailspin and none was there to help her, but she's a wonderful woman and mother we've lifted ourselves up and are ready to fght for these kids even if that means taking on 2nd jobs to be able to afford it.	Yes
Can someone advise me what would happen if my foster child were to say smash someone's car windows?  Would that be my financial duty, would it be the state's, or would the biological parents be responsible?	Yes
Long story short, I met a woman on reddit from India, we have been talking for months, and well obviously hit it off. We decided it may be best for her to come to the US so we can get married, and so she can get treatment for a particularly rare mental illness. As I understand it the best way to do this is on a K-1 visa. Now here is my question. How do I go about proving that we actually have a relationship? We have been communicating on Skype for a few months, but I would really not want to print out those transcripts because it talks a lot about the mental illness, as well as other personal things. I am going into my senior year of college, and can't really afford a lawyer, although should be able to pick up a job in a years time. This is also hopefully, when this plan would come into place. Still would prefer to not hire a lawyer because of the expense however. Should I make a new Skype, and only talk to her there about things we wouldn't mind being printed out, and used as evidence of a relationship? Can customs ask to see her phone, and look through everything? I know I am supposed to meet her in person once for the K-1, and when I do I will make sure to take plenty of pictures. Anything else I can start doing now, before next year?	Yes
"Long story short, when I was born, my father left my mother (both early 20s) because he didn't want me and wasn't ready to be a Dad. He wanted to keep partying, going to bars and living that lifestyle.  They were married when I was born, but shortly after, got a divorce.  My father was ordered to pay child support until I was 18, but he never did. My Mom was so busy working 2-3 shitty jobs to keep us stable and so upset with my Dad that she never had the time, willpower or resources to do anything about it. She just gave me the whole, ""He'll get his in the end."" speech about karma.  I haven't spoken to my father in over 15 years. Since my early teens.  Well, I'm older now and my adult mind can process what actually happened and I'm not okay with it. I'm 29 now and I was wondering if there is any way I can sue him and collect the money he never paid so I can try to force my Mom to take it. I know she's prideful, but I want to make things right because she still works those same shitty jobs as she did when I was younger and she deserves better than that.  Is there anything I can do legally about the back child support he never paid? I know he has it, because he **still** lives with his mother  (my grandmother), doesn't pay any bills, and my uncle (his brother) tells me that my Dad is into bad drugs and constantly bets thousands of dollars on stupid football games.  It's infuriating what he put my Mom through and I want justice. I'm just hoping that legal action doesn't have to come from my Mom, because I know she will just tell me to let it go like she did.  Any legal advice you guys can offer would be great. Thanks."	Yes
I (31f) and my boyfriend (29m) are very concerned over my niece and nephew's well being. Their father (33m) is a heroin addict who is in and out of rehab consistently - was just kicked out of the last one and is not able to pay for rent or food (refuses to go to a food bank). He quit his part time job and is solely relying on his SSDI to pay the bills. He has an untreated mental illness and refuses to seek any therapeutic treatment other than antidepressants. If the situation arises where he returns to drug use and cannot feed nor house his children - I am planning to sue for guardianship/custody and move them to VA where we both work. I make close to 6 figures and can afford the childcare and additional expenses.   I have kicked the can far enough down the road due to his lying and manipulation - but those kids deserve a better life. DCYF already visited his home and did nothing about it. My parents (mid 60s) are only capable of caring for them for a short time - any longer than a few months would likely overwhelm them with stress. In addition to that, they do not speak the same language (grandparents are Deaf).   What can I expect from this process? I already have a referral for a lawyer in NH, but do I also need one in VA?  What is the best way to go about this process?  Thanks in advance for any tips or methods to help the kids out.	Yes
I am in the military, and my wife has a 7 y.o. daughter from a previous relationship.   The birth father has a rough history, and essentially lost joint custody for a) harassment of my wife, b) repeatedly asking to pay less child support, and c) not showing up for court. By Oct '13 my wife had a protection order against him and his only rights were bi-weekly visitation.   I married wife that same year, and the military re-located us out of state. NY law required that we receive consent from the father to relocate step-daughter, and he was not willing to give consent, so we had to go to court. To sweeten the deal for him, we offered to reduce child support. The judge determined it was in the child's best interest to move with us for several reasons. Birth father is now allowed to see step-daughter every summer for 6 weeks and Christmas for 1 week, which roughly equals the cumulative amount of visitation he had with her before - arguably, more quality time together as opposed to 48 hours every 2 weeks. And he was released from obligation to pay child support, with the implied intent being that he could save the child support money to visit his daughter. He has never visited. We paid out of pocket to fly my step daughter home to NY twice per year, at about $500-800 round trip each time.   We have since moved 2 more times, and birth father has never paid child support. He has offered 2-3 times to pay for something like soccer registration fee, so about $100 worth of donations. Birth father got married last year and his own child this year.   Do we have any leg to stand on if we ever want to resume his child support payments? What would we have to prove? We don't need the money right now, and I don't want to be greedy, but it would be nice to put a little more into her college fund and savings account. We are not living in NY currently, which would affect our ability to attend any legal proceedings.	Yes
Hello all, I have a couple of questions about divorce and I was hoping I coud get a couple clarifications about them.   I would like to divorce my wife, she's been toxic and I haven't been as much as happy since I left. We live in different states, She's in Texas, where we used to reside together until I moved to DC for work. The house we lived in is under my name, I paid for it and she still live there with my daughter. All furnitures are mine, they are family antiques that were shipped from France and most things in the house belong to me. When we got married, we signed a Pre-nuptia, in France ( We did it a a notary, in the presence of an interpret etc). I don't wish nothing bad to my wife and want to help her and my daughter as much as possible but I feel that she might try to take advantage and keep some things she is not supposed too. She made copies of documents about money that I have in France to show a judge to try and get more child support (that's what she told me).   My questions are as follow: where should I file for divorce? Texas or DC? Will the prenuptia work in the US (wife said no, but she is obviously biased and not a lawyer so Im not sure).   I've been sending some money to her here and there, to pay the bills of the house and help with my daughter (wife goes to school and refuse to work so always need money) should I keep sending money or should I just wait until a set amount is decided by a judge?   If she were to destroy or sell some of my antiques as revenge, do I have any recourse?	Yes
If a girl gets pregnant, chooses to keep the baby and doesn't inform the (most likely) father of the child and he finds out, does this go against any of his rights?	Yes
I have a family member that is buying and redistributing mass amounts of fake ids from various places in China to college students. He posts frequently on the fakeid subreddit, but other than that is relatively discrete. I'm not okay with this family member doing this kind of activity in the same household as me. I also recently found out that he got fake ids for a student that passed away at college last semester due to alcohol poisoning. It could have been from the alcohol he bought with the fake. If he does not stop this activity, how should I go about reporting him to the police?	Yes
throwaway time. I am above 18 years old. She's already got the paperwork started. My mom and my Dr. are guilting me into going to a 2 moth program (which I really don't want to go to) because they don't believe I can take care of myself (I can). Is there anything I can do if she actually goes through with getting me a legal guardian?	Yes
Hello, I'm in the USAf and I'm going home this month to get married to my fiance. He is from Canada, however and wanting to know if there is anything I need to do outside the standard marriage practices for Oregon.	Yes
We have 50/50 joint custody and the parenting plan states that we share all major decisions. I would prefer her boyfriend stay in the waiting room and not be allowed back in the room with him. At least while I am there. This will be my first time meeting him, on top of the first time any of my children have ever been administered anesthesia and undergone surgery. I don't need the added stress of him being there. What are my rights here? I was also wondering if maybe there are OSHA laws that give me the right to deny people visiting my child in the hospital. My child will have both parents present. I see no need in a boyfriend who has only known the child several months be present if I don't approve of it.	Yes
21 year old child living in parents home. Child has quit college and is not paying rent. Child is not following rules of the home, such as chores and cleaning up after themselves, and has recently become destructive(smashed outdoor grill and threw others property away)as well as verbally abusive towards minor child in the home.   How would one go about removing him from the home? Is it possible to do so without causing him to have a criminal record? Thank you.	Yes
" Background info that you need to know: My dad has physically abused me for basically my entire life, and my mom their entire marriage (has become a lot less frequent in the later years of their marriage, but he still threatens her with a raised hand. Also, she has kind of learned not to speak out against him because she understands the physical threat that he poses to her). Up until recently I just took the abuse and did nothing about it, but over the past year and a half or so I've been standing up for myself and threatening to dial 9-1-1 if he stepped closer (first time I did this was when he was threatening to beat me with a bat because i accidentally lost one of his papers -- locked the door and put the phone up to the window so he could see) and even using my own strength to stop him from hitting me - not hitting back, just using my arms to hold his down.  Also, my dad has been financially abusive his entire life. My mother works 5 days a week and makes almost as much money as he does on top of the countless hours of housework that she does and the abuse that she has to go through from him, and still she is barely ever allowed to spend money on anything for herself. Every penny she spends is policed by my dad and he goes so far as to make her return things that he does not approve of. He barely gives me any money to spend (probably has given me on average like 5 bucks every 2 months -- he hasn't even given me a birthday present or a graduation present or anything), which isn't such a big deal on its own and honestly it may seem like I'm complaining about a first-world problem and sound like a little brat but what makes it awful is that he did not allow my sisters and me to get jobs while each of us were in high school (although with some convincing I managed to get permission to get one near the end of my senior year of high school, but I couldn't find a job all throughout the summer), so basically we all wanted money to spend but he would not let us work nor would he give us money. He's even been known to take money from us that we received from other family members on special occasions, which is why we've learned to hide our money even around our own house.  Also, he makes every decision in the household for both himself and my mother and she plays a very small role in any of those decisions if any at all, even though she is a breadwinner just like he is. He threatens her with physical abuse or raises his voice at her if she doesn't comply with what he chooses to do, and eventually she just gives in like always.  I planned to move into my college dorm (university is in NJ) on the 31st of September to start my freshman year of college. The payment for my first semester costs, including tuition and housing and everything, is due on the 17th of August, and it's not small amount of money that I can pull out of nowhere in 7 days. --------------------------------------  So, over the past few months, things have been getting pretty heated between me and my dad. I don't see him much during the day, but on the occasion that I'd still be awake when he came back from work, we'd usually fight about something, and the fights have been getting more and more frequent.  Tonight, my whole family was in the car on the way back from an event, and he asks me about my roommate, and somehow, like always, one thing leads to another and we're arguing with each other again. He says to me ""Ok, well if this is how it's going to be, then we're not going to be paying for your college. You're on your own."" I told him to stop using the word ""we"" as if my mom had any choice to make in the first place -- I told him to say what he truly meant and use the word ""I"", because everyone knows it's only him that makes any big decision like that ever and speaks on behalf of both my parents. Even though my mom makes her own money, if she wanted to pay for my college fees, she wouldn't be able to because my dad would not allow her -- or at least she feels too threatened to try anything like that. We usually have this argument and it blows over in a few days, except this time I went even further and told him that he basically ruined my life and called him out for physically, mentally, and emotionally abusing me throughout my entire life and doing the same to my mother throughout their entire marriage. This got him especially upset, and as we were coming out of the car, he rushed to the back, clearly very angry, and I knew straight away what he was about to try and do, so I locked the door and punched in 9-1-1 on my phone and showed him. Eventually, I got out of the car safely, but he would not let me back in.   So yeah, after much threatening over the years, my dad had finally kicked me out of the house for the first time ever. I called up one of my friends but by the time he got to my house (about 2 hours ago) my mom told me she wanted me to come in and just say sorry to my dad, but there was no way I was going back inside there, so I just left for a little and my friend and I hungout and I planned to stay over his house for the night like he had offered, but my mom wanted me back home and had convinced my dad to let me stay, so I just went back. And now here I am, typing all of this that literally just happened and my dad's upstairs and things are extremely heated between us and this is the first time that I'm actually legitimately concerned about what's going to happen in my future after a threat from my dad, because our argument tonight actually went way beyond the level that it usually does.  I still have to get a new phone and laptop for college which my dad had promised me, so that's also a problem, because I doubt he's going to be paying for those things any time soon. I'm going to ask my mom to help me out on her own without my dad but I know it's possible she might not agree because she would not even think of going against my dad's word. As I mentioned before, the payment is due on the 17th of August and I do not think between now and then that my dad will change his mind about paying for it, and even if he does, I do not want to remain under his fiscal control like my sisters have all throughout their college years, because they go through hell whenever they want to make a decision about their lives and I don't want to put myself in that situation. I'm completely lost, I have no clue what to do. Please help.  P.S. sorry if there's a lot of useless information in here, I just wanted to put the stuff about my dad because it seemed to me like a lot of it was illegal and it might help. Also, I'm just a complete mess of emotions and my thoughts are running crazy right now."	Yes
This in regards to technically my nephew-in-law, my husband's sister's son. Our nephew is about two years old and we were informed by her and a family friend that he was taken into foster care on Friday. We aren't sure exactly what happened to cause it, since we can't get any straight answers out of my sister-in-law, but clearly it was pretty serious. She has been under the scrutiny of CPS since the child was born, and even lived with us for a few months after he was born under an agreement with CPS.   We don't understand why we weren't contacted to have our nephew stay with us instead of being put into foster care. We've been an advocate for him since he was born. We've tried contacting CPS, but we know they can't tell us anything--we're just a little desperate. I tried contacting a few lawyers Friday and today (Monday), but I haven't yet been able to find anyone able to help on short notice (not at least for three more weeks). I've contacted my work hotline that helps connect employees with a lawyer or legal advice, they gave me a couple names, but agreed it would be incredibly difficult to find someone to talk to immediately. I haven't been able to get a response from anyone today. None of that is too relevant except that to tell you all, I'm desperate and I just don't know what to do.  We're supposed to be going out of town tomorrow for the rest of the week. Our sister-in-law is telling us she has a hearing this week and wants to declare her intent to have us to adopt her son. But no one has contacted us and no one will talk to us about it, besides her, and we have reason to not trust her. We don't know if one of us should try to stay to see what happens and if we'll need to take action during the week. The trip is for work, and so it's hard for us to make this decision not to leave just on a whim, when no one's telling us we need to be here.  I don't want to be too specific just because this could all involve some legal allegations that, again no one will talk to us about, but I thought maybe I could ask some specific questions someone could give us some advice:  1. I've been told that typically children are placed with family before being placed into foster care. However, no one gave us the option to take him, even though we believe our sister-in-law and social services knew that we would willingly care for him. We're incredibly worried that our sister-in-law has said something about my husband to make them think we were a threat, which would be completely untrue. Is that possible, or does it seem normal that a child would be placed in foster care just while they were figuring out what to do? And if something was said about us do we have any right to know about it?  2. What can I say, who can I contact to let them know how urgent our situation is? I feel like I keep getting brushed off from law offices because my matter is 'too urgent', they tell me to talk again to my referral service, but then I'm just stuck again with someone who can't take our case.   3. Is it actually possible that my sister-in-law is preparing to hand her son off for adoption to us but yet no one has tried to talk to us about it besides her?!   4. I realize that two weeks in foster care probably won't harm this kid forever, but at the same time, I am worried that things are going to move down a path so quickly that we may never see our nephew again, without even getting the opportunity to speak up about it. I know that we don't technically have any legal rights over him since we aren't his parents, but we care about him and we want what's best for him, and think that that is with us (if it can't be with her). But we don't know where to start and we don't know who to talk to to make sure our voice is heard.  It's been a long day and I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this! There are a lot of details I left out, and my mind is racing and stressed at the moment. I could write a novel about the journey we have been through with this kid, and I want to help him so much, but I don't know how to say it to the courts.	Yes
"I'm going to try to summarize this as briefly as possible. By the way, I'm in Virginia. Basically, my mom was impregnated and my ""dad"" didn't want anything to do with it. To protect me, my family had him sign something saying he wouldn't contact me or contribute to my welfare. This applied until I turned 18. Now, as an adult, I've attempted to make contact but he has responded that he has no interest. Given that I didn't make the decision to essentially sign him off all parenthood duties, do I have any legal grounds at all to sue for child support as an adult?"	Yes
Small preface: My mother is very trustworthy and would not misuse money or steal.  I am 19 and ready to start my freshman year at college. My mother is still receiving child support from my father. She is saving it instead of putting it into my savings in case she can get into trouble. We have not talked to my father about it yet in case it will cause a stir and give him an out.  My question is: is her receiving it past the date we thought illegal? If so, should we just transfer it back to my dad?   Thanks everyone :)	Yes
She came home from Banff Pregnant, Had a Daughter named ‚ÄúM‚Äù  Soon after Fell in love with a man we will call ‚ÄúBob‚Äù whom took to M as his own. Moved them both into his home. He had a problem drinking and about a year in got in an accident causing bodily harm. He had also impregnated my sister with ‚ÄúL‚Äù They tried to avoid jail by going into detox voluntarily but come the court date 6 months later, Bob got 6 months in jail. My Family was at their home keeping it up while he was away. No Help for his side of the family. Both sides of the family supported him with zero ridicule. He has been sober for 6 years and my sister was his rock.  L was born, my parents again were there to help, no sign of Bob's family. Two years ago they had twin boys. This is where I believe postpartum depression poked its ugly head. M is 8, L is 5. Again not to repeat myself but my family is now there everyday helping, while Bob‚Äôs family doing as little as possible.  This is where the story gets dark. My Sister tried to killer herself with pills. She‚Äôs taken to the hospital,they run tests ect. Immediately admitted to the Mental Wing. Now the Children's Aid Society is involved.  I‚Äôm not living in the same province, I fly home to visit her in the hospital where she will reside for 2 weeks. If you‚Äôve ever been in a Mental Wing one thing stood out she did not belong here. While she was in hospital Bob family all of the sudden had to help with the kids. She was no tint here for a week and Bob‚Äôs Aunt had papers for my sister to sign basically giving up custody of her children, thank goodness my parents were there to read the documents first. And they were not signed. Next the Van Bob‚Äôs mom Co-signed for needs some repairs that are to be covered by insurance but tell my sister that the only way to get it fixed is to sign over the van to Bobs mom. (Bob can not drive until 2020). This is obviously wrong she ended up just signing a different piece of paper from the insurance company saying they can pay for repairs. Keep in mind this was while she was in the hospital.  My sister finally gets out of the hospital, can not live at home because of the Children Aid Society rules she must have an additional adult present for visiting her children. These restrictions are to be lifted soon and she can move back home with her children, she is currently living with my parents.  But wait there's more since she has been living away from the children, Bobs family has had to step up and help alot more than ever. Is going to get a whole lot more bizarre so here goes. Bobs mom has taken the keys to the van and will not give them back forcing my parents to take two vehicles to pick up the kids because Bob will not let them in the house. They have packed up all my sisters things and put them on the porch one night, i advised them they can not move out of the marital home and to leave the boxes there. They have recently changed the locks to the Marital home leaving my sister without a key. Bob has also asked for a separation. All of this sounds bizarre but it's real, Bob‚Äôs family has completely turned against my sister when she needs the help and support the most.It all feels like set up now. They are dictating when she can see her kids &amp; implementing their own rules that accommodate themselves and no one else.  Financially they are not in a good place, They do get the tax benefit from having kids which pays for the van &amp; the rest she sends to Bob to pay for the marital home.  My questions are, can she move back home when the Children's Aid Society has removed their restrictions? What happens if she does not? Is this entrapment?  Can they legally do any of this? What‚Äôs the fastest way to get legal aid? We don‚Äôt know what her rites are  I'm not a real good story teller, please take it easy.	Yes
My girlfriend and I are getting married in the next month. We moved the wedding up almost a year because of her grand fathers health.  My question is, could I find quick prenups online that would hold up or do I need to go though a lawyer? Any other advice appreciated.   Before anyone asks, she knows a prenup is a stipulation to our marriage. She knows I have considerable assets and q business I want to protect in the event of divorce. I witnessed my father go though a brutal multi million dollar divorce after 20 years of marriage and don't want to go though that.	Yes
Hi. My husband and I, married 11 years. I am thinking of leaving my husband. He originally purchased the house before we married, but I have significantly improved it, ie repainting, tuck pointing, re-grouting, and basically building 2 new rooms out of a sleep out. I don't want it to get messy, I guess I just want to know where I stand if leave.  As he owned the house before we married, do I have any claim on it? I am worried as we have 3 children. I am happy to  move somewhere else, but I don't quite know how to move forward.	Yes
Overview  * he's 24 * Got this girl pregnant, they dated maybe 2 or 3 weeks * She's 6 months along now * He lives in one state, she in another  I'm trying to get things situated from a legal standpoint so I can help make sure he has his ducks in a row. I'm going to operate under the assumption that he needs to be looking out for his own best interests (and also the baby's) and not assume she will..  What state laws apply for child support? What are some common things that he can get in order to help his life less hectic?   He's the type of person that will ignore hard decisions or conversations hoping it all just works out.  Any input is appreciated.	Yes
Long story but here is the short version.  17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.   He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	Yes
Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
My best friend's father works for the MTA making $35/hr. All of his primary children are at least 18 years or older and are capable if not employed in a job. The issue involves financial and parental burdens on his children.  The father currently has two sets of families: the children and a passed wife he's lived with for at least 20 years, and another family birthed from infidelity dating back to about 15 years ago. He has rarely visited his second family until after the loss of his legal wife due to breast cancer 5 years ago.  The issue persists primarily on the financial impact that is affecting both his youngest son, age 23 (my best friend) and his oldest daughter, age 19. His 23 year old son has moved out since graduating college to Long Island. The father was assisting in paying student loans and is also responsible for the rent at the apartment he and his daughter live in. For the last two months at least, the father has rarely been home, when he does go home does not bring any food for the daughter, has stopped paying student loans, and is at least a month behind on rent. They fear he may be splurging his money on the other family or other things, but he is not around enough to confirm/deny that, nor does he often respond to their calls/messages. The daughter works a part time job until the fall semester starts and so she has been the one to maintain herself for the time being.  It's still unsure what will happen if another month's rent goes unpaid and if the daughter will be displaced and have to live somewhere else. Currently, grandparents are the most immediate resource even if their apartment is smaller and already crowded.   What options does my friend and his sister have for her living situation in particular? There's only so much I can do living in another state (TX) to try and help them out.   Any suggestions or advice are greatly appreciated.	Yes
Hi, my mother and I are co-guardians for my father and are closing on a rather large settlement. I was just wondering how the money is allowed to be managed/used legally? Currently we only have his SSA disability to manage and it is wholly used to provide for our rent/food expenses and easy to report. He is currently in a nursing home and unable to take care of himself and is mentally incapacitated permanently. If a large settlement is agreed upon we plan to buy him a home and hire first class home care for his needs but I am lost on what I can legally do with the remainder of the money. This isn't money that I feel comfortable using frivolously or irresponsibly but is it legal to gift myself a sum of money from the settlement to be used for my own living expenses and future needs(such as purchasing a home)? Could I report it as such or would there need to be a meticulous accounting report done for every penny spent? Of course I will discuss this with appropriate professionals when the time officially comes but after searching on my own I can't find any insight as to what to expect and I'd like to know what the general rules are so I can somewhat plan ahead.	Yes
"So recently my eldest sister (34) kicked out my young niece (about 16) after deciding to ""work"" it out with her abuser of a husband and told my niece that she could move in with our grandmother. She, obviously didn't take the news lightly and most of our family have rushed in to help her but legally what can we do? I only want the best for her"	Yes
"I'm sorry for how long this is but I don't know how to make this situation any simpler.   Some background: I'm 19, my brother is 17, and my parents got divorced ~15 years ago. The divorce was messy, drawn-out and complicated by my mother's mental health problems, and the fact that she wanted full custody and our dad out of our lives completely.  Though the court awarded 50/50 shared custody, my dad was ordered to pay child support because he'd been supporting our family by running his own business while my mom stayed home. A year or two after the divorce my mom (still unemployed) moved to a town hours away in an attempt to force the custody issue, and took my dad back to court seeking full custody again. She lost and after that point only saw my brother and I for three weekends a month and every other week in the summer, though she retained 50/50 ""rights and responsibilities"" and so continued collecting child support from my dad. In the intervening years my dad has had to close his business and file for bankruptcy (thanks to legal debt), go on food stamps and pick up multiple extra jobs just to keep our family afloat. My mom was well-employed for several years, but has also gone through several long periods of unemployment where child support was her only income. All my health expenses, school supplies, extracurriculars, clothes, food, etc. was paid for by my dad; my mom bought me food when I was with her and that was about it. Any kind of support from her stopped when I was sixteen, when I moved out and cut contact with her due to a violent incident.  Throughout all these changes the amount of child support paid has never been reviewed or modified from the original amount (I don't know the exact figure but it's hundreds of dollars a month). I've talked to my dad about it on and off for years, and he is terrified of going back to court and the effect it will have on our family. The last time my parents were in court my mom falsely accused my dad of abusing her, sexually abusing me, stalking, etc. He also can't afford another costly court battle and believes my mom can- though she's since become estranged from her entire family who backed her financially last time they went to court, she's currently dating a fairly wealthy guy who spends a lot of money on her.   This is all complicated by the fact that two years ago when our financial situation was extremely bad my dad stopped paying my mom child support. I'm really angry with him for doing this because I know it's illegal and could look bad in future legal proceedings, but my dad suffers from his own issues and I know he didn't see any other options at the time. My mom eventually reported it to the state and now they are garnishing his paycheck. The amount he owes continues to grow, in part because the state is still collecting child support for me even though I'm 19.  I want to get my dad off the hook for child support, at least for me (my brother still visits my mom a few times a month, although she cancelled last-minute on spending christmas and a couple weekends with him this year). I'm sure there's little chance of getting the child support adjusted for the years she didn't support me at all, or adjusted for my parents' changed financial situations without having all their tax paperwork, but is there any way I can inform the state that I'm not a minor anymore and to stop collecting child support in my name? Alternatively, what are some good legal arguments to convince my dad to try to modify the child support himself? I have no idea how long he's planning on letting this go on, and our family could really use any extra money (I'm putting myself through college because the bankruptcy/debt means my dad's ineligible for loans, but he's still helping out with groceries so I don't starve, and with my brother going to college soon we don't know how we're going to manage). It's ridiculous, at this point it feels like we're just throwing cash into a bottomless pit.   ***tl;dr:*** My mom is collecting child support she doesn't need or deserve. Do I, the 19 yr old child, have any grounds to put a stop to it? If not, what can I do to convince my dad to take action?"	Yes
Parents have been married 20-30 years. Combined income pre-divorce is in the 45,000 - 75,000 range.   Father has been unemployed for over a decade and is emotionally abusive. Father also suffers from a host of disorders such as multiple sclerosis and several mental disorders.   Mother is initiating the divorce. One house is fully paid off and in both parents' names, but the mother paid for over 99% of it. Bank accounts are in mother's name (I think), but one credit card lists both parents' names. Father uses this credit card to both buy food and support his hoarding disorder.   Mother wants to settle it peacefully (out of court) by selling the house and splitting the money in half or in the father's favor. Father wants alimony to cover medical expenses and lack of a job. However, father has not been going to a doctor (even at mother's plea) and uses his sickness as his reason for continued unemployment.  Mother is currently seeing a lawyer, but I'm curious as to what you all think would happen. Is there any way she can avoid having to pay the alimony for an abusive POS?	Yes
This question is for Virginia but could apply to every other state in general terms. Tomorrow's the day where parties go to court and the final divorce decree is issued. The ex-husband's attorney has e-mailed over a list of objections to the decree (no doubt in an effort to try and drag this out further than the 2-3 years its already gone on). Despite the fact that the judge issued a scathing ruling finding in favor of the ex-wife (rejecting spousal support outright, requiring attorneys fees for the wife and payment of back taxes). Generally speaking, without new evidence (they have none) what is the likelihood judges go back on their initial rulings? This has dragged on too long. And in addition, once the final divorce decree is issued it doesn't matter if one side refuses to sign it or not correct?	Yes
"I live in Texas first of all. My 5 year-old son just told me that he ""snuggles"" and sometimes co-sleeps (my language, not his) with his stepfather. He also told me this happens nearly every morning after his mom goes to work and that his stepfather is only wearing underwear while they're under the covers. Apparently, they also watch videos or play games on his phone in this state.  He continued to say that he sleeps between them some nights and his mom is ""totally naked"". I'm more than a little disturbed by all of this. He sleeps in his own bed 100% of the time when he's with me, which is 50/50 on a week on week off basis. Clearly he doesn't ""need"" this.   Where does the law/judges/cps stand on this behavior? It seems like alienation at the very least to me."	Yes
I have full custody (legal and physical) in this situation, and my ex has monitored visitation. I won child support through the court as the CSSD was never able to verify my ex's income. Recently my ex filed to open a new case with the CSSD, and I'm unsure if that's even possible nor do I understand the intention of that. So I guess my question is, if there is already a support order through the court, will the CSSD even bother with this?   Thanks in advance!	Yes
A friend of mine is on the run right now. Her mother tried to shoot her, and threatened to kill her little sister if she goes to the police. She's the only witness. Obviously she has to go to the police: what does she tell them so they lock the mother up and ensure her and her sister's safety? She's the only eyewitness right now. This is after a previous incident of assault after she ran away from home, also unreported no marks remaining. Thank you.	Yes
My SIL and her husband moved to Texas less than a year ago. He took a job and his whole family is there. Her family is in the PNW. She's miserable and is contemplating divorce. The one hiccup is the fact that they have a child.   She hates TX and has no support there. Could she legally take her kid with her to her parents house and file divorce while in another state?  Now that they live in Texas, is she essentially stuck there as long as her husband stays there?  Would it be better for her to encourage them to move to another state before filing for divorce? The husband hates his job.  Thank you!	Yes
"A girl i know and i were talking and she casually mentioned her almost 1 year old daughter doesnt have a birth certificate or a social security card. She had an unassisted home birth in California and almost immideatly moved to Illinois and never signed her daughter up for one. Her daughter hasnt been to a doctor and she tells public aid that her social security card was ""stolen"". She also doesnt plan to ever sign her up for school. She wants to raise her completely off the grid.  I know this will cause problems in the future but can anything be done about it now? Is this illegal?"	Yes
"My husband likes to tell me that if I were to divorce him I wouldn't get any alimony. He seems to be under the impression that if I were to ""abandon"" the marriage then I'm not entitled to alimony. It's only if he were to divorce me that I would be given it.   I'm a stahm with only a high school diploma, so I wouldn't be making as much as him were I to get a job. Divorcing him would be me voluntarily giving up his pay and the lifestyle we have, so I wouldn't be awarded any alimony.   I don't think this is true. But I thought it couldn't hurt to ask r/legaladvice to find out for sure."	Yes
Colorado. I was assaulted by my (ex)partner last night, him being taken to jail and I to the hospital. He was seen by a judge today and I have a Mandatory Protection Order that specifically mentions the apartment we are both on the lease for.   About an hour ago I received a three day notice to quit for substantial violation. Am I out of luck or is there protection for me since I was the victim?  I will be calling around when offices open tomorrow, but right now I am scared I will have to move on my own in three days. If I left anything out I am very sorry.  TL;DR He broke the lease by assaulting me. Do I have to move or can I fight a notice to quit?	Yes
My grandfather is trying to adopt me I'm 19 if that matters to make a long story short I've lived with my grandparents since I was 2. Parents are divorced dad has no rights and my mother's okay with the adoption while he was looking for a lawyer idk if we even need one but. He found this http://www.411legal.net they said it was a $1.99 for a 7-Day trial and $20 a month after that so is this bs?	Yes
Would my original child support payments to my ex change if I choose to have another child with my current GF? Thanks for your time.	Yes
"    Im 14 years old and my father has been emotionally abusing me and my mother for years. Divorce has been an idea that has come up and it seems like it wouls be a good idea if it weren't for who my father is. He is a  lawyer and pretty big name in the town that I live in. Last time he kicked my mom out he tried to make her quit her job and said he will send her ""papers"". This makes me fear what would happen in the event of a divorce. I also have recordings of him talking to someone I believe he's having an affair with. What is the best way to proceed with a divorce and protect me and my mom. He's also very possessive of me and the property that him and my mom share. I'm sorry that this post is all over the place but this was the best way for me to describe my situation.   Thanks "	Yes
"My Gf asked me to go to the beach with her dad and his wife, who is not her mother. We were all drinking one night and me and my gf were playing around wrestling which was a bad idea cause she started to get mad when she thought I was getting too aggressive. We stopped, I thought we were just playing around cause she started laughing and lunged at me which caused me to fall back and she hit her head in the ground hard. I immediately asked if she was ok and tried to check on her but she freaked out and said leave me alone, don't talk to me etc. and ran to her room with our 8 month old son who was sleeping. I kind of just layed there and was like what the hell just happened before going inside. Well her dad was in the doorway asking what was wrong and she tells him that I body slammed her to the ground which was not true. She claims she wanted my attention and her emotions always get the best of her when she is drinking. So anyway, her dad starts yelling at me saying all these things like next time I touch her he is gonna beat my ass and all this stuff making me out to be some abusive boyfriend. At this point I am looking him straight in the eyes saying ""I hear you"" ""I understand"" and we are both raising our voices. He then threatens me by saying ""I will go to your house and slap your mother"" this obviously pisses me off and I go on to say ""no the fuck you won't"" etc. next thing I know I'm hit the eye and we are wrestling around in the kitchen. He has me by the hair and is beating me in the side of the head while my gf is trying to break it up and he won't stop. He was also drinking. I can't even say if I hit him or not but I was just trying to defend myself. I eventually get up and say ""you got me, you win"" he calls me a piece of shit and I start packing all our things to leave. Later I find out he told my gf ( his daughter) fuck you and he pushed her out the door and when he did he ended up clipping her on the chin with his first. At this point I have no idea what I should do, I have a huge black eye, bruises over my head and my nose was bleeding. I have pictures of everything after it happened."	Yes
Hi all,  I located in Iowa, am a young adult and will finish college in December.   I am coming to accept that I will not be able to flee the state after graduation. In short, I do not believe my father and mother are capable of caring for my slightly younger brother with Asperger Syndrome. They failed to do basically anything at all until he turned 18, are too immature themselves and essentially throw tantrums in response to his tantrums, provide little structure in his life and my mother has this idea now that antidepressants will magically make my brother a functioning person.  I think my brothers social abilities have decreased and his anger has increased since he finished high school (he was pushed through with the help of an assistant and my parents basically doing his homework for him) and his social interaction has been more limited to our parents.  He currently lives at home, is over the age of 18 and no one has anytime of legal guardianship over him or his affairs. He is also not enrolled in medicaid, though he does have health insurance through my parents until the age of 26.   I think that for his well being it is necessary we get legal guardianship over him and have him enrolled in medicaid. Ideally, I think it would be best that I have guardianship over him as my parents have a track record of not being fit to address his needs (we have NO extended family). But, I will not make a lot (if any) money out of college, especially if I stay in this state, and I myself may depend on my parents, who have some money, to live. My goal would be to get him behavioral and life skill therapy and into an assisted living situation.. whether in this state or in another state that has better options.   I am willing to dedicate a few years of my life to this task, but I don't know if its even possible, and I can't afford a lawyer. Please if you have answers or resources on applying for guardianship and medicaid, let me know! Also, if you have any advice on convincing a judge that I am the most fit person to care for him, help!	Yes
My boyfriend and I are planning on getting married since he has pcs orders for Hawaii. We currently live in New York. My son's father does pay child support but refuses to have anything to do with him. My daughter's father is currently in New Hampshire, doesn't pay child support, and hasn't made an effort to be in her life. I never bothered to get any kind of custody arrangement due to their lack of interest in their children. I guess I'm just looking for advice on what my best option is so neither father can come back and say I took their child away!	Yes
Hi everyone   Basically my Mom finally had her mediation meeting with her ex-husband and their lawyers. They've been married for about 3 years prior.   In a battle for spousal support, his lawyer told my Mom that since he hasn't filed taxes for 2014-2017 and owes back taxes from before that, that she's legally accountable for half of it. So instead of having the IRS come after her, they'll opt to give her 0 spousal support.   My Mom's lawyer argued back, stating my Mom **NEEDS** some form of support, so they agreed upon $800 a month for 6 months.   Is this all we can really pull? Is this really how the law works? My Mom marries a new man and finds out he never filed his taxes during the divorce, so therefore she'll be screwed over because of his mistakes?	Yes
I have a summons for divorce and I noticed that my ex's name is spelt wrong. Does that mess it all up?	Yes
I am a recovering alcoholic. my son was taken into CPS custody because of an ongoing case where¬† my ex calling cps on me and me on him.. we were a couple of selfish, short sited, idiots.  ¬†Its been a year im recovering. Ive done class after class, PARENTING, IOP&amp; SOP, MRT, AA, CHOOSING HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS, PERSONAL THERAPY. I see my son once a week for one hour. Ive never had a failed drug test or missed a visit with my son. I am a happily sober person. I never thought I would be here. I have a great apartment a support system and a Job that i love.   Before my son was taken I want to be clear he was not abused nor neglected . He has never missed a doctors appointment or a dental appointment. He was actually spoiled with love and attention. I love my son and I would never hurt him. I needed to learn coping skills regarding stress and anxiety and i believe i have after a year of intensive therapy.  I am even¬† grateful to have had this. experience. I didnt realize that my life was unmanageable in every way. I feel like im on solid ground for the first time in my life. I was homeless as a youth due to my abusive addict bipolar mother.   The problem.  ¬†My appointed Attorney is bullying me to give PMC (permanent managing conservative) to his paternal grandparents. She herself said no one is going to take all of my rights.. then she does mental gymnastics and tells me that If i bring this case and the judge hears all the bad testimony ill lose him and if I have other kids they will be taken immediately at birth. Im of the opinion that yes... of course I fucked up to get my self in this situation. The judge is not going in there expecting to present me with mother of the year award. She is going to examine the evidence and decide of im capable? (I think) My lawyer wont talk about it. She is only interested in having me sign tge agreement. Its my opinion they wouldnt make things up if there case was good enough without the lies! right?   ¬†Im having a hard time with their lies. The DA&amp;CPS.   1. They have 50 ppl lined up to bad mouth me to tge judge.   2. A person at the Doctor's office that I go to for antidepressants has made a claim that i was walking up and asking other ppl what they take  3. they said 2 of my sons drivers are going to testify that i followed them...   1.Day one of the trial they only had 5 ppl show up.. My lawer said they dont need 50 ppl to win.  2. I went to my dr appointment one of the nurses was shocked to hear what they claimed. he scoward my records and said no one has made any such claim.  3. I hope they do put the drivers on the stand my google maps tracks my every move. To be clear I NEVER entertained the idea of following them..   I feel like they are all corrupt. Especially my Attorney.  On the day of meditation, I spent 8 hours refusing to sign most of my rights away with intense pressure from my attorney and the mediator. I stood my ground and refuse to sign over my rights.¬† This is when the DA said they were ready to call 50 people to testify against me.¬†¬† That one really scared me. I almost signed the custody orders, until I asked to see the list... it was a joke! 75% were people I've never met, for example the arresting officer who was called to a domestic dispute between my ex and his girlfriend another example was a group leader of a class my ex took  At the end of mediation My lawyer was furious that I wouldnt sign. She said that was the best offer i could hope for and she asked me 20x if im good with having all of my rights taken away because if we go to trial that is what will happen...   I agreed to continued negotiations via email. I was asked to sign again after a step up to 8 hours of supervised a month after 6 mos. I told attorney that I could not sign. She said she was speechless.. and she immediately sent an email to a friend of mine to gain an allie in putting pressure on me.   I want to fire my attorney but how.? Least trial date began and ended with me saying my name on the record.. We go back in 10 days ig i ask for a new lawyer they will likely deny my request and and claim i am only trying to prolong the inevitable.   Honestly..  I feel like they all got together and agreed to just bully and lie until I gave up.  Can anyone give me dome insight as to why this is happening and how do i protect myself and my son from being torn apart?   TLDR Appointed Attorney is bullying me into signing most of my rights away. The DA, CPS and my own Attorny are threatening me with fabricated stories that I have been able to conclusively prove otherwise.	Yes
Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old. My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.  I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.  My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.  This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.  I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!	Yes
I am one week from moving to a new state and out of nowhere my wife wants a divorce. We have a toddler aged daughter. She had been the one pleading for the move. Ive already quit my current job, and cannot get it back. I have no option financially but to take this job. The job pays significantly more than what I am making now. I am freaking out, if i leave the state, am i giving up all the rights to my daughter? She is hounding me now about rescinding our notice and allowing her to stay in the house we are renting. I am in shock right now. She locked me out of the house with no access to a car. I am worried ill never see my daughter again.  I am contacting lawyers and getting answering services. Hoping one gets back to me soon. Just hoping someone could give me some guidance here. I am completely stuck.	Yes
**Background:** I am a 27 year old female. I have been with my now ex boyfriend for about 6 years. I was a stay at home mom to his special needs child from another marriage for about 4 of thous years. Very unexpectedly 4 days ago he decided that when he returned from deployment we would no longer be together. Since then I made a post on /r/personal finance discussing my financial status and asking for advice on how to get on my own two feet again. Many responses urged me to seek legal advice and try to get my ex boyfriend to pay me more than what he is offering me. **I do not wish to take him to court. I am happy with what he is offering.** However, due to the nature of him being deployed and me still living in his home until he returns I am seeking advice on how to cover my ass legally so to speak.   **Details:**    - Location: Virginia Beach, VA    - He and his ex wife and her new husband are all active duty Navy     - He bought the home himself I am not legally tied to it in any way    - The only account of his that my name is on is our cell phone bill, and I have a solid plan on how to exit that smoothly    - He has offered to let me stay in the house until he returns from deployment in September    - Neither one of us are petty, spiteful, nor hateful people- but shit happens and we are trying to deal with it maturely     - There has been no talk of taking legal action and I don't think there will be but I'd rather be protected rather than naive     - Due to a job offer I may be out of the house sooner than he would like (by about 4-6 weeks depending on his return date) and will find proper temporary housing for our.. well now his dog.      - If at all possible I would like to never have to see him face to face again.    **My Current Plan**    - Make an itemized list of what I am taking from the house    - Have a witness present when I remove items from the house    - Have witness do a walk through of the condition of the house     - record walk through on video and send it to him before he returns    - ask his ex wife to take the dog temporarily until he returns    - discuss prior to me leaving landscaping plans with my ex       - I will surrender the keys to his ex wife with his written permission. **My Questions**    - Will the ex wife be a reliable choice as a witness or do I require someone less bias (she loves me and has a healthy amount of hate for him)? Or should I ask the next door neighbor? (we're not close and sharing something so personal with him seems very odd but he is someone we both would trust to stay impartial)    - speaking of written proof, do emails and facebook messages count?    -  is there anything else I should be thinking of to make sure I am protected in this situation?    **THANK YOU** Thank you so much for your advice, help, and support in advance.	Yes
Greetings,  Long story short. I was in an abusive relationship for over 15 years - myself and my children escaped from it - my soon to be ex husband lives in the US. Despite some foolishness by him and his lawyer, the divorce was granted just over a week ago, on the grounds that I contact Relationships Australia, so they can mediate more contact between him and our five children. I had to do so with 14 days of the court ruling. I did so the following Monday and I have an appointment on August 15th.  Two days ago, after I let him know that our children were ready to talk to him, he told me via text that if I didn't directly negotiate with him and send him something in writing before August 4th, 2017, he will be appealing the divorce. This is despite the fact that I have fulfilled the court's requirements.  As far as I know, as I am self representing due to financial constraints, I do not legally have to negotiate outside of the agency nominated by the courts. Nor am I legally required to agree to anything or put anything into writing before August 4th - this is just day 14 from the last court date.  I want to know if there is anything else I can do to stop this? Even talking to this man is a huge trigger for me - anxiety, nightmares, fear. I am going to start seeing a DV counsellor here soon because of the issues he is causing.  FYI: There were never any FVO charges filed because I was in socially and financially isolated in the US. He told me, and I believed at the time, that if I charged him, he would be fired by his employer and it would be my fault that our children would be homeless and destitute. Wrong in hindsight, but very real in that instance.  I also have several family members and friends writing affidavits and statutory declarations concerning what they witnessed etc.  I just want to know if there is anything legally I can do - NOW. To be proactive.  Thank you so much.	Yes
Just need clarification on what counts as educational expenses for a child in Missouri. Is it strictly for college/secondary education (Tuition, room and board, books, etc)? I have a child going into elementary school and he is now required to have a laptop. I would like to be able to have this bill shared between myself and the ex.  Need some guidance on what exactly the education expense entails.  Thank you.	Yes
"A little over a year ago my sister had her daughter (rightfully) taken away. A year later she had her daughter back for a home trial, and then got busted drinking and got arrested. The little girl is back in foster care, the same family she was with for almost a year.  Social Services is filing for permanency.    Through this whole process me and our mother have been trying to get information about how to be considered for taking care of the little girl. She is now 3 years old.  A month and a half ago I had a conversation with my sisters social worker who told me ""I shouldn't be telling you this but there are questions as to your mothers mental health"", and then asked me if I wanted to be considered an option for the little girl to live with and I said yes. She said she would send me paper work.     That night she left me a voicemail telling me ""we have no indication your mother has been ruled out as an option, in fact I don't have any indication that she's ever made herself known as wanting to be considered for taking care of Little Girl.""    My mom had social workers interview her at her home, she's constantly been asking for the paperwork she needs to fill out (She filled it out once and the County office claims they lost it.)   A few weeks ago Social Worker found out that all my phone calls are recorded, and told me to speak with her supervisor from now on instead of her.  I've since tried calling Social Workers Supervisor to ask about how to get the paperwork I need, no response.   My sister was served today. She has a Permanency hearing on Monday.  I texted Social worker and said that I was checking in about the paperwork she said she would send me a month ago. She then texted back and said ""I had to wait until the permanency petition was completed. I will be sending out letters hopefully this week.""   My concern is that this process is being pushed along because she wants the foster parents to get custody of Little Girl. They are great couple, but MN State Law as far as I know places a stress on the requirement to give special consideration to FAMILY first. And that doesn't seem to be the case. I'm suspicious that it's because one of the foster parents is her Coworker.  (they are both social workers for the county.)   I have: - Audio recordings of her making (seemingly unfounded) statements that there are ""Questions to my mothers mental health.""  - Audio recording of her telling me that my sisters previous case worker ""wasn't very good"" about keeping records.  - She also said that she hasn't really looked at any records that may have been kept because 'Up until now I haven't had any reason to.""  - There apparently doesn't need to be any record/proof that they made any effort to contact any family members whatsoever - She left me a voicemail telling me that she has ""no indication"" that my mother ever wanted to be considered as a placement option - I have the text from her saying that she couldn't send me the appropriate paperwork until the petition was complete   I've been trying to read up on everything but I can't comprehend fully if these are actual violations of her job, or if I am just biased in interpreting things.   Any help is so greatly appreciated!"	Yes
I need some help with my abusive family and have no idea where to start on my massive list of questions, problems and concerns.  A little about me: I'm 16 and live on a small farm in Alaska, I immigrated to the US with my mother when I was 6 and have been here ever since.  My mother re-married someone in the US but my legal and biological father is in Europe. And my moms husband has not adopted me legally. I get verbally abused everyday and physically at least once a week. I have no real bruises I can show to prove of the physical abuse as it mostly consists  of pinning me to the floor and choking me while yelling at me about how worthless I am.  They are very far-right so any physiatrists or any mental health checkups are out of the question as last time I asked I was grounded for a week.  Here is my list of questions and concerns.  1. All I have is a green card and I'm not legally adopted by my father so I don't know if I will be deported back to Ukraine to my bio father who I haven't spoken to in 10 years if I run away.   2. I've heard of some law regarding living in the US and at a certain age being automatically legible for citizenship.   3. They force me to work at a small gift shop they run for no pay and without a work permit, which I know is illegal as they are not present with me at the shop and I work up to 60hrs a week.  4. I have a medium size dog who is the only reason I'm still alive as I got him during a very suicidal period in my life. If I loose him I will most likely fall right back into that pit. So I will need some suggestions about keeping him with me.  5. They homeschool me so I have very few friends and no access to a school counselor of any kind.   6. I have not penny to my name.   The only thing that's been holding me back from going to the police is my lack of knowledge about the US immigration system and my precious dog.   Please advise me as to what I should do to get out of this nightmare. Thanks :)	Yes
This crap is so confusing. I'm sorry for the long winded stuff.  In the final hearing, the judge granted that her ex husband can have the internal PC components he wants by a third party. This was granted because there is no faith that he will not damage the computer and claim no knowledge. His brother is under his guise and affiliated and related to him. Is he a true third party or is this stoppable?	Yes
Thanks for reading. I am a 22 year old child of two parents whom divorced when I was 2. My father never paid my mother child support, and when my mother tried to petition for some, he denied paternity. Anyway, he never paid a dime of child support. Is it possible to sue him for back child support? He lives in GA now. I have honest motives for wanting to sue as he has caused serious financial impediments to my life recently. Thank you!	Yes
So, I am dealing with a wife who is emotionally and physically abusive towards me. She will start yelling about a very minor issue and it can quickly turn to her breaking things, assaulting me, and destroying our personal property. She has gone as far as threatening to kill me at times. Once, it was over me telling her that we had to wait a couple days until I got paid to buy her some new make-up.  If I divorce my wife of less than three years, what generally happens as far as paying her any kind of support? I work and bring in our primary source of income. She receives a little bit of Social Security Disability every month for mental health issues (schizophrenia, paranoia, anxiety, and depression). We have no children together, but she has a twenty year old daughter who has never lived with us. My was previously married for 20 years. This is my first marriage. There is a considerable age gap between us. I am 26 and she is 43. We live in an apartment, have two older vehicles with no payments on them, but we are $18,000 in debt. I have no problem taking on the debt to avoid spousal support.  Is it okay for me to set up a hidden camera in the living room of our apartment that can record video and audio? I want to do this for a couple of reasons. First, I want to be able to press charges if she physically attacks me again and because of the way males are treated differently in domestic violence investigations, I want to have clear cut proof of innocence. Second, a personal protection order seems in order if I can document her threatening my life again. Basically, I need evidence for legal purposes. If I can set up the camera, would I have to tell her about the camera?  Disclaimer: I am not asking these questions to avoid a lawyer or chicken out of a divorce if it looks rough. Rather, I ask them because I want an honest opinion from someone who isn't trying to sell me their services. This will better help me prepare myself financially and mentally.   Extra details: I need to do this, and I know it will hurt, but it has to be done. She has refused all attempts to address the issues as a couple. She even shot down marriage counseling, which is provided completely free by my health insurance. No matter what she does or destroys, it's always my fault according to her. I will feel guilty for kicking her to the curb so to speak, but she refuses to get help. I cannot even spend time with friends or family unless I sneak out to see them because she will lash out at them for seemingly no reason as well. This is not at all healthy. 70% of the time, she is a good wife. Cooks, cleans, and takes care of everything at home. The other 30% is toxic. The problem is, you never know what will make her blow up and when it will happen.	Yes
My stepfather left me money in his will. My mom wants me to sign off the money to her as terms of her agreement with closing the estate and getting essentially paid off.   I'm not sure that I want to sign it over to her. He wanted me to have it... Looking for some legal advice on what my options may be?	Yes
I was born as a 2nd child in china when the 1 child policy was still in effect. I became an american citizen in 2016.(Seattle, WA).  My parents changed my birthday when i was born so there wouldn't be any legal consequences. The only correct birthday is on my Chinese birth certificate. Is there a way i can legally get my birthday corrected? What would be my first course of action?	Yes
This is gonna be a doozy.  I just became married on New Years. My wife had started working at a cell phone store to help with the bills. We have two girls. I have a step daughter from her previous marriage and a daughter of my own.  Things had been getting weird ever since an old friend came back from the Army and ended up getting a job at the same store.  All of her paychecks would go missing and she always had the craziest stories for instance: someone took her debit card at work and had been stealing money.  Fast forward and I just flat out ask her where all of her money has been going and why she was always acting weird. She finally admits to needing rehab. She and some of her coworkers had become addicted to pain pills and when she couldn't get pain pills she and her manager would shoot up with heroin.   I stick around to help her get sober a month goes by and things are still weird.  My friend/her coworker is also around a lot saying he just wants to help us through these times.  Out of nowhere I get pictures of them together (hes naked and kissing on her) and screenshots that were taken on her phone between my wife and my friend's messages talking about how they planned on getting married once she left me, how much they love each other, etc. These all came from a third party who ended up just being jealous because my wife wasn't sleeping with him instead.   This had apparently all started back in March.   I have friends saying I should fight for custody of my daughter, that I should get an EPO, and here she is saying she's done, admitting her mistakes and asking to move back in tomorrow night.   What legal routes can or should I take?	Yes
I got married on July 2nd. We are a same-sex couple, and so instead of assuming names or hyphenating, we want to create a new last name that combines our two names into one. This is possible within Canada, and we plan on doing so, but this does change my wife's birth certificate, so it's permanent rather than an assumed name.  As a permanent resident in Canada, I am not sure how this will apply to my information in the US. I am a US citizen with a valid US passport.  I know that I need to apply for a new passport - will they accept the Canadian name change form? Do I need to get my name changed on everything in the US as well? I obviously have SS in addition to a student loan account and a bank account, but that's about it. I've been living in Canada for 5 years now, so there isn't much left in the US in my name. I will also be selling my car before we are able to complete the name change officially, so no need to worry there (the title), and I have a Canadian driver's license (already forfeited my US one).  Any advice or information would be appreciated.	Yes
Over the past couple of years my husband and I have decided that basically our relationship isn't enough for us and we don't anticipate staying together for too much longer. We've both been dating but it hasn't gone anywhere with anyone and we don't currently have dating partners. However, we also both want a kid. We're debating doing a co-parenting thing, where we have a kid soon, stay living together for the first few years, and then dating other people again. I got my fertility checked recently and was told I needed to have a baby basically now or it wasn't happening naturally/with treatment. Given my history it's going to be impossible for me to get into a romantic relationship within the time it'll take to have a kid biologically, plus my husband and I really like each other platonically and would be good co-parents. Frankly, it seems like this could be good for a kid as they would have two invested parents who would live close by and who both make enough money to live a comfortable life, and it seems loads better than a lot of children of divorce go through. I know a lot of middle class women are supposed to say they'd rather not have a kid than raise it alone, but we'd split custody, and frankly having a few days off a week from the kid sounds fantastic. So redditors, what practical and legal things do we need to think about?	Yes
I have sole physical custody. We have joint legal custody. He was ordered to provide health insurance and relatively low weekly payment.   First he was fired from a job he has had for quite a while. The reason, failed drug test.  Next, he gets a new job but doesn't keep it long because he doesn't like it. He quits.  Now, I'm a defendant. He is requesting a reduction to support due to his income change.  He did not tell me he was fired. I figured it out when the payments stopped for several weeks and all of a sudden my kid didn't have insurance.   The IRS and the court have the basic info on his employment but it doesn't tell them the reason he lost the job. Doesn't even say if he quit or was fired.   Any advice on how to fight this? I don't see why he should be allowed to choose to do drugs/not work and get rewarded with a reduction.	Yes
My ex-wife and I are on decent terms during and after the divorce. I claimed my jeep and she claimed her car in the divorce, the car happens to be the only joint loan we ever had together and she has told me numerous times that she'll refinance but it's been 6 months with no luck.   Question: can I take her to court over this matter? She assumed all responsibilities of this vehicle but hasn't fulfilled her obligation. I have written messages saying she would do this but has failed to uphold her word.   I'm currently deployed to Iraq and won't be home until September so I'm a little helpless right now. Any advice would be great, thank you!	Yes
My wife has 2 kids from her ex-husband who has custody since they divorced. We have 2 kids from me and my wife. My wife has been unemployed for the last 4 years and is a stay at home mom. I am military and our lifestyle is much more significant and beneficial for my step kids. Her ex-husband recently remarried and is trying to modify the order for more child support among other things that would impact our life for us and our 2 kids. I pay my wife's child support because she doesn't work and has a low education. Her income is imputed. I cannot afford the modifications he's asking for and any job my wife could get has the same effect since we would need child care.  What I want to know is there any chance we could pursue a change of custody especially if our lifestyle would be better for the kids, and they would grow up with their half siblings among many other beneficial opportunities he can't provide?	Yes
"Hello, I recently turned 18 and a friend and I were participating in a competition where one of the categories was ""best kept secret"". We decided to get married for this, as a joke, despite never being in any sort of physical or romantic relationship. I soon realized my mistake and I want to get a divorce, or ideally an annulment. How complicated would this be? Both parties are mutally seeking the divorce and we have no assets or anything to divide between us, we just want this to go away.  I am aware of how stupid this was so spare the lecture, I'm just seeking legal advice. Please note I live in/the marriage took place in New Jersey. It was a civil wedding, done in my towns village hall."	Yes
"Now that we have just applied for my wife‚Äôs 10-year green card I suspect she may file for divorce. The ~3 marriage has struggled, due largely to factors stemming from unemployment (at times *both* of us have been unemployed). Finally and thankfully, we both have good jobs now, though they are in different states (I am in CA, where we married, she is in NY) so it‚Äôs now a long-distance marriage. I love her but I think she has checked out and I have to agree that with our new jobs if there were ever a time for a ""fresh start,"" now is it. If she files, I anticipate a ""peaceful"" separation. There's no rancor between us and not much to divide up--no kids, few assets, just a few thousand $ in the bank. If she took everything in the bank it would just be an inconvenience, really.    However, if there is one thing I have learned from this sub it‚Äôs that relying on the goodwill of an ex-spouse is asking for a disaster, and I wonder if I should be on-guard for something? For instance, could she somehow come after my future wages? Also, during one particularly difficult stretch, my parents gave us some financial support, can she go after them somehow? I think it impossible she would ever attempt such a thing even if she had recourse, but really sad things are reported on this sub every day.    One last thing: If I've accepted the inevitability of divorce, why don't I just file for it myself and get it over with? One is that I do hope this marriage might rebound and her family is emphatically behind me. Another is that I want to put all my energy into my new job and don‚Äôt anticipate acquiring much in savings or significant assets this year, I personally would prefer to defer the divorce until it has to happen.    Thanks and blessings.    TL/DR. I feel divorce is inevitable. Can I just wait for it to happen or is it urgent that I pre-emotively lawyer-up?"	Yes
I am only asking for informational purpose as I was curious whether it rests with the father or the mother (paternity established, and they share custody). I also want to know if different states have different laws regarding naming the child.	Yes
So I have 2 legal godparents who are in my biological parents' wills (signed by both parties and everything). My parents' divorce is getting messy and my mom is so mentally unstable that she is starting to make things up to make my father look bad. She kicked him out of the house and told us a bunch of BS. (Even before she's known to be a manipulative and compulsive liar.)   I don't want to live with her because I legitimately fear for her sanity and at this point my own. I can't live with this much stress and tension. I can't do it. And my father will have to work all the time (it's not unusual for him to work 12 days in a row.) and I don't want to add any more stress to him than he already has.   I'm 17 but for the time being before I turn 18 next year would it be possible for me to live with my godparents instead? Please help. Any advice is needed. 	Yes
I'm in Colorado. My ex and I have a parenting plan in place for my son that says I will claim him on taxes since my ex only has him on weekends. This was placed in 2011. Now all the sudden he would like to start claiming him on his taxes for the child tax credit. I said no and at first he said we need to go to mediation. Tonight I received a text from him saying I need to sign the document to allow him to claim my son on his taxes and if I choose to go to mediation he will tell the courts I'm committing fraud (which is bullshit). Is this extortion?	Yes
Does it only change when one partner moves out?   We are going to be living in the same home at least another year for our child and for financial reasons. 	Yes
"Thank you in advance for your help and time it means the world to me.   I'd like to add that I currently have an attorney and I'm seeking for further assistance in enlightening me on what can be done and what I should ask from my attorney to do that may help us in the case.  I opened a case with the attorney general in regards to my ex girlfriend having no existence in co-parenting with me. I'd tried numerous times to make communication with her and to meet and discus about our child to no avail. In addition that request included extended visitation so that I can bond more with my son. I requested as well telecommunication to be enforced so that I can be in touch with my son as my ex had prohibited from me and my son.   I was granted the rights to communicate with my son electronically daily, and the judge set temporary orders which included the rights to use a third party app called ""TalkingParents"" which would help me with co-parenting with my ex. Extended visitation rights are pending until our next court which my attorney believes should be granted.   However and this is my problems. The day after our court and being awarded the following things mentioned I texted her if she could download the application and provide me with her code so that we can link our devices to converse if the need would arise. In which she neglected again and she states she never received any paper work saying she needed to do that. In which I'm thinking to myself well WTF the judge literally told you in front of your face that she needed to do that and they were part of the temporary orders. I just stayed silent and I'm fixing to go to my attorney to see what he says about that. However what can I do about this? It's costing me money to take her to court to co-partent with me and if she's not going to do it I'm just throwing my money away. Can I ask for attorney fees back? or what options can I do to put some heat on her.   Again community thank you and although I am aware that its best to communicate with my attorney I find he often asks me well what you want to do. And I'm here like well what can I do? Any help as to what to ask from my attorney is much appreciated guys. God Bless.  Location Texas"	Yes
So the girl I'm with takes birth control and the likelihood of pregnancy is very low. However, I do not want to risk a substantial part of my life if she gets pregnant and decides she wants to keep the baby and demands child support from me. I am only 19, in college, and have ambitions to make something of my life. These goals would be seriously hindered if she got pregnant and tried to fuck me over.  She has told me that if she ever got pregnant and wanted to keep the baby then she would not want to receive child support from me but these are just words and I do not know what would actually happen if the situation arose.  This is why I'm coming here. I would like to know what it would take to ensure that if she got pregnant that I would A) not have to pay child support since she has told me multiple times she would not want me to or B) ensure that the baby would be put up for adoption so that it can be taken care of by a family with better means to do so.  I appreciate any responses ahead of time.  Thanks.	Yes
"I'm still not 100% sure on how this happened which is why I'm coming to you guys.  So a few years ago I started college as a freshman and got some student loans to help. My (abusive) father made me take out this ""parental loan"" or something like that for $15,000 to pay for school. I was 18 at the time and didn't really know the details, he basically took the loan out himself. Long story short, I ended my abusive relationship with him a year later and dropped out of school to deal with my mental health issues and lived with my mom for a while.  Fast forward to now: I'm trying to apply to another school and my old school is telling me that my transcripts are being withheld. Apparently my father cashed out the loan, took the money for himself, and didn't make any payments or inform me of what he did. (So technically I owed all of that money to the school now?) The school was sending him bills and and notices to pay and he was just ignoring them and not telling me about them. There was so many missed payments on the loan that it eventually went to a collection agency. Now they're telling me the only way to get my transcripts back is to pay back all of that money.  Is there any legal recourse I can take? I really don't know what to do right now.  Thanks for taking the time to read this."	Yes
I am only asking for informational purpose as I was curious whether it rests with the father or the mother (paternity established, and they share custody). I also understand that if mother and father are fighting wrt to naming the child they should probably not be having childre, but I'm asking this question from a purely academic point of view. I also want to know if different states have different laws regarding naming the child, or if there are some ridiculous laws in other states, feel free to chime in.	Yes
i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	Yes
"Not much info beyond the title. There is a history of violence in the home. He is an unrepentant alcoholic and he claims he does not remember anything that happened.   Question is: What are the next steps? I doubt he can afford a lawyer though he likely makes too much for a court appointed attorney. I know the ""right answer"" is lawyer up but I need to know what to do in the meantime. I stopped by the jail but apparently I am not allowed see him. I **will not** bail him out or put up any money for him. I'm just trying to get info to pass on to my mother. I'd let him rot if it were up to me but she's freaking out so thought I'd get some general info to calm her down.   Thanks in advance. "	Yes
So, my dad has been doing this to my mom and now that her credit is shit he's using my (19 year old college student) credit to open cards. I can't complain because he does pay off my credit cards and hes paying for a study abroad trip but honestly what the fuck? I just got a letter in the mail (my home address not uni address) one saying I was approved and there was a card for me and my dad in there (I ripped them up and threw them away) and the other saying I was denied.      I tried calling every customer service number I found but there was only a robot server, so I just ripped the cards up. The issue is he has my SSCN written down (he has all three of ours written down on all of our SS cards. For example mine has his and my moms, his has my moms and mine, my mom has mine and his)     I don't want to get in anything too legal but I don't want my credit to go to shit. Can I change my social security card number at all? (also would that require me to get a new passport?)	Yes
"My children were removed from my home last August after my husband¬†made a false report that got me arrested and released with no charges. The¬†DHS complaint¬†and arrest was for my husband alleging that I held him and the children hostage at gun point. However, my husband admitted to the DA, DHS, and PD¬†that he lied¬†about the incident. My husband was never arrested or investigated for filing a false report.   My husband (who I now have a restraining order against and am in the process of divorcing) failed his court ordered psych eval, and I passed my court ordered psych eval. In court two weeks ago, I was ruled the only viable parent by DHS.   DHS is refusing to give my children back unless I admit to criminal activity per the caseworker verbally telling me that repeatedly.   The children have been with my family since last August. My family doesn't support me (except for my father) due to the caseworker telling them that DHS knows for a fact¬†that I committed a gun crime.   I have no mental health diagnoses (a psychologist certified it), I have no substance abuse issues (random UA and medical records proved it), I have a clean background (I have never been charged with a crime, and I have never been arrested before my husband made his allegations), I have a clean, safe, and stable home (DHS and service providers have been there to prove it), I have a job (I am capable of providing for my children), I have been engaged in every service recommended by DHS without hesitation, and I have completed the Action Plan created by DHS (except for the 32 week domestic violence course which I have 22 weeks left).  My court appointed attorney will not defend me or advocate for me due to his stated reason of not wanting to make the caseworker get mad and quit her job (he blames me for making the last caseworker quit his job due to being scared of my husband). He has stated to a service provider, my father, and myself¬†that I made the last caseworker quit his job. My lawyer calls me needy, says that it's my fault that my husband stalked/beat me, and he has repeatedly¬†stated, ""It's not my job to explain the state's case against you. I don't know the case, it's complicated."" He has been my lawyer for almost a year.   A few days ago, the caseworker told my lawyer that I sent my parents hostile e-mails after court which proved that I was an unsafe and unstable parent. I never sent them e-mails, and I gave the caseworker and my lawyer¬†a statement provided by my father denying the caseworkers allegations. After I provided my father's statement, the caseworker has refused to communicate with me. My lawyer, a former prosecutor, is trying to get me to admit to sending the e-mails and has not commented on my father's statement denying the allegations. My lawyer will only say that he is waiting to get a copy of the e-mails (that don't exist) before he will comment about them.   The caseworker told my mother, brother, and sister in-law that it is their legal duty to report to her every time they learn that my father speaks to my lawyer. The caseworker also told my mother, brother, and sister in-law that my father has to legally give her the contents of private and privileged communication between my father, my lawyer, and myself. My family (my brother and sister in-law are the foster family and my mother lives with them to care for the children) has been pressuring my father to give them the communication between my father, my lawyer, and myself so that they can give it to the caseworker. My refusal and my father's refusal to give the caseworker private and privileged communication is being seen by DHS and my family¬†as me being an unsafe and unstable parent. My lawyer refuses to comment or intervene on my behalf regarding this matter (he also refuses to comment or intervene on most things).  DHS is threatening to adopt out my children per my lawyer and my family.   TLDR; My lawyer won't put me in front of a judge so that I can fire him. I'm drowning due to not having competent representation."	Yes
"I have my court date set for this Monday against my ex (the defendant/respondent) to set ""parental responsibilities"" (I.e. Custody) over our two year old daughter. I'm asking the court for full decision making powers, as well as for her to live with me, and have her mother see her every other weekend, as well as a weekly, non-overnight visit.  She currently resides with her mother. I work full time, she works part time. It has been my family that has taken care of my daughter when we are both at work, where she also spends time with her cousins that are around her age. There has been some neglect on the mother's side for her care, such as not packing supplies in the diaper bag, not bathing her for days or even up to a week, not changing her diaper and bringing her with a bad diaper rash.. etc.   I'm looking for advice as to how I should prepare myself for this hearing. I've never dealt with anything like this, so I'm a bit unfamiliar with the process. I've talked to an attorney and they believe I have a strong case, but I'm just looking for further advice as to how I should structure my arguments and what I should focus on during my testimony, as well as resources that will aid me such as evidence, affidavits, witnesses, and such.   Thank you for your help."	Yes
Hello /r/legal advice, I am an emancipated minor in the state of California. I had my hearing in June and the judge granted my petition - I have all of my legal documentation. I also have a passport card I got when I was 14. I'm visiting my godmother in San Diego and I'm thinking of spending a day in Tijuana. Will being 17 but emancipated pose an issue?	Yes
I am engaged to a prisoner who is being held at a detention center in Maryland. He is currently awaiting trial. For a number of reasons, we would like to be married as soon as possible.  I do have an appointment with a lawyer of my own later this week but wanted to see if anyone could advise if our plans would result in a valid marriage.  I have gotten a family member ordained online already. Our plan is for me to pick up the marriage license, and after the 2 day waiting period, have the ordained family member pronounce us married during a visit.  Would this wedding be considered valid? There is a chapel and he can put in a request, but we prefer to do this as outlined above.  Thanks for any insight you can offer.	Yes
So we both live in California, he's been separated for 5 years no but his divorce isn't finalized. Well our baby is due soon and we aren't sure if he can be put on the birth certificate seeing as he is still legally married. Would it be better for us to wait till it is finalized? Or can he get in trouble if we put him on the birth certificate?	Yes
"My mom has chronic pain with arthritis, osteoporosis, and 3 herniated discs. 2 weeks ago my mom had a compound fracture and had to get rods and screws inside her leg. When my mom get another perscription from the hospital she asked my grandma to hold on to it and give it tp her when she needs, but as my title says she has been giving it to her when she only thinks she needs it. It says one every six hours and the doctor said to double up  while she is healing if she feels she needs to. Well my grandmother being the over controlling person she is has gone full dictator over her medicine and sometimes my mom will be crying in pain and she wont give it to her. Some days she would only give her two a day saying ""you dont need this medicine all the time"" acting like she doesnt even have a broken leg or all these chronic pain problems she did before. She will certainly not let her double up like the doctor ssid she could. So needless to say when my mom got her refill on saturday she was not going to let my grandmother have her perscription again because of her constant negligence. Well my grandma gave her an ultimatum. Either give her the medicine or she would have to find somewhere else to live which is completely ridiculous. My mom. Cant work and is basically bed ridden most days because on top of the chronic pain she for one has the broken leg and two she has addisons disease with all kinds of other problems which basically keeps her from work. So what can we do about this? She made a deal with her the first time i understand i figured that might play a roll but she definitley did not want her having this refill and considering its a schedule 2 drug i figured legally there is no way she would be able to keep this."	Yes
"My spouse and I are getting amicably divorced and own two houses. One is being used as a rental property that we intend to sell, with most of the proceeds going to her to cover her ""half"" of our assets. I am keeping the house we are living in.  She almost certainly cannot assume the mortgage on the property we intend to sell. I intend to assume the mortgage on our current house.  What should we add to our divorce decree to best protect ourselves?  * I would like to ensure the other property is sold so I'm relieved of the mortgage.  * She would like to ensure she is no longer liable for the mortgage on current house and gets most of the sale proceeds from the other house.  * I want her to quitclaim the current house.  * I also want to pay her from the sale of the house proceeds so that I don't have to liquidate other assets for her half.  I honestly don't expect any if this to really be an issue (we're still friendly and just want what is best and fair for us both.) We can probably do all of this without anything in the decree, but it seems like we should have something in place, just in case one of us loses their head."	Yes
Hey i'm looking for advice in regards to paying unnecessary child care in Alberta, Canada. I'm divorced and my ex wife refuses to apply for a child care subsidy. Over the last year iv'e been paying the bill out of pocket. I recently just got off the phone with the Government and they have said that she can qualify for subsidy yet she refuses to apply. Is there a way or a chance that i can get some of my money back whether it be through small claims court or through some other legal process?	Yes
Spouse and i are still technically married, nothing has been filed yet. (I plan to, can't afford it right now even with the reduced fees i was offered)  Spouse abandoned us and now lives in a different state halfway across the country and has pretty much left me with sole custody. Are there any legal hiccups that would prevent me from moving my child and i to a different state to be closer to my family?	Yes
My wife is mentally ill and is flipping back and forth between being a loving, caring wife to not speaking to me for weeks at a time. I am aware of her illness and I have been trying to take us both to counseling, however she refuses and sabotages my attempts.    We do not live together any longer, she is with her parents and I have my own place. I am employed (two jobs) and her main source of income comes from webcamming (nude/masturbation shows) and although she still makes a substantial bit of money she is refusing to move out of her parents house.  I want to gain sole custody of my 2 sons, yet I cannot afford a lawyer at this current time.	Yes
We've been dating for 5 years and we have talked about getting married so that I can move in with her and get a job in the U.S.  I've looked up the process of me getting a green card and we're pretty certain we're going to get married in the future so we've decided to have a low profile union (only telling very close friends and family).   I'm just wondering if I'll be okay to go down to the states as if I were visiting and marrying her then. If so what do I say at the border? Do I need to notify either government beforehand?   	Yes
Document - no. FDI-16-785520 Order to show cause regarding family centered case resolution   I got this in the mail last night due to mail fowarding. I cannot afford to go to California on Monday from my current state of Washington. I also have work on Monday. I'm scared of being thrown in jail if I do not appear. What can I do?    I only filed. My spouse was never served nor was any action taken beyond that initial filing.	Yes
"My fiance is by all means, still married legally, she and her ex have been seperated for about 4 years now.  We have been together for two of those.  We just had a child a few days ago and found out that her ""husband"" is considered the father, what can I do to prove my paternity?"	Yes
"I'm currently looking to change my name, and am unsure where to apply for a name change. If I want my degree to have my preferred name, I need to change my legal name as soon as possible.  My permanent address is in Illinois, where I grew up, but I go to college for a significant amount of the year in Utah. My driver's license is an Illinois license, if that is relevant.  Utah reports that I must ""Live in the county where the name change petition will be filed for at least one year before filing."" [Illinois](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/name_change/Name_Change_Suite_Approved.pdf) reports that I must ""Have lived in Illinois for at least 6 months"".  A big worry here is the wording. I lived in Illinois for most of my life, and I have been at college at Utah for more than a year. However, I haven't lived in Illinois for a contiguous six months recently. I have lived in Utah for more than one year total, but have not ever lived there for a contiguous year.  I'm not worried about court filing fees, but the logistics of court dates aligning worries me about filing in Illinois.  What would be my best course of action? Am I eligible to change my name in Utah? Should I change it there or stay with Illinois? Is there an advantage to having a court order in one versus the other? I will be in Illinois for a short time in a few weeks, where I could do any sort of court visits, and then court visits for Thanksgiving, etc. are definitely possible. I will also be in Utah for most of the upcoming semester."	Yes
Background: partner and her ex split up five years ago with a one year old daughter. My partner's been the sole caregiver ever since. We've been together three years, and I think of her kid as a daughter to me, too. Her ex has a new partner, and a new kid with her. He's hit his new partner at least once, and  I think been charged for it, though I'm not 100% on that.  The ex is meant to pay child support (which is like, $70 a month or something, practically nothing, and he hasn't paid it in like six months anyway). I guess he doesn't want to do it any more, because recently he's been pushing my partner real hard for me to adopt their daughter. We've been interested in getting guardianship, but adoption will mean (correct me if I'm wrong) that he ceases to have any obligations towards his kid, and as shitty as he might be, my partner and I both kinda feel like that's not really our call to make? We've talked about it and always figured we'd give her daughter a choice when she was old enough to actually comprehend the consequences.   When we told her ex this he didn't agree with this decision, and is now saying that he intends to sue for full custody of his daughter. She doesn't know him, has no relationship with him and hasn't seen him in years. He clearly wants no relationship with her and is just doing this to fuck with my partner, and I think it'll be really tough on her daughter to go through this. She knows she has a biological dad out there somewhere, but doesn't need to know its this fuckwit, at least at this age.  Is what he's doing legal? Isn't it kinda unethical for a lawyer to take on his case, given that he has no shot of winning and clearly doesn't even want the kid and is just doing it to be a dickhead? How should we respond to this?	Yes
Mom and i recently found out my father (divored) has been molesting my sisters but they hid it for years because they didnt want to lose their dad. We tried to report him but they sent cops and cps to our mom trying to charge her for it  because there's no proof against him. Also, my sisters said they found child porn on his phone but they didnt mention it to cops because they were telling them theyll go to a foster home.  How can we report him for that instead? My sisters dont see him no more	Yes
My wife and I are filing for divorce in Ohio.  It's very amicable.  We had agreed on all of the terms, however the lawyer just told me that what we had decided isn't properly equitable.  Neither of us really want to go back to negotiating and we are both very much in agreement about what how we want things divided.  Is there a way around this, or will the court effectively force us to distribute our assets differently than we desire?	Yes
I'm in NY and preparing for a divorce and have a quick question, since I haven't been to a lawyer yet and am trying to anticipate things in advance in order to make a rough plan.  We own a house but have only about $8000 in equity. We've decided the best option is for me to keep the house. I am assuming this means he will just owe me $8000 less (since I will be receiving half of his retirement funds, etc.) but he seems to think that the court will order half the cost of the entire house deducted from what he is supposed to pay me. (So, including all the money that we still owe the bank.) That doesn't seem right to me, I'm just curious if anybody could help me out with what to expect.	Yes
A close friend of mine (16y) lives at home and is dependent. She has severe depression and PTSD. Her parents refuse to see this as a mental condition and rather see it as a plea for attention or just simply a mindset. They also refuse to take her to see any sort of doctor, to be prescribed any medication, or even to allow therapy or counseling. My question is this: Is what her parents are doing illegal? Would it be considered neglect or abuse? Are there grounds for talking to a lawyer?  TL;DR Read it, darn you.	Yes
Allow me to explain the situation: I met and became friends with a trans woman online. She's caring, kind and is very motherly, a bit overweight and in her mid 30's. As I talked with her and got to know her, I began to learn more about her personal life and came to discover she's had quite a sad lot in life. She's married to trans man who is at best neglectful and unloving, at worst physically and mentally abusive, mentioning to me having to cover up bruises from pinches and slaps. Apparently about 5 years ago, they had an agreement to have an open relationship, but only with members of the same sex (this was pre transition for both of them). He(she at the time) broke this agreement and had an affair with someone of the opposite sex and when confronted about it, they blamed her(him at the time) for it. Apparently ever since he's made her the scapegoat for all their personal and relationship problems. This has had a considerable tole on her, becoming extremely depressed and attempting suicide by over overdose at least once. She's mentioned multiple times that she see herself making it through the next few years. She's also in a very bad place financially, unable to afford a divorce or even the $700 fee to change her name and gender on her driver's license. Despite my urges to seek help with a therapist or psychiatrist or even just staying with her parents for a bit while she sorts things out, she always brushes them aside, apparently viewing herself as a lost cause or saying the didn't help in the past. Here's where my end of the problems come in. I'm a 19 y/o male who is currently unemployed and I live on the east coast of America, while she lives somewhere in Northern California (she told me the exact name of her town once, but I forgot it now. Something like Sherryville or Cherryville if anyone is more familiar with the California area). I'm also not sure she'll even take any advice or contact anyone or anything that I ask her too. I want desperately to help her somehow and it breaks my heart to even have to write this and recall some of the things she's been through. Please, please, I just need some advice.	Yes
Here goes.. So I'm currently going through a divorce and my soon to be ex wife went online with USPS and changed my address to my business address without my consent. I have a screenshot of the receipt of change from the USPS and she was the one who changed it 100%. The problem I'm running into now is USPS online will not let me change my address because it says it's registered as a business. So is there anything I can do to: 1. Legally take action against her for changing it. 2. Get this issue straightened out with the post office so I can change my address?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
Ex is self-employed. Ex has zero parenting time (his choice). The last time the amount was changed was over 9 years ago.  I requested a modification, and when he received the notice, he threatened to kidnap the kids away from me.   I am disabled, have zero income (other than the child support), and we are living in extreme poverty (3 people).   Since he said that I called up and cancelled the modification. I have no way to prove that he makes oodles of money; I know he fudged the numbers last time. He lives alone in a high-rent district; He travels frequently out-of-state and internationally; he lives in a very-high-income place;   I guess I'm afraid of him going in front of the judge and saying that since he has so much more money than i do that he is better able to provide for the kids and therefore they should be with him all the time.  Also One more question: Department of Revenue refuses to send the support to me when he sends it to them: I get the money as a lump sum, never in a consistent manner.   I know he sends the same amount, on a consistent basis, as i have witnessed this, and also multiple times when he went out of state he left the money orders with me to mail in for him once a week.   Can i get them to pass the money to me on a consistent basis? Because of their inconsistency I got a warning when I turned my rent in a few days late.	Yes
Hello.  I want to preface with this is not for me, but a friend, and just need some advice.   It is almost a nightly occurrence that they want to kill themselves because of their family. They have been through psychologists and everything, but their family isn't changing anything and keeps blaming them.   They are about to be 17, is there anything they can do to get out of the house before they are 18? It seems like if the family is the main reason they are struggling, there should be something to help.   Am I just being naive?  I appreciate any advice, please let me know if I need to clear anything up, I don't really know how else to say this.   Thank you all.	Yes
"Me and my partner are planning on getting married.  We are both men, and we both work at the same company. We are closed at work and very ""straight acting"". While we do not work at a ""Christian company"", we work in an environment were one family makes up the executive branch of the business and they are very, very, religious and very, very, conservative.          To the best of my knowledge, being LGBT is still not a protected class in the state of Michigan. Michigan is also an at will state.           If we were to marry, would we need to disclose partner information to the company?  I know that we would change our tax with holdings but I'm not entirely sure what that entails. We both have health care through the company individually so I don't need to add him to my plan.              It's kind of shitty that I can't just be happy about getting married without worrying about losing my job but it is what it is."	Yes
"Hi, I'm in the UK currently, and I'm 18 years old. My mum and dad had a really bad breakup.Me and my Dad are moving to Canada in a few weeks, and while my dad is in Canada looking for a house, I've been staying with my Mum. Long story short she let me borrow a laptop, and she left her Facebook logged in when I went to use it. I saw a message that mentioned my name so I used the search bar in the messages to find other messages mentioning me.   She mentioned to two separate people that she wants to 'Go buy some illegal drugs and stuff them in (dad's) suitcase.' Obviously intending to cause issues at the airport and stop us from flying, possibly even worse.   She also mentioned ""Someone left their keys here by accident... Must have had the wrong ones cut when I went to get a copy of our own house keys made"", implying that she purposely had a copy of my dads house key cut. She also says that she used this to find documents in my dads house that told her what part of the new city we will be living in, and where my dad will be working.  She explained to a friend how she was planning on putting a satellite tracker in my camera bag, talking about how its battery is good for 5 days, and how it is accurate to 5-15 meters.   IN this conversation she also mentions wanting to find where to get drugs to plant in my dads suitcase.   Other more minor things she talked about were an IP grabber to find our new IP and using this to find our new location, and giving me essential oils without me knowing to help me sleep. Obviously the oils are not as concerning as the other problems but still makes me uncomfortable.  Screenshots to see what I'm talking about:  http://i.imgur.com/IgGHwpe.png?2 Illegal key cutting, finding documents in my dads house leading to our new adress and his new workplace  http://i.imgur.com/ozSoLnx.png?3  Wanting to plant drugs in my Dads suitcase, the satellite tracker  http://i.imgur.com/ZtT4P6e.jpg?1  Another conversation where she mentions putting drugs in my dads bags  http://i.imgur.com/TClYiXv.png?1  Family friend telling her how to use grabify to get our new ip/find our location  Any help would be appreciated on what to do, is it possible to get a restraining order based on this? There are screenshots for proof in case she deletes the chat logs, she's also taken away the laptop and told me that I will have to find a place to stay until my dad is back and we move to Canada."	Yes
My daughter turns 18 in 5 months and has one year of high school left. She is severely mentally ill after being sexually abused by her bio dad for six years, and she has lived with me since January of 2016. Her bio dad is in jail awaiting sentencing.   She threw a coffee mug at me tonight as hard as she could because I asked her to pick up her belongings in the living room, she went to bed without doing it, and I immediately asked her to please get up and do it. When she did she was yelling at me the whole time, throwing things, etc. Long story short, we were arguing and she threw the mug at me. I covered my face, and it hit me in the ribs. She picked it up to throw it at me again, and I held her wrist and asked her to please put it down. She dug her nails into my arm before slamming it onto the table. She also broke a knitting needle in half and threatened to stab me in the neck with it.   After she went to her room I had my husband change the wifi password, and told her we would talk about it tomorrow. She decided to try to punish us by playing music really loudly, and when we told her we weren't going to let her use the wifi regardless she left. It was around 11:30pm at this time.   This is not the first time she has gotten violent with me. She also rescinded her consent to allow her therapist and doctors to speak with me, and she has not been to see her therapist in over a month. She won't allow me to have access to her meds, nor will she tell me what she is taking. She has broken our property, punched holes in the walls, broken the bathroom sink. I have had her hospitalized before. I should have called again tonight, but I'm just so exhausted with her. And I'm legit scared of her.   I suspect she went to her boyfriend's house. I was unable to call his father because she had her boyfriend block my phone number on his dad's phone. I was able to send him an email through the form on his business website just to give him a heads up.   I don't want her coming home without being able to communicate with her doctors and therapist at the bare mininum. Really at this point I would rather she not return home at all because she is completely uninterested in cooperating with me of following the house rules to even the barest degree. What are my options? I would like to still keep her safe as much as I can, but I don't feel safe with her living here anymore.	Yes
Ok so first off I would like to ask people to not leave rude comments.    So I was born in Texas and lived here my whole life and my boyfriend moved to Texas from Mexico illegally 9 years ago when he was 14 years old. It might be a few years until we get married but I was wondering how the whole marriage process works with an illegal immigrant.  I know there was an act passed by Obama that might protect him but as I did more reading he might be a year off from the date of being protected. I am mostly really worried about us trying to get the marriage license and the government deporting him. Will he have to go back to Mexico to get a K1 visa or can we just get married and begin filing for a green card? Any other advice or helpful comments on how this all works will be greatly appreciated. 	Yes
Do I change my name in the US via normal US channels and then present the paperwork to the British, or vice versa?  My dad changed my name via deed poll when I was around 12 due to mis-hyphenation of my last name on my British passport, but my name was not recorded in this incorrect manner on any of my American paperwork so no communication there was necessary.	Yes

"So I have this friend who is currently trying to undergo a divorce. He wanted to start now, but he has to have 1k up front. So it will be about two ish weeks. Well, assuming child support doesn't stack up against him.   Anyway, his soon to be ex is a sucky person. She is overdramatic and always tries to start problems. Throughout their thirteen year marriage, she would walk out or kick him out and always do something dramatic to try and get him to chase after her like they do in all the romcoms.   This last time was it for him. She slapped him in the face and he shoved her back and held her against the wall, telling her to never touch him again. He didn't slap her or hurt her in any way. He restrained her. So what does she do? Goes out and gets a restraining order against him and feigns ""domestic violence"" and deems him unsafe. She realized that was pushing it over the limit because not even hours after filing it, she tried dropping it.   Whether it was through text or messenger, she would spam message him appologies and threats intermittently, which I know is grounds for her not being able to get a restraining order later on. Well, ""protective order"" I think.  He is done with that nonsense. And this woman finally realized how good she had it before. She has a job, but it doesn't pay well. And pretty much the moment after she did this and they began the ""separation"" phase, she was demanding money. She wanted like, 1500 bucks per month in child support. (We used a chart and consulted a lawyer for the actual cost he should pay.) She dropped the order the following week as soon as she could and has been repeatedly begging and threatening him throughout the last three weeks now.   She is also wanting him to pay rent even though he doesn't live there, or she will take the kids away.   He doesn't have a problem helping his kids, but we know if he keeps helping her she is just going to make it worse for him. And she said that if they do a divorce, she will make it harder on him than necessary because she is vindictive. She wants to do a legal separation so that she can still have power over him.  We have logs of all the messenger conversations and texts between them as written record and he avoids speaking in person as long as possible. He is paying child support and is picking up his kids a couple times a week.   But he tries to keep minimal contact with her, even when she continues threatening him and saying questionable or incriminating things.  Should he continue speaking sparingly? Does he need to go ahead and pay all their bills? And what should be his course of action throughout this ordeal? Sorry if I'm missing details, I'm typing this on my phone while waiting on a game of Black Ops to queue up. I will add more later."	Yes
(Arizona, Phx/Tucson) Hi, r/legaladvice, I‚Äôm posting on behalf of my mom.¬† She‚Äôs been separated from my dad for nearly a year now, for various reasons including infidelity with a minor, and hoarding.¬† He‚Äôs paying child support on the child which was the result of the infidelity, and has accrued other various debts.¬† Anyway, he hasn‚Äôt paid rent on his house in long enough that he‚Äôs now getting evicted, and has found out today that his landlord (who gave him more than thirty days‚Äô notice) put the house on the market and has an offer pending on it already.¬† My question is this: Mom can‚Äôt afford a lawyer, and is worried that she would be saddled with half of his debt and half of his hoard of junk if she were to divorce him. She is also concerned that he would try to force her to accept him into her new apartment, even though he is not on the lease. To complicate matters, I still have a minor sister living with her.¬† We‚Äôve already taken everything she wants out of his house, apart from a jewelry box she inherited from my grandmother that she can‚Äôt find. What sort of advice should I give her on how to proceed next?	Yes
Maine, USA  My exhusband and I purchased a house while married, however when we got divorced he agreed to continue making payments on the property and that if in a year he was unable to refinance the house would be put on the market and sold. This was in November of 2016.  However, I recently discovered that he has not made a single payment on the property since we split up in June 2016. The reason I wasn't notified earlier was because he changed the address they were sending past due statements to without my knowledge.   I received a forwarded letter to my current address from the bank that our mortgage is through with an intent to foreclose slated to be done on August 4th if the current 13 missed payments, interest and escrow is not paid by that date. Recently I have come into money that would allow me to pay this debt off and continue making current payments on the house to keep it out of risk of foreclosure again in the future.  To my knowledge my ex spouse no longer lives there at the property but has tenants. What he is doing with the tenants check every month I couldn't tell you.   My question is that even though in our divorce agreement he was going to take ownership of the house, is it possible to go back to court and use this information to take back the property and evict the current tenants? And would the court be willing to have an expedited court date to speed up this process? The loan is still in both of our names.	Yes
im not sure how to format this present this with as much information organized. I wont lie everything could always be a lie but i knew this person for 2 and a half years who i will call CRA.   --- **Background info:**  CRA is currently 18 who lives in reading pennsylvania which looks like a shit hole. she lives with 2 older brothers,19 and 21, and a younger one 15. her dad apparently dealt drugs in the past and was forced to move out of state before getting to pennsylvania because of a hitman. her mom goes to school for what degree im not sure but she always use her and her 19 year old brother to do her homework for her. if they dont they get threatened in multiple ways. Her mom gets a lot of financial aid as long as no one works in her household as she is seen as a single mother with 4 kids even though their dad does actually lives with them and uses his income on luxuries like owning 4 cars. one of them being getting $500 a month for classes as long none of the kids work (how this is supposed to work or if anything really works like that idk). so as long as they live in their roof they cant work or they get kicked out. problem is she lives in reading pennsylvania which appears to be just a shitty city overall. CRA says a lot of times she doesnt feel safe walking around as an 18 year old girl. even if CRA and her brothers moved out and 3 of them were to look for jobs she doesnt feel confident they can find some there fast enough and have a reliable income for all of them. There way more problems like her dad locking her in a dark room for the whole time her mom was at work because she snitched on her dad that he would go out at night with other women when she was little and believed in ghost but the list can go on [some little bio she wrote about herself for school that can give an idea on what shes willing to share about herself with people](http://imgur.com/a/QPeyL)  ---  **Family Meetings**: apparently CRA and her family has meetings where they supposedly are to speak their mind about any issues oor problems. problem is they are almost always afraid to say anything and things will turn personal and get scolded for thinking anything negative about her parents. Couple months ago when CRA was talking to her 19 year old brother about making sure she will not let her parents get to her financial aid. her mom overheard it outside her room and got mad about not only the money but some sly remark was made (what is was i dont remember). a day after their mom forced a family meeting about it and [this is what happened](http://imgur.com/a/vWKxu)   She recently believes her brother has OCD as her always tries to hit his elbows against something til they bruise and cries uncontrollably. when she brought this up with her parents they again made it about them worried about being accused of neglect and she sent me an [audio clip](http://vocaroo.com/i/s0br429ykSLd) she apparently had 4 recording but only wanted to share one. ive asked for the others but i cant say why as she doesnt know im making this post and this was [CRA complaining about it today](http://imgur.com/a/qvluc)  ---- again its the internet but i have reasons to believe and worry about a friend. I just want to know what can CRA do? what can i say? i cant relate but obviously i have empathy and wish to help. Its easier said than done to say just leave and work or crash with a friend(s) till you can get on your own feet but she said she doesnt trust anyone she knows irl and is close enough to ask for something like that. she is smart enough to know suicide isnt the answer but even after all that she doesnt really wish to report her parents to the police or anything. im open to anything	Yes
"My question is about child support and custody when married/vs not married. My guess was that the legal system would be significantly more involved with the child custody and support stuff if you were not married at the time of a kid's birth. I was picturing that with a divorce order, you'd pick what you both wanted, write that up and submit it to the judge, and they would accept it. (This is assuming both parents agreed on everything). I figured that if you weren't married then you'd have to ""follow the rules"" in terms of splitting custody and child support. I guess I was thinking because the presumption would be the parents don't have much of a relationship and might not be able to sort out stuff. But I am just guessing. Is there any truth to that?"	Yes
We live in North Dakota. My mother has been married for about two years. Shortly after marriage he starting showing his true personality. In any event, they've decided to get a divorce.   My mother doesn't make much money and definitely not enough to consult with an attorney. Since they've been married they bought a house (down payment from his retirement money), which he took out a second mortgage out on to pay off his credit card debt. My mother has about 10k in medical bills which they didn't touch. He now says he has someone coming buy to look at the house and try to sell it. She'd ideally like to keep the house.   He also helped buy her a car but they never transferred it into her name and he's threatening to take it away from her.   His exact finances aren't known as he won't share them.  What is the best course of action going forward?	Yes
I'm in the process of divorce, thus far it's been amiable and I have legal council which I pay by the hour instead of a full retainer. Boulder, CO  I'm looking for ways to structure the maintenance that I can then present to my lawyer and say this is what I'm thinking is it on the level or do I need to go a different route.   Details are this: I'm in sales, I make a salary which alone is about the average household income for Colorado. I also get a commission. I'm new at this company so commission is small and will remain so for 1-3 years based on what my coworkers have done. Once I develop my book of business, my commissions will be double or triple my salary amount.   For these questions I'm asking; can I (legally) do this, and would I want to? Set up a maintenance plan where I pay a flat amount based on my salary and then a % of my commissions as I receive them?  Can I put a hard cap on the amount I pay of my commissions; eg I pay her 40% up to a certain dollar amount in a year, at which point I only pay the agreed upon amount based on my salary?  She currently owns two businesses, one is as a real estate broker (buying and selling houses), she hasn't done it full time but has extensive related experience and the right personality.  She also owns a small ag business. This is where things get sticky, she has put about $15K of our money into it. Plus it has been her full time job for nearly 2 years, so there have been childcare expenses and other indirect spending. She has raised funds from small investors ($5K-$20K each), which I think is around a total of $150K, but that could be +/- $50K, she has pitched the company as having about a million $ value in about 5 years.   She has yet to collect a dime in salary or income.  I think I'm entitled to half the company (as an asset), but how to I get a value for it? How do I impute her income for purposes of finding maintenance?  I'm looking for resources and sources of information as much as actual answers to the above questions. Thanks	Yes
My soon to be ex husband came over and took my tv. (Were separated) I said no and was blocking the tv. He kicked me in the stomach and punched me in the arm to shove me away and grabbed the tv. I grabbed his shirt as he was leaving and it tore. He said great now when you call the cops it will look like you attacked me and you'll be arrested. He did this all in front of our 3 yr old son. What can I do? If anything. I didn't touch him (besides grabbing his shirt). 	Yes
United States, Michigan  I am 24.  At this point in my life I have severe mental illness.   I have enough control that I can hold down a job, but I can feel myself getting worse.  I don't want to get to the day where I'm going to do something stupid and there's nothing to stop me. I want to talk to my parents about having myself redeclared under their guardianship so they can legally tell me what to do.    What term is used to have a parent reobtain legal control their child over the age of 18? I would like to do some research on the topic.  If anyone has knowledge of the system in Michigan I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for your time and help	Yes
I have 50/50 legal and physical shared custody with my ex-wife. We get along fine and co-parent fine.  When we divorced, she worked part time most of our 8 year marriage, even though she has a Bachelors degree and I do not. I was the bread winner. Her income was imputed at minimum wage (although for a brief period she worked full time and made more annually than me). So, I pay her child support every month.  This isn't a huge deal, and I didn't mind, even though it was a financial burden.  Since divorcing, she began a Masters Degree program. She has also re-married.  I understand that the re-marriage has no effect on my child support payment. They're our kids, not the new spouse's responsibility.  However, she has now finished her Masters Degree, and is still working part time. She has acquired several new piercings. She has acquired a new half sleeve (half her arm) tattoo that has grown over what must be several sessions. And she is about to have breast implant surgery.  So, her education has increase, though her income and work hours have not, and she is getting a lot of voluntary and aesthetic work done on her body.  I'm not judging, and I don't care, she's allowed to do whatever she'd like....  But, I'm struggling financially to maintain my home for my children, bills, etc. AND pay a not insignificant amount to her each month.  Would any of this be grounds for CS adjustment in Oklahoma?	Yes
I hired a lawyer to help me out with a legal name change. I submitted to him all my relevant papers and documents. Now it's been two weeks and I haven't heard anything yet. I'll probably ask him for an update, but is this amount of time normal? How long should it be before I hear back about making a court appearance, etc? Is this timeline consistent with usual expectation?	Yes
 Simply put my husband wants to name our daughter something gross. I don't know if he is serious or not. But I am not ok with the name. Can I name her without his consent? OR will she just have to be named Baby A until we can agree on something? I dont want her to grow up thinking we hate her.  The name for the curious: Marc-Geraldine. Yuck. 	Yes
I gave my friend money to lend and believed her story. Today, I thought I was dropping her off to see her mother, but I drove her to pick up heroin from her drug dealer. I had no idea this was happening, and I'm scared and worried for the child. The grandparents are likely to get CPS and the police involved.   I just would like to know what to expect from my end; will I be called in to give information or have to testify in court, if it happens? What is the process involving opiate addiction and pregnancy? Will I get in trouble?  Thanks.	Yes
My aunt has sole custody of the kids, the court allows my uncle to speak to the kids when he wants to and vice versa. However he never calls the kids and instead harasses my aunt who put a restraining order against home because he's crazy and abusive.   My uncle is extremely authoritarian and tries to restrict everything he can, currently in divorce with my aunt; he does not allow the kids to speak to my aunt when it's his days or weekends.  He disables their internet on their iPads and blocks all her calls/texts so she never has an idea whether or not the kids are safe. She fears one day the kids may get kidnapped from him and she won't be able to get a hold of them...  I'm concerned for their safety to and am curious, if I buy my cousin a phone and pay for his services per month to be able to keep in touch when needed; is my uncle allowed to confiscate it or place restrictions?   Any help is truly appreciated, thank you!	Yes
My sister and her husband are getting a divorce and he told her he enrolled their kids in public school and will be sending the orders in the mail. Right now they home school and the kids are VERY smart. She fulfills all the state requirements and they score very well on the standardized tests. Also neither of their work schedules would work very well with dropping them off and picking them up. He was the big proponent of homeschooling and is just doing this to be a jerk.   He has an attorney but my sister can't afford one. She has tried calling the number for free legal advice but hasn't been able to get through. The hours they are open are limited. I could help pay if an attorney would take monthly payments and wouldn't be horribly expensive.    Can he even do this without her permission? What can she do? She already filed for divorce but I guess the next step in the process (court date?) isn't until September. School starts in August. My sister is trying to be agreeable and wants joint custody. We don't know what he's even after.   I know there may be negative comments on homeschooling but it has nothing to do with me and wouldn't be very helpful. Oh also we are in Washington state. Thank you in advance for your help!! I will be at work so probably can't respond. 	Yes
First off- I don't believe there is anything nefarious going on (such as sexual molestation).  I do have a lawyer from my past custody issues, but he is currently not on retainer.  Before I take it there, I want to know if I'm overreacting, and if the family court will even care.  I know that co-sleeping is not illegal, and it is not in violation of our current parenting plan.  I have two sons (7 and 9) and have been divorced for 5ish years.  My current issue is that my ex-husband is co-sleeping with our nine year old.  My son sees a pediatric psychiatrist for ADHD, and in mentioning it to her, she believes it's unhealthy and detrimental for his development.  I think it's also unhealthy, and given that my son is in the beginning stages of puberty (and the fact that he's not a toddler), the co-sleeping situation to me is just flat out weird.    I've been discussing this with him for months, since March 2017 that I have written proof of (we communicate via Our Family Wizard).  I understand that transitioning him to his own room can be a process, but given that it's nearly August, I feel that this process should be completed at this point.  He's full of excuses and he doesn't think it's weird or unusual in the slightest.  I believe that my ex-husband is lonely and very co-dependent on our children, which is also unhealthy.  Having my son in his room at night is likely a crutch for his emotional instability.  Will family court even address this?  Thanks.	Yes
Background: This one is tricky because I am in the army(until Nov) and my younger adopted  14 year old brother resides with my mother in California. She has a great heart at times but it is no secret her mental health is on the decline. And she is prone to tantrums of extreme anger in which she takes it out on my brother. My little sister and older brother that live there will attest to it. Our father passed away 9 months ago and so she is worse than ever but so are all of us and the tension is high and I constantly worry my little brothers emotional, mental and physical will being around her.  Questions:   How could I go about getting custody of him?  If I succeed is there a way for me to be given the state support she receives for him(that she frivolously spends away) after my father passed?	Yes
"First off, I'm a 14 year old male, and I have a sister who is 12 years old, my sister does not feel the same way as I do and therefore would most likely stay on the same schedule no matter the outcome. About four years ago my Stepmom and Dad took my mom to court to (from what I've gathered) try to gain full custody of us. It ended with the decision being equal time where my sister and I switch every other week. The weeks where I am with my Stepmom and Dad have started to feel like a living hell. For various reasons such as my bisexuality and their refusal to acknowledge it, (other than the usual ""You're going to hell"" of conservative Christians) which has been causing a huge decline in my mental health. I have brought this up once before when in a particularly bad argument with my Stepmom and Dad where they said that they would go to court to get me back and that ""The court can't keep you from us."". What would be the best course of action?"	Yes
"Short and sweet. My husband screwed around behind my back a lot in the past. I'm 9 months pregnant.  I had a bit of a moment today and texted my mother saying pretty much ""kinda wish I could Leave him I can't get over the shit""  He saw and has decided we need to do something so we are discussing a marriage consoler but he also would like to put the baby up for adoption to avoid ""getting trapped"" and child support. Is there a way to put his fears to ease and avoid him paying child support? I am some what attached to the baby by this point and have already started a nursery and have a baby shower in a week so im a bit commited. Financially if I were alone with a child I would be doomed but I will have family who will help.  He has a great paying job and doesn't want to feel like he's getting screwed.    *TL;DR* I want to ensure my husband doesnt have to pay child support in case we do divorce. Is there anything I could do?"	Yes
My girlfriend lived in the US for most of her life and had two kids while she was living in California. Her ex (the father) and her moved to Mexico with the kids and then they separated and she took care of the kids but let him see them. She finally decided to move back to the US but she wanted to let him see them so they agreed that they would stay in Mexico until the school year started and then they would move to the US. Her visa was still good when she crossed the border but it has now expired and her ex is saying he won't return them. He is only doing this to upset her but she's not sure how she will get them back. Is there anything we can do to get them back? We're worried about her going to a court because her visa expired a few weeks ago.	Yes
Texas  My husband and I are splitting up. We have a 3 year old son together. My husband has offered to pay me $600 a month in child support. $500 would go to child care and the extra $100 would be for anything else he needs. My husband brings home around $4,500 a month. He also has our son insured through his work.  Here is the issue - I want to go through the attorney general for child support. He doesn't want me to because he says I'll get more money from him and I 'don't need more money than that'. He says that he put me through school so that I could have a career and can take care of myself and that I really don't need any more money from him in child support. I make about half of what he makes monthly.  I didn't think this was fair, so I told him that I was going to get a lawyer for all of this. His response to that was that if I went out and got a lawyer to get more child support, he would ask that I take our son to an actual daycare. My dad has been taking care of my son since he was born. He watched him every day when I was in nursing school, and he watches him while I work. He's been to every single doctors appointment, he takes him to his T-ball practice and he does 2 learning programs with him at home - ABCmouse and a program with actual books and flash cards. He's doing really well with these programs. My son is very close to him and I feel safe knowing that he's with him.  So my question is - would I likely get more money in child support if I go through lawyers? And can my husband make me send our son to a daycare facility?	Yes
Im Located in Florida, USA. Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old.    I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.    My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.   This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be safe with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.   I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The long litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!     tl/dr: ex wife keeps winning custody battle even though she knowingly is filling false accusations	Yes
My ex-wife made a gofundme fundraiser(?) claiming our son is autistic, which he is not. Is this a basis for me to get custody?  This isn't her first venture into questionable ethics to garner sympathy or make money. What legal actions can I take?	Yes
"I'm just trying to think about the future and what moves I can make. The woman I am dating and myself work typical 40 hour weeks with me earning $3 more per hour.  With this pay gap at a low tax bracket (neither of us make over $40k), assuming we rented and never owned property, and didn't have kids what type of prenuptial agreement would need to be drafted for a ""clean"" divorce?"	Yes
My soon to be ex wife is divorcing me after we got into a fight after being drunk. She stated that she is not pursuing alimony. Could she pursue alimony for one incident that did not result in any impairment? We are meeting with an attorney where we both sit down and discuss terms this weem. Do I need to lawyer up on my own? We have no assets as we are in college. Just electronics and two cars and furniture. Any advice is appreciated 	Yes
My ex and I agreed that we would pay our fair share of taxes, in proportion to our earnings, at tax time. Because I withheld too much, and she withheld too little, I ended up paying her taxes for her. Per our divorce agreement, in this situation we agreed to pay back the other, but she is now refusing to pay. Do I have to go to divorce court, or could I take her to civil court, or even small claims court, to get my money?	Yes
My girlfriend and I were wondering if in Indiana state she can transfer the deed to her house that's only in her name into my name so we can force him to stop coming over and causing trouble. Little background  State is Indiana  County is Allen  City is fort Wayne They have been separated 2 years, he's an abusive stalker with tons of money from a settlement from a death in his family.  Twice now he has put protective orders on her to get possession of the house temporarily and go through and steal our stuff.  The divorce is still a ways away as there is a lot of fighting of tons of assets.    Is it possible to put the house in my name to keep him from coming over?	Yes
The situation is kind of complex, but I'll try to break it down. I may not know all the details of the legal stuff that happened, but I'm trying my best from what I do know.  We are in Manitoba, Canada.   My parents separated legally. However, between themselves they agreed that Mom will not apply for child support benefits and in turn Dad will let her live with him rent free. They live like roommates, only sharing common spaces. They barely talk and in general do not have a relationship.  They do not share finances outside an RESP for my education.   My mom recieved government benefits for being a single mother for 3 (?) years. She works part time and does not recieve financial assistance from Dad at all, apart from their agreement about the rent.   Last month they both got letters stating that they need to explain what kind of custodial agreement they have over me. Their definition of shared custody included living at separate addresses, so they could not say they shared custody. So they wrote a custom explanation about the situation and their agreement.   Today a letter came in with an invoice of $10k CAD. I do not know the terms of this debt (interest, time frame). Is there anything that can be done? Is what they're doing actually illegal? Please help.   TL;DR: Parents separated, but live in one house to save the hassle of child support and rent. They do not share finances otherwise. Invoice came in saying Mom owes the government $10k CAD. What do?	Yes
I live in MN.   My SO was recently diagnosed with cancer. So far it is not terminal but it is not looking great. I would rather not get into the personal details of this.   He has always been a spontaneous person and so I know if he hears terminal, he will ask me to marry him. I am more of a planner and have a few concerns about marrying him so sudden and young, only to be widowed. I want to be prepared in case it does so I can give him an answer and have peace of mind myself about my future.   1. I am on my parent's health insurance as I am under 26. Am I able to stay on this if I am married/widowed?  2. Would I inherit any of his debt if he passes?  3. Would I be in charge of his estate and affairs?  4. Would this in anyway affect my taxes?  5. Are there any other life impacting/legal implications I should be considering once I am married?  This has become a reality very quickly for me and I have not had to consider any of this up to this point. I understand if this comes off as uncaring, but please don't misinterpret my tone. I would marry him in a heart beat if I knew it wouldn't cause major financial or legal changes in my life being widowed so young. If there will be I would consider spiritual marriage instead of legal.   Thank you in advance.	Yes
So, my boyfriend is currently going through an awful custody battle with his unsavory ex. I wish that we could record his ex with the kids but that isn't legal. His kids sometimes talk to me about things, so I was wondering would it be legal for me to record myself speaking with them about her given that they are minors, could their father give consent for them? Or is that still illegal? My boyfriend is very stressed about all of this and I can't really think of any other way to directly help with the hearings and his ex makes a lot of things up. Thank you for any help.	Yes
My boyfriend has been separated from his wife for a while now. They are finally going to go through a divorce. He isn't completely legal in the states. They were working on immigration status to have him become a permanent resident. That eas halted when she began to refuse attending the appointments.  Now that they are going to begin the divorce process how will this affect him? He works at a job, has a social security number, and has 2 kids under the age of 18 that were born in the US. He and I have a baby due in October and I'm terrified he might be deported.	Yes
"If I were to divorce my husband of almost 5 years, what are my legal rights?  He definitely makes more money then me and we did not sign a pre-nup.  We got married in NYC but will be moving to NJ this fall to attempt saving our marriage.  We also have a 15 month old daughter.  These are my questions below.  My biggest fear is that because he makes alot more then me that the courts will side with him or he'll hire lawyers to ""get me"".  Also, if we got married in NY and lived in NY but soon will move to Jersey (in Oct/Nov 2017) How does that work?  Would it go under NY or NJ law and how would that affect me? HELP! :(  1.  Child custody.  I would want joint custody for us to make decisions together, BUT I want her to live with me with granting him visitation rights.  During a heated argument he threatened me with taking me to court to gain full custody of our daughter.  He even mentioned that he will hire the most expensive attorney for him to win.  He has since apologized multiple times, but I have no idea if he will rant and threaten me again!  2. We did not sign a pre-nup and live in a co-op (that we bought together).  I recently became a stay at home mom with no income.  However when we move to NJ, I plan on going back to work and earn my own money."	Yes
My brother has had sole custody and legal decision making for his two kids for 3 years.  Their mother was arrested for drug distribution, plead guilty, and only allowed supervised visits once a month starting 8 months ago.  She's now taking him back to court to try and get 50/50 custody.  We know that's more than likely not going to happen but she wanted to have the kids interviewed to try and see what they wanted to do.  My brother found out that his oldest daughter (16) said she wanted to live with her mother during the week and come back to him on the weekends.  His younger daughter (14) said she wanted to stay with him during the week and only visit her mother on the weekends.  I guess the question is would the court take their wishes into consideration and allow for this?  I've seen kids split up per their wishes before but I don't think I've ever heard about a court order for it.  Also,what would a split like that mean for child support?  Right now he's getting support from her, though she owes about six months worth of unpaid support.	Yes
It is am amount equal to 5% of my income. 	Yes
"This is a complicated situation, but I'll try to be brief.   I'm 18. I come from a recently divorced family of seven children. I live with my dad, along with one sister, while my other family lives with my mother.  Most of the children who live with her are very little, the youngest three being ages 3, 5, and 7.  My fifteen year old brother is not very mentally stable. When my father comes over for visitation, he throws violent scenes and yells in front of the whole neighborhood. Just last week, my dad told me that he (literally, not a joke or exaggeration) started jumping on top of the hood of the car and started banging on the front window.  He has issues with anger. He's had a history of violence and troubles with both anger and empathy. He has been on medication, but has stopped taking it two months ago because he is paranoid that my father is ""using it to control him"" even though it's been prescribed by a psychiatrist. We can't force him to take it because he lives with his mother, who doesn't believe in medication for mental health. He's been through multiple therapists, and always ends up fighting with them or throwing a scene.  I've heard from my mother a few weeks ago that he's been collecting knives and storing them in his room.   I don't know what I can do. I don't feel good about him being around my younger siblings. But nothing has happened so far that would warrant legal action. My mother goes to work most nights and comes home at 7. Her father watches the children, but he is old, and can't speak English very well.   Is there anything I can do? There are long stretches of time where he is alone with the children, and I'm worried that there won't be anything I can do to put the children in a safer situation until after something's already happened. Because he hasn't done anything drastically illegal, and because he is still a minor and in my mother's care, there isn't anything I can do to distance him from them. He isn't getting the help he needs. I don't feel good about just sitting here waiting for something to happen. These are vulnerable, little children with a near-absent mother.  Other things my brother has done:  ‚Ä¢poured water on my 13 year old brother in a restaurant (on two separate occasions) ‚Ä¢pretended to be someone online for 2 years to my sister, and pretended to be her close friend. I found out when he bragged, ""I can't believe she's stupid enough to believe it after two years"".  When I told her, she cried for forty minutes.  ‚Ä¢has been violent to me and my sister. ‚Ä¢steals money and other belongings from family members ‚Ä¢regularly gaslights, manipulates people. Once tried to ""teach"" me how to lie to our father. ‚Ä¢emotionally antagonizes and berates my sister with BPD and anxiety. He targets her specifically. This is the same sister who he pretended to befriend online.  ‚Ä¢tried to lie to the public school administration that he was being physically abused and neglected. ‚Ä¢regularly throws fits in public. ‚Ä¢I've seen him screaming at my younger (7 yr old) sister, calling her a ""retard"", and I've seen him manhandling the children when they're dropped off from visitation. ‚Ä¢stalked a teacher from his middle school until he was given an unofficial restraining order from the school. He has a notice that if he is on the school grounds again, they will take legal action."	Yes
"My son's father has his visits in WA state (for the month of July), I reside in FL. I found out through my son they were planning on taking a plane flight to CA without telling me. I can't pinpoint my question but I feel there's something not right about leaving me ""out of the loop""."	Yes
We live in Virginia for starters. A little background I'm 24, my husband is 32. We've been together for 4 years and married for 3. We have one child together and have purchased a home while married.   He has been verbally and emotionally abusive to me for a long time now, and has cheated on me in the past. In recent events he's brought it to my attention that he's miserable and that this isn't the life he wanted for himself.   I've made it clear to him that the only thing I want out of this marriage is our daughter, I don't want spousal support, child support, none of the property. Just her.   The problem I've run into however is I currently don't have any means of acquiring any money, he's our sole bread winner.   So my question is, what the hell do I do.   I can't keep doing this with him, I'm at the end of my emotional threshold.	Yes
"Hello everyone, i have a question for the best minds at r/legaladvice because I don't know what to do.  Let me give you some backstory.  I live in Kentucky.  My older brother lives in Athens, Georgia.  He's had psychotic breaks twice before, both timed he gets violent and talks about how people have a death wish and how they're going to die, one time he drove a golf cart with a .30/.30 rifle and pellet gun towards a house owned by someone he just had a loud argument with before veering off to an adjacent house and busting out windows and destroying it in his rage.  This was his first episode.  The second happened on Monday, he told me he had suicidal thoughts and needed help then went dark and wouldn't answer me, come to find out he got arrested for attempting to jump out in front of traffic and told the police officers to kill him and he had no reason to live.  He was also very careful to tell them he was on acid, so they wouldn't think he was nuts (he later proudly told this to my Aunt, unprompted).  Currently he's in a mental institution for monitoring, and is to be released on Monday.  I think that my brother needs serious help, and he is refusing to do any sort of inpatient care.  He doesn't have insurance.  I can't believe that the police are letting him go after he was attempting suicide and assaulting police officers.  From what I understand that's how the system works in Athens, they're overcrowded and just try to shuttle people through the system.  He is on probation from the first incident, but just has to do call check-ins and that's it.  He was diagnosed as mentally ill and was given medication but stopped taking it.  My brother is very manipulative, and when I spoke to him last he's still on the ""pink cloud"" where everything is going great and he had a support system and is on medication and everything is going to be great.. but I'm terrified that he's lying to me and he's just going to go back to the same old habits and next time someone could get very hurt when he has one of these psychotic breaks.  He won't listen to reason.  How can, or can I even, go about getting him involuntarily committed if he hadn't really done a great act of violence yet?  As I said he's manipulative, and likely that the mental health professionals swallowed everything he told them even though it's very unlikely that he is going to follow through with this and his psychosis builds on itself until it's too much to even bear.  The living arrangement that he'd be returning back to is with another violent psychotic person, who has said that he is going to shoot my brother if he sees him again, and he still has my brother's stuff even though he's officially filed an eviction notice with the state of Athens.  I fear that Athens is going to let him go because they buy that it's just an isolated incident, buy whatever he told them and would rather do nothing so they can get someone who is ""really sick"" in that bed but I'm not buying it.  Sorry if this is jumbled up, this is just a Readers Digest version and I'm just upset about this whole thing so...  TL;DR I think my brother is being affected by relationships and the environment of Athens, including the police and they want to just let him go but I think he has a serious mental health issue and he could turn violent.  How do I go about getting him out of Athens, with state help preferably, and into a care facility he needs?  He also has no insurance and my parents are unwilling to help pay.."	Yes
It's not my child, thankfully, but I'm attempting to give my friend advice. Missouri (at least where I live) has been known as a mother state.  Her boyfriend divorced officially divorced his wife last year after a rather harsh divorce in which she went rather psycho. In order to keep it from turning it into a huge custody battle (which it ultimately pretty much turned into), mother took weekdays while father took weekends and alternated holidays. Mother bugged them about holidays and attempted to extend or shorten the time, and for the most part the father didn't fight her on it. She began to move further and further away. She claimed job but twice it has turned out to be for men she has met over the internet. Understand, she meets these men and under two weeks she makes plans to move. The first time she intended to take the father to court in order to move out of state for the new boyfriend, but the guy broke it off with her. She recently did it again, but this time she shifted over custody and pretty much dumped the kid on him.  The kid has behavioral issues. He's 8, and was expelled from school last year. The mother 'homeschooled' him (sat him in front of a computer for two hours in which he watched youtube videos that gave him nightmares). After about two months of that she stopped even that. While he is not in school, he is not with his therapist and she refuses to find him one because she doesn't 'trust any of the ones in the area' so he hasn't been getting the help he needs. She also constantly forgets to give him his medication. He is a violent child. He destroys, he threatens. For some reason his mother decided to teach him to shoot a gun (gun safety is important, sure), but he got mad at my friend one day, and he threatened to shoot her. All guns are safely locked up in the house, but it's disturbing, especially as mother tries to undermine friend, tells son that he doesn't have to listen to friend, or attempts to blackmail father or make son think they're getting back together (attempted to make friend think father was cheating, claimed pregnancy of father's child and miscarriage the very next day when friend was present despite being on IUD and second trimester at least with no hospital visit). During the time that the father and my friend has son, they give him the proper care and his behavior improves, but when he goes back it goes right back to square one. He becomes a nightmare again. He's allergic to cats but she has a house full of them. The father believed he needed the mother in his life, however. But she refuses to work with him. Even the kid doesn't believe the mother wants him at this point, and thinks the mother thinks the boyfriend is more important than him.  Well, after the most recent boyfriend/job/move, where she attempted to move across state lines again and father refused to allow her, and she gave the father primary custody, the kid has started to improve again. Where the kid has tantrums every day, friend said he's only had one this last week and a few hiccups here and there that were easily rectified.   My friend sent me a few videos of him today talking about her. He thinks he's dumb, that mother doesn't want him and that's he thinks the boyfriend and the job and the move is more important. That she doesn't want him and he doesn't want anything to do anything with her anymore. At first he started off angry but at the end of it there was just this resignation.   Mother has also on numerous occasion claimed to have blacked out, lost her memory to the point that she thought she was still married to father on two separate occasions (she went to the docs but the docs ran tests and can't find anything wrong with her), and claimed to having seizures, but no reasons as to why. She also drives 3 hours to drop son off for the halfway point (in which cops have to be present at father and friends insistence as mother tends to start screaming matches) but doesn't see a worry about driving so far with her kid in the car and potentially endangering him. I originally thought you couldn't drive within 6 months after having a seizure but I don't think that necessarily applies in Missouri.  I've encouraged friend multiple times to call cps on her for her actions, but she's worried about making things worse.   Anyway. Again, mother state, and while the mother is pushing things over onto the father finally, she keeps coming back. She won't stop. She won't let go, she won't let the father go. She seems to want to wipe her hands clean of the kid but it's like she wants to use him as leverage just to keep him in her life. To her the kid is just a pawn and while I don't have much to do with them (I've literally never even met the mother), it makes me sick that this is going on.   Is there anything that the friend and father can do for the kid that can get her away for good, if she doesn't stay away on her own? She's missed several times she was supposed to call him and she was supposed to come pick him up but never did. She called him today apparently, after friend texted her and pushed her to talk to her son, but apparently she was just acting nice and didn't really respond.	Yes
So about 4 days ago my first born was well, born. He was born at home with no health issues although mama had to go to the hospital for a hematoma that was ironed out in no time. After we got home we both had been up at this point for about 40+ hours and were exhausted. He had passed his 24 hour visit with no issues and we were just about ready for bed when my SO asked if his hands were blue. I had told her they looked red if maybe a teensy bit blue and we decided to go to the ER for our new parental Paranoia, after telling them this they brought him to the NICU and said they needed blood, some pee and a 48 hour watch. Obviously we didn't want to but we waited the 48 and as we were relaxing my SO was holding the baby in the chair and he had been angled funny and lost his breath from his head being against the his chest. The doctor knew this but it was shift change so she communicated it to our new doctor, he says 5 more days are necessary even though my baby has been told he's healthy, a good eater, and clean of any infections. Do we really have to wait the 5 days or can we do an alternative and leave. I know AMA isn't allowed but is there any other way?	Yes
"TL;DR: If I offer my ex $8,000 to sign a financial settlement to give me $20,000, is this extortion? Can ex later argue she was coerced? Can my attorney ethically discuss with me how to present it so it's legal?  I have a petition for rule pending to enforce financial aspects of my divorce decree, namely contribution to kids' expenses and a retirement account payout. Over 12 years for 3 kids I've paid about $73,500 in documented expenses with zero reimbursement from ex.   The retirement issue was resolved by agreement a few months ago, but the other expenses drag on.  The decree says 50/50 but ex argues that this was based on our salaries being equal at the time. For 9 of the last 12 years, she's been out of work and says I should pay 100%. She never asked to change nor disputed the 50/50 until I filed the petition. I've been giving her receipts all these years and she kept saying ""I'll pay when I go back to work next year or the year after"". I have some sympathy for her as the kiddo she has with her new husband had some significant medical issues for a few years and she chose to stay home with her.   She has just returned to working full time and I took this action to force her to share the financial burden of college, which is frankly overwhelming me.   She's in a rough financial situation right now with significant damage to her home from a recent storm. Insurance is not covering it and she's clearly desperate for cash because she asked me for a loan of $8,000 this morning.   I'm not unreasonable and she's been a pretty good mother. I am tired of legal expenses and now that I've gotten the promised retirement money, I'd be willing to settle for $15-20k of the $36k and her paying the remaining college costs. I've already taken parent loans for 4 years for one kid and 2 years each for the other two. She can either pay or take out loans for the next two years for the two youngest.   Can I propose giving her the $8k in exchange for her signing an agreement to this effect? I'd want her to sign it before I give her the money and giving her the money would contingent on her signing.   I have an attorney, but am not clear if my attorney can ethically discuss how to present this offer in a legal way."	Yes
"My parents are going through a very nasty divorce. My mum has announced she wanted a divorce in February, but my father didn't accept it. He simply said no. She insisted, went to several marriage counselors and relationship therapists. It has finally gotten to the point where they have signed to go through mediation.   My father and I never really got along, because he is a very dominant person, with several narcissistic personality traits. He has never accepted any opinion other than his own. My mum has been ""suppressed"" by him for over 30 years and it has drained her, making her depressed. Ever since puberty, when started to not blindly accept his opinions, we haven't gotten along. When I'm stating my opinion/interest whatsoever, he has to bring me down and disagree. But I digress.  My father is doing all the technical things in and around the house (even though I'm convinced I can do it more efficiently, he won't let me) so also our email provider. He created all our email adresses for us with our email provider. I immediately changed my password afterwards, but I used the same password as my computers, which he also knew, because he set that up too (stupid me).  Today he had to leave the house in a hurry and left his computer and light on in the office. He becomes really pissed off when someone leaves the light on in the house because of electricity costs or whatsoever, so I went in his office to turn his lights off, when I saw his email client open on his computer. I glanced a bit, debating whether I should turn his computer off too (because he turns off mine when I leave it on when I've left for 10 min), when I recognized my own emails in his email client. And emails addressed to my mum (and my mum only), and emails addressed to my sister. I looked into his email client and saw that this has been going on since the end of April, so roughly two months after the divorce decision. My father did not ask me for consent about this and I am wondering if this is legal or not and what I could do to make this stop. I already changed my email password again to something I'm 100% sure of he doesn't know.  TL;DR - My parents are going through a nasty divorce and I just discovered that my dad has been reading all emails, including my own, my mums and my sisters, without our consent. I consider this a serious breach of privacy and secrecy of correspondence. What can I do?"	Yes
Hello, everyone. Long story short, I was about to break up with my then girlfriend, she thought trapping me would make me marry her, it didn't, now I'm in a shitty situation. We broke up, she moved back home, and refuses to communicate with me. I've tried to contact her and her family about the due date of the child (I know it's sometime in February, but that's all I know) but they ignore me. I only got a picture of the ultrasound because she posted it to my facebook wall in an attempt to embarrass me. She's also stated that she's not going to put my name on the birth certificate, which I'm not sure if that matters. I'm afraid she's going to try and keep the baby away from me. I may not be on good terms with her, but I want to take care of my child. I'm in Texas. What are my options?	Yes
I'd just like to say that I live in a rural area. The road I'm speaking of is off the main road, it is more narrow and unmarked. There is a sharp turn with a lot of trees and grown up weeds, so you can't see anything until you're going around that turn.   My neighbors have a few kids, none of them high school age. Middle school at most, probably. Amongst those kids is a handicap child. Not sure how old he is, just that he is in a motorized wheelchair. The parents let their kids go for walks to their friends house, so sometimes the handicap kid is supervised by them. However there have been multiple times where I've gone around that turn and had to slam on my breaks to miss the kid in a wheelchair and he was alone. I drive pretty safely but that is such a blindspot and I'm terrified of hitting him.   I was going to make a post about this awhile back and if it'd be calling CPS worthy, but it had stopped for a long time. I assumed someone had talked to them.... Until now..  Tonight, DARK OUTSIDE, on the turn there was the dad pulling a trailer with a riding lawn mower with no lights on, and the kid in a wheelchair was riding in front of him (also no lights, obviously.) Only thing that prevented an accident was a car that came from the other direction flicking their lights to signal to slow down before the turn.   I don't know the law, I don't know things that should be called in to CPS, or things that are perfectly fine.	Yes
Last month I submitted a proposal to modify my child support. The child support was modified and I thought all was good. My ex wife said it was fair and was not fighting it. The letter I got said that no hearing is required unless one of the parties requests a hearing within 30 days of the notice and motion. I just got a summons to go to court next month over this. Why?	Yes
My brother and his ex were never married and have been together for 6 or 7 years. They have 3 children and have lived in Iowa all throughout their relationship. They split up a couple months ago and had been sharing custody without any official agreement. She just left and took the kids, she is currently on her way to Georgia. What are his rights.  Where will a custody battle take place?	Yes
"As stated above, I am getting married and we are both signing a prenup. I don't come from any significant money, but my partners parents own several successful businesses that will eventually be passed down to her (she manages them currently). I have no problem signing a prenup excluding me from any inheritance or spousal support (I make good money, and have a good career), and my ""almost"" wife and I make very good income combined. Is there any legal shenanigans I should watch out when looking over this agreement? I obviously want to protect myself as well in the event that we get divorced. I am mostly looking for suggestions for things easy to overlook, before I sign I will go see a lawyer to look over it with me of course.  Thanks in advance!"	Yes
I am living abroad of US but in an American company. My question is, if a female security guard in an American company wants to have a child just for herself and she chooses a coworker male security guard as donor for giving birth to child, does it effect according to US HR regulation their employment in American company? If the donor has a wife and children.	Yes
I (25F) will be giving birth to a baby boy who is the offspring of my fianc√© (31M) in September. Because we are not legally married yet, I have a few questions/concerns over medical legalities.   Basically, I need to know the steps to take in case of something going wrong during birth. I'm assuming, as the father of my child, he would take over the decision making process for the baby if something were to happen to me. Would he have the same medical power of attorney over me if I were to have to be put in a coma or on a life support machine? Or would MPOA go automatically to my parents? I guess my questions are  -Do I need to file some sort of paperwork in case of an emergency with my life?   -Do I need to have a will or some type of notarized paperwork giving him MPOA over our son?   -Should I just inform my parents of my wishes in case of an emergency?   -Am I overthinking ALL of this?   Any and all advice will be considered. Thank you in advance!	Yes
My older brothers house was raided by police. He has 2 kids which were taken into protective services. Right now I guess he is being charged with burglary, theft, possession of an illegal firearm, child abuse , possession of controlled substance. His wife is being charged with receiving stolen property, and possession of illegal substance. According to my younger brother who was staying there and witnessed the whole thing, all that was in the house was stolen stuff, and 3 meth pipes. Now I love my brother very much and I want to do what I can to help, but he's in Nebraska, and I'm in California. I don't think he can afford a lawyer so I was wondering if I could hire a lawyer from here to defend him in another state. I also want to see about taking custody of his kids while this all gets sorted out. Wtf do I do?There is more, but I'm on my phone right now.	Yes
So basically she has been with this guy on and off for like 8 years now. She has broken up with him like 3 times now, but he always finds some way back in. I know he smokes weed and cigarettes. Sometimes he will use mine and my little sisters bathroom (I'm 16 and she's 13) to take a crap and smoke. He has taken my things and sold them when I was younger and seemingly convinced my mom he didn't do it. He is a previous sex offender but is off parole. He also used to do drugs. He just got back out of jail and a got back together with my mom recently. He always acts like he owns the place.   The point of this is I have told my mom time and time again to kick him out or I am gonna leave. However since I'm only 16 and she claims I can't. My whole family knows he's a dick. Am I able to go stay with a differently family member? Can I file some kind of restraining order against him? What are the legal issues with this whole process?	Yes
My ex and I were married for 10 years and we got divorced 3.5 years ago. He is an attorney and black mailed me into waiving the spousal support or else he would ruin my life. I have been through therapy and am ready to go back to court to modify the child support because I have had a change in income. Can I also ask my lawyer to look into the spousal support? I am no longer afraid of him and even though I waived the support I was under duress. He took advantage of his knowledge as an attorney and held me under duresss. Is this all possible? 	Yes
"I have a 4 year old son. My name is not on his birth certificate and paternity has not been established. This is an agreement between his mother and I, I have no custodial rights and they live several hours away. This, to her, prevents me from ""trying anything"" and also prevents me from being responsible for any child support.  I pay half of his health insurance premium through Florida Kid Care to help out.   This coming enrollment period I will be adding my 8 year old son to my insurance, the difference between Emp+Child and a family plan is minimal.   My question is, can I add my 4 year old son which I, on paper, have no rights or custodial duties for to my health insurance while keeping our arrangement?"	Yes
I live in Florida. With my consent I agreed to allow my wife to take our two children, 6 and 4, on a quick vacation to NH to stay with friends and come back in a week. I did not go as I had a job interview during that time frame. A few days after leaving she advised me she wants a divorce and wants me to list our home with a mutual friend who is a realtor and she doesn't know when she is going to return. I've had limited contact with her and the children as she states she is too busy to talk. A few days ago we got in a dispute regarding minor mutual property I wanted to donate to Goodwill we had already saved for a garage sale. She's since blocked me on her phone from calling or texting her. Unfriended me on FB and changed her last name on FB. I plan on contacting an attorney this week sometime. What recourse do I have to make her bring the children back?	Yes
"Some background information: So my mother and father are currently going through a divorce. I'm legally an adult (18+) while my younger brother is a minor (Under 18). My father recently moved out of the house because of this divorce and is currently living in Chicago. My mother, who had been previously diagnosed with a personality disorder, left the house for 3 days without a word to me or my brother on when or whether she would be coming back or not. During day 2, we broke down the door to the house's office room in order to get more information or maybe a hint on her whereabouts. The actual act of kicking down the door was committed by my younger brother but I witnessed it and did not try to stop him. She is now trying to take me to court for ""convincing"" my brother to kick down the door. I don't think she has any legal standing as the house is under my dad's name and he pays for all the bills because my mother has been unemployed for years now. My dad understands my side of the story and doesn't care for the damage done. Can she really do anything or is she just trying to scare me and play mind games? I am now living with my dad in the city during summer break from college to get out of the house but my brother is stuck with her because he's still got a year left of high school back home.  Some other stuff she has done to me I think I can use against her to file a ""counterclaim"" (don't know if I'm using that word right) or just in general is: 1) Logged into my newly opened bank account (which was only suppose to be under my name) and taken $5,000 from my savings and tried transferring it into her personal bank account. I, foolishly, used an old username and password from a previous joint account with her when I was a minor to open the new one. She used that previous information to log into my new account and tried to steal my money. I called the bank and reversed it but I would still consider that some form of identity theft, right? 2) She has been constantly berating and belittling me over text message (calling me names, using every swear in the book, threatening me, etc.) for a little under a month now. I don't want to block her as I think I can use this as evidence as some form of abuse, correct? Yes, I find it very disturbing and am deeply saddened that my own mother thinks I'm worthless simply because I refuse to take sides in the divorce.   More info on her mental issues: She has obviously had this Personality Disorder for a while now and during my childhood would constantly go through bouts of yelling at me and my brother and acting like a normal mother. She use to see a therapist but I'm not sure how often she attends appointments now. I think the stress of the divorce accelerated/intensified this disorder as the abusive text messages have gotten more frequent. I've even come home one night (in the old house) to see dozens of holes in the wall across different rooms of the house which was very creepy to say the least.  Thank you in advance for all the help."	Yes
We have been married for over nine years and have a seven year old, she does not work and is financially dependant on me, she would not be able to pay rent if I were to leave our apartment and move in with my parents who are relatively near by, and I would not be able to pay for my own personal rent and our current rent if I were to rent a room somewhere on my own  She wants to take our only car and drive 8 hours north to stay with her parents, and I really don't see any other options for us either, but do not want to be that far away from my son.	Yes
"Hello!  My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force.  Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.  What are some factors that could allow him split custody?  Sorry, just stressed out about this. We don't know how this stuff works. Yes we are seeing an attorney we just want to know if others have been through this.  Advice?  ""Corrected title from Disney Dad to Deadbeat Dad"""	Yes
"Someone I know is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this."	Yes
"Location:  Virginia  I (mother) have full legal and physical custody of son (Father wanted neither).    Father has visitation every other Sunday as well as visitation on holidays.  He also has visitation every tuesday from 5-7 (to take kiddo to dinner).    He is also supposed to call our son once a week and also email me once a week to ask for updates about him.  We aren't best friends, but we are cordial, there is no arguing or fighting.  What is upsetting me is that the father isn't doing anything other than his every other Sunday visits, and even on those, he shortens or cancels fairly often.  The father lives 20 minutes away.  There is no good reason for this...when I confront him, he just says ""yeah, I know I should do better"".  And that's it.  Kiddo is 8 and is good friends with another boy with separate parents, and that father lives in NYC.  That father and son skype daily.  My son is beginning to notice that his dad is choosing to be distant, and I'm seeing his disappointment.  He's also mentioned he doesn't want to see dad anymore...all his dad does is take him home and sit him in front of a TV while dad does stuff around the house.    Is there anything I can do legally to make his dad step up?  I realize that's not the best way to go about it, but I'm getting desperate.  I've tried being as agreeable as possible.  I've offered overnight visits.  I've offered to drive.  I've had a heart to heart with him letting him know he's missing out on the opportunity to share these moments.  Anything to get him to participate with his son more than the little bit he does.  The way the custody consent order reads it looks like he is ordered this visitation - that he is required to visit/call/etc.  I can't tell.  Can I submit a show cause for every time he hasn't done these things?  Again, I know it's not the best way to handle it.  I just wonder if he can be scared into caring, sadly.  Or at least making it look like he cares.  Thanks.  TLDR:  Can I do anything legally to get my son's father to be more involved in his life?"	Yes
Long story short... Court awarded home to ex wife in 2012 and she signed a decree agreeing to refinance in 60 days and hold me harmless of the debt. She never did this and I couldn't find an attorney who wanted to handle the problem so I basically did nothing.   Now, home is going on 120 days past due (Foreclosure on the horizon) and she notifies me that she's filing for bankruptcy. Spoke with her attorney and he says she's going to let the home go back to the bank and file bankruptcy.  My credit is already slaughtered (570-600?), but I plan on visiting the home tomorrow to see what shape it's in and if she's not living there, entering the home and taking pictures, etc for when I take her to court for this. I have not signed a quit claim, I have the deed in my hand, and I'm still on the mortgage. Even though the divorce decree awards it to her, with all of the rest, do I have grounds to enter the home if she is no longer living there without any legal reprocussions? My concern is if I have to break in and the police get called.  Thanks!	Yes
My wife filed for divorce 8 months ago in January.  I never signed any papers but she said that she received an email saying that as of yesterday the divorce was final.  Is there any way I can contest this?  She is having second thoughts and wants to work it out.	Yes
"My daughter is 5, my ex and I have not been together since she was a few months old. I have always had full custody, he did not request anything regarding visitations, etc. I filed for child support after we broke up. A few months later, he went to prison for a little over 3 years for domestic assault. I was under the impression that he could have had the child support modified due to the fact that he was no longer working, but the money kept coming every month and I never questioned it. We use the state child support system, and the amount was very low as he was not working very much before he was incarcerated. It didn't seem crazy to me that the payments were being made.   He has been out of prison for a little less than the same amount of time he was in. I had a RO against him for a year after he was out, but I let it expire because I did not feel that he was a threat (lives several hours away, made no attempts to contact me, etc). His mother sees her granddaughter a few times a year. She has mostly been pleasant enough, but is convinced her son is completely innocent and that I've ruined his life. I'm fine with us pretending to like each other for the sake of my child for a few hours every 6 months or so. We've never had any major problems.    I remarried while my ex was still in prison, and my husband and I have decided that we want to move forward with him adopting our daughter. We had the child support order terminated about 6 months ago. My ex did not show up to court, and we basically just said that we are a 2 parent household capable of supporting our child without support from an absent father. It was pretty easy. A few weeks ago, we had our lawyer send a letter to my ex's address that he was served his court summons at requesting that he comply in terminating his parental rights.   His mother has recently sent me a long and vicious email basically stating that she has been paying his child support the entire time the order was current and that she 1. wants all of the money back and 2. is planning on hiring lawyers to dispute parental rights termination for her son.   We are meeting with our lawyer next week, but I am just sitting here thinking of all the worst case scenarios in the meantime. I was honestly expecting this to go smoothly. My ex has never shown any interest in being a father, and I had figured he would be happy to no longer pay support.   I am having trouble finding any information online about the legality of paying somebody else's child support order. It seems to me that his mother made a conscious decision to pay every month despite having no obligations and me never asking her for anything. I can't imagine that she would have any right to this money back.   Furthermore, could this potentially help our case if we do have to sue for parental right termination? I basically have proof that my ex was not paying child support. This seemed like our biggest deterrent if we did have to sue, because the payments were made on time every month. I was just banking on the fact that I thought he would just sign rights over without issue.   I still do not know if my ex has even received this information. His address is a duplex that his mother owns, and she lives in the other unit, so it's possible that she intercepted his mail. I know he was served with the child support mod papers, but I can't say that he received this letter. I think our next step may be to send another copy through certified mail, which we probably should have done in the first place. I did not anticipate any of this happening.   Is there anything to do right now besides wait until Monday to talk to our lawyer? I feel like the answer to that is probably ""no"", but I feel really helpless and attacked right now and that's a shitty feeling. Any advice is appreciated."	Yes

Obligatory this post is not about me but about my fiance (22 M). It is also necessary for me to say that him and I live in WA but his daughter lives in FL so this is a Florida state matter.  So my fiance got a girl pregnant when he was living in Florida. The child is now three years old (possibly 4 but I am pretty sure she's only 3). Anyway, his daughter was born while he was in basic training and he is now active duty military stationed here in WA which is where I met him and it is where he has been since. The mother of his child requested that he have a paternity test and he agreed. This was a little over a year ago. Since he has taken the test (it was positive), he has had to pay an ordered amount in child support since then which is automatically deducted from his pay and was slammed with owing around $12,000 in back child support which he now makes extra payments every month on that as well to keep him from going to jail. Additionally, the mother of his daughter refuses to let him see her or even have any contact with her. He always pays his support since he has had to and has no criminal history of any kind or any reason for him not to see her. I assume since he is required to pay child support, he has joint custody of the child even though he does not live there. He is also not named on her birth certificate.  So my question for anyone who has been in this situation before or anyone who has knowledge of FL laws regarding this, what rights does my fiance have to see his daughter and additionally, is it right that he now owes so much money in back child support from before he took the paternity test and how can we resolve this situation for him?  Also, there is talk from him about wanting to surrender his rights over. His logic is that if he isn't allowed to see her, why bother paying child support for her. So fine people of Reddit, can you give me any advice?	Yes
"We didn't have lawyers and went the mediator route, everything was pretty standard and even got a little more than most. I pay 20% for child support, I get him all summer, every weekend and Thursdays, most holidays, rotate Christmas break etc.   We live in Central Texas and she is in school. When we were deciding where she could take him the options were this and surrounding counties or 'without regard for geographic location'. I didn't want to rule out Dallas and Austin since those are her best bets for work, that was the discussion we had and that was the understanding when I signed it - certainly no word about moving out of state. Now, however, she's threatening to move to Connecticut and laughing at me for being stupid and signing it - which....she isn't wrong. I was trying to think about her finding a good job so my son would have a decent place to live. Now it seems ""I've made a huge mistake"".   We only have the custody and child support agreement at this point and neither of us have filed for divorce (she needed an operation and my insurance so we waited for that to be over with).   What are my options in getting that one part changed in the custody agreement? Is that something that will be revisited when we get to the actual divorce? I'm retired military so I don't have a whole lot of money for a lawyer but if it's my only option is there anything I can ask for specifically to cut down some of the costs?"	Yes
So the title says my STBX and I are getting divorced. There was a domestic incident tonight and I'm filing for a restraining order in the morning. I've read the documents online but I'm still confused on whether or not I need to file for temporary custody of our son separately or if that will be granted with the OFP?  I'm in MN. 	Yes
Hello, the home I share with my husband has cameras inside it that we put up to protect expensive equipment. I recently found out he wants a divorce; he logged me out of the cameras but I was able to log back into them. I have video and audio of him cheating with another woman when we were together. I also have audio after he asked for the divorce telling his friend that he was happy that I was okay with settling and giving him the house. He also admitted to other incidents of cheating. Will I be able to use the audio and video in court? He has no idea that I have them. My belongings are still inside the house which we jointly own.	Yes

Rather than the traditional route of donating through a company (which after some research I decided was not for me) I found a site that does it in a similar fashion to a dating site, which seems much less carefully tracked. Is it possible I could be sued for child support or other risk factors for this? Should or could I draft up some kind of legal waver and how would I go about doing so if I did? For further information the site I use is www.coparents.com	Yes
My father over the past couple years (parents divorced 4 years ago) has been alright, if not hard to deal with. But lately, whenever I forget to do something he will always yell at me and harass me, calling me another lazy millennial and saying that my mom is raising me to be a pussy. At the time of the divorce, my mom was living alone and had a low wage job. She is now in a slightly higher paying job and is married, making her much more capable of sustaining a family now. She has decided to take my dad to court and he has already been served the papers with the new custody plan, but I'm just not quite sure if the change in her financial situation on top of my not wanting to live with my dad is enough, and am mostly looking for confirmation.	Yes
Florida. My father collects disability and hardly gets by as it is. He rents a small trailer that's 3 bedroom 2 bath. It's not much, but it's his. He doesn't get food stamps or other assistance other than disability. I have a sister in the area that has 2 girls and 1 stepson. They bought a fix it up house in the area. For the last couple years they let everything go. No ac, no refrigerator, no heat, and the water was undrinkable. The stepson is in the care of the biological grandmother. My sister lets call her, lazy and her boyfriend (father of her 2nd daughter) let's call him doofus. Well they would randomly come over to my dads house unannounced to stay the night because their power would constantly get shut off. Of course my dad would them and the girls stay. It would usually just happen for a couple of days here and there. Over time they stopped having people over. Later it was discovered how bad the house got. Fleas biting you constantly, and the mess was apparently terrible. My other sister made a surprise visit and just broke down into tears. She immediately just started cleaning. We thought that the situation was getting better but soon after thy showed up at my dads house because the power got shut off again. This was back in February. They are still there. My dad was currently caring for my 17 year old sister who just turned 18, graduated and moved in with me to start college in Nevada. The oldest daughter is currently with me. I don't have custody, but my sister let me have her for the summer. I just got permission to let her stay with me until she can get on her feet. Lazy and doofus eat all the food, pay $0 in bills causing my dad to borrow money constantly from family just so that the kids could eat food. Doofus works full time as a welder and apparently they can afford to move back home. My dad is being stepped all over just because they are living for free. The only bills they have is $300 for rent, electric and car insurance. They pay my dad nothing and even have their hand out for gas money. Lazy goes to a methadone clinic 1 1/2 hours away every other day costing them a lot in gas and of course money for the drug. All of their money seems to go toward this. I know that doofus smokes pot as well. They could go to a clinic closet to home but it's run by the government so they would actually have to go to meetings and whatnot. My dad offered to buy them a refrigerator, and reccently offered to pay their electric bill so they can move back into their old place. Doofus replied with, no reason to it will just get shut off again. The kids were going hungry and there was 6 people living in a small place. It was crazy. I now have the oldest daughter, and my 18 year old sister. I have no idea what I'm doing. Lazy said I can let her start school out her and whatever paperwork I need let me know and she'll sign it or whatever. I'll save that for another post. My poor sad is at his wits end. They are clearly taking advantage of him and he can't see the kids suffer so he does everything he can but it's not enough. He wants them out but who really wins? The second daughter will still be suffering and I can't take care of everyone. The issue here is that the landlord doesn't know doofus, lazy, and their daughter are staying there. It's supposed to be a single family home so he could get evicted. Can my dad still start an eviction notice? We could have to get CPS involved for second child but we are all scared because we are all stretched thin as it is and don't know who can actually care for her effectively. I just had a baby myself. I went from no one to 3 kids to take care of. I should also note that the fixer up house was bought by doofus's mom outright and they just pay her $300/month. That's why they haven't lost it. I'm sure she's upset she hasn't been getting paid, however, I'm not aware of any written contract or that she wants to sell or get rid of the house. Any help here would be greatly appreciated. I honestly have no idea what I'm doing. I'm just trying to scoop everyone up and take care of everyone, but I can't. They need a wake up call. They're older than me and sleeping in my dads couch. It's shameful to take advantage of my dad, and even more shameful to not even care for the kids. When the oldest came out here she didn't even have a pair of shoes to wear on the plane. This is bad. But they need to step up and take care of their family.	Yes
My ex has filed a domestic violence protection act against me, asserting that I had yelled at her, but nothing further than that in the instant.  While I did yell at her for one sentence in the midst of her yelling at me, this seems rather arbitrary and there was no assertion of violence (and never has there been in the past).  I have only contacted her since to apologize for yelling and to arrange a time for her to come and get her things.  More importantly she also asserted in this that previously I had made her leave the residence which we were staying (for which I was the only one on the lease and the only one paying rent) and she had no where to go during this time.  I can document that this is not true, that I only asked her to leave for one night and that she had her own separate residence to stay in.  Also that I had assaulted her by touching her sexually while she was sleeping and could not give consent (while we were dating and having consensual sex), which is also false but of course there is no way for me to prove this.  Are there any repercussions of this?	Yes
 So me and my ex wife filled out all the paper work for a divorce, (No lawyers) nothing contested, we did it jointly, have everything sorted out already as we've been apart since 2012. Sent it in, judge sends it back saying I need to send in affidavit and 2 years taxes and a reason why I'm not paying the full amount per month. Me and my ex wife have agreed on amount that works for her and I contribute with the purchasing of what he needs when he stays with me on top of what I give her per month. My question is we have both agreed and signed off on an amount that works for us, how do we say this to the judge without him making me pay full amount?	Yes
"I'll try to keep this short. My boyfriend has been pressing for an open relationship for months. I told him no. Finally, two days ago he said that we were now in an open relationship.   I told him it doesn't work like that and that both of us had to agree.   He said he owed our boss a favor, and I was going to help pay it off. My boss, last night, told me to stay late and told me my boyfriend said I was ""fair game"". I told him I didn't consent to have sex, which of course didn't stop him. He made me shower when we were done.  He sent me home with my boyfriend, and I have been there since ... I don't know what to call it - the rape?   I want to leave, or press charges but my boyfriend won't let me do either.   Can I even press charges with no physical evidence?  Do I need his permission to break up with him?   My parents gave me to him when I was 17, like to date... Kinda like an eventual marriage.  We are now 19 but not married. I don't know if this affects anything.   TL;dr: my boyfriend told my boss to rape me and won't let me break up with him. Please help.   Dallas, Texas"	Yes
"Sadly, my fiance and I of 10 years are getting separated. We have a wonderful 6 year old child and have owned a home together for 2 years. Due to her infidelity, staying together is no longer an option in our lives. We purchased a home in 2015 for approx. $275,000. The home is in a good neighborhood and the value has raised since the purchase. I believe it is now worth near $400,000 due to the crazy housing market of our city. Her wonderful father helped us out greatly in acquiring our home. He gave us $10,000 for a down payment and co-singed on the mortgage as well. He hasn't helped in any other way financially. We both appreciate everything he has done for us.  We both pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. Her and I have always split bills 50/50. I have 2 utilities in my name, she has 2 in hers. She generally handles the finances so the mortgage payment to the bank comes from her checking account. I pay her in cash every month for my share of the mortgage and we split all other things right down the middle. I would like to hope we both remain civil in this process, but there is no telling what will happen in the future.   What are my options? I love living here, and I would hate to lose my house that I have worked so hard for. I kind of feel she is the one who should move out do to her infidelity, but that means little in court. I have very little money in the bank, and very few assets. What will happen if we decide to sell it? What will happen if we can not agree on who gets to remain living here? What if we decide to remain ""business partners"" and keep the house and rent it out? I am lost and confused and don't know my rights. Any advice would be much appreciated."	Yes
"We got divorced earlier this year. I got full physical custody of the kids, but we share legal. She was supposed to look after them during the afternoon hours, however, she does not. When we got the lawyers, I asked him ""What if she does not?"" ""Then she has to pay someone to look after the kids."" No alimony and no child support, however, I do owe her some money. We split the equity of the house and she got half. I am paying her that money over the next couple of years.   Today, she asked me if I have her August money. I did not reply back to her message yet. Since she is unavailable and does not look after the kids, do I still have to give her the money? I am paying a nanny out of my pocket. For hours that she is suppose to cover.   Can I just tell her ""No, because I need the money for nanny services or do I have to go through the court system?"""	Yes
Hi, I have a software company that actually doesn't have any money in it, besides a couple of hundred dollars in bank, and I'm going through divorce. (it's an LLC, solo to my name)  My soon to be ex is fine with me having all rights, etc. on the company, but how would that be legally phrased?  I have a lawyer, and he will put in something, but if there's some specific Intellectual-Property advice I can get, then we could put that statement in.  Or maybe a generic statement of me getting entire business is enough?  There's some code there, i don't think it's of value, i just don't want there to be a battle over the business later, if I continue the business and actually make a profit in the future.	Yes
We live in Kentucky and my wife got a DUI / OVI in Ohio. We have multiple kids around the toddler age. I have documented proof of infidelity via messages from a former partner of hers. We both have college degrees. Neither of us have criminal records (except for her recent DUI). My wife does have an alcohol issue, but it's never been treated nor documented in any formal way (minus the DUI). I will more than likely file for a divorce. Do I stand a chance of gaining full custody of my kids? What's a best case scenario?	Yes
Hi everyone, I (22f) have a question on how my husband and i should handle child support. So my husband is the military and we stationed in VA, he was recently contacted by social services about a former girlfriend who claims to have had his kid. Now we haven't done a paternity test yet, (we will have one done in about 2wks), but we are 98% the kid is his due to timing. So since we are pretty sure, my husband contacted the woman and spoke to her and discussed what it is she wanted for support and they both agreed to a few terms once the paternity test is completed and positive. So here is my question. The kid and mom are in TN and we are in VA, how do we go about through the court systems to sign something that states what we have agreed on since we are in different states?	Yes
Long story short I am leaving for a couple of days to clesr my head and possibly commit suicide( no one knows this. I just bought a 20 gauge and am hoping this will work) but my question is. If I am not around and my ex girlfriend who is staying with her ex attempted to let me have our son for a night ? Or if everyone just thought that I was gone for awhile would I be okay if I came back? What would happen if I didn't come back and I had a CPS case open against her? 	Yes
(NC) - A GAL has been assigned to our case, per my ex-husband's request. I have paid my half of the fee and signed the contract - he still has not. Court is on Aug 24th to determine if I can move out of state and if yes, grant a temp custody order. A custody hearing will be held Nov 22, my ex filed a counter-motion seeking full custody in my response to my motion requesting to move to another state. What impact will it have on the case of HR continues to procrastinate on the GAL payment/contract in order to force a delay? Will a judge see his ploy or just grant the continuance even though it is a red calender date for both hearings?	Yes
Say a judge rules at the conclusion of a divorce proceeding that the husband is responsible for $10,000 of tax debt incurred during the short marriage and $5,000 of the party who filed for divorce's attorney fees. The judge orders the 10k to be paid by December 2017 (6 months from the ruling) and the attorney's fees paid within 90 days. Can the person the judge ruled against file bankruptcy to avoid paying the court ordered fees?	Yes
I'm honestly not sure if this belongs in /r/legaladvice, /r/divorce or /r/parenting.. I apologize if this is the wrong sub.  For the bot: Texas. Throw-away just because.  I got divorced in 2015 and am the father of 3 kids (two teen sons - I'll call S and J - and a pre-teen daughter - I'll call M) and I got custody of them late last year.  Both boys are in the Autism spectrum, with J also having anger issues. S has ADHD as well. M doesn't have an issues. All three kids are in counseling. The boys are also medicated.  My ex lives with her folks and we follow the standard visitation schedule for the state.  My ex messaged me recently saying J was being argumentative and disrespectful. They're staying with her right now for an extended visit. Ex's father has had it with J's behavior and doesn't want J to come back until J gets his act together. My ex expects me to keep J on the weekends when his siblings go to visit. The resulting melt-down J will have is not something I or my fiancee are wanting to deal with. Plus, we deal with J's and S's arguing on a near-constant basis and need the break.  Can my ex really decide to not have one of her children come for the visit?   I did have the same divorce lawyer deal with the paperwork for the recent custody issue, but to be quite frank he wasn't the greatest attorney and I really don't want to go back to him. I cannot personally afford a consultation right now.	Yes
Hey not-lawyers,  My parents have been separated for around twenty years now, but never got legally divorced. For some of that time, they co-parented me under one roof. A few years back, my mother moved across the states to Michigan to live with a new partner, and my dad remained in CA. They'd talked back and forth about divorcing a few times, but it never went anywhere. My dad is under the impression that without my mother's full cooperation, there's no way to divorce her. The thing is, my mother isn't *against* the divorce - just way too dysfunctional to do any of the paperwork, and she doesn't seem to care whether it happens.  Obviously, this is not ideal. I'm concerned that if my father passed away unexpectedly, everything he owns might go directly to her, and that if the reverse happened he might continue to be liable for her debts in some way (she has loads). Does anyone know what kind of options he might have to get the process started on his own, and what might it be like?	Yes
Basically I have a friend who is determined to legally change her name every 5 - 10 years. Her reasons are not nefarious but bizarre. She has already changed her full legal name three times and intends to continue. I think, even though she's not doing it for criminal reasons, that she is opening herself up to problems down the road.  The following is a fictitious example of what kind of name change has occurred:  Lauren Miriam Brown to-&gt; Elizabeth Jadzia Tolson to-&gt; Ava Vivian Grimes	Yes
State: Alabama To keep things short, my girlfriend is currently 16 (I'm one year older so don't make any assumptions, reddit). She's been living with her dad for the past five years of her life, and its been tearing her apart. Her father is an asshole who hates her and keeps her in the house 24/7. Currently she is with her grandmother, but because her father is still her legal guardian he wants to take her back into his home. Her dad also does things such as hit her, and recently he slipped up and hit her in front of her grandmother.   Now that he's threatening to take her back into his home, the grandmother is threatening legal action on him. What I'm wondering is if there may be any way that a judge will allow her grandmother custody without having a trial. There is no way he would win a custody battle in his current state, and definitely after both her, and the grandmother can testify that he physically abuses her. I was also made aware that Alabama recently changed the age in which a teen can leave the home of their guardian from 17 to 18.   I just want to hear all of you guys' opinions on this and what may be a good course of action that would prevent her from having to even look at her father again because he's truly a monster.	Yes
The way i worded it in the title makes this seems a lot more civil than it is. My uncle cousin and aunt lived with my grandmother (uncles mother). Friday my grandmother and aunt got into a fight and my aunt left calling it the straw that broke her back. My uncle is completely fine separating from her, but he needs to see his daughter. My aunt told my uncle not to come to her parents house or her dad will shoot him. My uncle's response was to call his cousins and nephews (including me) to do a home invasion style re-kidnapping of his daughter. I told him how shitty that will look in court, not to mention the danger we'd be in (the old man with a gun would get at least 2 of us).  After calming him down and convincing him to see a lawyer Thursday (earliest appointment) he is now irate at the thought of not being able to see his child for at least a week. It seems like he's starting to move the pieces for his raid again but this time leaving me out.  What can I do to help my uncle see his child today (sun/mon are his days off)? My grandmother went to the hospital and is working on getting a birth paper copy to give to the police, thinking this will allow him to legally kidnap the his child while the aunt is at work; will this work or at least allow him a visit?  Florida.	Yes
Hi,  How can I get a marriage license for a wedding that's held overseas? The ceremony would be next summer, which I think excludes some states. We want to get married under US law, by a person who fills the US requirements (e.g. pastor), not a foreign government official. Is there a way to manage this? Thank you!	Yes
I'm in montgomery county pennsylvania i filed for divorce in january since then she's filed 2 false pfas against me shes been taking 500 dollars a month from my disability on top of the 1000 a month i give her for child support. This morning i woke up to a knock on the door it was the county sherriff serving me with a PFA saying that i held a gun to her head back in February. They took my gun and i have a court date next thursday what can i do to prove everything is false.	Yes
He kicked me out at the beginning of the month and I have all overnights with our daughter because she is nursing. Is there really a law saying you don't have to pay child support to your child's mom until she is 18? 	Yes
 Hello, thank you for taking the time to read this, first of all. I will go direct to the point. 1) My ex has blocked me from contact with my daughter for the past 3 weeks. 2) She moved out of state without my permission and has left the country without my authorization as well.  3) My daughter and adopted son ( my ex‚Äôs son) are being home schooled, without me knowing about it. And I thought they were going to a regular school.  We got divorced 6 years ago in NH, with her having primary physical custody (Not the same as sole custody according to NH parenting plan form). We also have joint decision making over the two kids. The divorce decree mentioned that she will be able to relocate to Arizona, and so they did. Throughout the 6 years, I signed a consent once when they moved to Dallas, another when they lived in California, the times they have traveled and so on.   I just found out through my mother (who lives in southamerica) that she arrived to Peru last Saturday. My ex contacted her a day before (maybe so that it doesn‚Äôt seem like child abduction? ). My mother, since she doesn‚Äôt see her grand kids as much (maybe once a year), agreed to have them for a few hours and they had a great time.  My ex's mother also lives in Peru but in a distant city, and it is worth mentioning that that city has had mayor flash floods and slides which have destructed some of that city this past summer (winter there), making it a dangerous place to be at. This is where my kids are currently and I don‚Äôt know for how long exactly, although they said something being around Christmas to my mother as well.  Apparently according to my daughter, they have been living in Hawaii since May, last time I saw her was on January and I have always thought they were in Arizona, since that‚Äôs where they have been living for the past year and a half or so ( I am not entirely sure at this point).   I‚Äôd really like to know what the best next steps are and what can I accomplish. Ideally I wouldn't like to separate them from their mother but I am starting to doubt that it'd be the best for the kids to be with her long term with this type of upheavals; this is the 7th time or more that my ex and her bf move with the kids in 6 years. I cant let this go on and I have been passive enough. What are my options? I have done some research but there is a lot of contradictions even with lawyers.  Is this abduction? Child kidnapping? I read the definition of both and somewhat it fits. Would the fact that my mother having been in contact with my daughter and son contradict the fact that could be a possible abduction?  I also want to put a stop to this and not just be in touch or see my kids whenever they decide it's ok (my ex and her bf). I honestly have put up with a lot, I also have tried the ‚Äúmaybe later on my daughter will reflect and look for me‚Äù. I think this is has been enough.  Thank you in advance for the advice and thank for taking the time to read this.	Yes
"Hello friends,  So I am in quite the predicament and needing some help from reddit!  This is a throwaway account as the person discussed is also a regular visitor.  My fiance and I recently found out that we are moving due to a job I received.    Background: We are both currently living in an apartment near her mother.  About 1.5 years ago, her mother helped her find an apartment and purchased several pieces of furniture to help her furnish the new place.  Her mother obviously not on the lease nor has keys.   Fast-forward to today: Her mother is demanding that she give back all the things that she ""loaned"" to her to furnish the apartment.  She is obviously upset that we are moving away and is trying to do anything to force us to stay nearby.  She has threatened to take us to court for ""her"" belongings.  Are we obligated to give back every item her mother purchased for the apartment?  This includes: a futon, bed frame, kitchen table, bar stools, and entertainment center.  Thanks again everyone for all your help."	Yes
In the U.K. If a minor runs away from home (due to bad parenting) can they face any kind of charges (so long as no laws are broken) and also, if they stop at a friends house and the friend doesn't tell the authorities can they face charges too?	Yes
"My older sister has always had mood and mental troubles, but they are getting steadily worse as she ages. I'm getting very, very worried about her and I think it's time to step in with her common-law spouse and get her help (whether she agrees to it or not). She has a small child (age 4) in her care to worry about, as well.  Some of the things going on with her: 1. She thinks I call up her sister in law and brag about how I tell everyone that she didn't breastfeed her kid, that her and her partners are only common-law and not officially married, and that she's a cam girl. I have never met this person and I have no idea how to get into contact with her. 2. She thinks there are cameras and microphones in her home, placed by her in laws to spy on her. 3. She sits around all day looking at people's social media profiles, applying make up, and taking selfies. 4. She picks at zits until she tears up her skin and scars herself. She bleaches, dyes, bleaches, and dyes her hair until it's fried. 5. She stopped speaking to me before the birth of her second child (the 4 year old) because I casually asked her about her birth plan and she formed a delusion that I was going to send social services to the hospital to take her baby. 6. She ruined her relationship with her common law spouse, and blames it on him ""being into trannies."" 7. She has a certificate in assisting in a health field, but refuses to work. She insists she needs more certifications to make more money. When she interned in her field, she posted on social media about how disgusting the patients were. 8. She thinks everyone is jealous of her, out to get her, and constantly talking about her. 9. She thinks a guy she romantically rejected in high school (as in 20 years ago) installed a key logger on her computer to spy on her for revenge.  She lives in a different state than me (Colorado) and is not communicating with me after her last aggressive, delusional episode. How can I get her to a psychiatrist or in for an involuntary psychiatric hold (if that's what it takes)?  tl;dr: My older sister in Colorado is delusional and has a small child in her care. I might need to force psychiatric help on her. How?"	Yes
Hey guys! Hoping I'm posting this in the right place! I'm a transguy from the Tampa Bay Area (in FL) and I need someone to point me in the right direction here regarding two documents I desperately need amended. First being my birth certificate, second being my marriage certificate.   FIRST: I called the county courthouse for my area and spoke with a lovely supervisor, who all but told me I'm fucked in regards to having the name changed on my marriage license, despite the fact that, according to Social Security, the DMV, and the court system in general, the person my wife married technically doesn't even exist! Flabbergasted and dumbfounded here, friends. I NEED that marriage license amended for my wife's second round with USCIS in 1.5 years so she can get her permanent green card, as I was her primary petitioner, but in my OLD name; very fearful of that screwing with our case / invalidating our marriage!   SECOND: In regards to the birth certificate, I have a doctor who can vouch for me, in addition to my court order for my name change, but I cannot afford (and don't necessarily even desire) the complete list of gender confirmation surgeries Florida seems to require an individual have in order to have their birth cert. amended - soooo, I'm in a bit of a pickle here. The wife did some digging and found out that an underage transguy in Miami went to court over this, won his case, and to be honest, I'd be willing to go to court over it but I don't necessarily want to have this thing drag out.  So maybe I'm just missing something here, but does anybody know if there are any ways around these two issues so I can get my documents amended to reflect my actual identity? Any guidance or advice would be greatly appreciated!	Yes

I purchased a duplex from the estate of the homeowner, who about 2 years before he died had rented the other half of the duplex to a young-ish couple. The lease is month-to-month. One major remodel of the half the homeowner had lived in later, I'm preparing to tackle the side with in situ tenants. So on  April 30 I served them with a 90 day notice that the lease would be terminating as of Aug 1. Immediately they stopped paying rent, &amp; early July I filed s 72-hour pay rent or quit for the three months unpaid rent. Of course they didn't pay, &amp; so next is the forcible entry &amp; I had the first appearance last week. They agreed to move out by August 1, so if that happens it is fine. Here is the problem: part of the stipulated order was I got to do an inspection of the unit, &amp; what was over there was just appalling: rotten food, stench of dog feces, unbelievable amounts of trash &amp; garbage everywhere. And they have a little 15-16 month old kid in the middle of this. There was also make evidence of domestic violence -- every hollow core door had 1 or 2 fist size hikes. Also, there's a pit bull that already has attacked one of the tenants, causing the dad to break an ankle (and  a window). Also lots of screaming could be heard at times. Also also I do a free legal search &amp; it turns out mom has been charged with oxycodone possession (dropped) &amp; theft (pled guilty), dad is a registered sex offender for a pretty gruesome sex crime on a young girl (served time), &amp; both have multiple evictions. Also, during the course of the eviction, both got extremely upset that I might be photographing pill bottles, which they said they were in the process of throwing away.  So, what I am worried about is this cute little kid. If I bring this up to an attorney, will he/she gave a duty to report to CPS if I show the pictures of the dangerous squalor this kid has been living in? Or is this hopeless?  This is Oregon.	Yes
After some financial and relationship issues, I have been given a few opportunities from family to start over.  One is living in a basement apartment with my Aunt, the other is taking over my grandmother's house as she is only there 3 months (camps in summer and goes to AZ in winter).  Both are not in Iowa where I have resided for 10 years and where my son was born.  I have a 5 year old son.  His father has never held a job and currently lives with family members.  Also has a history of meth use and I believe he is not clean as he states due to his behaviour.  We were never married.  He is listed on the birth certificate.  I have solely provided for my son his whole life.  I did file for child support but the best they could do was have my son added to Medicaid under him as he has no recorded income.  I am not in a position where I can afford a lawyer and not sure if I qualify for assistance as I make just above the maximum for various assistance programs.  I did have a no contact order when I first left him that granted me custody and he had supervised visitations for a month then had to provide a clean drug test to be granted unsupervised visits. He failed to provide drug testing and all visits were revoked.  He also went to jail for violating the no contact.  Some advice from people claiming they have done this is as follows...  Because we were never married and do not have a current custody agreement, I as the mother, automatically has full custody and can move anywhere I want with my child(ren). The father would have to bring the mother to court for custody.    This seems a little vague and too easy.  Advice?	Yes
Sorry in advance for the length. I live in CT, fyi.  Seven years ago my then-wife and I bought a condo. It was put in her name but everything including the down payment was split down the middle. We divorced four years later in July 2015 (without lawyers) and we agreed that I would continue living there since she could move in with her mom rent-free. The divorce decree said I would continue paying half the mortgage until it sold and at that point we'd split the money we made (if any). I wanted to cut my losses and walk away since the condo isn't tied to me at all, but she refused to sign the papers unless I agreed to continue paying half the mortgage until it sold.  She said it'd go on the market as soon as it was show-ready. I gave it a good cleaning and bought some nice decorations and new couches for staging. it looked better than when we bought it. She said then it'd go on the market in the spring because that's when most people look for new homes. That never happened. A year ago we agreed that my new girlfriend could move in and take over paying half the mortgage until it sold. So, at that point my ex wasn't paying anything except property tax. After several months it still wasn't on the market. I told her it needed to be put on the market and sold ASAP so we both could move on with our lives. She said she met with a real estate agent friend and the condo is now worth a hell of a lot less than what we paid for it. She said we'd have to keep paying the mortgage for 3 more years until we sell it to break even.  This is unacceptable. It's been 2 years since the divorce and we've made no progress. I desperately want to move and be done with my ex once and for all, but because of our divorce agreement I feel stuck. Moving and taking on a second mortgage/rent is not a possibility -- I barely make enough to cover my bills as it is.  I'm planning on meeting with a lawyer soon to see what my options are, if I even have any. Before I do that, I'd like to hear what /r/legaladvice has to say. Would it be possible to take her back to court and have the divorce agreement revised? I want nothing more than to walk away from this damn condo and create a new life with my girlfriend.  *tl;dr: I agreed to continue paying have the mortgage of a condo in my ex-wife's name. She is no longer paying her half of the mortgage as that's been taken over by my girlfriend. Ex expects me to continue paying for another 3 years so the condo will break even when it sells.*	Yes
I am filling out a fl-300 RFO form to request spousal support or a portion of my ex husbands 401k. I was married for 20 years in Northern California to an acholholic. When I finally left the marrige (no children), out of fear, minipulation and intimidation I didn't ask for any support in the divorce. I only left with a few boxes of my personal items and credit card dept. I lost my job last year after 9 years with the company and can't find work. My unemployment has run out and I'm broke and staying with family. I'm not sure how to request for what I deserve on this form. I'm not even sure what his yearly income is at this time. I know that when I left him two years ago he made $80,000 a year and had over $200,000 in retierment. I can not afford a lawer so I'm trying to do this myself. Any advise will help. Thank you	Yes
I have a friend who is a minor who lives in the UAE (united arab emirates) whose parents just divorced. They are all citizens of the US and not of the UAE. There may be some up-coming custody issues and what court system they would take place in would completely change the outcome. So the question is where would the decision take place? In the US where they are citizens, or in the UAE where they live most of the year?	Yes
Could my father's dept be transferred to me after my parents get a divorce? Btw my mom will be getting full custody 	Yes
"Long story short. California case. Husband had temporary restraining order placed on him, and I filed for divorce. He has a charge of domestic violence. Actual restraining order was not granted. (Judge HATED my attorney.) Judge ordered a ton of things, including a social services investigation on our child. Husband and I worked things out, don't live together but want to stay married. I filed a form for dismissal of the divorce, and was told all upcoming hearings would be dropped. Guess they weren't because I got a letter saying we are being ""sanctioned"" for not appearing  and are due in court to discuss dismissal.. What the hell does this mean? What will likely happen? I'm terrified of this judge, he is extremely powerful. I've never been so terrified of someone in my life. Can someone please give me an idea to what this all means? (Please no judgments on the fact that I'm with my husband still. It would take me days to write out our whole story.) Thank you."	Yes
"SWIM is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this."	Yes
"I am in awe that there is a subreddit for legal advice. August 1st will mark a year since I've seen my daughter. Her mother for no reason other than to hurt me stopped ""letting"" me see my daughter. We have never been to court for custody or child support and I am not concerned with having to pay child support. My daughter is now 6, ive missed her birthday Christmas thanksgiving first say of school!!! Easter Halloween new years everything. I've texted and pleaded with her mother to try and co parent with me. Ive asked Her several times why she is doing this and I've never gotten a reply. The only reply I've ever gotten is her telling me if I want to see my daughter I had to pay the last few months of child support which was 5 months after my ex stopped letting me see her. I live in Georgia, sorry I know I should mention that. I could keep on literally all night long but I have always done everything I could for my daughter. I've been employed the entire time, always split everything with my ex, took my daughter to school (picked up daughter from ex's house and took her to daycare) every morning, she stayed with me on the weekends and some nights during the week. My daughter and I were so close it absolutely wrecks me to think that maybe she thinks I'm not there because I don't love her. I have no idea what she's been telling my daughter but my daughter and I love each other more than anything in the world. She made me promise I wouldn't leave her there and I would come back the last time I saw her. I have not been able to be myself for a year now, such a huge part of my life and heart missing. Thank you so much for any advice I have been lost about this and have always hoped her mother would stop doing this. can anyone tell me what I need to do and how it would go? Thank you so much!!"	Yes
Hello, I just changed my name and got my updated license and social security card with all the new information. I plan to update my bank accounts and credit cards next. I just want to cover my bases and make sure I'm not forgetting anything important.  Is there any sort of checklist after a name change? I graduated from college a few years ago, do I need to contact them and have them send me an updated diploma or something just in case I need proof of graduation in the future?   Thank you for your help	Yes
I'm 20 years old and I've never seen my social security card and passport. My parents keep them in a safe deposit box at the bank. I have reason to believe that my parents will not permit me to retrieve them. What options are available to me if they decline to give me my identification?	Yes
My ex filed a petition for protective order against me claiming harassment. I don't deny I called and texted her multiple times. However, the last time we spoke she said she was planning to move back in. The very next day she filed the petition. Also, on a couple occasions she contacted me first to begin communication. She never ignored my calls or texts and would call or text me back every time. I have evidence through call logs and messaging as proof.   How good of a defense is this to prevent the judge from granting the order? How do I go about articulating she was sending me mixed signals? Please help me, this is seriously stressing me out. I can't afford a lawyer and intend to attend the petition hearing to defend whatever she is claiming I did.	Yes
We have 3 kids and we're going to co-parent/joint custody. We've agreed upon splitting assets and such. We want it to be legal and for our agreements to have legal weight. Our best option? And can we waive the 90-day wait period?  Also a friend and I have recently started a company and I need something legal that she can sign releasing any future claim/stake in this. It started after she wanted to divorce and she has had no hand in it. Is there a waiver for something like this?  **TL/DR** Wife and I are filing for a no fault divorce w/ joint custody of kids. Can we do this without lawyers and keep it inexpensive?	Yes
Some background: I am 17 years old. My mother is a narcissist who thinks the world revolves around her. She and my Stepdad have been together for ~14 years and have a son that age. They've been married about 7 years.  It's clear they've only stayed together for financial reasons and for the three children. My Stepdad loves me and my sister like his own, despite him not being our biological dad. He takes care of us financially by himself and has built a beautiful life for us. Over my lifetime we've gone from poverty to upper-middle class solely because of him.  My mother, on the other hand, has never worked a day in the past 16 years. She spends child support checks from my Realdad on weed, alcohol, and things for herself. (Clothes, takeout, etc.)  About a year and a half ago, Mom was arrested for domestic battery and obstucting a person trying to make a 911 call. I made the call after she attacked me and Stepdad after taking unprescribed oxycodone and mixing it with a LOT of vodka. She was in jail for about 2 days before stepdad bailed her out. We made her stay in a hotel for a week before she swore to change. We dropped the charges. ...and....she didn't change. She's always been emotionally abusive but it started to get worse. My sister, 17 at the time, just had a baby. He was ~5 months at the time. Moms bullshit caused her to move out Feb. 2017 with her fianc√©. This caused Mom to be okay for a while, as she blamed Sister for all of our problems. Recently it's been bad again. It's clear she's on pills again as we know how she acts on them. (more background: She was arrested for prescription fraud about 7 years ago) NOW: Last night Mom and Stepdad got into a big fight. Stepdad had one drink with Bossman before coming home, and Mom freaks and calls him a drunk. This angers Stepdad so he tries to go to bed. Mom decides to go fuck with him and turn on the lights and slam the door to their bedroom. Stepdad breaks the lights out of anger. Mom keeps antagonizing him. Stepdad decides it is in his best interests to leave. I have video of Mom pushing Stepdad out the door. But Mom took all of Stepdads keys, including his work keys issued by his company to his work truck. She claims he's intoxicated and won't let him leave. She finally gives him his keys but won't let me leave with him because Stepdad isn't my legal guardian and claims he has no rights over me.  Stepdad is done. He's filing for divorce but we're scared of what is going to happen with me. I refuse to live with Mom but we don't know if Stepdad can get custody. My Realdad is a homeless druggie, all my grandparents are either blind or deaf, and I refuse to live with any of Moms family.  What are the chances Stepdad will get custody? What are my rights? All 3 kids agrees we would testify under oath that we fucking hate her. Is there anything we can do to give us a better chance? Stepdad is willing to give Mom alimony and half of what we own with no argument. He just wants me and my brother under his custody.   Tl;dr: Stepdad and crazy narcissist Mom getting divorced, trying to be in his custody despite no biological relation.  Sorry for any spelling, I'm on mobile.	Yes
My SD(11) would like to live with us full time. Her mom has a long history of being physically and verbally abusive, but we've never been able to prove it. SD is very unhappy and has mentioned suicide. DH and I have been fighting this for years, but BM is very good at convincing judged and CAS that she is a good mom. She also makes the kids lie to make herself look good.   We are trying to see if there is a way to change custody so SD can live with us without making her go in front of a judge. We aren't even sure if a judge would take her seriously at 11 years old. Does anyone have any advice or resources we can use? We are very concerned for SDs safety and wellbeing.	Yes
I am an adult looking to simply change my last name to my mother's instead of my father's. This is due to uncovering things about my father and things he did to his family members that I find completely and utterly unforgivable. I've found reviews online but all they talk about is the cost. What I want to know is, what is the convenience? Can I take care of the entire process online or will I end up needing to go to court anyway? And how long will the process take?            Thank you.	Yes
"I'm in need of some advice. First I will provide some details on the situation. I live in Canada. I had a daughter with my now ex girlfriend back in 2014. The ex has severe mental health issues, she is diagnosed with borderline personality disorder.   Throughout our relationship she did a number of terrible things. She would verbally attack my friends and family, and she physical attacked me and her family members on several occasions, no charges were ever pressed.  After our break up, we agreeded upon taking our daughter for half of the week. Things went relatively smoothly, other than a few minor episodes of verbal abuse against my family.   About a year ago now, I found out that my ex had become a prostitute. Knowing how my ex is, this concerned me. After texting her under the guise of a client, I learned that she was ""working"" out of her appartment where my daughter lives half of the time.  She claims to never ""work"" when my daughter is there. But my concern is what individuals might come unannounced. Or if a pedophile offered my ex money to do unmentionable things. It's obvious that a child lives in her apartment.  I contacted children's service and informed them of the situation, with screenshots as evidence. When children's services called me back, they told me that prostitution isn't illegal in Canada, and because my daughter isn't there when she's doing it, there was nothing they could do about.  It might also be worth noting that my ex is on disability and is making large amounts of undeclared income.  My question today is what should be my next course of action? Would it be worth it to try to fight for full custody? I tried to get a written custody agreement through a lawyer, but that didn't work as my ex would make unreasonable demands that would constantly change."	Yes
Is there ever an actual legal distinction between these options when filling out forms, and if so, when? What, if any, consequences are there to marking single instead of divorced?  Three examples:  * I imagine that my massage therapist doesn't really need to know I'm divorced, and even if she'd like to know that, I don't think there are any legal consequences for lying on a medical intake form. * On census forms, it maybe makes sense to mark divorced, since the whole point of a census is to gather demographic information, but while by law I am required to fill out the census, I don't see any avenue by which the census would a) know if I lied or b) be able to do anything about it. * On a credit application, I could see it being fraud if I didn't report legal obligations that reduced my available income (alimony, child support), but some states award 'palimony' and you don't have to have ever been married to owe child support, so as long as I disclosed those obligations, it doesn't seem like lying to check single instead of divorced.  I put [WA] for LocationBot, but this is really a general question and I'd be interested in hearing answers to locations other than the US if it differs. And there is no particular situation I'm in prompting me to ask, it's just a combination of:  * plain curiosity. * I'm really sick of something that happened years ago being considered the fourth-most defining characteristic about me (it's often after full name, birthdate, gender). * pedantic irritation about how it's always a radio button instead of a check list even though I am technically both single because I'm not married and divorced because I used to be married, and if I were to re-marry, I would be both married and divorced and it would still be a radio button, unless by dint of getting re-married I am somehow magically 'un-divorced' in the eyes of the form gods.	Yes
Hello. I am from Mississippi. My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We always used birth control. A few months ago, we were fooling around, and, out of the blue, my boyfriend suggested we try to have a baby. I was perplexed because he had always expressed disinterest in children. He started fantasizing about a wonderful family we could have, emphasizing his love and commitment to me. I was so taken aback and, after a few hours, he eventually persuaded me. I probably asked him a hundred times if he was sure, each of which he replied in the affirmative.  Well after a short while, he changed his tune and told me to go back on the pill. I was again confused but obliged. Shortly afterward, I found out I was pregnant. I felt a rush of emotions ‚Äì fear, anxiety, and, surprisingly, joy. I thought it was nice to have a little person growing inside of me, depending on me for support. But I was mostly worried about how my boyfriend would feel. That night, I gradually broached the subject and eventually told him.   He hit the roof and accused me of plotting against him. I reminded him that he persuaded me to try for a baby, and he said that was just stupid pillow talk. He ordered me to ‚Äúget rid of it,‚Äù to which I felt sick. He has known from the very beginning of our relationship that I am terrified by even the thought of an abortion, and he always said felt the same way. I tried to placate and reason with him, but he just kept calling me a lying slut and a bitch. He snapped that I would never get a cent of his money and stormed out.   I was completely flummoxed and scared. I know several single mothers who were abandoned by their boyfriends/husbands and are struggling immensely to raise their children on their own. I swore I would never end up like them. But I know that I cannot raise a baby on my own. I even started considering abortion, but the closest abortion clinic is over a hundred miles away, and abortion is not covered by insurance in my state.   Unfortunately, I could not even have a conversation with my boyfriend, as he kicked me out of our apartment and cut off all communication with me. I spent weeks simply trying to talk to him. He eventually relented, just in time to introduce me to his new girlfriend, seated in the passenger seat of his brand new truck. I felt defeated and gave abortion a second thought but realized I had just passed the 20-week threshold. To top it off, I was fired from my job for unexplained reasons (just days after I put in a request for a larger uniform to accommodate my baby bump).  My boyfriend was the one who coaxed me into going off the pill and making love night after night. He promised me, swore up and down, that he would always be there for the baby and me. And now that we are pregnant, he wants nothing to do with the baby or me. How can he do this? How can a father want nothing to do his own child? Our baby is our creation, and every day, I find myself growing more and more attached to it. When I feel it kicking inside of my stomach, I feel warm and joyful. But I know that I cannot afford to feed and clothe it on my own, and I know that I will not be able to give it up once I hold it in my arms. I really, really do not want to have to go to court, but as my bump grows and my paltry savings diminish, I fear that I may be the only option at this point. I don't care about myself; I only want our baby to have his basic needs met. What can I do?	Yes
"My ex-wife has agreed to reduce the amount of monthly alimony I give to her.. courts.ca.gov says:  ""If the spouses or domestic partners can reach an agreement on a new amount of spousal or partner support, they can write it up as an agreement/stipulation and give it to the judge for signature to have it become a new court order.""  I cannot seem to find anything that really explains how to DIY this process.  Any suggestions?  thanks!"	Yes
My wife's ex-husband took out a $20k student loan in her name back when they were married. It was a physically and verbally abusive relationship so she did nothing about it at the time or during the divorce and since the loans were under her name he said he was not responsible for any of them. Fast forward to current time, I'm helping her pay them off but sick of it and wondering if there's any legal ground for us to sue to make him pay it. He opened them up under her name but they were married at the time so in my mind should both be responsible, at worst case for half of it. Any advice you guys can give would be super helpful, or just let me know if I'm boned here and can't do anything about it.	Yes
In 2005 I had a child with my Ex -- things were not very smooth in the custody process. My ex had primary custody of my daughter up until about 2012 when the state removed the children (she had other children with another father later on) from her due to allegations of abuse and neglect.  In 2012 I was granted sole custody and have maintained sole custody since. The child abuse allegations never came to fruition and she ended up getting all her children back aside from my daughter who is now 12 years old.  My daughter has consistently seen a therapist throughout the years and still suffers from PTSD and has on multiple occasions told the therapist about the abuse she endured (mostly at the hand of my Ex's current husband). Every therapist that she has seen (they have changed as we moved from Montana to St. Louis for a year and then again moved to Colorado about 2 years ago -- all work related moves), all agree that it's in the best interest for my daughter to stay in my custody.  There is a parenting plan in place currently that allows for phone contact. These phone conversations tend to last no more than 10-15 seconds as my daughter has no interest or desire to talk to or be with her biological mother, and in fact gets anxiety from having to have any communication at all.  I have now received certified documents showing that her biological mother is filing a motion to amend a final parenting plan that includes giving her full custody of my daughter, as well as seeking attorney fee compensation, with very little visitation granted to me.  My current plans are to get an attorney here in CO and have the case transferred here as she (my daughter) is a resident here, and has not lived in MT (where this all originally started) in almost 4 years.  Anyone with experience in this kind of situation? How high are the chances that the mother gets what she's seeking?  Asking here, because it's going to take some time to speak with an attorney directly as the weekend approaches and I'm hoping to ease my anxiety.  Thanks!	Yes
Hello,  Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I first communicated to my exwife my concern of overexposition to the stock market two years ago.  She ignored it.  I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax.   I feel overburdened because the stewardship over these funds fall on me.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.  Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months, just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.   Any advice appreciated.	Yes
Wife is currently stationed for A and C school in Texas for the Navy. She had made a deal with me to stay married so she can be accepted into the Navy and she would help me go back to school and finish my degree. She talked me into moving to Texas so she can be close to the kids.  We've been in Texas for a year now.   Since being here she has gone back on a lot things she promised. Has not helped me with school in any way. I've had to quit my job because she wouldn't help with day care costs and couldn't afford it on my own. She doesn't even see the kids more than maybe an hour a week but has loads of time to go out and on trips and hang with her friends. In fact, I'm pretty sure she is dating one of her shipmates.   I've had enough and back in California I have loads of family I can count on to help in taking care of my kid. I also have friends that have offered me jobs that work with my schedule. I can take care of myself and my kid while in California. I want to move back soon. I have friends and family willing to hope me drive my stuff back to California.  So my big question is this, can I file for divorce and consequently take my kid to California with me and finish the divorce there or just wait to file there. My wife lives in the barracks and cannot have her kids. So if I move to California my kids will not be able to stay with my wife.   My next question is what will happen to my step son? He has known me as dad for for 5 years but I never legally adopted him and his not biologically mine. He has autism and I love him but right now he's too much for me to handle; not to mention the place where I'll be moving to in California is big enough for me and my biological kid. I have his biological dad's contact information and he's always wanted to be more in his life so I'm sure he'll take him. So do I send him to his dad's or do I make my wife figure it out?   My last question is what will happen to my wife. Will it affect her career? Can I ask for support for my daughter and me since I had to quit my job for her to successfully join the Navy?  TLDR:  Can I move my daughter with me from Texas to California while my wife is stationed in Texas?  Do I file for divorce in Texas or California?  Can I get support from my wife for daughter and myself?	Yes
"My boyfriend and I met at work, and both had their health insurance. I quit after getting a different job, but I don't have health insurance. ""I'll just add you to mine"" he says, because we knew that company doesn't require marriage. Neither of us are interested in getting officially married, and if we were, it wouldn't be right this second.   Well, after looking into adding me to his insurance, it does say it requires a domestic partnership affidavit.  As far as I can tell, you can get one of those in a bunch of counties in NY (not my county) but most have residency requirements. The exceptions are the cities of Albany, Ithaca, and Rochester. Albany is 1.5 hours away, Ithaca 3.5 hours, and Rochester 4 hours. I was not opposed to driving down to Albany, but then I saw the rules. (see links below)  We have lived together over 6 months, but his driver's license address is his mom's because he cosigned her mortgage for her, and there was a whole thing about residency. That house is right up the road from us. I own my house and the utilities are all in my name, and he doesn't have a lease with me. He's just here. We do have a joint bank account so I can provide a document for that. His car insurance and pay stubs list our address. He got the motorcycle license endorsement in May, so his driver's license issue date is not over 6 months ago, which Albany seems to require, right?  Ithaca doesn't seem to have all these rules. It looks like you just show up, sign the paper, and you're domestic partners. However, they are only open on week days and the 3.5 hour drive each way would result in an entire day spent. I'm fine with doing that, I just want to be sure it's really necessary instead of going to Albany.   I can't seem to find any google or reddit examples of domestic partnerships in NY state...everything that comes up is for NYC, or for state employees, or counties we don't live in.   Does anyone know anything about domestic partnership in New York state? Is Ithaca really the place we'll need to go?  [Albany DP rules](http://www.albanyny.org/_files/DomesticPartnershipsInformation.pdf) / [law code](http://ecode360.com/7683425)  [Ithaca](http://www.cityofithaca.org/177/Domestic-Partnership) /  [law code](http://ecode360.com/8390659) / [Form](http://www.cityofithaca.org/DocumentCenter/View/193)"	Yes

My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	Yes
I went no contact with my mother about 6 months ago after years of dealing with her violent alcoholism, her undermining my choices as a parent, her blatant favoritism and targeting of my children, and the straw that broke the camel's back, her running a background check on my SO in an attempt to persuade me to break up with him. I just received a certified letter from her asking me to contact her to set up visitation for her and my children. It didn't explicitly say anything about her taking further steps, but it seems like that's the direction she's trying to move. If she does take me to court for visitation what sort of information would be pertinent to document? Are her chances of winning high? (We live in Nevada) I can get several character witnesses on my side if I need to. I'm just not sure if I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thanks in advance for any advice. ETA- should I respond to her letter and reiterate my stance on her visiting the children?	Yes
So I have been separated since 2014, filed for divorce in October 2015. I have sent several offers to hopefully soon to be ex wife's attorney to end the marriage. Never once has she countered any offer or given her own offer of what she wants. All she has done is fight against things I have tried to keep (children visitation).   I am a veteran and retired in October 2016. Didn't have a job when I got out due to hiring freeze at military shipyard where I lived due to Obama and approaching election. I paid support of what I could until I got job in February. I was half a month behind in support and she tried to get me for support in arrears. I had to use tax return to come current. And again no offers from her. Started new job she again took me to court for support modification since now making more money. Sent her offers and still nothing to try and settle this.   Now my question is it seems to me something is keeping/making her want to stay married. It's not my military retirement she only has under 17 yrs based on agreed upon date of separation which equates to about 37%. She will never get her own tricare health plan under the 20/20/20 laws. The best she can get is one additional year of benefits from tricare under the 20/20/15 law if divorce is after this august.   So with that information, what would be the odds a judge in Washington state would allow me to pull my petition for divorce, I am the one who filed, and she has done nothing to get this done. I don't really care if we stay married so she gets medical benefits, I'm just tired of spending money on attorneys that I don't have. She is still in Washington state and I now am in Maryland working at my new job.	Yes
I apologize if this isn't the right forum. I'm seeking guidance on documenting the birth father for my 11 month old daughter. He's married and I agreed to protect his identity. While we haven't done the swab, there is no doubt of his paternity.   Can I add his name to her birth certificate now? I'm in Georgia if that makes a difference.	Yes
My fiance already pays child support to his ex-wife for their 2 kids. If we get married, can she come after my income? (She lives in KY, we live in GA, and their current agreement was filed in FL).	Yes
"I'm looking for advice from people who maintain totally separate finances or are real estate experts. My partner and I got married mostly because we wanted the legal protections marriage gave us and we planned to buy a house. From my past experience with my ex, I knew that buying while married has significant advantages, especially when you both make a lower salary. However, over the course of my current relationship I have ended up out-earning him, and I now make in the low 6 figures while he is barely middle class. Which would be totally fine, except for when it comes to the house. We want to continue keeping our finances totally separate, and with the house we would ideally both be paying equally into it and into house maintenance, taxes, etc, but that can't happen now due to the fact that any house/condo in our area is going to be too much for him to pay half of either the downpayment or the mortgage. The ""solution"" seems to be I just pay more for everything, but we are both feeling very uncomfortable about this. It breaks up the plan of keeping finances separate and if we break up, he walks away with 50%. Neither of us think this is ok. The reality is he can pay about 35% of the house down payment and mortgage. Has anyone who had separate finances dealt with this situation before? In an ideal situation we would be single and my partner would be renting from me and I would write my will up so he got the house if anything happened to me, but we are married now. How would you write up a contract designating that he gets a percent of the house and how do you figure out what that percent is? Are there any emotional things we should think about? We're considering getting a divorce to be able to do this but I would like to know what my options are."	Yes
I'm writing this on behalf of my mom. We live In Ontario, Canada.  A few years ago my dad created a supplementary credit card under my moms name. He kept both cards and my mom never used the card. Than, a few years bag my parents separated and my dad took the card with him.  Only a while back we received a notice from the bank the card was created under, apparently my dad has been using this card, but it's registered to my mom, so we received a letter requesting that we pay back the debt. My mom called the bank and told them she has nothing to do with the card, she requested her name be removed from the card. The bank says that they cannot remove the name before the full amount is paid back. We talked it out with my dad, and he told me it was settled, the problem would be fixed.  It seems that was not the case. On July 13th, 2017, we received a letter from a legal firm. Apparently the bank has taken legal action on my mom, an they are requesting that she pay back the full amount spent. The problem is, my mom never used the card, that is not money she spent.  The letter was sent on June 29th, 2017, it stated that we must pay back a balance of $3,945.98 CAD. The amount is to gain interest annually at a rate of 19.8%. It also stated that if arrangements are not made within 10 days of the letter being sent, than legal action will be taken. It has been 14 days, we just received this letter.  I checked out the reviews for the Law Firm, it's technically a debt collector, and apparently their service is horrible. They are known to refuse to pick up calls so that interest is gained overtime, they seem to be all about money.  So now we have a problem. My Mom owes a bank money that she never used, it's quite possible that legal action will be taken by a potentially scummy company, and I doubt my dad will do anything to help.  So I've turned to my friend Reddit, I need your help, what can me and my mom do in this situation? How do we proceed?  Thank you for taking the time to read through this, I know it's quite long, but it means a lot to me.	Yes
So let me preface by saying that I am in no way defending my actions, or the way I behaved. It was completely unacceptable, and I feel horrible and stupid for it.  Saturday night my girlfriend, lets call her Vee, and I went out for a couple of drinks. At the end of the evening we both had gotten a little tipsy, and started having an argument on her porch, which then escalated into the kitchen, with the door still open.  In my drunken idiocy I knocked over a pile of glasses onto the floor.  At this point we both notice a cop car with lights on coming down the street. They say they had a report of a domestic dispute, put me in cuffs, put me in the car. All the while she is saying she does not want me arrested, to release me, and that she is refusing to press charges.  Of course they don't let me go, I spend the night in central bookings. When I go before the judge, he tells me that I have an order of protection against Vee. I am in no way allowed to contact her, to speak to her, to be within 100 feet of her, if I do, and should I be caught, I will be arrested and charged with contempt of court.   The judge let me go on my own recognizance, no bail, and I am scheduled to appear back in court in September with a lawyer of my own - furthermore, I don't even know what I am being charged with?  My question is Vee and I have no absolutely no desire for this order of protection. We get along, love each other, and are planning a future together. This was just a stupid spat that got escalated way further than anyone ever would have thought. We practically live together, and spend all of our free time together.  At this point, how exactly should we proceed? I am at a complete loss of what to do. How do I even find out what I am being charged with, and when I contact a lawyer what should I tell them, will they be able to find out what my charges are?	Yes
I'm not sure if this is the proper place to post but I'm really lost and need someone to help me. I want to get a job, the problem is that the only documents I have to my name are my birth certificate and my social security card. In order to get a job I'll need more than only that according to what ive found on the internet. here is what I was going off of https://www.vec.virginia.gov/docs/generaldocs/documents/i_9.pdf now this says that I can either obtain an item from list A or B and have enough to get a job. I was looking into getting my Permit / ID card but those require more documents I don't have https://www.dmv.virginia.gov/webdoc/pdf/dmv141.pdf . I'm really lost as to what I can do about this, I think in most states id be fine but since VA has laws requiring you to provide proof of legal presence im going to need to find some form of identification.        Here are some bonus details -    1. I'm 18.    2. I've had jobs in the past, before i was using a school issued ID card but I don't go to school anymore.    3. I dropped out of high school, but I did earn my GED.        from what i can tell i need documents i dont have to get the documents i dont have, there has to be a way around this problem. any help would be greatly appreciate, thank you in advance!	Yes
I live in Alberta Canada.   There is a lot of back story here but I will try to keep it as short as possible.   I'm 31, my sister is 12. My mother is 49.   My mother and I have been no contact for over 2 years (previous periods of no contact on and off since I was 13 and living in foster care).   When my sister was born I was a very active part of her live from the beginning. When she was 2 years old I had my own daughter and actually provided full time care while my mother worked since I was a stay at home mother. My sister and my daughter (almost 10) are very close.   During this last period of no co tact one as not allowed to see my sister for a little over a year, but my sister's father bridged the gap and began to allow me to see her (without my mother knowing). My mother eventually found out and flipped, but inevitably continued to allow us to see her, mostly because my sister freaked out and begged her.   So about a month ago sister's dad called to ask if we would take my sister for an indefinite period of time. Mother was evicted and is unemployed, was planning to move my sister into a tent on the property my sister's dad owned. Sister's dad is also unemployed and living in a broken rv on said property. He receives disability monthly.   There are no current plans for the winter. I don't know how long they expect me to keep her unofficially, and I don't mind having her here, but I personally believe they are both unfit. I would like to try to gain guardianship or custody, but I'm not sure if I have a leg to stand on legslly. We can provide for her financially, but I worry about the back and forth and I worry that any day now my mother will decide she doesn't want her here (this has happened before). I know that if she knew I was planning to try anything she would cut off contact completely.   Some issues: I feel that her parents are not adequately managing her health. She's just over 250 pounds, for one. I know that her pediatrician said she was lrediabetic years ago and they have done nothing to change her diet or exercise habits. They routinely provide her with all manners of junk food in copious amounts.  Her father showed up tonight at 11 pm and took her the 711 and bought her a giant sluroee and chicken fingers after she'd already eaten dinner and snacks here. This is common.   She suffers from anxiety and depression (diagnosed) and takes medication for it. She also has sleeping pills prescribed for occasional use. My mother routinely forgets to send medication home and I don't think she is ensuring she takes it regularly.   They do not take care of her hygiene appropriately, even prior to the eviction. Her hair is always dirty and unwashed. Her clothes are absolutely filthy and smell of cigarette smoke. Her shoes were a size too small and tattered, She was wearing them like slippers. She's gotten her period and they haven't taught her how to use pads properly and don't provide her with deodorant or ensure she showers regularly. In short, she smells pretty bad every time she comes back. They currently do not have access to running water or heat, though her dad has a generator for limited power. I have no idea what they plan to do come winter.  My mother has been exceeding irresponsible financially for pretty much her entire life, but especially lately. She was evicted and is on welfare, but recently purchased a car (got some shmuck to cosign) and an expensive dog (within two months of eviction). She smokes a pack a day. These are just a few examples.   The situation between my mother and my sister's father is extremely unstable. If my mother needs something she will allow him access to her but will randomly decide that he's abusive and can't see my sister anymore, and will tell my sister that she's not allowed to speak to him. This lasts until the next time she needs something, like right now. They both verbally abuse the other in her presence. There has been a few physical alterations but I'm not sure if anything was documented.   Right now she has no idea where she's going to be living, where she'll be going to school (the property they're camping on is over an hour from the city they were living in) or even whether she'll still be here tomorrow. She wants to be here, but is extremely dependant emotionally on my mother and if pressed, would absolutely tell any official that she wants to be with her mom. She's just a kid, I get it, I used to feel the same way.   I considered originally contacting social services , but have been onoffvially advised that because it's summer, and she technically has somewhere to live, god and clothing, they would likely only monitor the situation. If that happens, they will know I called (no-one else knows what's going on, my mother is very secretive) and would cut off contact with me immediately.   For now she's with me, and safe and happy, so I'm sort of just waiting. They are obviously not providing for her financially, I'm paying for everything for her (which again, isn't an issue).  If I wanted to sue them for custody, I know I would probably need lawyer, but do you think I'd have any chance of winning based on the situation currently? I'm not really sure what my best option is here but I am very concerned for her going forward.	Yes
Hey, r/legaladvice I'm 16 yrs old, and my parents are divorced, they were never married in the first place, but they separated amicably and I live with my mom, I'm planning on going to my mom's home country in April 2018, and staying with relatives, when I'll be 17, Am I allowed to travel alone all the way there from the U.S to the country?, will I need my dad's permission to go there, I already have a passport and did not need his permission to get it.

Are there any legal action I can take to get my terrible father out of my life?  Beside changing my name, is there a way that he is now disconnected from me in the judicial system? Anything along those lines?	Yes
"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
Greetings everyone.  I am having a hellish time trying to move on / away from my abusive ex fiance of 4 years. It's a complicated situation and it invovles a lot of manipulation, lies, defamation and abuse on her part that I would like to put a stop to, but need help doing so since my own efforts to disuade her have not worked out. I'm in colorado. If you know of any good lawyers that care about mens rights please help me find them because I am afraid being the male and her acting like a victim all the time when I never do anything but raise my voice and demand her to take responsibility for her actions!	Yes
It is stated in our custody order that my step mom is a suitable child care provider and costs are to be split based off our income and paid directly to her per month. Since May, my ex has stopped paying her his portion. I've already wasted a lot of money with a lawyer trying to get him to comply with other things, so I'm hoping to avoid more attorney fees if at all possible. Can anyone please help me with this matter?	Yes
"Hi,  I just posted to financial advice and was told to post here too.    A little back story, my dad has fucked around on my mom, lied, cheated and hidden things in the past. My mom forgave him and he ""rededicated himself to her and god"". She loves him, and has always forgiven him, but now it's just too much.   So about three days ago my mother found evidence that my (step)father was trying to contact the woman with whom he has previously had an affair. She found the many searches for this woman‚Äôs phone number, address, social media, and so forth on his phone.   She has also found out that he has a secret credit card. It has a 6k limit with a 2.5K balance, last payment made a few weeks ago. He has always been in charge of finances, he makes over 100K and she, a school teacher now, makes only 28K. My father has always been in charge of the household bills, finances and is basically head of household in that aspect.   My mother has been under the impression that all bills were being paid. They have not.   My mother has a nervous system disorder which landed her in the Mayo Clinic for quite some time, running tests, spinal taps and so on. Recently both were involved in a car accident together. My father has stated that all the medical bills are being taken care of, however after recently checking my mother has found that his medical bills are paid and hers are not.   When my parents met, 16 years ago, my mother was in college. He helped her pay for her doctorate in molecular biology. She went on to work for NCAR, and to publish papers. My father decided it was time for him to pursue his dream and together they moved to florida. My mother could not find any work in Florida in her field and so decided to teach instead.   I bring this up because she has around 120K in student loans, none of which have been paid, and now works in public education. She has been out of the science world for so long she fears she will never find work that will make ends meet.   She has also found out that they have a ‚Äújoint IRS lean‚Äù? I'm probably saying this wrong‚Ä¶so basically again, my dad said he was paying the taxes, he spend a lot of time as a contracted worker, and hasn't paid taxes at all. its 17K in back owed taxes. Again, I'm not familiar with this at all.   They own a sail boat that has both their names on it. She has currently taken up residence on the boat. I have asked her to change her DL and mailing address to the boat.   They do not own a home.   One paid off Explorer, maybe worth 5K   Her Mini Cooper is in my father‚Äôs name, not paid for. 17K owed.   Her credit score is now screwed because he has not paid anything in her name. Its maybe in the 400‚Äôs She really scared and wont talk with me at length about it.   28K a year.   120K in student debt.   5K in retirement in her name   Father has 401 K unknown amount   around 3K medical debt.   Terrible credit.   Not sure if she can afford a lawyer.   ANY advice would be so helpful. I love my mom, and she doesn't deserve this. I love my pops too‚Ä¶but right now I‚Äôm angry and he shouldn't be allowed to get away with this.   Contested divorce in state of florida runs 5-20 thousand, which she doesn't have. She does not qualify for legal aid, she has informed me."	Yes
I have an 18 year old brother who lives in the house with us. I'm 14 years old and very small for my age. Today I've been home and he gets home and I go outside and sees me once he's inside and looks at me and locks the door so that I can't get inside of the house. I dont really do anything but I do the same thing to him later on and while he was outside he grabbed my expensive mountain bike and threw it. I let him inside the house and he grabs me and shoves me. Then we're outside and he shoves me down a hill. Then I try to get inside and he grabs me and throws me back. I don't know what to do at this point. My mom says she can't punish him because she's not there?!? What do I honestly do? Can I press charges?	Yes
Who is guilty? Two brothers, one 36, one 26, live in their father's home with their mother who is ill with cancer. The two are not amicable. Great deal of bad blood. 26 claims history of violence at hands of 36.  They take turns occupying shared spaces in the home. 36 goes to work to make private income. Family income provided by the father. 26 stays at home caring for ill mother. 36 returns to house in the middle of the day. This is not typical. 26 doesn't want 36 in the house. Feels it's his time to occupy spaces. 36 just want to prepare for business trip. 26 grabs a skillet, stands at the entrance, and blocks 36 from entering house. He warns 36 not to enter. 36 comes in anyway toward 26 punching. 26 weakly swings skillet no injuries. 36 knocks skillet away. 26 jumps on 36 and bites chest and arm. 26 clings to 36s back. Fight pauses, they talk about issues. 36 gets fed up and strangles 26 with hands until he passes out. 26 calls cops. Report filed. 26 leaves home later that night to live on streets. 36 remains at home.	Yes
My father was recently deemed incapacitated. From what my lawyer has uncovered, on the day he was admitted to the hospital and before he was official deemed incapacitated by a psychologist, his ex wife talked him into signing a financial power of attorney. Three days after he signed the power of attorney, he was ruled mentally incapacitated. I have since then been granted temporary guardian and appointed conservator. My question is, was the power of attorney signed by my father in the hospital granting his ex wife financial power of attorney hold weight considering he was ruled mentally incapacitated 3 days later?	Yes
I've never posted here before or really even browsed because I've not run into legal issues that I did not know how to handle or where to turn locally for advice. I've recently been presented with some hard hitting information about my ex wife and her new husband involving a sex crime. Can you guys recommend a good custody attorney, I need to do something for my childrenswell being and my peace of mind. Ideally I want full custody instead of the joint we have now. I know that won't happen unless something drastic has happened, and to my knowledge it has not come to that yet.   As of right now I have a little information to go off of as to the depth of my situation but I will do my due diligence and dig deeper, quietly.   I need a good referral in he Kansas City area, I'd like to speak with an attorney to go over my options and lay out some costs and a potential plan of action. Thank you all in advance for the help.  I don't have unlimited finances but when it comes to my kids I'll make it work somehow.	Yes
Ohio: OK, so a friend of mine is in the middle of a HUGE cluster and I could really use some advice to pass on. I'm not even sure where to begin‚Ä¶ My friend is 19 and a completely disabled quadriplegic, his mother is his full-time caregiver, but she has become very estranged to her husband (yes they are still married) and they lived under the same roof up until recently. My friend has three younger siblings, all of whom were just taken by the dad to another town and he won't disclose where they are staying. The mom called the police and they said they can't do anything unless there are court documents filed. Isn't this kidnapping? Since he has taken them, they have come back to the house couple times, but only for a couple hours.    One of the biggest problems is that the mom is my friend's full-time caregiver and is completely dependent on the dad to pay bills and take care of things financially, but he doesn't include her on any of the financial information. This makes finding a legitimate lawyer very difficult. There is a lot more to this whole situation, including years of manipulation and mental abuse. It seems his main goal is to discredit her and threaten her with getting full custody of the kids and making her out to be the bad guy. It sounds like he has been able to turn the three youngest kids against her and is using money and gifts to manipulate them. The mom has no idea where the dad is getting the money to afford a second home or these gifts (including a car), especially because the dad recently put the family on Medicaid and food stamps.    What are the first steps I should recommend for the mom? Thanks in advance for any help/advice you can offer.	Yes
I'll try to keep this short and keep as little reference to names or job titles as possible. Basically, about 6 years ago I met a girl who had semi-famous parents and I ended up marrying. During the course of our relationship, I suggested starting a YouTube channel and various social media with her father who was a professional athlete. My intent was to build a brand around it under the idea that eventually my wife and I would take over once they retire and that we could live off of the fame and publicity (my wife also became a pro athlete after I convinced her to let her father mentor her). Everything was fine, until she decided it would be a good idea to cheat on me and move to a completely different state with the dude randomly. I waited and tried to reconcile with her for over a year with no luck and it tore me up extremely badly. She also ran off with the majority of our assets and money and left me with very little. So not only did my wife disappear over night but also my career. She and her family also refused to give me my filming equipment back until just recently we had it court ordered back to me next month. Over the period with the drama between my wife and I, my in-laws approached me about buying me out in both person and through text. I informed them that I still wanted to wait and see if my wife returned before I made any big decisions, and I was also concerned about whether she would try and claim it as community property or not and if I would get in trouble for selling before we reached a settlement. Everything was created before we were married, so that's not the problem. The problem is that eventually they texted me wanting to buy me out still and after consulting with my family lawyer they thought that if I could get an offer that we could draft up a contract that would legally absolve any possible right my wife had to the stake in IP and social media. I asked them to give me an offer and they did not. After a couple of weeks I was then informed that they were suing me and placing a restraining order against me (even thought I had not voluntarily contacted them in over a year). Since we were family, we had no formal contract- But the agreement always was that I kept the revenue from the channel in exchange for building her dads fame and increasing his value  (which it did EXPONENTIALLY). The YouTube account and all contracts associated are all under my name. The Logo was also created by me and I have all original photoshop, sony vegas, and over 7 TB of footage and pictures to show my ownership- But hiring an IP lawyer is going to cost me a minimum of a $20,000 retaining fee. And I have very little money thanks to my wife taking everything with her and my inability to get my equipment back to be gainfully employed normally. I feel like they are trying to back me into a corner so that I settle for much less than it's worth or just give it up. But this is the last 6 years of my life work and I would prefer if I could at least get some startup money for a future venture of my own so that I can start new. What should be my next step? We're talking potentially millions of dollars worth of value in assets and I know that he is feeling the hurt and pressure from his sponsors otherwise he wouldn't be trying to get it so badly. Especially given the fact that he always belittled my work and acted as if it had no actual value to him (even though he always wanted to continue doing it).   Hopefully this is easy to understand. This is a throwaway account just for the record because I'm not sure if names getting out would hurt me or just them.	Yes
"So my mother is going after GPR here in Idaho, my wife smoked pot about 2 weeks ago, when I was upset with my wife, I casually mentioned this fact to my mother and now she wants to go for grandparents rights. Yay. So, if my wife took a ""trip"" to a state where it was legal, could it be held accountable against her in court for a follicle test if when she did it was technically considered legal?"	Yes
My boyfriend's ex is taking him to court for additional child support. Without getting too much into the details, because I don't believe they are relevant...  He has been asked to fill out one of those income/expense worksheets. Obviously he has filled it out with the amount of the bills he pays (his portion of rent, etc) but it also asks for household size. We live together but are not married. Am I correct in assuming that the household size is 1 and not 2?   We live in New York, if it matters.	Yes
Quebec, Canada. I am the victim along with my younger sister, my father is the abuser. I frankly have no idea where to start legally - I have a few questions I hope someone can help me with. Frankly, I am terrified, this has been kept hushed in my extended family for over 20 years.   The abuse lasted from when I was in diapers to the age of 18. I remember recurring specific instances of abuse clearly, without the memory of specific dates because I was so young. Abuse included numerous and repetitive molestation and forcing me to manually stimulate him.   At the age of 5 years old, my mother was suspicious of abuse but never witnessed anything herself. My mother filed for divorce. An Aunt on my father's side called her one day saying she had witnessed him molesting me while giving me a bath during a family visit at my grandparent's house. However, this aunt was not willing to testify. At the age of 5, I was considered too young to testify in court. Without a witness, all my mother had to go on legally was suspicions. Though she fought tooth and nail, the legal system was not on her side since she had no witnesses willing to testify and no evidence except the memories of a child. The legal system failed me and my mother horrendously. She had no job, no family support and no money, and the appointed lawyer could do little for us. She was advised to try for supervised visitation, and not to try to prosecute as the case would most likely fall through, and the courts might take pity on him if he was not convicted and grant equal custody. My father ended up with supervised visits one Saturday a week. Despite this, the abuse continued. Any time someone's back was turned for one second, he would molest me - this continued at least until the age of 8 where I became more self confident to protect myself and avoided his advances, but subtle abuse and psychological abuse still remained. He remained in contact with me until the age of 18, when I became an adult and felt I had the courage to cut off all contact with him and move away without fear of him tracking me down to hurt me.  Now, 20 years later, I feel I am ready to finally face the ghosts of my past. No-one in my family would talk to me about the abuse as a child or a teenager. Which, in a way, is a good thing as it solidifies the fact that all of the memories I have are from my own experience, not from people telling me that I was abused.   I plan on getting in contact with the Aunt who witnessed the abuse, although I highly doubt she will be willing to testify if she was unwilling to do so when I was a defenseless toddler. I have several recurring, specific memories, that correlate with memories of my younger sister, who suffered the same type of abuse as myself. My older half sister, who was a teenager at the time but lived in the same house, has memories of abuse including him trying to climb into her bed and molest her at night, and showing her hardcore pornography while she was a minor. However, she lives in Malaysia currently and I am not sure she would be willing to testify.  I know it is a very long shot, as the abuse was many years ago and the memories of a young child from that long ago do not hold up well in court. But I know that if I do not do this now, I will regret it for the rest of my life. I want to get in contact with child abuse help, but I have no idea who to contact, and I know nothing about the legal system or how the case would be handled since it was such a very long time ago.   I am considering buying a hidden audio recording device, and interviewing the aunt, as well as my father, for evidence. It is legal in canada to record a conversation between two people without one party's consent, as long as the recording party is aware of it. Is there anything else I can do for evidence or to prepare for this? I want to be as prepared as I possibly can before I present the case.   This monster has molested me and my sisters, probably more family members or neighbors children that I don't even know of, and is walking free hurting more children no doubt. He is unbelievably bold and manipulative, charming, and continued the abuse under the direct supervision of my mother and case workers without anyone knowing. This will be a long, hard fight. Any advice would be welcome.	Yes
I had just recently passed my road test in MN. I am a 16 year old and need a parent/guardian to sign off. Here's the issue I am currently living with my aunt and uncle and my parents are in China on vacation and they won't be back until December. They haven't given legal custody to my aunt and uncle so they can't sign off on my license. My uncle has the same last name as me so could I tell them that he is my dad and would they figure it out? Is that legal to do? Is there anything else I can do before my parents are physically back in the states?	Yes
My dad abused me to the point where I had so much adrenaline pumped I could barely even feel the physical pain with household items used as weapons against me. I don't think I need to go into the details, but this was in a country with basically non existent child protection laws and I decided not to go to the embassy on the basis that it would be better to request aid in Canada.(and I was too scared to)  The abuse hasn't happened after a bit more than a week of being in Canada, but is there anything I can/should legally do? I don't want to mess up anyone's life, but since he's betrayed my trust so many times and significantly affected me, I don't want him to go unpunished.  Yes, I am under his(and my mother's) custody and I am living with them.	Yes
Parents of biological child mentioned were not  married, but the father abused his biological child's 10yo autistic half sibling (but not the neurotypical  biological child, toddler) and there is proof (yelling in face, cursing, pushing in video, sounds of hitting heard in another room but not seen on video, child heard/seen screaming, beung pushed around while naked because of bm accident, obviously traumatized in video) but no charges filed at the time of incident. Mom reported 1.5 years later when finally got courage to leave relationship (d.v.p.o).  Because of the evidence of abuse to the biologocal child's half-sibling, what are the chances of termination of father's rights to the biological child?	Yes
"My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend (BM for baby mama) had him served last week, or the week before, to take him to court and change some things on their custody agreement.  On Sunday (07/25/17) she came to him and offered to remove a morality clause (""when enjoying access to the minor child, no parent is to have another of the opposite sex staying overnight"") and lower his child support payment significantly in exchange for abandoning the 50/50 custody they have previously agreed to, and changing it to the father getting the child every other weekend and one night a week.   Today, after thinking it over, he told her to tell her lawyer to start the paperwork. She immediately then began saying how she changed her mind about the morality clause since ""she's not comfortable with it.""  We do have a DNA test process started to determine if she's actually the father. I'd go into some details about why we have doubts, but I don't want to post anything too personal.   I'm sorry if this is all scatter brained, but I don't know anything about family law. All I know is that, I want to be with him, and I currently live eight hours away. No, we don't want to get married right now. It just feels like someone he dated for 4-6 months (I can't recall exactly) is controlling his life now, and I don't understand how she can do that. I'm aware of the need for a lawyer here, but like some other dad's paying child support, he can't afford a lawyer AND child support.   Do we just wait for the DNA test and go from there? Or do we take actions based on the assumption that the child will be his and focus our attention on getting this clause removed?   Thank you so much in advance, and I'm sorry if I sound super ignorant. I just can't read through the legalese anymore."	Yes
My partner, lets call him John, and a child 9 years ago when he was a teenager but the mom and her family chose to exclude him from the pregnancy and did not include him in the birth. She tried filing false restraining order charges that were dropped once her allegations proved to be false. She did not want John in this child's life. At the time, he was a punk kid and not exactly the worlds best role model. However he has cleaned up his act, he went to school and got a degree, he has three beautiful daughters, and he just started up his own business. We don't have a lot of money since most, if not all, of our money is going towards helping the business grow but the older this child gets the more depressed John gets. He hates not being a part of his life and he truly is an amazing father. How do we go about even starting this? He has tried reaching out to the mom in the past about meeting him and she blocked him on all avenues so we don't want to keep pestering her and rather have another way. We aren't looking to take him from the only parent he's ever had unless there's reason to? We simply want to meet and get to know our son.	Yes
I will contact lawyers, but wondering if anyone here has a general idea of how to proceed? She left me without any warning or explanation, and I want to file for divorce. We have a shared checking acct with only a small amount of money, but I have mutual funds/retirement savings in my own name (that I had before we got married, but they've accumulated a lot of wealth in the years we've been together). Will she be entitled to money from my retirement account in settling this?  Any idea of how to serve her papers in another country? I have no idea how the divorce process works. Does she need to be there in person?  Thanks.	Yes
Separated from ex for about four years now. We decided to attempt filing for a non contested divorce without the assistance of an attorney. We agree on everything with the exception of who will drive for pick up and drop off during visitation. We really can't get past this and I think it's probably going to result in a contested divorce in front of a judge.   A little background; I'm a mother of five children ages 2-10, three are half siblings and step siblings from my current relationship. We alternate holidays and he gets every other weekend with the option to see them whenever he's in the area. Neither of us is too firm on the visutation schedule, we just do whatever works.   In the four years that we've been sharing custody the kids have never been picked up or dropped off on time. He's picked them up as late as 3am and brought them home as late as 4am on a school night. It's become a huge problem and source of tension. He blames it on my location, says I live too far away but in the four years that we've been separated I've lived in one home while he's lived in several. Whether he's staying with family, friends, in temporary rentals or hotels, I can't be blamed for not consistently living within an appropriate distance from him.   Currently he lives about an hour and 45 minutes away. He wants to meet halfway for pick up and drop off. Under normal circumstances I would agree that that is fair but I've been there and done that with him. In the beginning I would meet him and we would sit in the car for *hours*, sometimes very late into the night waiting for him to show up. I tried bringing them to his house and still, I would sit for hours, waiting. Eventually I stopped meeting him and now it's becoming an issue of him bringing them back at all because he doesn't want to drive. They'll be due back on Sunday and he'll repeatedly say he's coming but not actually show up until several days later.  It's driving me crazy not having a consistent routine and I realize that something needs to be put down on paper so that everyone is equally liable.   In a contested divorce will a judge consider the circumstances before ruling on who should do the driving? Honestly the reason I've put this divorce off for so long is that I'm worried a judge will order me to share driving duty and I can't- I just can't- spend every other weekend sitting in a car with my 5 kids waiting on him for hours.	Yes
So a friend of mine is having some issues with the father of her child. The child is currently with the father's grandparents and the mother would like to pick the child back up. Father wants the grandparents to get some time with the child. Without a custody agreement in place, can the mother legally take the child back? How would she go about this?	Yes
So I hired a lawyer last year to help me with my child support case. Back story, I was a SAHM for three years and also a full time student. Ex and I decided to mutually split and split our times with the kids as well. After the separation, ex was acting childish and stupid so I started getting my evidence together to take him to court to get primary custody of the kids and child support as well. Of course, I had to get state support since I was not working after the separation and they referred me to their 'go to lawyer'. I contacted said lawyer and her paralegal. They assured me it would be an easy case and to send everything their way.   Long story short, I didn't get primary custody, but shared.  50/50 was what the judge ordered. Even though I had multiple proof of him not being fit to have the children for 50% of the time. Anyways, after the judge ruled the shared custody, we were supposed to go over child support. Here where I'm at, the child support services will not talk to me since I'm being represented by my attorney. They will only speak to her and will only accept documents from her. I've tried calling, emailing and even stopping by the office but they've cut me out cold.   What can I do? Our contract is different because I was referred to her by the state. I paid a one time fee and she said it would cover ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Even if I needed her a few years down the line, as long as it was about my case with my ex. I feel like she's trying not to help me since she's technically losing out on money.  Any advice?	Yes
"This is quite a long one.  Please excuse poor grammar. So 5 years ago I started custody on my son.  At the time he was 8.  While this started his mother refused to go to any court dates till she was handed with a contempt of court months later.  So during the next 2 years there were over 100 days of missed parenting time.  Our judge had enough of us constantly being in front of him.  None of this was due to me.  I had always done everything that was asked of me.  During this time his mother was charged with 7 drug felonies. She was allowed to use a 7411. Which means if she successfully completed her terms. That she would be charged with possession of non-narcotic.  During this time she had moved 90 miles away. And we had to meet half way which she despised doing.  Ok so now this is where the story picks up.  So on a Tuesday before my weekend I get a call from CPS.  I tell them that I will inform my lawyer and we will meet.  I work nights so mother goes to pick my son up.  The next day I ask my son what CPS was in regards to. And he says ""none of your business"".  Me and my son were really close prior to me starting custody.   We spent time together when she wanted a babysitter.  So we go to my parents house.  I tell him that he can go sot at his desk. For being disrespectful to his grandmother the weekend prior and me just then.  He wanted to get up so I tell him that he could write a report that his school was offering for extra credit.  He chose not to so I told him to continue to sit.  He was allowed to get up but I told him no TV.  He ends up watching TV with my father.  I tell him to sit back down he says no and what are you going to do about it.  I get up and I pit my hand on his ear and he walks in front of me and sits down.  Say an hour passes and I tell him he is done being punished.  We watch some soccer and go about our day.  Next day we all go to see Ghostbusters.  He has a younger brother and my ex's son who I raised since he was 1.  After we go to my house and they all play and go to the park.  We drop him off later that day.  So on the following Thursday I get a call from a detective and am told I am being accused of breaking my sons arm.  So when he was age 6 &amp; 7.  He had broke his arm in the same spot.  Now that January he had broke it for 3rd time throwing a dodgeball at school.  I call my lawyer.  And he says normally I would say not to talk to them but in your case we should.  We go and meet with him and tells me the allegations. The story was that  got mad at him and dragged him from one room to the other and threw him into the wall rebreaking his arm.  There are no accessible walls in the room.  Running a pornographic household.   For having a sex talk with a 13 &amp;12 year old.  Showing a Playboy and having a serious talk with them.  Both mother's had agreed and known about prior to use sitting down.  And then of course my wet preserved specimens were brought up.  Oh and I did this when CPS already had a investigation from her call the week prior. So during all this my children have been interviewed multiple time prior.  I have never hit my children.  I dont even yell at them.  So I go to court and I end up losing custody of my son.  If more back story is need on why I will provide.  But basically my court appointed lawyer set it for a bench trial.  And I was deemed unfit.  I did switch to my regular lawyer but the deck was already stacked. So during this time about 3 months later.  I find out I am being criminally prosecuted.   I get depressed about everything and stop going to work and make some overall bad choices.  One was having sex and getting a woman pregnant.   My youngest son was 9 and I had no plans on having any other children.   Well this woman is an addict.  While pregnant she was taking pills.  She goes to jail and then rehab then to methadone clinic then back to jail. All in her 1st 6 months.  So the baby is born. He maconian comes back positive for opiates.  CPS is involved. They find no reason to continue since she had a prescription for her last pregnancy.   Which was like 5 years prior.  Oh yea she signed rights away to her first son to her mother.  And gave her 2nd son up for adoption.  So CPS tells her that if she lives with me that they will be involved and want them out of my home.  So I still see my daughter when the mother would come over.  Till I ask for some things she took from the home.  I had bought everything for our daughter but was for the home.  The mother was essentially couch bouncing with our daughter. We stop having physical contact after this fight as she wasnt welcome in my home.  Over the course of her firat 16 months CPS had been involved 4 times.  One alleged incident involved her boyfriend shaking the baby.  These were always dismissed regardless of my concerns.   When we go for custody.   She received sole legal custody and I was denied parenting time.  I was also denied parenting time for my son. The reason was alleged abuse.  Even though the criminal charges were dismissed against me.  So last week CPS gets ahold of me and tells me the new case.  That the house she lives at is selling drugs.  Unknown number of people living there.  She smoked weed at 630 and at 1030 was in a single car rollover. 300ft of skid mark.  She was taken to jail for dui, driving suspended and child endangerment.  So today when I called they told me that our daughter was placed with her mother.  They are petitioning to remove custody from her and place her with the grandmother.  I have fought for my children endlessly. And continue to be disregarded.  Do I have any options?"	Yes
I guess I'll start with the situation that led up to me discovering this. Please pardon any spelling errors. I've done the best I can to piece everything together from memory.  Up until yesterday afternoon, I had been staying at my parents' house for a few days with my cats because I was in between apartments and my new unit wasn't ready yet. Then the landlord of my new unit ghosted me after I'd paid my deposit/application fees, and I was stuck trying to figure out where I was going to go when my mom came into the living room and started asking me about it. She accused me of lying about it, so that I could somehow use her/manipulate the family. (I've realized she's a narcissist and all the abuse I endured as a kid all made sense after that but I digress. That's a post for /r/relationships.)  Anyway, one thing led to another and I decided to pack my bag and leave, rather than endure her verbal assault. My dad and sister weren't home to witness this fight (I think she waited for that to be the case before instigating) and in the moment I needed to vent to someone who would believe me, so I texted my half brother in Massachusetts and told him what was going on, that I had a horrid sneaking suspicion that SHE was the evil manipulative monster, and not my biological father.   Now, my mom has always told us that he left her in California with us when my sister was 2 and I had just been born, and moved to Massachusetts where the trucking company that he owned was stationed. He asked her to bring my sister and I up to the east coast so they could all be a family, then slapped her with divorce papers the day she got there. He'd been cheating with another woman and was planning on starting a family with her. The divorce was messy and my mom claims she fled back to California after he was a no-show for the termination of his parental rights. I was maybe 4 or 5 years old at this point. When she got back to California, she happened to reconnect with the man who would eventually adopt us (that happened when I was 8) and married him.   After speaking with my half-brother, who still lives with my biological father and my half-sister in Massachusetts, I decided to reach out to him and hear his side of the story. And it's not what my mom had led me to believe for the past 20 years.  He had been planning to divorce her because she'd grown cold and unloving towards him whenever he came back from trucking. (He didn't know that she'd met my step-dad/legal father before she met him, he thought they met after the divorce when in reality that's probably why she was so distant towards him- she already had someone else.) And he did cheat on her, which is what led to him filing for divorce. But he never asked her to move us to Massachusetts- she chased him up there when she suspected he wanted to leave her and then moved us and herself in with his mother and step-father against his wishes to try and keep him from going through with the divorce. It didn't work of course, and he went through with it anyway. The courts granted him custodial rights to me and my sister at first, and he would have us on the weekends while the divorce proceedings were being finalized. When it was finished, at my mother's request, she was also allowed to move us back to California under the stipulation that 1.) he would have us for vacation time and 2.) she would have to provide him with contact info, i.e. a physical address and a phone number- which she didn't do. In fact, the only reason the courts let her take us back to California was because she said she had a support system there and family to help her (another lie). She took us back to California and never told him where we were. He received one letter from us through CPS but there was no address on it so he couldn't send anything back. She also quietly filed for the termination of his parental rights with her attorney by forging his signature on the paperwork. After paying for the divorce, he couldn't afford to hire another attorney to fight the termination of his parental rights and he'd also would've had to come to California to do so. It wasn't within his power to stop her. When he found out we'd been adopted, he stopped paying child support and the courts threatened to take him to jail but he contested it- because we were legally not his anymore. He sort of gave up trying to speak to us after a few years, until he found her info when we moved to Georgia (presumably because we left the protection of the state of California) and called us wanting to connect when I was 16. It was the first contact he'd had with us since we were taken from Massachusetts. My mom had brainwashed us and painted him as a manipulative monster who would turn us against her if we gave him a chance, so when we spoke to him we basically told him to fuck off and we didn't hear from him anymore. That's how things were left until I called him yesterday.  I really want to sit down with my sister and tell her everything, because this is not the truth either of us grew up with. Through the mess of the divorce and custody battle, we cultivated a closer bond than anyone else in our family but that also means she's very loyal to my mother (she was a bit older than me and remembers a lot more than I do) and has already told me she's not choosing sides in the situation about my mother kicking me out of the house. My mother has texted me since that incident to berate me the way only a narcissist can, and I've refrained from responding. At this point, all that I care about is telling my sister in hopes that the web of lies my mother spun and protected for 20 years will finally fall apart. I'm really not sure at all what advice can be given about this because I have no paperwork to support his claims, but I want to see if there's a way to possibly request it somehow from the courts. My current boyfriend is completely up to date on this situation and has a lawyer I may be able to speak to, but I'd like to gain some clarity here so I can be more organized when we get to that step.     TL;DR I have to find irrefutable proof of my mother's alleged illegal actions to show my sister to support or I'm afraid lose her with the rest of my mother's family.	Yes
"Here's the background: My ex-husband moved out of state (from OR to WA) about 4 years ago, and has visited our daughter (F, 12) maybe 4 times in those years. He has drug/alcohol/legal troubles, and is currently sitting in county jail awaiting a trial for domestic violence that will likely send him to prison for 5 years (that's the plea bargain).   We have ""joint custody"" and have since 2009, but our daughter has lived with me and with my husband (her stepfather) that whole time. I've discussed getting official full custody a few times, and it's just never seemed worth it. (He can't afford any child support; he's often homeless; he doesn't try to see her or have her for Christmas/vacations anyway, and so for all practical purposes, we really do have ""full custody"" anyway.)   But now, with this prison sentence looming, I'd like for my husband to be able to adopt her. I know I need to have his parental rights terminated, and I'm meeting with a lawyer next week to have that first conversation. Just a few questions:  We have a $100 consultation, but I'm wondering if after that, I'd be able to do most of this paperwork on my own. Does that seem reasonable? Or am I going to have to really sign up for the full deal with the lawyer? If so, does anyone have a rough ballpark of what that might cost so I can start figuring that end out? Are there any particular questions I should ask at our meeting?  And finally... this IS a good idea, right? It's possible and worth it?  Thank you, thank you!"	Yes
Hi Reddit,  My wife and I have decided to separate due to unforeseen circumstances. (She left me for another fellow).  Anyways, I need help.   So I've spoken with a family lawyer and she gave me a bunch of papers for both of us to fill out regarding our financial situations. Including the last 3 years of tax returns.   We are going to both sign an unofficial separation agreement that I've drawn up. Once done I'll hand that to my lawyer to draw up an official agreement.   We are being surprisingly rational to each other and I want to know if this financial paper BS can be waived and we can just simply sign an official separation agreement and be on our ways.   We both think it's a waste of time and I was told once the official agreement was drawn up, she will still have to retain a lawyer of a different firm to explain it to her.   We just have the desire to end this as quickly and painlessly as possible.  Lawyers ain't cheap.   If you need more information let me know.   All responses are appreciated.	Yes
Pretty straight forward. I lost it and not sure what steps to take to get another one...	Yes
Hi there. Quick question please; I am supposed to have my son every second Sunday as per a court order which was agreed to in mediation. Last week Sunday my visit was cancelled despite the court order saying it was non negotiable and the reason why it was cancelled is because apparently my son was sick although he was fine the previous evening when I saw him and they would not show him to us to verify that he is indeed sick. Also they did not take him to the doctor and I stay less than twenty metres from his place so there was no real reason that they needed to cancel the visit. I went to the police station to report them and the police were unable to do anything. The court order is brand new and I'm already being pushed around like this. Now the social workers have told me to forfeit this week's visitation as well because they worry that the conflict is harmful to my child however what they fail to acknowledge is that there would not be any conflict if the other party simply followed what they agreed to. Is there any justice for people who breach court orders and go against agreements? I do not understand why I must now make a second agreement if they wouldn't even follow the first. I stay in the same apartment complex as him and they still never let me see him and it's grossly unfair. Also they drive around with him in the car without a car seat. I am extremely discouraged by the judicial system!!! 	Yes
She hasn't seen the kids in days and her husband isn't picking up the calls. She's high and wants to do nothing. People are cussing at her on facebook. Cousin says we can't even call the cops because we're not as close and don't count, cps was already called they don't know where they are. Anything I can do?	Yes
A couple years before I met my wife she gave away a child so that she would not have to share split custody with her physically abusive ex. She was under age and grew up in a religious home so they got married and she  tried to make it work. A few days after the child was born her ex went for cigarettes and didn't come back. My wife (now just 18 and terrified) was talked into giving up her child. Somehow the ex found out  and tried to stop the adoption so my in laws payed ex off and tried to hurry the adoptive process. Through a friend of a friend she heard about a family looking to adopt. The parents seemed to check all the boxes: the husband was well off and in a prestigious occupation, they had already adopted other children, they are of the same religion, they seemed very happy. My wife told them that she wanted to keep regular contact with some form of open adoption. They agreed. Within days papers were signed and the adoption was finalized.   In the beginning they send pics/updates every month. They had a visit each of the first three years and they brought the child to our wedding. Then things start to change. After our wedding they decided to message once every three months and we had to ask a few times for the yearly visit. They say something about other birth mom's losing interest over time and my wife has to ask for updates. We have since moved away and my wife is going back in town for a family event and asked for a yearly visit while she is there. The response was that there will be no more visits and only a yearly update.   I have never seen the legal paperwork as that obviously happened before I met my wife but is there any room to legally get more contact? This happened in Utah around 6 years ago. All conversation was through email. Should I bother trying to do something about this or are we without recourse? I don't want to put my wife and her family through an emotional fight to come up with nothing especially if the family could just go no contact on us.  Sorry for the long post.	Yes
My sister, Anne, (30s) is mentally ill. I am not sure of her exact diagnosis, but she has been on and off medication and in and out of therapy since we were teens.   She has a 3 year old with her ex, John, who lives 1 hour away; John is employed, responsible, and a good dad. My sister moved back in with my parents when they broke up shortly after my nephew was born.   Anne has custody during the week and one weekend a month. John gets Nephew three weekends a month. My other sister and I live out of state and don't engage with Anne or the situation much.   Anne and our parents have a volatile relationship. Anne doesn't work, does not parent, and loses her shit if my parents try to set boundaries or engage with my nephew when my sister doesn't want them to.   Without getting into details, there's all kinds of damaging shit happening to my nephew - including some concerns that triggered a visit from CPS.   Suffice it to say my sister is an unfit mother, and my parents have been in what has felt, to them, like an impossible situation. They've been terrified for my nephew's well-being and have been hesitant to lay down the law with my sister because she's so volatile. They've thought it was better to put up with the insanity as long as Nephew lived where they could keep an eye on him.  But things have apparently come to a head. My sister left my parents' house several weeks ago, taking Nephew with her. They're apparently staying at a friend's house. Again, my sister doesn't work.   The last time John and Anne met to do the handoff for John's weekend, Anne refused to turn over Nephew and John called the police. So there are files with police and CPS related to this situation.  John has told my parents he is pursuing sole custody, and my parents are supportive of this. They have spoken with John's attorney and will be fully cooperative. John's attorney sent a certified letter to my sister at my parents' house, but she hasn't lived there for a few weeks and has not come to pick it up.   As of now, Anne does not know this custody suit is happening, and I am concerned Nephew will be in physical danger once she finds out. She is obsessed with someone taking away her son and will absolutely lose her mind. She has had violent episodes with family in the past.  My questions: 1. Do my parents need an attorney? Not necessarily to pursue their own rights, but just to guide them through this to ensure the safety of Nephew.  2. I'm concerned my nephew might be in danger once Anne finds out about the custody suit. How should that whole thing be handled?   I'm actually terrified that she'll find out while she has my nephew and may hurt or kidnap him, when really the best scenario is that she finds out while Nephew is with John.   Is there anything that can be done to remove him from her care for his own safety while the custody suit is ongoing?  3. Is there anything I can do? I feel so helpless.  4. What are we (myself, my parents, my sister) not thinking of that we should be doing?  Our biggest goal right now is just to make sure that Nephew is physically safe, now and when Anne eventually finds out about the suit.	Yes
"CA, USA Throwaway account for obvious reasons.   Backstory:  My ex-girlfriend (currently early 30s) and I (mid 30s) had a daughter and ended up going on our separate ways when my daughter turned 3, daughter is currently 10. Ex started to go off the deep end before we split and went into a heavy depression and drugs and willfully became homeless not wanting her family's help. After months of threats of taking our daughter away from me, I took myself to court and filed papers for full custody on my own with county help, I was not doing too well financially at the time. After it was said and done primary and physical custody was awarded to me. A visitation schedule was arranged and I told my ex to get the help she needed and if she was sobered she could see her daughter anytime when she wanted and if she got back on her feet we would revisit custody.   Last year my ex had hit 2 years of sobriety after living dirty and not making forward progress for 6 years. In those years, she did not pay one dime of child support or help with any funds for our daughter, I was the sole provider. Ex's mother helped her daughter and was involved in our daughter‚Äôs life and still remains so to this day. Ex went to cosmetology school and started going to church. Ex moved back in with mother and mother provided financial crutch for her to get her life back on track with help for work, education, car, etc. Ex started wanting to visit with daughter more so I allowed it, especially being at grandmother‚Äôs house, she was there to help and supervise and at this point we were not following agreed upon visitation because we were working together without the schedule.    Ex one month approaches me and told me she wanted to have 50/50 custody and I said I would think about it. My internal instinct did not feel that 50/50 custody was appropriate due to the amount of time she was off doing whatever a parent doesn't do. I didn't bring it back up to her but she kept on top of me about it. She kept mentioning wanting to claim her on her taxes and red flags were going off left and right as this was all happening around tax time.   Eventually ex served me paperwork to go back to court. I retained a lawyer who was willing to help but was curious on why I wanted to hold back custody rights. Lawyer informed me that judge would more than likely rule in favor of 50/50 because of recent events and that if there were any further issues it would be easy to have that revoked and changed. Believing that people can change, I took a chance and agreed to 50/50 rights with no child support from either parent. Things have been smooth so far.  Current Day:  Ex is now heavily involved in church. The church is very small (10-15 people) and is just starting to grow. (another red flag for me as I get cultish vibes from small churches for some reason) She brings our daughter to service weekly and I have no issues with that besides not particularly liking small churches. I grew up in church and learned from the stories they tell. Ex meets new boyfriend in church. New boyfriend I have not officially been introduced but I have seen him and something struck me as being a bit off. Ex and I are friends on Facebook and I am seeing posts of her boyfriend or her tagging each other in places with our daughter. Having a weird feeling about the boyfriend I searched his name on the local records database for our county and found a potential match for a criminal case, but this person had a middle name which boyfriends profile did not have.  Person had a conviction for Attempted murder, assault with a deadly weapon and having a firearm.   Instantly this raised concern for me and I began trying to find more information about the boyfriend. Yesterday the information fell into my lap. He posted a Facebook post claiming he was happy he was out of prison and turned his life around and the dates lined up exactly with the printout i purchased from the county.   This morning I asked my child about the ex's boyfriend. I asked two questions, "" Is he nice to you and your mom?"" she replied with yes.  Secondly, I asked her if she knew about his past at all where he was from etc.   She paused and looked at me and told me that he has a bad past. I pushed a little bit further and asked what she meant by that and she told me that he paralyzed someone with a shoe and went to prison, but he is ok now because he is walking with god in his life and then she smiled. My child had no concern over the fact that her mom‚Äôs new boyfriend tried to kill someone or that he went to prison. That lead me to believe that the Ex's mother was ok with this was well so I asked if her grandma knew about his past and she said yes. I sat in disbelief that a situation like this would happen to my child.  When Ex arrived today for her pickup of our daughter I walked with her outside and asked about her boyfriend‚Äôs past, mentioning that I saw on Facebook he posted that he was a ex-felon. All she would cop to was that he had an assault charge. I told her that I found out he was in for attempted murder and she said that he has changed his life and walks with god. I asked why she did not feel the need to tell me about his past and she said she didn‚Äôt have too. I told her that the safety of my child is my concern and I think if the roles were reversed she would expect me to say something. She then rebutted that if she would have told me that all I would have said was I don‚Äôt feel comfortable with him around our daughter.   She goes on to tell me that she has no fear for her or our daughter‚Äôs safety around the ex-felon and that the grace of god is protecting them. I understand that with my ex's past being shady and the new boyfriend's past being worse they would naturally gravitate to each other and ""fix each other"" but I don't want my daughter involved in that relationship.  Drug use and attempted murder are on opposite ends of the spectrum in my mind. But to her, she tells me sin is sin and doesn't see it that way. I told her that I do not want that guy around my daughter but she said there is nothing I can do about it. She goes on to tell me that the boyfriend has people in the church that will vouch for him and the pastor will too. She also tells me the grandmother knows about the boyfriend as well as the grandfather and her brother and they all are fine with him. I have a feeling that she only told them he has an assault charge; however, I have not called them yet to express my concern over this boyfriend. I wanted to have a conversation with her first. She ended up taking my daughter in the car and leaving.  I am left sitting in my office writing this post, not knowing what to do or where to turn. What can I do to protect my child from a potentially horrible situation?  help."	Yes
I made a post in r/relationships yesterday and someone brought up a point I hadn't thought of.   I'm 16. I live with my mom and her boyfriend. When I was 4, CPS took me out of her home and gave me to my Dad and step mom. I lived with them for 7 years, but my Dad abused my stepmom and she eventually left. He took me to live with my mom not long after that and I've been here ever since.   Part of the reason they took me away was because my mom's boyfriend is a sex offender and had for sure sexually abused my older brother (they didn't know about me and I wasn't speaking then. I don't remember either way). There were also drugs and neglect, deplorable house conditions and other things.   Things were ok when we moved back in with her for a little while. She and the boyfriend weren't together anymore, but they got back together a few years ago. My mom is sober as far as I know, but she doesn't really do anything other than lay in her room. Her boyfriend is abusive to me and on drugs. He also has a few warrants but I don't know much about it.   When CPS took me away, my mom willingly signed over full custody to my Dad with no visitation. There also was a restraining order in place against her boyfriend for my brother and I but I've never seen it and don't know how long they last.  I don't want to live here anymore. What can I do to get out of here?  Ideally, I want to live with my ex stepmom but I don't know if that's possible. I haven't seen my dad in years. No idea where he is. I don't think my other family members could afford to support me.   Someone suggested calling the child help hotline and I will, but I want to know if legally I'm even SUPPOSED to be here. If not, can I just walk out?  Can my mom do anything if I just call up my ex stepmom and ask her to come get me?	Yes
Like the title says I have to get a license in New Mexico. New Mexico has two drivers Licenses. The first one doesn't ask for proof of citizenship but you have to make an appointment to get fingerprinted. The  second one requires a birth certificate or visa, a Social Security card, and a utility bill to show proof of residency. So, I opted for what seemed like the easy option. thing is when I showed the clerk the documents, I found out that my Birth Certificate has a Jr while my SSN card does not.   So now I have to go to the Social Security office and change my name there and get a new card or go to a Judge and change my name on my birth certificate. My question is, with all my past documents not having the Jr (mortgage, marriage, Loans) would it be better to just change the birth certificate to mach all those documents even though it means having to set a court appointment or can I correct my name on the Social Security card and leave all my past documents as they are without the Jr?	Yes
"I live in Sacramento California. I am a single father and have full custody of my 7 yo daughter. The court order states that my ex can only see our daughter under supervised visitation, which she does twice a week at my home.   However, I just discovered from the sac county website that she didn't show up for her sheriffs work project from her misdemeanor burglary conviction in 2016, as a result the courts issued a ""commitment warrant"" for 45 days (the time her sheriffs work project was supposed to be) and modified her work project to straight time in jail.   I want to know how i can tell if she has fulfilled her 45 day straight time conviction or if she has an outstanding warrant?  This could be an issue with the supervised visitations at my house. I went to the records office and they wouldn't tell me but there has to be an easy way to see if someone has warrants as I've seen officials announce warrants on tv.  Any help is necessary as I'm just concerned for my daughters safety."	Yes
I'd like to file a motion for my ex and into only communicate through a court approved site like MFW. My ex is either hostile/vulgar or ignores important questions regarding custody. He lately will only communicate with me through the kids which is not beneficial to them in any way. How do I go about filing a motion without hiring a lawyer? Does anyone have experience with MFW?	Yes
So my mother just called me to let me know that her tenant informed her that a man had moved in boxes to the garage and was sleeping there. Turns out its my dad! They have been separated over 20 years. He just left one day and that was that. They never divorced and the mortgage is still under both their names. I didn't see my dad after that or talked to him until maybe 2 years ago when he randomly contacted me to get money. My mom had tried contacting him before about refinancing house to remove his name from loan with no luck. We would hear about him from time to time as he remained in the area. She wants to ask him to leave but she thinks he will still stay because it is still his house. What can be done in a situation like this? Obviously she needs to divorce him.	Yes
"I am in the military. My wife is a veteran. We have two children (7 and 5). We are currently in Camp Pendleton, CA, but we submitted our wills to base legal in Quantico, VA (not sure if that is relevant).  When we were filling out our paperwork, my wife listed her younger sister and sister's husband as the guardians of our children should anything happen to us. I had listed my own older sister and her husband on my own paperwork. Unfortunately, when we went to sign and file the paperwork, the guy had recommended that she and I list the same people for guardianship. I changed the information on my will and my wife was upset with me because, I admit, we had agreed a few years prior that her sister would take the kids.   Then it turns out my wife had listed my sister in law as our children's guardian if anything were to happen to her (my wife) alone. She reasoned that because our daughter is high needs autistic, I would not be able to juggle her therapy appointments and my job in the USMC. I agreed reluctantly and a clause was added that I would get my children back when I ""stabilized"" enough and my SIL and/or a judge agreed that I had all my shit together in order to handle the kids and my work (it was all worded professionally, I just cant remember the exact phrasing).   I am considering filing another will (easy to do as it is a required item before deploying), but with my actual wishes depicted this time (MY sister gets my children if anything happens to us, handles their ""inheritance"", etc., and I get to keep my children if anything happens to my wife). Do I have to let my wife know if I do this?   Now, I know the odds of both my wife and I passing away at the same time are relatively low, but, in case it did happen, whose will would be honored regarding the kids' guardianship?  I know I will not be able to get my wife to change her mind about giving guardianship to her sister. Wife thinks my sister is much too busy with her 4 kids and she also takes care of our father, but that is why I think she would be perfect. My kids would grow up surrounded by family. I think her sister is not fit because she doesn't have any children and does not wish to have any. My children would grow up technically isolated because that is how my SIL and her husband live. They live in TX and are 300 miles away from any of SIL's and wife's family, not mention, three states away from CA where all of my own family lives. While, currently, my kids are much more used to my SIL than my sister, I know they will get used to my family in the coming months since we can now visit with them every few months.  Will it create much of a mess if I do anything I have written above? What *can* be done to try and change the first wills? Is there a way to cancel out my wife's will if I no longer agree with what is supposed to happen with our kids?  I know I was all over the place, so I will try to answer any questions that will help anyone get a better picture of the situation."	Yes
"I am primary custodian of two children who live with me and have visitation with the non-custodial parent every other weekend and a large chunk of summer. the NCP and I have a joint custody order that is very extensive due to the NCPs unwillingness to work with me, the court, or the children multiple times. Due to some things that happened in the past, (threats to vanish with the children and not return) one of the current (many) stipulations of our order is that the non-custodial parent may not remove or block access to the minor child's cell phone.  After a series of gradually escalating confrontations, which are culminating in yet another upcoming court date, the non-custodial parent has refused her own visitation with one child (15 yo) and is continuing to exercise visitation with the other (12).  Now, it has become apparent that the non-custodial parent is taking the child's phone against our orders, and is sending text messages to the custodial parent (me) and step-parent in the guise of the child. The spelling, grammar, and phrases used do not match the child's way of writing or speaking at all, and are very consistent with the NCP instead. The ""Child"" is stating that they are having a great time visiting their NCP, when less than 24 hours prior they were extremely hesitant to visit the NCP due to their cumulative past experiences.  Afterwards, we both received messages from the ACTUAL child that the NCP has been sending messages to us and she has been forced to hand over her phone.  It is also important to note that a child that is normally very good about communicating has gone largely silent since this most recent visitation began, and that is very largely out of character as well.  I've contacted my lawyer already, who is involving the children's ad litem attorney in the situation. What I guess I'm seeking is- has anyone ever heard of anything like this happening before (NCP pretending to be the child in text messages) and how is it best handled (other than ""contact your lawyer"")?"	Yes
My ex girlfriend is around 8 weeks pregnant.  My mind is racing, so please excuse the brevity of this post.  Here is my question:  If the child is mine, I will fight to be a part of the childs life and perhaps even for sole custody.  My ex girlfriend has past legal issues and past drug use.  I am concerned for the well-being of the unborn child.  What can I do now to prepare, legally?  I want to protect myself but I also want to protect the child.  It is also possible that the child is in fact not mine, I am just trying to prepare for the scenario that I am indeed the biological father.  She will not talk to me at any capacity, so I am completely in the dark in regard to information coming from her.    What I know: -She is pregnant, I could be the biological father. -She has had two abortions and has stated she is keeping the child. -She has legal issues and recent drug/alcohol abuse.  In short, how can I use the legal system to protect myself, the child in the event that I am the biological father and can I use the legal system to gain any information on the child before birth?  Thank you for taking the time to read this.	Yes
"Texas.  Spouse out earns me by double. Just found he has not paid the mortgage in 3 months. Trying to force a short sale (mortgage is not in my name , house has joint deed).   I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about ""taking someone out."" When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality. I am an educated professional and a bit disgusted with myself that I allowed this to happen.  Maybe some of that is not relevant, i'll admit I am not thinking clearly. Fundamentally, what can I do about the house???"	Yes
"First of all sorry for the bad English I'm working on it and for the wall of text, but it's a very delicate situation.   Background: We are a family of 5, very poor, living in a Villa near a small town in South Italy. Since I was a child I remember violent quarrels between my mother and my father, he hitting her, screaming on her face, insulting her, spitting on her...   The quarrels are always the same, he started spitting on my little sisters, hitting them, hitting me. When I started growing up i began defending my sisters and my mother; once he said this to me ""get off my way or I will kill you too"", I'll never forget these words.   Nowadays: Since my father has discovered Internet he basically lost all interest in living with us, getting more and more confident with his own smartphone (payed by us, his 3 sons- he cried for it, he wanted the money else he would have just screamed like a mad and maybe got violent). Now that he's 60 he still retains that violent nature, but I'm here now, 24yo, stopping him, helping my mom (who had an accident caused by him hitting a parked car because he had a sleep blow due to him never sleeping spending all night on internet), my sisters are new adults -19yo-. I'm afraid one day we'll come to hitting each others and there will be only one of us alive.    He started cheating on my mother with other people online, chatting with them, meeting with them (i suppose) and calling them (heard one of those names  this morning).   He has his facebook with no privates settings, so I accidentally stumbled upon his profile. All my doubts were solved, words like ""i love you"" ""The place I'll stay with ***** forever and ever"" (that place was the photo of our Villa...)   I wanna lock him outside of the house as soon as he leaves for a reason, what would the consequences be? Is this legal? What should I really do?"	Yes
"When the children were born, I tried my best to keep them on track with their developmental milestones given to us by the pediatrician.  When I weened my son off of bottles and breastfeeding at 8 months old and began baby food, the grandparents immediately put a stop to it, insisting he would choke or that the sippy cup would hurt his mouth. They continued giving him bottles against my wishes and those of the doctor to the extent that the doctor dismissed the children from her practice.  Both of my children ended up eating pureed foods and using bottles until they went to preschool.  My son wasn't talking when he was supposed to - around 2 years old - so I signed him up for the Early Learning Coalition Early Intervention Head Start program. Their father insisted I was forcing them to grow up too fast, and that he'd eventually just start talking on his own. After seeing the ""baby school"" as we called it, he relented, and my son was considered a preschooler at 2 years old, in the state school system with a structural and safe environment, and speech therapy. I was ecstatic to see their father agreeing to something finally. It turns out that my son is autistic, and this early intervention has helped him enough that it is barely noticeable.  My daughter was a thumb sucker since the womb. When she was born, be I bought her onesies with hand covers on them, and tried to get her to use a pacifier instead. His family undid it all, insisting that if it kept her calm and happy, let her do it until she grows out if it. (She was a colic baby)  She is now 8 years old, needs her mouth reconstructed so her front upper jaw won't be shaped like her thumb anymore, needs braces to straighten her teeth, and STILL sucks her thumb when she sleeps.  I left when my daughter was 7 months old. I tried to take the children with me, but he took them from me and locked them in the room with his parents. I was forced to leave without them. I tried multiple times to get the children back through the courts - even with evidence of domestic violence - but because he had more money, he kept getting primary custody. I was able to get them back for a year, before any court order was in place, and during that time (they were 3 and 4) I got them off the bottles, potty trained them both, and introduced them to solid foods. Getting them into school and social scenarios was a little harder. While my son had been in ""baby school"" since 2 years old, his grandparents wouldn't let him eat the school lunch, and only packed him a pack of crackers and an applesauce, quoting that he wouldn't eat anything else. (My kids, at the time, would eat anything I gave them)  So as my children grew older, they refused to eat anything they were not already introduced to. They would go as far as to act terrified, cry, and even vomit to justify their fear of new or different things. Even today, while I have had progress over the last few years, they will only eat things such as chicken and rice (their dad's family staple) pizza, macaroni and cheese, or fast food chicken nuggets. They don't like hot dogs, hamburgers, any kind of red meat, had never had any fruits or vegetables, or even candies and chocolate. They don't like chocolate milk or soda or tea. They are robbing themselves of their own childhood - and I don't mind some of these, but this is ridiculous. We have a rule that they have to try one new thing every visit. If they don't like it, they don't have to finish it, but they do have to try it. It's worked so far for so many things, but we're still far from even having begun.  My children have never known the need for physical exertion. They have never been exposed to sports at their dad's. They refuse to ride their bikes or scooters or skateboards. They get tired walking to the mailbox. They claim a box of food is too heavy to carry, they expect me to walk across the room to give them something off of the table in front of them. I don't do it - but someone else does. It took a long time to get my son to understand that he cannot bark at, or give orders to, my mother or myself. My daughter is still learning that she has to do things for herself. They don't know how to open packets of food, tie their shoes, brush their hair, fold their clothes...the list goes on. And they refuse to learn when I try to teach them. Because they're so used to everything coming so easily, or someone else doing it for them, if you try to teach them and they don't get it the first time, they get angry with the task and say they'll never do it again.  My daughter is actually exceptionally intelligent. She is making straight A's in school. I'm trying to skip her a grade and teach her things that are more mentally simulating and challenging, but the moment she is required to put effort into it, she refuses to do it, claiming it's too difficult for her. Turns out the county here doesn't skip grades, but they've agreed to change her educational material regardless. Hopefully, this will help her learn to accept hardships as a challenge and not a stopping point.  The children were never taught how to control their emotions, so when something happens, I have to drop everything, grab their face, tell them, ""don't panic, breathe, look at me and nothing else."" ""The worst thing you can do in a high-stress situation is panic. Now look at this situation, and tell me how you would deduce a solution"" I refuse to let them give up on anything they have the potential to enjoy.  It takes time to get through to them, but I take all the time I'm given to prepare them. I find myself often reminding them, ""as your mother, I am not here to do everything for you. I am here to keep you from harm as I guide you to learn to do these things for yourself. That is my job."" And they begin to understand.  They also learned the concept of money from me. It started with bribes as rewards, then fines as punishments - which I don't personally condone, but it taught them the basics of law and finances. If they messed up, I'd ""ticket"" them, and they'd pay. Suddenly they realised they didn't have enough money to buy another of whatever they broke. They learned that we can't ""just go out and buy another one"" anytime something breaks. So they better care of things. They know now when I do or do not have the money, but they trust me when I tell them I'll get what they ask for when I can afford it - so long as they earned it.  The children often say they do not want to return to my house, because it is too hard for them to be with me, because I teach them sports, budgeting, household chores, cooking, logical deduction, stress management... They say they're only given things to play with at their dad's, and the only real interaction they get is when they are given help with homework and food. They're otherwise left to their own devices and their grandparents will just do whatever keeps them quiet and happy so the kids don't have to do for themselves at all.  But my shining moment was when the children tried to do something they know very well how to do - such as warming up food in the microwave - and their grandparents panicked and took away the chance. When the children realized that they were treated like independent and intelligent people with me, and babies at their father's, they started getting more excited about our visits.   But the issue is, their father considers their attempts to care for themselves as ""rebellion"", and they're punished for it, then the children are told to me angry with me. The children are told I do not love them or want them, that I neglect them so they're forced to learn for themselves. Everything I teach them becomes undone. Their lost money is returned, their broken items replaced, their independence stolen from them. Then they go back to their Xbox, their tablets...they get locked away from the world I'm trying to show them.  Since 2013, my visits have been every other weekend, and 2 weeks out of the summer. During 2014-2015, they were withheld from me for 18 months in violation of that order until September of 2015, and now I'm starting all over again. Every attempt I've made to regain custody has been turned on me, and the courts see nothing wrong with how the children are parented by their father's family. I've been denied custody now 3 times.  So...what can I do?  Sorry this is too long."	Yes
"Apologies in advance, there's a lot going on and we've only just found out about this.  My grandmother (father's side) has slowly had her Alzheimer's get worse and worse.  Back in 2005, she was worried that she was starting to ""lose it"", and signed power of attorney over to my father in case it was actually Alzheimer's and not just her getting older.  I've checked the county clerk of courts website, and I see the document there granting power of attorney to my father.  About 3 years ago (2014-ish), my Uncle and my Aunt (and possibly other extended family) told my father that they convinced her to switch Power of Attorney over to them.    My father asked my Grandma if this was true, to which she replied yes.  Dad takes that as his cue to stay out of it from here on out.  At that point, my Aunt started living with my Grandmother.  My aunt has multiple felony drug convictions.  I would bet my house that she's been stealing from my grandmother since she moved in, but that isn't relevant to the question, sorry.    Fast forward to two weeks ago, and grandma is in really bad shape.  Almost non-responsive.  A different family member took her to see the family doctor who immediately admits her for dehydration and malnutrition.  She is now (as of late last week) in a senior care facility.  Monday of this week, another concerned family member got online and did some digging on the county clerk of courts site, and there are no records of Grandma signing Power of Attorney over to my Uncle or Aunt.  There are also no records of any Guardianship applications.  Dad realizes he's probably been lied to, purposefully by aunt and uncle (who have again almost assuredly been stealing her social security money) and almost assuredly unknowingly by my Grandmother.  My question is, had my Uncle actually filed for power of attorney, or for guardianship, would there be a record of that on the county clerk of courts website?  This was again supposedly a couple years back, not like last week where it wouldn't be updated.  Dad is now meeting with the current home, who was told not to allow him or my mother to make any decisions about Grandma by my Aunt / Uncle, to show them the 2005 documents.  They intend to move her to a better facility closer to them so that they can help.   I guess I'm just wondering if we're getting our hopes up?  Uncle and Aunt are obviously a mess, and we want to do what's best for Grandma, but we were under the impression (and that's on us for not checking) that Dad was no longer in control.  Also, if my dad still does have power of attorney, how can we get Grandma's financial information so that we can see how much they have been stealing from her, and make sure that her social security money gets used for her care?"	Yes
So my friends sister is married to a marine. They have been married for nine months. Yesterday he served her divorce papers but would not let her see the papers. He now is telling her today that if she doesn't sign by 5am tomorrow then he is going to go to the court and say she is refusing to sign them. With a quick Google search it looks like she has 30 days before he can do anything. But he is refusing to let her even see the papers so she can't sign even if she wanted to. What's her best course of action? Thanks! 	Yes
Greetings!  I reside in the state of Illinois, and I'm wondering if getting married in Mexico will automatically hold a legal authority in the US? I cannot find any info about this online (though I'm bad at research). Do countries instantly exchange marital information about a citizen/resident? Or will it only hold its legal value and thus show up on my american record if I notarize and apostille the certificate in the US.  Big thank you in advance.	Yes
"As the title states I'm 22. My mom got the no contact order when I was really young, no older than 4. I met with my dad, mostly out of curiosity but partially because I wanted to fill the void I felt during my childhood.   My whole life he was called my ""sperm donor"" and as I grew up and saw my mom for who she truly was I became more and more curious about my father and what really happened. (Feel free to stalk my comment history for more backround on my mom and our relationship)   The short version is I spent my entire life being the villain in my mom's story, even as a young child. I was blamed for everything wrong and the constant abuse I endured was ""my fault"" as well.  So when I heard that my dad wanted to meet me, I jumped at the chance. We spent 2 hours talking, about our cats, my mom, our childhoods, anything that came to mind.   I would love the opportunity to meet with him again and to possibly have him involved in my life but the no contact order worries me.   My questions are:   Would the no contact order still be valid even though I'm an adult?  If there are different types, how would I go about finding the information as to what exactly the order entails?  And finally, if it is still valid, how would I go about getting rid of or ending it?  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to being able to move forward with my life, out of my mom's shadow."	Yes
"Alright so I'm in a weird situation. I've been with my kids mom for several years now and it has never really worked out. We've stayed together for our son. Anyway, she hates my guts and I don't really enjoy hers, I live in her apartment(her aunt pays for) and I pay rent. It's been this way for a long time now. My name is not on the lease and hers is. My question is this; she is telling me that she is going to have the cops come tomorrow after I get off work to kick me out. I've told her that I need a notice to have some time to find a place but she's adamant in the fact that she doesn't need to give me a notice and she can ""do whatever the fuck she wants because it's HER apartment."" Am I wrong for thinking that a notice is required? I pay bills and I am here for my son. She's guaranteed me that the cops will come tomorrow and make me leave. I've tried to reason with her but she isn't having it. We agreed a few weeks ago that I will leave the first of September(which I'm COMPLETELY ok with) and now she's doing this. Do I have any rights in this situation? I'm the breadwinner in this household, it's not like I don't contribute. I'm just trying to figure out what to expect IF the cops get involved tomorrow."	Yes
"My sister M is currently 13. Earlier this year, she started self harming and one of her friends reported it to the school. M talked to a school counselor and confessed that she had been molested as a child by one of my cousins. The counselor then shared this information with my family (and the police I assume? Aren't school counselors mandated reporters?). None of us had even suspected a thing and it was horrible for pretty much everyone in my immediate family (no one outside my parents and siblings knew or even suspected). Now here's the part where I want legal advice:  My sister M was 7 when my 16 year old cousin molested her on 3 different occasions. She is now 13, like I said. Even if M does decide she wants to press charges (and I don't think she is currently in a place to feel comfortable doing so), is there like any chance in hell that something will come of it? The cousin who molested her was a minor at the time, no one witnessed it, and while I and my family of course believe M, it happened 6 years ago so I'm afraid there's not any ""proof."" Note: this cousin joined the military out of high school and we have not seen him in years. Does being in the military affect this at all, if charges were to be brought against him? I'm mostly terrified that he will be able to hurt (or has already hurt) other children and, of course, I also want him to rot in hell/jail for what he did to my sister. Pressing charges is ultimately going to be M's decision (with support from her therapist and all of us), but what are the odds that it's even worth our time (ie, will actually go somewhere legally) and her possibly having to see him again in court to press charges?"	Yes
Basically, I'll make this pretty concise and simple. I had a child that CPS was involved with during and after the birth due to a terrible decision of mine and a positive drug test. My aunt now has temporary custody. I have passed every drug test, I've complied with all court orders, and I'm on the way to getting my son back. However, the CPS workers involved have, behind closed doors, openly ridiculed me, accused me of altering drug tests but refusing to send them to a lab, and generally been very openly judgmental and difficult to get along with. So, my question is, WHO can I turn to as an advocate for my rights and complaints? The GAL? The CPS case worker's supervisor? A human rights advocate? Can I request a court-appointed attorney? Perhaps a change of venue to another county? Can my case worker be remanded due to personal bias? I've tried to research this information on my own, but only found information regarding proceedings and my rights, but not who I can contact as my advocate in the matter. Thank you to any and all who can point me in the right direction. Again, I live in Virginia.	Yes
"Okay, so, basically my kids dad had me served with a civil summons yesterday petitioning for joint custody with him being the primary. For some backstory, we were together for 8 years, have two daughters, 5 and 7, and have been separated for four years. Never married. No prior legal agreement in place. Since we separated I have always been the primary parent. He never had them more than a couple days a week, has never paid child support, never there when I needed him, everything has always fallen on me. We have been having issues for quite awhile now. He has always been very unreliable. Doesn't pick them up when he says he will, doesn't answer calls or texts, never says when he'll drop them off, will be set off by the most random things and threaten to keep them and not give them back. From July to October of last year all of this kept escalating. My oldest picked up lice from school and gave it to me and her sister and he berated me for being ""filthy,"" refused to give my kids back but eventually relented and gave them to my mom after insisting they had lice again after I had already treated them. They didn't. He was erratic with the days he wanted to keep them, was late getting our oldest to school and couldn't pick her up so I had to drop what I was doing to rush to get her. Eventually I stopped asking him to help me out and my mom and I worked out a more reliable  schedule because I just couldn't depend on him or trust him to help me and be a partner. This was fine for about a month until he started demanding I change my schedule so he could see them. He wouldn't work with me and I got scared so I cut off contact while I saved money for a lawyer.  We have been back in contact for about a month now. He showed up at my moms house, said he was going to call cps on me, the cops, that I am unstable, etc. I talked to him and he told me all he wanted was visitation. I sent him a very long text outlining my issues and concerns but telling him I was more than willing to work with him and go to a mediator but I wasn't comfortable with him taking them until there was something in place. He never responded and instead had me served with this summons. I'm calling lawyers as soon as possible to formulate a response to the summons since I only have 20 days but I guess what I am asking is what are the chances I would lose primary? I have had some missteps in my past which play into why I did not seek out a legal agreement sooner, I was a stripper which I thought would hurt me and I did mess with substances. (Nothing major like heroin or anything and I was never addicted or did anything around the girls). Now though I am steadily employed since November and have moved up quickly at my job. I have been clean from any and all drugs for almost a year. I don't smoke and I rarely drink. I have a reliable paycheck and benefits. The girls go to school in my district, I have a stable home, I've had the same boyfriend for four years and we don't even live together, I provide everything for them emotionally and financially. He has never provided support or had them more than a couple days a week in all the time we have been separated.  I believe he's trying to file this way to get out of child support and to hurt me. He is a very manipulative, vindictive person and I know he doesn't like me standing up to him so he is going to do everything he can to drag me down. I'm afraid me cutting off contact will play against me. In his summons it sounds like he is going to go after my environment and emotional stability. What do I need to do to prove what he is asking is not in the girls best interests? What are the chances he will get what he is asking? Is there anything that will hurt me going forward and that I need to do to prepare? I am fine with working with him on the joint custody part but I absolutely do not want to lose primary. I'm scared and need some reassurance. Thank you guys."	Yes
My ex and I went through a court battle for custody and access of our child, the justice's order was that access and custody be 50/50.  She now wants to change our child's name, which I'm against.  Is there any way she can have this done without my consent?  And is the justice's order for custody and access difficult to change?  It's been keeping me up at night, as the court order was just recently won in my favour restoring my access and custody, and I constantly worry what she can do to overturn a justice's decision.  Advice and any insight appreciated.	Yes
First time poster looking to get an answer to a question that I've been having issues figuring out.   I'm trying to file a Paternity case to get a court order for visitation. I reside in Los Angeles county and my daughter resides in San Bernardino county. Which county do I use to file for my paternity case? My daughter has lived outside of Los Angeles since 11/2016. If I file in San Bernardino county, do I have to travel to that courthouse each time I need to go to court or will the Los Angeles courts be able to assist me?	Yes
"My summary is long but my general questions are what constitutes harassment and/or annoyance when a divorce degree is in place but you share a child and are still required to communicate? As well as what actions can I take in such cases?  Here's my summary as I'd like to know if this is harassment and/or annoyance. I live in Ohio. I have full custody of my child. My ex husband has a set visitation schedule within our divorce decree unless ""the parties do not agree otherwise"". We agreed a month ago in text messages to a small one day change in the schedule. I stated ""My birthday falls on your Friday on [my birth date]. As I allotted you to pick her up at 10 am for your birthday (not to affect any type of visitation or vacation time) I'd also like to be able to pick her up for my birthday at 10 am on [my birth date] for my birthday. "" Text in parenthesis was included. He agreed via text message. This Thursday almost a month later he came to pick our child up and requested that he be able to pick her up another day to make up for me getting her on my birthday as he doesn't want to lose time with her. Where as he's not losing time with her as his birthday fell on my visitation day and mine on his. We also ""otherwise agreed"" to a one day change a month ago. A month's notice was given and my intent was also that if he didn't agree that I could request to use a ""vacation"" day which our decree states has to be made 30 days prior. I declined his request. He asked me two more times in person. One of which I stated he's not lost any time as I gave him my time on his birthday. He then proceeds to text me this Saturday again requesting to get her another day to make up for his lost day. I again state that he's not lost any time and refer back to his birthday. I question him as to why he seems to think his time with her is more valuable than me. He denies he feels that way. The proceeds to question me as to why I'm making such a big deal and that he'd have agreed to switching days for his birthday which he had contacted me requesting to have her for if if of asked. To which I responded stating again that I already have him my answer. He then responds saying I'm being spiteful and do not have the best interest of our child at heart. Then threats that he will take me back to court since I' not being ""friendly"" (imply that if I do not comply to him he will take me back to court.) He claims that I am doing this only out of spite and I lack care for my daughter and her feelings. He made the remark that everytime our three year old daughter goes to his house she claims to want to stay with him. (Which she also tells me she wants to stay with me.) He also then proceeds to say that our decree does not state anything about either of us getting her for our birthday. Then threatens me again that if I do not agree to him picking her up on his demanded day that he will not allow for me to pick her up for our agreed upon schedule change that happened a month ago. I reminded him that he agreed to the adjustment and also remind him that he had just stated that he'd of been fine with switching days for his birthday that had fallen on my time and that I was now requesting such. He then asked me to prove where he agreed to losing a day. Claiming he never did and that he has done nothing but request the day he's now demanding. He continued to again exclaiming he is not trying to argue that he just does not want to lose time with her. Again questioning as to why I'm making such a big deal about it. I state that he said nothing about wanting to make the day up during our text agreement a month prior. Reiterating again that I'm only making up for my missed time with her from his birthday. I also state that I now have texts of his saying he'd of been fine with me requesting the times being switched to accommodate for his birthday. Yet when I request such he is threatening me and calling me spiteful. I screenshot and circled the text messages from a month prior and send them to him as requested. He exclaims that I act like I am so high and mighty like i have all the power in the world. Saying that in reality I don't know how to put my daughter's feelings first and that I only care about myself and everything in my best interest. He throws out again something from our divorce decree that we are supposed to work together for the best interest of our daughter. But that i only care about my best interest and only want to hurt him. He says whatever and that he wont bring it up again. My response was¬† ""Where was this best interest and working together for our daughter as well as her happiness that you keep speaking of when you were upset that her birthday fell on my visitation and I asked if you, your family, as well as your girlfriend would like to come to her birthday party the day of her birthday? Yet you gave me no response nor did you show up for her birthday. Not even a phone call. Yet I made that about myself? Did i also make it about myself when your mom picked her up on my time for [our daughters cousin's] birthday? Or how about when you asked to take her to the zoo and my plans had fallen through and I allowed you to take her on my time to the zoo ie: Chucky cheese? Or when I switched the schedule around for you because of your work schedule? Don't flatter yourself."" To which he never responded. This is the second time I've ever asked for anything. The first time was for our daughters mom and me dance recital that fell on his weekend. He initially refused my months notice to switch the schedule around but did finally come around after ignoring me and refusing to respond until he had something to use as leverage ie: fathers day when he again requested more of my time rather than allowing me to pick her up at the time the divorce decree calls for.  Does this constitute harassment? Does this break our divorve decree agreement to not annoy or harass the other party? At what point do his threats constitute harassment? Especially his exclamation that if i don't agree to his request that he'll keep our child from me on our priorly agreed upon schedule adjustment?"	Yes
My wife and I are splitting, we're divorcing, we're done. Not going to get into who's fault or whatever, but there's a big issue.   She took my debit card, basically taking access away from money. Basically she decided to hold the money over my head. The account is joint, I have a card with my name on it and she has one with ours and it goes to the same account. She would basically give me cash when I got paid and tell me to get another bank account, which I eventually did but the latest paycheck still went into the account. She would drop the money off and yet I wouldn't get the full amount. Basically she's leaving me with nothing and also controlling how much I can have. She told me she is closing the account so I will no longer have access to it. Fine. We need to split.   Here's the twist... I found the card. Apparently she didn't think to chop the damn thing out before throwing away (and apparently she needs to work on her skills because she missed the garbage can) And the account isn't closed. I check the balance and found she has a lot more money than previously thought. I'm sitting here with my card wondering if I have any right to withdraw whatever money I want. And I'm confused... Do I? I mean... It's our account, she took my debit card, and the card has my name on it..... What do I do? I need to pay bills, I have a mouth to feed and she just left me with nothing. I could take the loss and wait until I get paid again but during this split she's done nothing reasonable. Everything done, especially the money situation, has been uncalled for. It may sound mean, and like I'm trying to get revenge but that's not what I want. I just don't want to starve the next two weeks. So... Do I have a right to withdraw the money?	Yes
Just curious I am a step parent and father has already refused to give up parental rights.  How do I go about gaining legal rights for my daughter without adoption since he refuses to give up his rights? Dad has not been in her life at all and I have had custody the last 5 years. He lives in another state and was abusive towards the mother even though there is no legal evidence of the abuse.  We are also looking into child support but me being a step parent I support and pay for everything including insurance. Is my income and my support taken into account in court? Or just the biological parent? 	Yes
"Hey!  My mom and dad seperated legally back in November of 2016 and my mom was awarded spousal support checks from my dad's income. My dad is salary and gets a constant amount every two weeks. My mom's spousal support checks from my dad's workplace have varied in amount by $100 to $200 each check, and that's when they show up. Currently it has been almost 2 weeks since my dad's last payday and no check has arrived. This isn't unusual and has been on going since the checks started coming. We tried to get direct deposit but his workplace refused and will only mail out a check when they remember to.   Now my parents agreed outside of court to some things, such as my dad continuing to pay the mortgage on the house, while my mom has taken it on to pay pretty much everything else. The checks coming late puts a massive amount of strain on her when trying to pay bills and maintain things around the house. Her divorce lawyer (original plan was full divorce) has been completely unhelpful and extremely expensive to do minor tasks. When the checks being late or coming in different amounts was brought up they sent a letter which cost way to much to do nothing. This was back in March. So my question is, what can be done here? My dad has gone in to HR at work to inquire about missing checks which they've claimed ""were sent out weeks ago"" only to show up next day via priority mail and they won't really tell him anything either way.   So is there anyway to get these checks in on set dates or maybe verify they are abiding by a court order? I know one other thing is my dad works for an Indian casino and there seems to be some odd understandings regarding their abiding by said court order, so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
I need help, more accurately my grandma needs help. She is getting evicted at the end of August. She has had my mother staying with her. My grandma is the sweetest little old lady and can't see that my mother is a leech. My mother hasn't paid rent, she doesn't clean, she does nothing to help my grandma. She has the money to help get my grandma from being evicted but is just letting it happen. My mother is paranoid. Is manic depressive, and has bipolar all untreated. She is a leech to the point her own father wont take her in and he has done it once before.   I want to know if there is anything I can do to get my mother away from my grandma or to make her pay up. I would prefer to remove her from my 73 year old grandma.   I would rather have my grandma hate me over her supporting her daughter till she passes. My grandma also still works. My mother should be supporting grandma not the other way around.   I also live in albany, ny. They are on long island. I have a month to do something. If you need more info just message me please and thank you.  (Not sure if tag is right but I'm not sure what this would fall into)	Yes
Okay so here's the deal. Around march of this year I quit a job that provided a company vehicle. I found a used Volkswagen on Craigslist for $3,000. The money for the vehicle came out of my exs bank account. I never had a ton in my savings but she did because of a large settlement she received from a car accident. The car is registered in both of our names and it is clearly stated on the title.   Anyways about 6 weeks after we get the car she broke up with me. Now she either wants $3,000 or the car back. I'd be okay with giving her the money but since we are in the process of moving out then should I not be asking for the things I bought her during the relationship? Obviously the car is expensive compared to the other things I'm thinking of but I just don't see the difference. When we got the car I needed it to get to work so I could make money for our bills.   So should I just pay her for the car to end this headache? I offered her half of the money, would that be a decent option? Or was the car a gift and I don't owe her anything?   Sorry if I sound selfish or rude. She's done and said a lot of things to me the last few weeks that have affected me a lot mentally.	Yes
Hello Reddit , and thank you for taking the time to read my story.  Throwaway my obvious reasons. I have two kids. A daughter who is 8 and a son that is 5.  When I gave birth to the both of them, I was staying with him, because I didn't have a place to stay myself. As time went on, things went South and we ended up not being able to be in a relationship with each other.  Ever since then, I have been trying to get partial custody because I have a place and would like to see my kids. However, they keep on delaying indefinitely,  because the grandfather has a terminal illness and they're in the grieving process currently. Recently, the father officially has passed, may he rest in peace, and now they're requesting even more time. What can I do? Before they were requesting time because he was very ill, and now they're requesting more time because he died.   The FOMK isn't even letting me see the kids in any shape or form. They're doing whatever they can to keep me out of the kids life and that's completely unfair. I don't even know what school my youngest son goes to because he hides everything regarding them from me.  I have tried to get partial custody. Filed for child support. What can I do Reddit? Is there anything I can do to stop them from delaying indefinitely like they have been?  Also, his aunt is an attorney and is helping them through the process. What can I do Reddit?   Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much for reading.	Yes
I need financial advice. This is to help my mother and family. Basically my father comes from a wealthy family, he was abusive financially, emotionally, verbally, physically towards my mother. His father passed away last year and he purposely makes sure my mother and none of my siblings have anything to do with his side of the family. He has a massive paranoia towards my mother, because he is mentally ill, his whole family do. He did not tell any of us that my grandfather passed away or that he was having a funeral, we found out a week later after feeling something was wrong. My grandfather did not agree with the way my mother was treated, and wanted her to be treated fairly, and his grandchildren within the family. My father lives alone, and has joined a very expensive gold club, which he denies, and I imagine he has his inheritance hidden, since that side of the family have been up for tax evasion previously. I talked to him yesterday after he didn't communicate with the family for a year, which he blames us, but he impossible to communicate with. He said that he has gone back to work because what else would he do, but he said technically he doesn't have to work anymore. He did ask if I am okay for money and was going to throw me a few hundred euro, but I didn't accept his offer, because I don't think it is good enough, he abandoned the family financially for years, and my mother had to work extremely hard to put food on the table. I also have a feeling my grandfathers will has been tampered with. The reason I believe this is because he told me when I visited him, that we are getting nothing, because it has been set up that way, and that it is out of his hands. He had alzheimer's for years and tried to hide it, so it would have been very easy for anyone on that side of the family to get him to sign anything. I have no idea what is going on with my grandfathers inheritance, but would like to get to the bottom of it. He won't tell me much information because he is paranoid about what will go back to my mother. He only gives my mother 350 euro a month, which is ridiculous considering the fact he told me he lives very comfortably now. My mother had to pay a solicitor 20,000 euro of her money she earned this year, because she owed him from when she had to get legal help to get him out of the house years ago. She is also paying five thousand for my brothers braces, while my father claims he doesn't have enough money to help her. She is suffering financially while my father is well off, and is hiding money, probably in his mothers name, or someone else's. Do you have any recommendations of what I can do? I am willing to speak with him since he allows me to communicate with him, but I have to be very careful with what I say, because he could easily choose to have nothing to with me, if I push it too far. I want to help my mother, but am not sure the best way? I could try and convince him to speak to my mother, but he is so against her and mistrusting of her, it would be very difficult.  Thank you.	Yes
"So in just over 24 hours I have a ""hearing to determine dependency"" with children and youth. The paperwork I received says that ""the child is without proper care or control"" and that she will be placed in ""kinship foster care"". What do those things mean? Also, I was told that once the issue involved is no longer an issue, she will be able to go right back to me. Does it work like that, or will there need to be another hearing? I applied for and was given a public defender, that I have so far not been able to get in contact with."	Yes
I am getting divorced and have a 18month old son. I have moved out of the house because Wife has made false accusations against me in the past and I do not feel safe at home.  My Mediation for Temporary Hearings is coming up. My lawyer (a expensive one) told me straight that if we do not get agreement at mediation, the judge will just give me a Standard Possession Order at the Temporary Hearing.  I am sure my wife knows this so she will offer me nothing more than the Standard Possession Order at all.  My goal for this custody battle is to get 50% of my son's time. Question is - should I settle at the Mediation for time equivalent to the Standard Possession order or go to Court for the Temporary hearing and get teh Standard Possession order (SPO) there?  The reason I ask this is because - It seems that if I voluntarily ACCEPT an offer equivalent to the SPO, I will probably not get anything more later. If I do not accept, it will be on record that I did not accept and I can continue to fight for more.  Is my reasoning right here?	Yes
Location: KY  Going off this post: Wife on drugs and cheating on me with coworker. What can I do? https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6nd1vy/wife_on_drugs_and_cheating_on_me_with_coworker/  I caught my wife up in some more lies and she is livid right now. She said she's coming to get my daughter away from me and telling me there isn't anything I can do because we are married, she has possessions in the house and the cops won't escort her off the premises.   I'm worried about the safety of my daughter. She says she hasn't used drugs in about a month now so Idk what leg I will have to stand on there and it's the weekend so I don't know how to go about getting an emergency custody order. My lawyer is on vacation and Idk what to do? Do I have to let my daughter go with her? IS there anything legally I could do?

"Posted from r/relationships  I've posted about this before but feel utterly stumped. Pretty short summary of everything going on, my abusive ex boyfriend has been harassing and blackmailing me. As he is currently in a different country (Australia), he's contacted me on several numbers telling me that if I don't speak to him he's going to release my personal information and a couple more intimate pictures. Ever since, I've woken up to messages from him, telling me that I've been ""exposed"" and has started to involve some mutual acquaintances. He'll claim that they've also seen my pictures because I'm whore who's passed them around. When I have enough proof that he hasn't even spoken to them, he gaslights me calling me a ""shady bitch"" or ""paranoid"", or will tell me that ""he just thought I had been exposed"".   Per r/legaladvice and many of the people on this particular subreddit, I took the advice to reach out to my local police station to file a police report. Upon discussing my issue with them however, I was told that I would not be able to do anything as police reports are for ""criminal matters"" only and I can't do anything about anything that might happen. Furthermore, I was told that ""my public information would be available online anyway"". An officer told me to try telling him that I was going to submit a report regarding his harassment which I have tried only to be told by him that, ""If something happens to him, there's going to be consequences for me"". I have also previously received other threats from him stating verbatim ""I know where you live, I'll see you soon"", ""If i want you dead, you will be. I know people in your state"", "" ""I want you dead"". I'm currently waiting for another call from the police regarding these threats, but I feel like I have no basis to take this any further.

(Ohio, USA). Despite being a minor, does the kid have any rights or privileges after the divorce is said and done? i.e. can they decline going to the opposite parents house, choose whose house they want to be at, etc.	Yes
First off let me state, me and my ex have a pretty good relationship, except shes very controlling and wants her way. Besides that she's an amazing mother and friend.  We're in the process of divorce and she keeps saying that she wants sole legal custody so she can make sure peyton attends the right schools and isn't raised into religion (family drama caused yhay issue)   So at first i agreed, nothing is finalized but after talking to a family friend who is works in a law firm she told me it was a terrible idea because I'd be essential giving up all rights as a father.   I love being a father and I don't want to give up my rights, but I'm extremely confused..  Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
I'm 16, was adopted from fostercare about 3 years ago. It was one of the worst decisions I've ever made and I'm now looking for a way out. Anyway, absolutely any way that can sever ties between my adopted parent and make it so I can live else where. I have multiple places I could live if I wasn't legally obligated to live here. I've looked into emancipation and it doesn't look easy and/or possible. I've tried CPS (trust me it was justified) and they left I shit you not. And now I'm just looking for a way out, does anyone have advice?	Yes
My ex husband will be paying me child support starting next month. I am trying to do some long range planning to see if it is feasible to stay in my current residence.   This year my CCTB payments are $1800 a month. When it comes to file next year will I include the child support payments as part of my i come to calculate my payments?    Thanks for any advice or answer. 	Yes
I'm getting ready to file for divorce in Arizona after six years. We agree on everything, already live apart, are friendly, have no children, and the only asset is the house we purchased and own together. I'm keeping the house, and she will file a quit claim deed sometime after the divorce when I'm able to access some funds to give her half of the equity.   I'm going to file the petition, and she is going to complete an Acceptance of Service. We then plan on filing a Consent Decree after the 60 day waiting period. My question is, how do we handle the Response? If she files one, it seems the court automatically schedules an Early Resolution Conference. If she doesn't file, I have to request default which looks to add an additional 4-6 weeks to the process. Is there some other option, or is it one or the other?	Yes
"CA/Alameda county/Bay Area So long story short, I am posting for my brother. He is getting a divorce and she won't leave until he signs a paper saying he kicked her out with is untrue. A little backstory: they got together when she was in high school and then had a baby so never finished high school until some time later. fast forwarding, they got married and had kid number 2. They have been living together for quite some time but obviously unhappy. I mean I'm not rude or anything but she's a 2 and he's like a 7 at least right so how they got together is still a big question.....anyways the point is she's stuck in her high school mentality or something, never grew up. When they got together she became a ""housewife"" because she has no job and doesn't do anything with her life. She sits at her house watching netflix all day/facebooking all day. Her kids are usually dirty, her house is always a mess. Literally her dishes would be piled in her sink and she would leave them there for weeks! The house would smell like sewer because if the rotten food on the stove! Half of her food in the fridge was always decomposing!The kids clothes are small and not to mention the kids clothes smell rotten because she washes them and then dries them days later. Im pretty sure they shower every other week too! Now my brother works graveyard shifts all the time. He comes home and wants a hot meal and a clean home and clean kids! but no. So of course he would be unhappy! mind you she can go to the store anytime she wants she has a joint debit card with him. Theres so much to this story but i guess thats the basics. Now. I wanna know what can he do incase she tries him in court. I mean he brings in all the money, he provides for them and she's a stay at home mom. never had a job before and doesn't even clean or do anything at home. She wants to get full custody of the children. She wants him to sign a paper saying my brother kicked her out so she can pull it up in court. He told her if she wants to leave the door is open, but he will not continue to pay her phone, bills, buy her stuff , etc. I think she's crazy and honestly i don't know how they have lasted years of marriage, its been around 10 years. OH! and they have a new house together and of course the house is not paid off yet so its legally not theirs yet but i also am curious about the home. Someone please tell me what could happen and whats the best way to go and etc. Thanks!!"	Yes
Father has been absent to child for 4 years and living in another province but he resently was court ordered to pay child support. Well  he wants something to do with child now and i have refused due to the fact we have a new family now, the child knows only her step father as her father(hes been around since the child was 2) and 2 little sisters she loves very much, not to mention but she also has my in laws who spoil her and treat her like thier own blood. Well the bio dad wants full custody, what are the chances of that happening? Would a judge give him full custody and let him leave the province with her? Any lawa in place i can use to stop that from happening? Its been four years, does he not forefit his rights to her? Could it be considered abandoment even though she has been with me?	Yes
"Hello guys,  Well, the mother of my child is moving away with my kid about 300+ miles away from me. We were never married but have had split custody without any official court order for that matter.  I have had a personal addiction problem which I have sought treatment in recently after getting into Rehab.  She gave me the heads up of her move well over a year ago and I did not put up with a fight due to my admittance of personal demons.  At the moment I am clean and have turned a new leaf although I am within 3 months of recovery I'd rather not elaborate.  Despite my problem I have always held down a job, often two when no overtime is available.  I live with both parents, one who is retired and taking care of my child most days of the week and another who is retiring within the year to dedicate bringing my child to school and taking care of her.  Now this was something the mother of my child and I were ok with as our plan for 5 years.  However, she is still adamant of moving away.  She virtually has the worst credit score, car repo'd, lives with either her spouse or family.  I am not on child support however I make sure to give her a couple hundred+ monthly which was originally for day care services however, she hasn't been in day care for over a year.  (Maybe longer, it's hard to believe her at this point.)  Now with my health and wellness getting in order I fear for my child.  Her mom still plans on moving to LA despite no vehicle, credit score, and no family in that area, let alone a true job option or place (she is waiting on section 8).   She's ""almost done"" with school  and does not have a good employment history.   I really want to fight for full custody and keep my child with me and my parents, we even had a school lined up a few blocks away from my house but the mother of my child immediately interjected at my suggestion with ""shes not going to school here"".  With her vehicle repo'd I told her that I wanted my child with me being that you don't have a car nor stable home to live in and she was adamant of her moving to LA.  Despite no vehicle her response was ""she'll just have to school late"", she will be attending 1st grade.  I am really trying to not let the stress get to me.  I do NOT anticipate a relapse nor am I considering it, but I really want full custody of my child.  I work 7 days, 56 hours a week as my parents depend on me to maintain my good credit score (they have filed for bankruptcy) and despite the economy, there retirement pay supports our household."	Yes
This is kind of a long one, so stick with me. I don't feel like I'm getting a straight answer from an attorney. I'm in New York.  My wife and I are getting a divorce. We've been living separately for about 14 months now and are very amicable. We've decided to go with an unconstested, no fault divorce. We have no kids, more debt than assets, and we simply want the divorce to be over as quickly as possible.  We agree as to how all of the assets and debt will be split up. I'm dispassionate about any of the 'things' (furniture, electronics, etc.) that we acquired together, so I'm letting her have whatever she wants of that. I'm keeping all of the cash assets, house, cars and the significant debt other than student loans. I'm taking on the debt because she has almost no means of servicing high levels of debt and it's less of a burden to me than it would be for her to do so. Additionally, she has no interest in our cash, house, cars or my very modest retirement assets. She sees them as mine because she did not work during our marriage, and she is aware that she has a right to all assets acquired during the marriage. I'm not looking for an analysis on this, we 100% agree on this piece.  So, I've researched all over the internet and can't find the answer to this: given that we are in complete agreement about how everything will be split up, do we NEED a document that outlines how the assets will be split? If so, how detailed does it need to be?  I went through New York State's DIY online divorce tool and it simply asked me if we were in agreement about the division of assets. I said yes, and it let me continue and print out the paperwork--there was nothing in there beyond that question on the walk-through about the division of assets. I spoke with an attorney and he is telling me that I need to have a separation agreement, but I don't think that's right if we 100% agree on who is taking what. I understand that it's best to have one, and that it would be appropriate in 99% of divorce cases where the spouses are adversarial, but that's just not how things are in this instance. I don't feel a need to have an attorney involved if it isn't necessary.  Does anyone have any insight on this? Essentially, what's the bare minimum paperwork that I need to get an uncontested, no-fault divorce in New York?  Thank you for your time.	Yes
Okay so there is a lot to this situation so I'm going to try and explain make it as easy to understand as I can. Also thank you ahead of time for any advice possible.  So I'll start with my sister which is who is inadequate of caring for my nephew. She has been on and off of drugs since before he was born. Though she did have a period of sobriety that lasted from when she found out she was pregnant up until my nephew was about three (he is currently about three and a half. In the past few months she has went completely off the rail. From doing drugs while she home alone with him, to have different men over while her fiance (I refer to him as my brother) is working out of town through the week. So about two months ago he found out about everything that was going on and that she had cheated on him in his own house. So as expected he told her to leave. So eventually it had been decided (and she finally agreed) that her and my nephew are to go out of state to live with my oldest sister and the father of my oldest sisters unborn child. This was thought to be the best situation for everyone in an attempt to put my nephew in the best situation considering the circumstances, which was to be with his mom in a safe environment and so his father could continue his work out of town. So that is just the beginning and sorry to how long the post is.  So in the last three weeks this is what has happened. She has decided to sleep with my oldest sister's father of her child, while also doing drugs with him. So my oldest sister left the house where they were living and moved out of state back home. So for about three weeks my younger sister, my nephew and the father of my oldest sisters unborn child were living in the house together. Yea I know, fucked up and trashy situation. So just two weeks ago my brother (father of my nephew) took time off work and convinced my sister to let him have my nephew for a week, with every intention of not letting her have him back due to the living conditions he was in. So now to the point we need some sort of guidance on what steps we should be taking so that he does not return back to her and that terrible situation.   Thank you to anyone that has any advice.	Yes
Hello,  I am reaching out to get some help for a friend. She divorced her husband in May 2017 (finalzed) and had no stipulations regarding assets in the divorce papers. Only that the townhome would be signed over to him eventually and that he would sign a car over to her, neither of which has been done since the ex-husband is not cooperating.   She has been wanting to get some of her items out of the townhome but he changed the locks and ignores her requests to get her items. Items include: motorcycle helmet, deceased father's toolbox and tools, a few other small odds and ends that she owned before she met him.   I have come up with the brilliant idea to call a locksmith to let us in when he us working, load up her stuff, and then take off. Her name is still on the deed to the townhome and her license still has the address to the townhome. Now this seems straightforward to me but my friend is insisting that her ex-mother-in-law would use her lawyers friends to go after her if we do anything that isn't completely legal, or even of it is.   So what are the concerns with takong items from the townhome that we hers before they met?  Is it legal for us to call a locksmith to let us in since her name is on the deed still?  Is there any other concerns I have completely overlooked that we should be considering?	Yes
My marriage was never registered in the US. If I want to get a divorce, can I just go through the religious process similar to how I was married, or do I need to go through the full legal divorce process of the state? Thanks you.	Yes
SIL loves in Texas and is in a unfortunate situation. She's married with one kid. Marriage isn't going well. Could she take the kid and live in another state? The husband would know where she was, it would be to simply get her in a better position and maybe fix their marriage.	Yes
My daughter is turning 18 in a month. She wants to quit school and has just started her senior year. I am very against this. I know I can't force her to go since she will be legally an adult, but what other options are available to me? Can I tell her that she has to move out immediately? Join the military? I want to make life very hard for her if she does quit, but legally I don't know what I can do.	Yes
"My brother is a horrible sociopath and drug abuser. My mother has been one of those mothers who has been blinded by motherly love in the past, and has enabled him for the past twenty years. But now it has reached a point where she fears for her life. So last year she took out a restraining order against him.  However, whenever the police take him away... they seem to release my brother from custody after a few days. I don't actually know the law, but I'm told that my brother is classified as mentally-ill by the state, and according to the law, they cannot hold mentally-ill in jail. So over the past several years one of three things, happen... they release him to a homeless shelter, or the county hospital, and one time even a church. And from there he is released, and able to come back to my mother's house where he starts the abuse, and the cycles starts all over again.   In the past, she would even bring my brother home herself because, even after physical violence, she would say ""he is still my son and I love him"". But because the type of drugs he abused got harder and harder, and the physical, mental, and financial abuse got worse and worse, she finally was able to get a restraining order against him.  However, my brother has found another loophole to this restraining order law: Police can only remove people violating a restraining order if they are outside the house. What he does is hop the backyard gate and sneak into the house. According to my mother, the police have told her that they can no longer remove my brother if he is already inside the house.  My brother currently has a case against him for violent abuse against my mom, but the next court date is in late September, but I fear she won't last long in her current state.  My questions:  1) Am I misinformed in that mentally-ill persons cannot be kept incarcerated in California? If that is indeed in the case, what options do we have to forcible keep my brother away from my mom at least until the court hearing date?  2) Can the police really do nothing if my brother is already inside the house on the restraining order?  3) Can a restraining order be made null and void if my brother argues that my mother voluntarily took him back?"	Yes
"Hi - I (28f) have a 6.5 year old son from a previous (never married) relationship where the biological father is not involved. He is court-ordered to pay a little child support but that's it. Nothing as far as custody goes - but he won't sign off his paternal rights.  I am getting married next year to a man who my son knows as dad, as he's the only father figure he's ever known and has been there since he had just turned 1.  What changes once we get married? More specifically, what rights will my fiance have over my/our son once we are legally married? Does he become a ""legal guardian""? Would he be able to keep him if I ever die? I really know nothing on this topic so any light shed on it would be helpful."	Yes
Since she was born, I have raised her myself. She is almost 3. Her mother is currently in Texas in a rehab center (she got into meth after she left me with my daughter) I've talked to lawyers but can't afford one upfront. I live in Indiana.	Yes
My mother lives about 3 hours away from me in the hometown that she grew up in the South Ga area. She has paranoid schizophrenia from years of drug use as a teenager.   She has been in several crisis centers for the past months. The issue is that she is able to check herself in and out of them but none of the family can do anything about it.  She recently was arrested at her apartment and is getting evicted in a few days. She has been in jail for the past few days and she does not have anywhere to go. I don't think anyone in my family can take care of her because she won't listen to any of us. Not even the cops.   I just need some suggestions on the next steps for her. She does have disability so that area is covered. It has been suggested that I find a way to take over her healthcare decisions but I don't know how to go about that. Any advice would be appreciated. 	Yes
So this is a bit of a shit storm my  gf got me into. As stated above we got into an argument and the cops were called. my gf is an alcoholic, and started to tell the cops about how i hit her in the past even though these were very false allegations. now i wasn't talked to or even approached by the police. she signed a waiver stating she didn't want to have me arrested. we received a letter in the mail yesterday from the local police dept trying to get her to contact a detective to gather evidence against me to get a warrant for a crime i didn't commit. she said she would call them and let them know she didn't want to press charges or anything against me. should i lawyer up? can a case be built against me if i wasn't even talked to that night and my gf doesn't want to pursue it?	Yes
I'm 25 and from North Carolina. I haven't seen my 2 kids in 3 months and she keeps demanding I pay child support. Two weeks ago I sent her a formal email renouncing my parenting rights but she demands I continue paying child support. Is this legal? If so, how do I make her stop without taking her to court?	Yes
So I was recently jailed on an Domestic Assault charge on a person that I've been friends with for years. The only reason it was classified as Domestic Assault is because we dated years ago. I'm really shaken about the entire court process and I plead not guilty. However I have numerous scratches and contussions from the actual fight, but I was the person that was taken to jail. With a no contact order in place she is on Facebook taking about she beat me up and knew I would to go to jail, she also messaged me an apology and said have a nice life. Her family was there when all this happened and I didn't have any witnesses of my own.  Is this case going to stand up in court or do I need to get an attorney? I also want to get a teaching license and would rather not have anything violent on my background. If you guys could help me out I would definitely appreciate it.	Yes
Im going to try and make this as short as possible. Boy meets girl. Boy gets married. They have a kid after a few months. Boy losses job and place to provide for family. Family moves into girls parents. Parents kick boy out for arguing with wife about finances. Boy leaves to 'make it easier'. Now, how do I go about ruining there lives? Im already going to never allow them to see the grandchild they love so dearly. There is alot of information, If you read this far please ask anything you need to better understand the situation and give me proper assistance.	Yes
"My soon to be ex has told me that the are the beneficiary of over 5 million dollars in a trust fund(s) that will be transferred to them one or both parents pass away. My ex told me this directly, and also told their friends about it, but in an interrogatory states ""N/A"" when asked about trusts/expected inheritances. I can't find any written record of it. We made financial decisions based on this nest egg, so of course now I am screwed.  It is possible that my ex's parents moved this money or otherwise revoked the trust during the divorce process, but assuming that they haven't, how do I figure out if this trust exists at all so I can learn more about it in discovery?  Note that I am not looking to gain access to this money, but it does come into play when it comes to equitable distribution / alimony (which my ex is requesting).  Them and their parents are of course hostile to this and will not cooperate, and also have a lot of money to fight any requests I make."	Yes
I hear it all the time in Michigan that you can move out at the age of 17. Planning to move my GF out of her home at that age and just wanna be sure that her cop brother can't touch me when i do.	Yes
I'm married to someone with a phd, 2 Masters degrees, and who also is a CPA candidate. She refuses to look for work or work. She doesn't do anything at home either in terms of taking care of the home or taking care of me.      In a divorce I'd have to give her half which basically would leave us both with not enough to live on. We have a mortgage and debt.      I want to divorce her and her get a job so I don't have to pay forever. I made it clear to her from the beginning that she needed to contribute.      How can I get the court to force her to get a job?	Yes
"So essentially i was brought up under the guise of paternal alienation and covert incest. On top of a this, she also told all of us that Grandma would leave us an money when she died but 2 years after he death the will has been put into probate and we have been refused to see the will. She knows we are poor and she seemingly will just hold on to it till she dies.  First aspect, parental alienation. My mother would rarely ever speak positively of her my Dad. She belittled at every turn. Worse, she belittle his attempts at counseling and essentially use us to make him hit rock bottom (arrested usually.) my Mom did this portray herself as the valiant Mom. These things made bonding with him difficult and this only made things worse for him. She would never stage support for him, only ridicule him. He was like Lisa with Charlie Brown's football. We had to move 3000 miles to find work in the South because he failed a pisstest at his job. He has mental illness for sometime and figure she knew how to manipulate him. He lost so many opprotunities but my mother would always play the Wight Knight for him. Meth and pot arrests were big ones, however I witnessed her engage in these activities as well. Only after she would quickly criticize him. He was punching bag.   Stage 2: Covert incest, my mother always crossed every boundary with me. As a 4 year old, she bought me happy meals every day. She would constantly take me places and spend abhorrent time with me. I had a very hard time making connections with people. As I grew up after the move, I began to try and distance. But she would still act in ways that were inappropriate. The in 2008, my father tried leaving for the 1st time. Me and my sister quickly became each others escape. I would try and spend as much time with her as I could so I would not have to see my mother. The. In July my sister left with Dad for custody. I stayed with Mom and I believe she sexually manipulated. It got out of hand it was incredibly harming my 13 year old mind. Graphic depictions of sex and touchiness. These began the unwanted sexual thoughts that still plague me today. She offered me to come ""to bed with her"" one night. Of course that seemed like a sexual invite considering the previous events. But she knew I would have strong reaction that. All these thoughts made me turn to drugs and alcohol. I hung out with the wrong people. And she encouraged this. She would pretend like it was all okay. Then my Dad decided to come back and I would try rebuild a relationship with him. My mother interviened ever chance she got. She always would bad mouth any effort he made to connect. I thus would hang out and seek people who had drugs. This also impacted my relationship with Dad. Anytime he tried to stop me, my mother would constantly remind him about his past deeds.this only made me get worse.  Eventually in 2012 I started stealing some of my Moms tramadol pills because I was experiencing profound depression. She never addressed with me. But she knew it was going on and moved the bottle around and did try and intervene. This was the begining of a two year binge encouraged by my Mom and lead to me losing my scholarship. She practically encouraged me to leave school. My father left shortly after this. Now that he was gone for good, it was back to sexual manipulation and using drugs as a means to control. I quit tramadol on my own and then she began to romanticize her drug use and then a new substance for me. As this went I became more and more depressed and she began treating me worse and worse.the only reason I put up with was because she promised Grandma would leave an inheiritance. She would die and then she refused to talk about. I eventually was fed up and tried talking with my 17 year old sister for help. I was planning on getting help with that money. Turns out, my mother had manipulated her into blaming her father's absence on me. My sister geniunely complains about issues I can not fix. I left shortly after my mother refuses to help me in anyway.my father is so broken and he lives many miles away.   There is the issue of the will as well. i have checked the county office and the will is not in probate. She is ripping of my sister me and my two cousins. I think she is promising my sister money.   Thats the most polished way to put it. Is there anything I can do about the trust? Oh and she has stalled the divorce for three years. Its all just jumbled up and designed to be confusing as hell. Is there anyway to proceed with anything?"	Yes
Last month my ex-husband purchased a new car and came to pick up our two and five year old children for his visitation without car seats. He expected to be able to borrow my car seats which I declined to share with him. He has come twice to pick them up without appropriate car seats.   The first time he left angrily after I refused him my car seats and didn‚Äôt contact me about making other arrangements to see the children. He did not see them all for that visitation which was supposed to be for four days.   The second time he arrived we were outside playing and, my ex-husband  managed to scoop up the older child and get him in the car. I made it very clear to my ex that I would be calling the police to report his car the second he left if he didn‚Äôt have my kids properly restrained. Again my ex left without the children and has since left me several voicemails about how he‚Äôs taking me to court for violating our custody court order and denying him his visitation. He also thinks that the car seats belong to the children and should come with them like their clothing.   The lawyer I used for our custody agreement is currently on vacation and I haven‚Äôt been able to consult with her yet. Do you think it would be likely that I could be forced to share the car seats?  We have it in the custody agreement that he has to pick up the children because I have a degenerative eye condition that may make me unable to drive in the next few years and we don‚Äôt live in an area with public transportation.  The main reason I don‚Äôt want to share the car seats is my ex seems to be making it his personal mission to destroy or lose any clothing, toy, or other item my kids take when they spend time with him. I had to buy the oldest three pairs of winter boots this past winter.	Yes
Hi,  My mother's ex is a sole trader and receives cash in hand for his work. He claims he only earns ¬£7000 per year which is untrue. He charges ¬£25 per hour and employs a couple other people to help him out which already suggests that the ¬£7000 per year figure is inaccurate. As a result, based on his stated earnings the court only demands he pays my mother a mere ¬£9 a week which barely covers my little brother's school dinners, let alone the other expenses of raising a child. But how can we prove that he is really earning a lot more? Or is it pretty much impossible to get evidence?   Many thanks.	Yes
My son‚Äôs father filed for a child custody modification last year. We are going to trial at the end of the month. The original judgment handed down by the court gave me primary physical custody with visitation for our son‚Äôs dad on Wednesday nights and every other weekend.   I cannot afford an attorney so I will be representing myself at the trial at the end of this month.   I have a few questions: 1. His lawyer emailed me a ‚Äútake it or leave it offer‚Äù regarding visitation (for me) which I declined to sign. Since then, my son‚Äôs father has not let me see our son. His lawyer indicated in the email that I could not show the judge the ‚Äúoffer.‚Äù Is the lawyer allowed to say this? My son‚Äôs father has now said he will ask the judge for me to see our son a few hours each week.   2. DCF (Mass) was involved during a domestic violence incident in 2015 in which I was arrested and my son‚Äôs father had a 51A filed against him for abusing me. A 51A was filed against me as well because I was arrested in front of our son. At the time, our son was 4 months old (I had full legal and physical custody) and I was used to the abuse and thought it would make more sense for me to decline to press charges against my son‚Äôs father so that my son wouldn‚Äôt be taken into custody by DCF. How can I most effectively tell the judge the circumstances of that night?  Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
"TL;DR: Alcoholic EX abandoned daughter 3 times in two years and is now saying that I have no right to keep her from him while we wait to go to court.   Everytime I go to file our divorce and custody paperwork something changes, which is usually him exiting, or coming back into our DD life so it remains to be filed.  The first time he told me that he couldn't care for her anymore because of his depression and said that he was thinking about moving to Abu Dhabi with his dad and NOT keeping in touch. I gave him two months while my daughter, then 4, asked me why I stole her away from papa. She regressed to peeing in her pants and bedwetting every night at the start and asking if my SO was her dad now. We got her through it, but by the end I told EX that he needed to either start taking her again or at least paying CS.  The second time, DD was almost 5. I for the 3rd time caught ex drunk in the morning from staying up until daylight drinking while she was in his care. I realized that it wasn't a mistake or one off and with him completely passed out and DD having helped herself to ice cream sandwiches for breakfast, I realized this was dangerous and harmful to her. I found out from his SiL that she frequently watched Adel while he slept off his drunk. I started by being supportive. I told him to go to AA, and got his family involved. At the time we had a 50/50 schedule. I didn't tell him that I couldn't give DD back, but he also didn't bother to ask to get her back when his days came and went. DD regressed to nightly bed wetting again, and developed social issues. I ended up telling him that he needed to be in therapy for his depression and alcohol treatment. 4 months later he asked if he could see her for a holiday and I told him that I thought that would be confusing and reminded him of what he needed to do. No response. The next month he asked for another holiday and I gave him the same answer. Then the next month for Christmas, 7 months after I had picked her up at his house while he was drunk, he asked if we could talk. I met him for coffee and it seemed like he understood what had gone wrong, he was in therapy, and ""not drinking."" so I told him he could have every other weekend and I'd give him first dibs on babysitting. He said that he would pay me back for his months of absence. He didn't, but that's beside the point.   It was working for 4 months, but then when I went into labor with my DS I let EX have dibs on watching DD. The next morning while I was in active labor and about an hour away from giving birth I had to organize for a pick up of DD because EX was drunk. I let him talk me into it being a mistake, and we continued visitation for another two weeks until he was forced to move out of his house. I told him that while he was couch hopping he only had to see DD once a week for several hours so that she wouldn't panic and think he was leaving again. That went on two weeks with my full support before he stopped responding about when he was going to pick her up and missed a weekend, only to apologize on the following Monday and say that he was going back into counseling (something he was supposed to be in the whole time he had her). THIS RIGHT HERE was the point where I finally broke. THIS is the moment where I stopped being friendly or supportive. He didn't ask about her, until her birthday a month later (June) when he'd found permanent housing and I told him we needed to go to court and reiterated that this was not good for her. I finally filled out CS paperwork and that pissed him off. Then he asked to bring her to a family picnic the next month (last week) and I told him again that he needed therapy and AA and that I thought it would be confusing for DD to have him in and out.   Last night, after I had found out that he was drinking over the weekend and then no called no showed to his weekly gig, we had a texting battle where he told me that I had no right to withhold her. I told him to take me to court. He stopped texting.   What I'm looking for here is legal validation and perhaps resources so that I can get this done correctly with my DD best interest in mind. I know that what would be best for her is for him to get his shit together, but he's blame shifting and refusing AA rather than doing it.   Anyway, if you read ALL of that, kudos, and thank you."	Yes
"Hi guys, I had a few questions regarding property ownership rights and financial rights in California.  My wife and I are going through a divorce, we have a a house together and joint credit card, checking and savings.  In short what are my my rights to the money in the checking and savings.  Also, what should I do with the property, what does it mean for her to ""buy me out"" regarding the property?    If you're curious about the situation, please see my previous posts.  In a gist we have a house which she says I don't contribute enough, even though she knew before hand that I would be on deployment and have my own living expenses."	Yes
Hi all, thank you in advance for your help.   Long story short. A woman and I are about to determine custody of a 1.5 year old in Vermont. It is a complicated situation, but the bottom line is that I would like Zero custody or visitation rights. I would like her to have sole custody. I think this is sincerely best for the child and the adults in this situation. I understand that I will owe child support and that is perfectly ok.   Initially she was on-board with the idea of me giving up parental rights, but she has change her tune lately and wants me to have some form of joint custody and seeing the child on the weekends. Can a judge force me to have custody?  Can a judge force me to have a relationship with this child?  I sincerely appreciate your help. I was waiting on a call back from a lawyer, but they must have gotten tied up. :(	Yes
Her ex's only visitation rights are one 2-hour supervised visit per month, and he hasn't paid child support nor requested to see the child in 6 months. He is apparently extremely verbally abusive and narcissistic (compares himself to a god, etc.) and will undoubtedly dispute it when he receives notice due to his pride. Will he have a chance in court? I hate the thought that some horrible person can affect my life so negatively if he's somehow able to say we can't move and I miss out on a great opportunity for myself and my new family.  I am begging anyone for any insight, my wedding is set for less than 2 months from now...	Yes
Hello, posting from Ontario, Canada.  I am a step-parent of three years to a nine year old girl whom my wife had with her ex boyfriend. My wife and I also share a child together of two years. I have fully supported this family and the biological father has paid maybe $600 total over the entire course that I have been in a relationship with my now-wife. To give context, I make about $53k per year on average, and my wife makes about $16k. I suspect the bio father makes about $45ish.   My wife refuses to pursue legal action against the biological father to pay child support. My home expenses are roughly $3000 a month, and my family (my mother, myself, my father) have basically helped clothe, feed, and provide a home to my step child. The bio father provides no support.  Am I legally able to initiate a legal action against him for child support? All of the results I found online were post-divorce, but I am still married. Please advise, thank you!	Yes
I had no idea how to title the post well, because it's all very odd to me. I've been separated from my husband for over 4 years now. I haven't seen or spoken to him in over 3 of those years. I have no idea where he's living, and divorce has been complicated to try and start. This isn't about a divorce though. I just had a child with another man, and I didn't know anything about paternity laws in my state. I live in Oklahoma and found out after delivery that if I'm married my husband is the legally presumed father of my child and my childs actual father cannot be put on the birth certificate or be the legal father. I now know he has to sign a denial of paternity and the biological father has to sign an acceptance. The issue is, I have no way to get my husband to sign the form. To my knowledge, he's still living out of state in California but I have no idea where other than the state. What actions can I take to get him to sign this form? Is there any service that can help? Do I need a lawyer?  Edit: A nurse in the hospital suggested that if I absolutely cannot find him to go and file for child support against him because the agency could find him and he could come and deny paternity. I don't exactly think that would work because I'm not sure you can even get child support while still married, plus I know he's not the father and that would make the whole ordeal odd.	Yes
Hello, I'm getting married very soon, and I like to procrastinate. Is there any way I can still get one in a week? And not pay $1000+ for it? I'm in the US	Yes
My mother and I were left behind in India by my father when I was a baby but after 18 years he brought us to USA but we came here to find that he is another mistress and his family has been treating my mother and I like slaves and maids actually worse than that. We were being mentally torched everyday for about 1.5years. But then since he kept on saying us to leave his house we decided to not live like servants and leave their place. But even so he refuses to pay for my college tuitions and my mother and I cannot save up enough to pay for everything. What should we do? Please help us. What kind of lawyer should we consult or what we should do. We have no idea. We would be grateful for the help.	Yes
Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.  I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.  Thank you all	Yes
He has an attorney. There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her. Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	Yes
"My (heterosexual) partner and I do not currently have plans to become legally married, but consider ourselves to be and meet all the NJ legal requirements (listed here http://www.nj.gov/health/forms/reg-d7.pdf) of Domestic Partners -- that is, we have a joint bank account, joint insurance, are one another's life insurance beneficiaries, etc. But everything we find regarding DP in NJ refers to those 62 and older, there doesn't seem to be anything on the books for younger couples.  Is there anything available to us at our age (early-mid 30's), or are we just SoL? Do we even NEED anything official, or do we just declare ourselves ""domestic partners"" to whoever listens and that's that? We just want to make sure we're protected in case of accident, emergency, legal issues, etc etc."	Yes
I need to find a lawyer who will work in placer county to help with a custody case. Does anyone know where I can find that sort of help?   Thanks	Yes
Insert the standard throwaway disclaimer here.   Back in the late 90s-early 2000s, I dated a guy. We moved in together for about a month in 2001 - long story short he punched me in the face, I dumped him and that was that. No kids, no pets, no community property. It was a clean break.  Fast forward 16 years to about a month ago, my fiance and I were at the grocery store and he noticed someone acting really weird, ducking in and out of aisles, following us around. It was my ex. We ignored him, finished shopping, and went home.   Today - I got served with divorce papers from the ex. I was (and am) totally baffled. Apparently he hired a lawyer, filed with the county, etc - everything you'd do for a regular divorce except that we were never married. I know the rule of thumb is to ignore the crazy until you get served, but here I am with papers in hand. What do I do now?	Yes
Hey guys,  I need some advice in regards to my fathers income tax return. We are really stuck right now and could use the money for a down payment or even deposit on a house/Rental property. Hear me out and please let me know if you can help out.   Here goes nothing, I guess.    So, my dad recently claimed his tax returns but was denied compensation because he has a standing order for custody for my siblings an I from January of this year.    You see, my parents have been divorced for almost 5 years now and my siblings and I have been living with my father since 2013. However, even though my parents have been divorced some time now, my mother has always had custody even though we have been living with my father for the past 4 years.    When my dad filed his tax return and claimed us the first time around, the CRA (Canada Revenue Agency) quickly denied it and requested for proof of us living with him in which he provided them with proof and sent them documents. And now we are here. Rejected once more because of a court order my dad has for custody.   At this point we are both puzzled and unsure on what to do next. Every time we speak with the lawyer he requests money; which we do not have, unfortunately. I believe that he should get his money. It is not fair. We have been living with him for 4 years. Even if he did not have custody he should still be able to claim us on his taxes and get his hard earned money.   Please help.  Thank you,  Moe	Yes
"Is there a way to remove my mothers name from a property mortgage my dad acquired before they were married? My mothers lawyer had my mom signed a quit claim BEFORE ""applying"" to get it refinanced.   She wants her name to be removed to get approved for a low income house loan she applied for. The low income agency advised her to clear her name off the mortgage to be approved.  Her lawyer is incompetent. She told my mother to just wait 3 years. And my father is the biggest dung, for not cooperating.   Thanks in advance."	Yes
I've been trying to research this for a while, and while it's easy to find how to remove a father from a birth certificate, I cannot locate anything on how to remove a mother.  I've never had a pleasant relationship with my mother. She didn't raise me, and I feel no attachment for her, and on the contrary, she has no attachment to me. We haven't spoken in ages. I'm a 30F, and would like to know if it's possible to remove her name from my birth certificate without having to replace it with an adopted mother's name?  Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.	Yes
My kid is grown and out on his own. My ex owes $30K+ in child support to me and has not paid, except for the incidental garnishment of refunds or when he had a job long enough to get garnishment paperwork completed.   My case is handled through the state, but they have yet to ever issue a warrant or impact him in any meaningful way. He has moved to another state (over 5 years ago) and has just moved to a different state.   My son was very sick for 5 years and I am still working through the medical bills. I don't need my ex's money, but it sure would help.   How do I get the state to follow through and put some pressure on him to start paying back? There are other wives/children as well. I assume they take precedence since my child is grown now?	Yes
"My husband and I are at a point where civility is the best way to describe our relationship. He has cheated in the past and despite trying my best to work through it, things are not good. I'm very tired of feeling bad about myself and this relationship is toxic. We are living with his parents in the UK and we're separated for six months. I have spoken to him about how I feel and his response was ""tough, but put up with it for the kids"". I am suspicious he is cheating again. The trouble is he says I can leave, move out to my own place or whatever but he won't let the kids go.   I have always thought he is a great and loving dad but he talks to my daughter in the most unpleasant manner (she was with him when I left, it was a decision made by everyone). He curses at her ie STFU and yells - this is unacceptable to me regardless of how she behaves. He has always yelled and cursed and broken things and I've learned to let it go but I don't want my daughter to think that's how men are supported to be. Today he told me ""what am I doing to you that's so bad? I don't beat you!"" I couldn't articulate how that in itself is an insult to me, like I'm supposed to be glad I'm not beaten?   I want to return to the USA, both my kids have American passports - what can I do? Do I have any legal recourse to take them with me?   Please advise."	Yes
A little backstory i think is necessary: Back in mid-2000's my wife and I divorced. Around 2013, I filed for custody and given the circumstances she was in, I was granted custody as it was clearly the better place for him to live.  My son (16 years old) visits his mom during the summers and had stated to me before leaving he wanted to live with her. I think this was due to him getting in some serious trouble soon before he left and wanting what he thinks will be a more lenient household. Also he had a serious falling out with his best friends shortly before he left as well. He told me again during a Skype call a couple weeks back that he still wanted to stay at his mom's. I was considering allowing him to move back there at the end of the next summer but wanted to talk to his mom and get a lawyer involved to protect all parties' interests.   Yesterday I was served with paperwork, filed by my ex-wife, that I abuse our son. It seems to reference a couple of incidents that I somehow harmed him. Im not sure, it doesnt go into specifics. As a single parent Ive tried really hard to provide the best life I can for him. I didnt even file for child support so his mom would have more money to do fun stuff with him when he visited as we were *fairly* secure at the time. Im really scared what could happen with these accusations.   I cant imagine any proof they might have since abuse never occurred.  Any advice or comments would be much appreciated. Thanks for reading.	Yes
My son‚Äôs father filed for a child custody modification last year. We are going to trial at the end of the month. The original judgment handed down by the court gave me primaryp physical custody with visitation for our son‚Äôs dad on Wednesday nights and every other weekend.   I cannot afford an attorney so I will be representing myself at the trial at the end of this month.   I have a few questions: 1. His lawyer emailed me a ‚Äútake it or leave it offer‚Äù regarding visitation (for me) which I declined to sign. Since then, my son‚Äôs father has not let me see our son. His lawyer indicated in the email that I could not show the judge the ‚Äúoffer.‚Äù Is the lawyer allowed to say this? My son‚Äôs father has now said he will ask the judge for me to see our son a few hours each week.   2. DCF (Mass) was involved during a domestic violence incident in 2015 in which I was arrested and my son‚Äôs father had a 51A filed against him for abusing me. A 51A was filed against me as well because I was arrested in front of our son. At the time, our son was 4 months old (I had full legal and physical custody) and I was used to the abuse and thought it would make more sense for me to decline to press charges against my son‚Äôs father so that my son wouldn‚Äôt be taken into custody by DCF. How can I most effectively tell the judge the circumstances of that night?  Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
"Short version: My mother is mentally sick (depression) and is being coerced to regularly give someone large sums of money. I don't have enough details to go to the police. I don't think she's capable of caring for herself either. How can I ensure the safety of her self and finances?   Long version: This is long and I don't know where else to turn but the internet. My mother has been ill for a long time with a history of depression and bipolar II. We have a sizable family. A few years ago my father passed away; due to timing in everyone's lives, my brothers and sisters moved out (including me), to school or work or whatever. This lead to textbook empty nest syndrome which she never really recovered.  She eventually moved to NYC into an apartment that cost an obscene amount of money per month. Additionally, she leads a very expensive lifestyle she can't afford to sustain. She apparently has/had a lot of assets but I never did find out specifics of how much or where they came from but I don't care about that. Today I found out she has been giving money to an unknown stranger (she refused to tell me who, or why). I pressed hard but all I managed to get from her was ""he might hurt me"" if she refused. She repeatedly tells me she feels threatened and in danger but will not elaborate.  I am 8 hours away by car, 4 by plane in Bumfuck, Nowhere. I am only just making ends meet. My siblings live closer but only one of them is on speaking terms with her (her illness makes her unpleasant to interact with). Her friends have left her (likely the other way around), so she is alone. She is in a vulnerable position and it seems like no one is willing to help. And I can't help personally because of how far away I am. She's old and vulnerable.  Nearly all of these details are vague and nebulous. She won't tell me anything about where her money came from, or who this mystery person is or why she's giving him money or why she feels unsafe.   * How can I protect my mother when I don't even know what's threatening her? * How can I ensure she gets the medication and prescriptions she needs? * Can I legally force her into someone's care? Are there programs to pay for this? * I've no interest in her finances but how can I protect her assets so she can live comfortably?  * To be honest I'm not even sure I can convince her to budget even if all of the above was taken care of. * I don't think a nursing home is an option. Elderly abuse is a huge problem, and I'm not certain she'd let herself live in a nursing home.  I don't know what to do. Sorry for the brain vomit but all of this came up suddenly. I greatly appreciate any advice of any sort."	Yes
"Quick backstory: I caught the ex wife cheating and asked for a divorce as a result. She gave a lot of lip service and crocodile tears before she just threw her arms up and went with it. In the agreement towards the marital home, she said that she would keep it. Our divorce decree states the following: ""8. Property Settlement: a. Real Property: Wife shall retain the marital home, located at REDACTED in REDACTED, and shall be responsible for all costs associated with the property, including the mortgage, taxes, insurance, and utilities. Wife shall hold Husband harmless and indemnify him in regard to such liabilities. Husband shall quit-claim the property to the Wife within 14 days of judgment in this matter.""  Handed it over, she said that she would live in the house without issue. States also that my name must come off the house as of Jan 2019. So the mortgage was behind when I left, but I forked over my tax return (about 8k) to cover it, and was told about a week ago that she has no plans to make any future payments. This year she went to Disney World with her new husband, and just spent it there... however she has made every payment up to now, and I want to save my credit, as I just got into the Excellent range and was looking to buy a home once this one sells. For about 6 months, I was told that the house was going to sell. Unbeknownst to me, ex-wife took out a lean, with my name, on the house to bring the payments down. So when she went to sell, the bottom dropped out of the deal when they found the lean. I don't know where the 28k extra came from, but the decision to do this occurred once I signed the quit-claim. Last week, she tells me matter of fact-ly that ""I have no plans to make any more payments,"" since she got knocked up the week she met her current husband, and decided to take extra time off this summer when she could have worked. She DECIDED not to work. Yes. she had another baby, but she told me that ""she only got paid for 4 weeks off."" She also just moved into a 350k house with this guy and put a giant divide between me and the kids. A year ago today she didn't even know this guy.   Any case, I'm tired of the surprises. Surprise! I've been having an affair for 15 months. Surprise! I met some guy last Tuesday and me and the kids are moving in! Surprise! I'm also pregnant! The house I told you I was refinancing to get your name off, didn't get your name off! Surprise! NOW YOUR CREDIT IS GOING TO HIT THE TOILET!  No more surprises. I rented an apartment down the street so I could be with my children anytime, at the drop of a hat, and this woman decided that her tingles were once again, way more important than the relationship her children have to their father. I'm lucky that I have a 50/50 custody agreement, but I don't know what to do.   I spoke with my lawyer, who said that she could not represent me, but that my ex would be in contempt of court. I'm sick of this woman having jurisdiction to screw with my life over and over again. What does contempt of court mean? I asked but it was an inopportune time. This person can physically work, just refuses to because ""she just had a brand new baby"" with her husband and spent all of her money irresponsibly. She is still driving around in a car with my name on it that I help pay for... why can she just tank whatever deal she wants but she can tank her obligations to the martial home? I thought I was being really generous with her to keep her name on it. I had no idea that she was going to get knocked up and walk away from it. Her response to my saying that I will petition the court was ""what is that even going to do for you?"" I also found out that she stole money out of my son's college fund. It was only 1k, but this stuff is getting really old.   Any help that you can muster would be appreciated  Some guy in Connecticut"	Yes
Hi there, I am 14 years old, the son of recently divorced parents who have not made/filed official custody order. My dad left for a business trip this morning, and will return in three days. (I was staying with him last, obviously.)  My mom is pushing me to go to her place tonight, telling me that asking to stay here for three days is like asking for a yard when she gave me an inch. She says that I because I'm not 18, I have to follow her instructions.   Since there's no custody case, and my dad is out of town, what can I do? I have enough money to get meals for these next three days, and I want to stay at my dad's. He is okay with it, so long as I keep the house clean. If it helps at all, my mom is a pretty horrible mom, just look at my post history and you'll see. She said she's going to pick me up in an hour, so I need advice quick please!	Yes
"I live in Dallas, TX.   The mother and my child and I have a standard visitation court order. We got it made in Beaumont, TX because that's where she was living at the time. My rights are I get standard visitation: weekends, certain holidays, summers, etc. I also pay child support. Since our court order, my child's mother has been on a downhill slope. She's a stripper, a prostitute, she's on drugs, constantly getting new numbers/addresses/boyfriends. My son (4 years old) stays with his younger half-brother's (2 years old) grandparents and dad. They do not even live with her at this point. He's not potty trained, can't speak that well, hits himself when he's angry, isn't in school, has marks on him from her hitting him with a wooden solo on his butt. She isn't aware that we know all of this and have been keeping tabs on her. We've had multiple people tell us she's suicidal and need to take my son away before it's too late.   Today when I went to get him from her, I secretly video taped her giving me permission to keep my son while she ""takes some time to get her life together."" Now, what steps do I need to take from here? I want to get primary custody of him and have this documented so she can't have him. I'd honestly like to limit his visitation from her until she gets her life together. Do I call CPS, the courthouse where we got the court order? Also, if she wants him back sooner than we expect (we imagine she will change her mind quickly), do we have to give him back since she stated on video we can keep him or are we forced to abide by the court order regardless? Please give me advice on where to proceed from here. Thank you."	Yes
My dad is going through a divorce in Indiana. He inherited a 50% stake in his mothers house (in Ohio) when she died. His brother inherited the other 50%. I know that Inheritance can be considered marital property in Indiana divorce law, unlike most other states where inheritance is not included as marital property.   What factor does his brother owning 50% stake in the house have in the court calculation to split inherited property in divorce?  Thanks.	Yes
My gf(30f) needs a good divorce attorney but has specific familiar issues with regard to her ex-husband's religion. I am curious if this is a semi-common issue with divorces and also if anyone could point me in the right direction. If the answer is a simple Google search, I shall apologize and hang my head in shame. Thanks!	Yes
I am really out of options here.  We are not divorced so there is no type of child care plan. In order for me to see my child I had to live with either her mom or her dad.   Well one evening her dad freaks out on me and it no longer became safe for me to stay there. So I moved out. I haven't seen my son since. This goes back 8 weeks. His birthday is monday. Between my house payment and bills I virtually have no money left over to afford an attorney. I have shit credit and no way to make more. I have 450$ to my name outside of that and anyone that could help has. I called legal aid in my state and they denied my case for unspecified reasons. I am at a loss.  As a result my son is being kept from me. His grandparents will not let him talk to me because for fear that they would be denied the right to see him. This is the type of person she is. I need your help.	Yes
This is a serious question.  I'm in a relationship with a woman who is very unhappy with me.  We entered into a relationship, moved in together, entered a loosely defined business relationship as well.  For personality reasons, things have not been financially successful.  Also due to the added expense of her (I pay for all of our living expenses, and I pay her money each month), I'm almost broke.  Our relationship has dissolved, we live together (separate ends of the house), there is no sex or intimacy.  She screams at me from the time she wakes up til evening.  She's accused me of stealing money from her (from a questionably joint account in my name, which was used for household expenses).    I know there's a lot to digest but my biggest question is, her constant screaming has become abusive in my opinion.  Is screaming, harassing, insulting, using disparaging remarks, a crime?  Are they assault?    If I as a man were to behave this way, even if I weren't happy with some arrangement, I am convinced I would be arrested for assault.  I want to to know my options legally for getting out of this relationship.  I feel there's a chance I have been gaslighted, hoodwinked, taken advantage of... We are not married, there are no written agreements, which is my regret.    What are my options?  Ask questions, I'll gladly provide answers to the best of my ability.	Yes
So I don't know if there's anything I can do about this. My children are in Louisiana visiting their father. I am supposed to pick them up at the halfway point (I live in PA). He told me this morning that he will only drive four hours and I need to drive the other 16 1/2  hours. Is there any way I can compel him to meet in the middle like we agreed? I even offered to drive 12 instead of 10 hours. Its a round trip 20 hours if we meet in the middle.	Yes
I just found out that my husband has been having a year long affair with multiple women.   I am a stay at home mother and full time student with two kids (6 and 1.5). I have not worked in over 6 years.   My husband and I own a house together, though it is primarily in his name as he has income. I am, however, in the paperwork showing that I also own the home.   I feel so lost. I never wanted to be in this position and I have been busting my ass to finish my degree to make sure I could provide for myself if need be. So I guess my question is - now what? How can I protect myself and my children? What kind of government assistance is there for women like me? How much of his paycheck will go towards child support? We live in Texas, and he makes roughly $45k before taxes.   He's my best friend, I'm not out to be vindictive, I'm just trying to get by while I finish my Bachelor's.	Yes
"My husband and I are considering a divorce. We have a child born in 2014. We also married in 2014, in California, where we've lived the entire time.  I've been the higher earner in our relationship. He was out of work, and then took care of our child when I returned to work. In case of divorce, our child would stay with me. We've discussed that, in case we do divorce, we would want to treat our property (~100k 401k, ~200k investments, no house) basically as non-community property, the way it would have been had we not gotten married. Now, this ""you keep yours"" and ""I keep mine"" results in a very skewed allocation of our assets, where he gets to keep ~40k, and I keep the rest. In a non-contested divorce, where we draw up all the paperwork together, can we agree to such a lopsided allocation? Or is that somehow illegal, and/or could be rejected by a judge? If so, can we sign a post-nup that outlines the above in case of divorce?  To make it abundantly clear, there's no coercion whatsoever involved. We both think it is in our child's best interest to split assets as described."	Yes
Pretty much summed it up in the headline but one more detail I need to add.  The mail from the food stamp office comes to my house.  I called her and asked about it and she told me that they knew she didn't live there but she didn't have her PO Box set up.    I'm concerned that she told them that she does live here, but not me.  Is this something that could come back on me?  What exactly are the requirements for counting a child as a member of the household, when they don't live with you the majority of the time?	Yes
Mom is in CA, Biological father is in NV My parents divorced when I was young (I'm 38) in CA. My mom has the divorce paperwork stating the custody and child support amount for my sister and I, $300 a month. He has never paid and was locked up for 20 years begining when I was 11 or 12. He is a felon and has since been released and now live is NV. My mom was never on welfare and never notified anyone that he wasn't paying. She has talked to an attorney in CA who said she needs to contact a NV attorney.   My questions are...  * Is it feasible/realistic to go after him since so much time has passed?  * Is this something only an attorney can handle, or is there a way to file and let the state go after him? If she can file, where would she start?  * Since he is a felon, could this put him back in prison?  Thank you!!	Yes
Son is 23 years old and is still living at home. Unfortunally he hasn't got a job for a long time or makes too much effort to get one. I told him many times to better his life, but for years he continues to just make a mess and play video games the whole day. Nothing we tell him seems to let him want to change his behavior. At this point we are considering to force him to move out so he needs to learn to provide for himself. The problem is, he probably won't like the idea and would probably refuse to cooperate.   In that case I wonder, are there any legal grounds on which we could force him to move out, or could he just refuse and stay home? And if it's neceserry (when he refuses), are we permitted to move his stuff to a room we will sign for him and take his key of the house? Lastly, if he would refuse to pay, are we obliged to take him into the house again (because he proobably would) or is that not the case?	Yes
Been married for a little over two years. She's unemployed, but collects Social Security benefits as a representative payee for her kids (the kids dad died last year). I realize that alimony laws are different from state to state. Therefore, does anyone have any specific knowledge about alimony laws for Alabama?	Yes
Hey all,  My fianc√©s friend is in Cincy, Ohio. Single mother who just had her baby. She is currently drowning in medical debt, getting warnings about having her utilities shut off, and her baby daddy who has done nothing for the kid is lawyering up to get custody and child support. My fianc√© and her parents are trying to help her anonymously with money and I'm trying to get a bunch of clothes and stuff together for her.   My question is, is there anything we can do to help her regarding the child support/custody case, utilities, or even medical debt? I do not know if she's on government assistance or if she has tried to have her medical debt forgiven, nor does the fianc√©. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!	Yes
Hello! I just got married last month, and in addition to my wife taking on my last name, she and I are adding her maiden name as second middle names.  My question is this: do I need to do things like renew my passport and driver's license with the new middle name? I've heard things like the license won't even have both middle names on there because of space constraints, and for most of my transactions/official things, I won't even include my second middle name because of a lack of space in the form or inability of the form to accommodate a second middle name.  In essence, do my passport and license (and other similar documents) need to reflect my legal _full_ name? Thanks in advance!	Yes
[This is my first post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5gexji/girlfriend_now_ex_is_pregnant_and_wants_to_give/?utm_content=title&amp;utm_medium=front&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=legaladvice)   Short version: I'm sitting here and my baby daughter is right here next to me, taking a nap!  Long version:  If you remember, I asked about how I should go about stopping my then-pregnant ex from leaving the baby for adoption. I listened to the suggestions. Got a lawyer. Put myself on the registry as well.  She really wanted to fight me over this right until the last month of the pregnancy. I was fully ready to fight her legally to get my rights as the father. But in the final month she changed her mind and decided that give me full custody instead of giving up the child for adoption. So we had no messy legal right over it.  The childbirth and custody situation went very smoothly. My lawyer took care of it quickly and my ex made it easy as well. Her family didn't like this, but they couldn't do anything about it in the end.  So I have my baby daughter!  Taking care of my baby is difficult but certainly worth it. I feel like I have something to live for! My family has been super helpful and with their help we can make sure my daughter is happy. I also got a promotion at work. I realized that I need to be more ambitious because I now have a baby to provide for. A higher position was open at my work and I asked for the promotion but they told me I'm too young. I offered to do the job for as a trial 1 month without any extra pay only to prove that I can do it. After a month they gave me the job!   As most of you suggested (and my lawyer did too), I had my lawyer file for child support after I had full custody. My ex didn't like it and wasn't expecting it. She actually called me names and various insults and all of that. But I didn't say anything, just that communications should go through my lawyer. She said she regrets making it easy for me to get the baby. I don't know. I didn't need the child support payments for daily care of my daughter but I think she deserves to have something saved up for the future and for her college. I didn't have the chance to go to college (not smart enough, I'm not good at studying) but I want to make sure my daughter has the chance! My sister in law is helping me setup a 529 plan with vanguard and I think I'll send most of the child support payments there once I start receiving them.  Thank you all.	Yes
I plan on doing a name change. What legal or non legal hurdles will I confront before/during/after this process? I would like to know as much information on this subject as possible. Any thoughts and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.	Yes
I have severe anxiety issues and my father said that there should be a witness on the hearing which he read on a letter that was given to him. I don't know what I should be doing as a witness since I've never been in one and it just makes me scared thinking about it.   My step-mom is the plaintiff and she said she would not be bringing anyone.   EDIT: My father is perfectly okay of me not being there. He is just making sure if there is a need to have a witness on court.    	Yes
So just as a warning this will be long, and details may slightly vary due to my mom being the one going through this. If a certain detail is pertinent though I can get the specifics from her.  We are located in Indiana.  My grandma is 90 years old.   My grandma got put in the nursing home around 6 months ago. She had broken her hip and needed rehab.  She is till there because she can't go to the bathroom by herself and sometimes she feels too weak to sit up in bed by herself. My mom stays there with her every other day (all day) and her sister stays on the other days. They do this because they say if you leave grandma alone she will try to get up by herself and re-break her hip (she has done this once before).    They are currently paying the nursing home $225 per day to keep her there. They looked into getting Medicaid and apparently you have to pay a lawyer $10,000 to represent you, it won't cover costs for another year (who knows if she'll make it that long), and once she did pass they would have to pay a certain % of the money back.  She has quite a large farm they had planned on selling (~$1,000,000 my mom thinks) but a lawyer told them if they sold it before she passed they would have to pay a large amount of taxes.   Grandma's savings has run out and my mom is trying to figure out how to pay for the nursing home bill. She is thinking of getting a loan, then paying it back after grandma passes once they sell the farm. However she is having a hard time finding someone to give them a large enough loan. So my questions are:  is this the right option?  Are there options out there we don't know about?  Was she given the correct info about Medicaid?  Tl;dr need advice on how to pay grandmas nursing home bill	Yes
throwaway username. Do parents have any recourse when their minor child is being courted by a MUCH older predator (30+years) if the child's age is of their state's age of consent - 16 NJ and 17 NY. 	Yes
Found out my ex-wife is driving around on a suspended license. I told her not to take our kids anywhere and she refused. She left yesterday with them. Her license is suspended for not renewing her car registration or inspection. She claims to have over $300 in EZ pass bills so she can't afford to pay the fines and have her registration renewed. Since she won't listen to me about taking the kids on a suspended license, should I call the cops on her? I'd do my best to keep my kids out of it in any way possible, but this could be my only opportunity to prove to the court system that she is irresponsible and that I should have primary custody of my children.   Call the cops and have them handle it, or let her keep doing it until she gets caught?	Yes
I have full parental consent from both my parents and her's. I want to go to school where she lives which is out of state from where I currently live. What process, if any, do I have to go through?	Yes
"Massachusetts-In the span of a very bad year, I have gotten divorced AND have sought treatment for mental health issues related to my military service.  Initially I had a minimal disability rating due to hearing damage; my veterans service rep streamlined an application for an increase due to my continuing issues.  My ex left me a voicemail that stated she ""wants increased child support when you get that bump up in your monthly check.""  I never told her about any disability monies that I receive, nor did she know I was seeking assistance for my issues.  It's a horrible, extremely non-amicable divorce.  We do not interact.  I went to the VA and asked the advocacy rep if she could have gotten this information due to the fact that she still has a yet-to expire dependent ID; *he said he recognized her and had been in the hospital last week*.  My medical issues are my issues alone.  What do I do from here?"	Yes
Hi, thanks for taking the time to read this! Okay, let me explain the situation to you. When I was born my mother groggily signed my birth certificate and misspelt one letter of my last name. Apparently this went by unnoticed until now, but that's a different story. Anyways, I'm 19 now and I would like to correct my name. My misspelt name shows up in my social security card as well. I was wondering what steps I could take to correct this. I live in Kansas but I was born in Missouri, would I have to change it in the state I was born in?   Thank you and sorry for any mistakes. I'm new to Reddit :)	Yes
"My wife and I recently got married and headed over to the social security office in our city to change her name. She decided that she ""hates"" her middle name and thus requested it to be changed to her mothers first name. Normally, they don't ask you questions about a maiden name change if you have your marriage license on you.   Long story short the name got changed and about a month later, which is today, we headed into the DMV to update her license to a newer version with her new name on it. They told us at the DMV that the name was changed without a petition of the court indicating a lawful name change. How can I get this fixed? Why did the social security office allow us the get the name changed if it is unlawful? What course of action should I take?    Thank you for reading my long post.    TL; DR: Wife and I got married, tried to change her middle name to something unrelated, social security did it, DMV told us we messed up and sent us to the clerk court, now we either pay money to fix it, or change her name back."	Yes
My parents have always had a rocky marriage, and my dad was (and is) extremely verbally abusive and controlling.  Mom stayed for many complicated reasons, the primary of which is that she worked in ministry, and divorce at the time would have required her to take an unpaid leave of absence (and been a potential career killer).  They are now both retired.  Throughout their marriage, Mom was the primary wage earner, as Dad sabotaged a variety of jobs through (surprise) bad attitude and behavior.  She was also the primary homemaker and caregiver for my sister and I (now both adults).  Dad was verbally and sometimes physically abusive to us as well (think taking corporal punishment a step too far). She has a substantial pension, life insurance, and a significant inheritance from her aunt and uncle, and co-owns the house my parents live in (though the down payment all came from her).    Furthermore, my dad has a history of TERRIBLE spending decisions.  Pyramid schemes, miracle supplements and cures, fake investment opportunities, flat-out scams... you name it, he's thrown money at it, to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars.  (Most recently he handed over all their banking info to a guy claiming to be from a tech support firm that would provide better security...than the bank. $8k vanished before he was finally willing to admit he'd been had, and then he tried to blame the bank.) And of course, he hassles her about every penny she spends (including recently pitching a fit because she bought my daughter a watercolor paint kit for all of $12.)  My mom recently consulted a lawyer about divorce, and while she wants to ensure he has enough to live comfortably, she was alarmed to discover that NJ law is such that Dad would automatically be entitled to half of all their assets.  She is balking now at leaving him, because she is convinced (for good reason) that he would blow through all of it and leave nothing for the kids/grandkids.  Plus it is just deeply upsetting to her that after all her hard work and his poor treatment of her, he would get half of everything she earned as well as half her inheritance from her family.  Does she have ANY options for moving/reallocating even some of that money to keep it out of his hands? I would hate for this to be the reason she stays with him.   TLDR: Mom wants to leave Dad, she earned/inherited most of their assets, he's a controlling jerk who's terrible with money, any way to keep him from getting 50% of everything in a NJ divorce?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
I'm asking for my brother-in-law. His wife wouldn't let him in the house last week, so he stayed at his mom's house and my house. Yesterday, after the fifth day away from home, he decided he would just go back home. His wife and 2 year old daughter were at a friends house. She let him come get the daughter so he could spend time with her.   He kept her at the house last night and his wife stayed at their friend's house. Wife is now wanting to come back and take the daughter and keep her for the week....which would mean dad only got to see her for one day in a two week span.  He wants me to come over and be in the house when she shows up...no idea what I would do.   He wants to keep the daughter at home with him (I'm obviously biased, but I think he's the more responsible parent). Would it cause problems if he packed up some bags and came to my house or went to his mom's house? Would that be twisted into some sort of kidnapping type situation when the divorce proceedings *do* start?  She has made it clear she has no desire to preserve the marriage. Neither one has sought legal council yet, but I have told him to quit calling me and call a lawyer. Right now I'm just looking for a quick answer to what will go down today.	Yes
W.V.  The cops called me completely out of the blue, saying that my ex-girlfriend is wanting to press charges for phone harassment. I leased a vehicle for her before we split and she stiffed me on the bill. I did try to contact her a few times about the bill (nothing heated) but eventually gave up.  The cops want me to bring my cellphone in so they can hook it up to their comp and get all the data off of it. What should I do?  Also, what data are they going to get? I don't want them having access to all of my conversations on all platforms and stuff. I also hear they can get all keystrokes that have ever been typed on your phone, which would give them my passwords.  The cop told me she didn't have much, but I'm assuming they tell everyone that just to get their phone.	Yes
"Hi all... I'm helping my boyfriend get his marriage from Vegas annulled (he was drunk and drugged during it and doesn't remember, and both parties are consenting to the annulment). We are trying to do this on our own to keep costs down.  I have filed through Odyssey eFile NV the following documents:  Family Court Coversheet - FCC Complaint for Annulment - COMA Summons Electronically Issued - Service Pending - SEI	 Affidavit in Support of Summary Disposition - AFSD  What am I missing? This was filed many weeks ago and ""Accepted"", but things have not seemed to move forward.  Thank you!!"	Yes
My ex wife's boyfriend is over stepping his bounds taking over my role as a father of my 7 year old son. We divorced when my son was 3 and ex wife garnered the relationship right then and they have been living together for over two years. Immediately, my ex wife and boyfriend established solid boundaries that keeps boyfriend out of the father like role, as I am heavily involved in my son's life. Ex-wife has been extremely reasonable with me and almost have had all weekends with my son. The problem now is that although she is taking some of that time back, which is in her legal right... She isn't necessarily making that time to be entirely with our son, instead the time is bring channeled over to the boyfriend to spend time with our son on full day excursions etc., and she doesn't care or mind it. I prefer she spends most of the time with him not the other way around.  The relationship between the mother and boyfriend is unusual, and it seems as if the relationship has more weight on the boyfriend and son side. This is because of several factors:  - ex wife did not have a romantic interest in the new boyfriend, more of a convenience relationship during divorce - ex wife has no interest in doing meneal chores for child, such as taking and bringing from school, and other school related activities. Are just some examples  Online searches are coming up short for information about my rights as biological father in the state of Florida. Although, from a high level I'm finding that the mothers boyfriend has zero rights to my child.  Can anyone point to a source where I can find out more law info? ....under these circumstances.	Yes
Throwaway because my sister is an avid user of reddit, the whole deal.   I live in Ontario, Canada. I'm currently fifteen, but will be sixteen this month, which is the age I can legally move out of the care of my parents, who are basically useless. One is an alcoholic and tax evader and the other is truly his soulmate, I assure you that.   The thing is, I have braces and no cash saved up. If I do move out, what are my parents obligations to me? I don't see CPS or foster care as an option at this point. Can the province provide me with financial aid?	Yes
I realize the logistics of the father ending up with a child make it less likely, but I'm curious about the legality of it. I know different states have different laws, so really just interested in any states that allow it.	Yes
My ex files a motion and somehow convinced a judge that I have something that belongs to her. I am in another state and I don't have that thing. Will that make me automatically in contempt ? The order she sent me before the hearing (which was decided on the papers) called for issuing a warrant for my arrest if I don't return that think.  What will probably happen. Is the worst case scenario of actually being arrested a possibility ?	Yes
I'll try to stick to details and ask for specific advice, forgive me if this is a bit scattered. I am planning to leave my husband of 4 years due to overwhelming debt and lies regarding our finances. My credit has taken the bulk of the hit due to the fact that he had no credit cards and I signed the lease on our first apartment, I am about 60K in debt and have been trying to get documents together for bankruptcy. In doing so, I discovered lies and deception were more involved than I had thought and I need some advice on moving forward.  Filing bankruptcy in PA- I forget what the term is, but we are both liable for the debts accrued during the marriage in PA. Can I file for bankruptcy after the divorce is finalized? Would they come after me for his debts accrued during the marriage later? Child support, house- I'm not asking for abuse and name calling, just advice. He tells me he won't pay me child support or help me in any way and I will be homeless. How exactly do they decide what he pays and how? How can I support myself inbetween the filing and official divorce? Is a homeless shelter my best option? I really would like to stay with my kids in a home and not put them through that situation, and I'm worried of what it would look like to the courts if I took them out of a physically safe home to a shelter. -As another question, can he kick me out of the family home? His parents own the residence and we rent from them. He says I'm not on the lease and have no right to be here.  Do lawyers ever make payment agreements in these types of circumstances? I can't afford to even begin this process and I'm unsure where to start.  Can he use mental illness against me in the proceedings? I had PPD with my first child and had trouble bonding with her, but I have attended counseling and parenting classes since that time. He says I am unstable and he will get full custody if I leave.  I appreciate any advice and thank you for taking the time to read.	Yes
"My SO's mom is abusive and controlling. She is 17 now and turns 18 in several months, I am 18. I live with my parents and am in college but my parents, after seeing how my SO is treated, are willing to let her move in unconditionally. I have some questions about how to (if it's possible) take things legally which have been paid for in full or in part by her mother. We live in TX.  ---  Here's the situation:  * SO is the daughter of a single, never-married mom who owns a small business. We've been together for 3 years.  * SO has no license because her mom is ""too busy"" to take her to TXDPS (DMV). She paid 50% for a car and chauffeurs her mom around illegally because if she doesn't her mom will have a meltdown. She needs a parent/guardian there to get a license so she will have to wait until 18 to drive legally. Her mom's name is on the title. The car is insured and SO pays for the insurance.   * SO has a joint savings account with her mom with around $6000 in it from working for her mom after school and during summer.   * SO likely has an undiagnosed chronic condition (which my best guess for is strain+anemia or fibromyalgia) which has gone untreated because her mom lacks insurance or is ""too busy"" to take her to the Dr. (both excuses have been used along with others).  * SO has access to her birth certificate and social security card but no form of photo ID.   * SO has many items of clothing and other misc. things paid for by her mom which she would like to keep.   ---  Here's the questions:  * Can a joint savings account be cut off by either party at any time? How would one go about doing that? Could it be done in advance without the her mother being aware?  * We know that she has to wait until she is 18 to get her license and it will hopefully be much easier, but what about the car she paid 50% of? We're not hopeful about being able to bring it because the title is in her mother's name, but just in case, is there some way to legally keep the car without having a title transfer because she paid for half of it? Like I said we are not hopeful and she is willing to eat that $2600 if it means moving away, but it would be nice to keep it.   * They currently don't quite have medical insurance, what they have is a ""Health care sharing ministry."" I'm not exactly sure what it is but based on what I've read online it seems like something John Oliver would make a segment on. That's besides the point because the assumption is that her insurance will be canceled when she does leave. I am guessing that because she won't be on her mom's ""insurance"" and because she is not one of my parents' children, she cannot be on our health insurance. What is there to be done about insurance? Will she have to buy her own policy if she wants insurance?  * Are SO's birth certificate and social security card her property? The birth certificate is not the original, a new one had to be requested because her mom lost the old one and her mom paid for the new one. Since those are the only documents she has to prove her identity, are they her property? The birth certificate is kept at the place of business and social security card kept in her mom's wallet (stupid, I know).   * Her mom has paid for probably about 80% of her clothing and other items. Is it stealing to take them? Can they be assumed her's because she wears them? How can she take her clothes and other belongings without it being thievery?   Thanks for bearing with me through the long post and thanks for your advice.   TL;DR: SO is daughter to single mom, SO turns 18 soon. How do we arrange to get her belongings and identity (which were mostly paid for by her mom) legally?"	Yes
My best friends son is in Maine visiting his father. He was supposed to be returned yesterday to Tennessee. The father is ignoring the mother's phone calls, the police have been notified. They won't do anything because it's not kidnapping, it is 'restraint by another parent'. They told her to go to a lawyer in Tennessee, and Tennessee lawyers are telling her to get a lawyer in Maine. She set up a gofundme page, but it's unlikely she will raise money within a significant amount of time.  She tried Pine Tree Legal, they don't deal with family matters. She went to the court in Tennessee AND phoned Maine's court, and was told she needed a lawyer before filling out the forms, and/or told about a 30 day waiting period.  The court order states that the father only gets custody every other Saturday, Father's Day, half of Christmas and Thanksgiving.  They made a verbal agreement that the boy would be returned yesterday, but now they are in hiding. The police have gone to his address and his family's addresses.  What can she do???	Yes
We recently sold some of my personal property and are working to get our debt under control and credit score up. My husband had $13k in debt from his previous marriage, which ended about 5 years ago, and was split evenly between them. It is affecting my credit (yay marriage) and I want it gone and I know she has no plans to pay for it because she has no intention of needing or getting credit, so it doesn't matter to her, and it's been 5 years. I'm pretty sure even suing her for the $7500 will come to nothing (she spends money like it's on fire), but I want a record at least that it was paid and she owes me. Petty, yes, but it's a lot of money to me and I want a record of it. How should I handle this, legally? What steps should I take?	Yes
State (Alabama) (will answer questions!!) Hi I'm 17 and been have been in joint custody for a long time and I'm tired of it!! I'm so tired of my mom and want to go live with my dad I have already been kicked out once at the age 15 and forced back into my mom's home because she can do that apperntly.I am about to snap on my mom and on my stepdad I can't stand this anymore. I go back to my dad's every other weekend and sometimes a week I'm summer when school is over.Besides that I feel like im treated really bad at my mom's and ive already called dhr many times and nothing has happened over the three times I've called them. Sorry for really bad grammar but I need help with this like really badly!! Any leads or tips to help me get out of this	Yes
As a 17 year old in Utah I'd like to move in with a friend. I have ptsd and I feel like the longer I stay in the house where everything happened the longer it'll take to recover. There's also been more and more conflict with my mother and my ptsd symptoms and suicidal thoughts are increasing. I'd like to know if the police would come get me even though I'm less than 6 months away from turning 18, if the people I'm staying with could get in trouble, and if I can stay in school and work without a parent/ if I'm listed as a runaway.	Yes
Hey, I thought I'd turn here for an answer to a question that I've been curious about. If someone aged 16 or 17 in the U.K. we're to get married, would they be automatically emancipated? Or would they still be under control of their parents?	Yes
I apologize in advance for the ramblings   So my boyfriend of 5 years has 2 boys (6 &amp; 8) with his ex wife. When they divorced he got full custody of the older child and she got full custody of the younger child with weekends switching off.   1.5 years ago she got another divorce, and being unable to care for the child, he came to live with us for 5 months. She got remarried (husband #4) and took the child back. After a few months they separated and she moved to another city. A month later they got back together and she moved back. After domestic violence issues she finally handed the child over to us and checked herself into a mental hospital for a week and filed for divorce from husband #4. The poor kid was in 4 different schools last year.    Now she's asking for his birth certificate and ss card because she wants to take him back. She has only seen the kids a handful of times since he's been living with us and my boyfriend has never denied her access to the kids whatsoever.we don't plan on letting him go back to live with her full time, as he should be with his brother in a stable house and not living with his mother in a converted school bus...... In the past she has threatened to call police for kidnapping if we didn't give him back.   TLDR;   I guess my question is, since the child is living with us full time, can she just show up and take him back whenever she decides she wants to? What rights does the father	Yes
Hey all- any advice appreciated.  My ex and I are getting divorced and we have kids. We agree on everything, have already split a bunch of stuff. We are still friends despite the decision to divorce.   I am working through the paperwork myself, but some of it seems like ridiculous red tape given our situation like the mediation for example.   Does anyone know if there is a way around any of that?  Also, the stipulation of assets and liabilities form is a tad confusing because stuff is abbreviated and I don't understand the agreed value and amounts portion. I might just be brain fried at this point.	Yes
Practically speaking, are there advantages to being legally married at the time of your child's birth? I always heard that it was but I'm now struggling to find information on exactly why that is. I'm in MA.	Yes
I don't want him to go to jail. I didn't think it would result in criminal charges.	Yes
"Long story short, my mother is a not so great person and stole my identity ages ago. She's done this to my father and my sister but neither of those escalated to this level. Right now the issue writing bad checks. She's spent time in jail for this herself.   I live in Florida right now, and I completely removed her from my life. These charges are coming from Nevada and are from 2011.   Basically I was getting a background check done for a job and they told me they couldn't hire me because I have two arrest warrants out in Nevada. I wasn't too shocked, because like I said, my mother has a history of this, but I was pretty damn floored.   Running off of 100% assumptions here, but I'm guessing these physical checks stemmed from a bank account that my mother helped me open after I turned 18 and she just kept the checkbooks.   I completely and 100% did not do this. I've known of her using my identity before because I have bad marks on my credit report from her (from around this time) but I had no knowledge of these checks being written nor did I do it.   Since moving away from Nevada, I went from having nothing more than a GED to my name and now going to an amazing University, living on my own, etc., my life has really changed. This happening has been the lowest blow I've felt in a while.   Now I'm stuck on what to do. These are two separate charges, both misdemeanors, issued within 6 months of each other. I briefly spoke to an attorney in Vegas over the phone and he said something along the lines of ""these are not bench warrants, they're actual arrest warrants which are more serious"".   I was quoted $7800 to get both of these taken care of. It's twice as much because there are two separate charges.   I have no idea what these checks are for, how much they're for, who they were written out to, anything. I'm kind of afraid to call the courts to find out anything because I don't want to trigger a manhunt or something. Paranoid, I know. I'm really lost in what to do.   Any advice on my next steps? Is $7800 too crazy high for an attorney?   I've gone 6 years without knowing these issues existed... I'm terrified to even drive my car now in the event that I get pulled over, arrested and extradited over this.   Any peace of mind and advice would be greatly appreciated.    For what it's worth, I've spoken to my mother once in the past 6 years and I have no connection with her. I ignored the negative remarks on my credit report because.. it's family. But this, this is too much. I don't have contact with her, don't know where she is, but I have no qualms over saying it was her. I know some people have relationships with their parents that they'd never turn on them, but this is far too much for me to forgive. Like I said, she's been in so much legal trouble for writing checks before. This is her pattern."	Yes
Throwaway account for obvious reasons. I am a 19 year old male and I was recently looking through an old digital camcorder. Most of it was really nostalgic, old videos of myself and my siblings as kids, stuff like that. I then came across a video of my father raping me. I don't want to go into detail as I am still in shock and typing this out is still extremely hard, but I have no idea what to do. I live a relatively normal middle class life and I am just at a loss of words. I have been in my room with the door locked for eight hours as I don't want to face my family. The worst thing about this is my mother was present in the video as well, she seemed to allow it.  I am typing this through tears. I have absolutely no idea what to do legally about this. I cannot afford a lawyer.  Thank you all so much for your support, I am completely shocked right now	Yes
Asking for my mom, she's not a Redditor. My mother and father's divorce was settled last year. My mother was awarded sole custody of my underage sister, while my father was granted visitation rights. My mother is wondering if she is able to send my sister away to a boarding school out of state without my father's permission. In other words, does my mother's right to choose her daughter's school go to that extend? Thoughts?	Yes
We live in Nampa, Idaho. My husband asked for a divorce during this May 2017. He filled the petition for divorce not long after that. I got a lawyer because he was acting very pushy, just expecting me to sign and part ways. Once he got my answer for his petition from my lawyer, he apparent got so upset he and his new girlfriend went out drinking, with her friends, in downtown Boise. He had a couple drinks and told me he didnt know they were 'double shot' drinks or whatever. He, his girlfriend, and 3 other people got into our car and he was driving. He then drove the wrong direction up a one way street. The cop said he failed the test and the breathalyzer  and he got arrested.   My husband said that because he didnt have his glasses with him that he couldnt tell it was a one way street. I have been married to this guy for almost 8 years, that is a flimsie excuse.   This is his first DUI and his lawyer had him plea 'not guilty'.  Everyone says it will be a slap on the wrist for him. He will get away with it and he is 27 yr old should know better.  So basically, will he get a slap on the wrist because it is the first time misdemeanor and his lawyer is skillful?  If i provide all the court documents and arrest report to my lawyer to submit to the judge about my husbands poor moral character? Does any of that matter?   My husband lied to me saying that he wanted to be on his own when he asked for a divorce. But ive found out about all this stuff on Aug 3rd, including the fact that he wants to divorce as fast as possible so he can be with his girlfriend (23 yr old).  He just got out of the Marines and i qualify for the chapter 35 school support opportunity because of hisva disability status. We had both planned for me to go to paramedic school for over the last year and use the Chapter 35. Then he asked for the divorce two weeks after I got my acceptance letter.  What can i do legally to fight back? I feel like a doormat. I have 3 jobs, no friends, and have about 1/3 of the money I need for school. He goes out and breaks the law and gets his license suspended.	Yes
"This might end up being quite long and complicated, so I apologize in advance, but I really do need advice. I'm not entirely sure where to start, or which parts of the story are relevant or not, so I'll try to do a quick summary in chronological order.   Background: My mom and I have had a very rocky relationship since my childhood. I won't get into much detail on that as I don't know if it's relevant or not, and I don't want to draw attention away from the more pressing questions I have. I think what's important to note though is she has the tendency to be very manipulative and controlling, and uses her money (she's quite rich)/position (as a mother) to get her way with pretty much everything. She'll result to yelling, physical abuse, threatening to withdraw financial support, etc. to sort of force you into doing whatever it is she wants. She absolutely has to have her way about everything every single time, or she'll have some kind of crazy violent outburst.  My dad's a calm and quiet man - the complete opposite of my mother. He's very understanding and is ""passively supportive"". He'll let you live your own life and make your own decisions, and will help out when asked. However, he's very laid back, and will try to avoid confrontation as much as possible, so he tends to stay quiet and let my mom go crazy and have her way with whatever she wants, only stepping in sometimes, when she gets excessively violent.   Summary: [2007] I had a son when I was 18 out of an abusive relationship with my then boyfriend who was 19 at the time. The relation very quickly deteriorated upon me finding out I was pregnant, so much so that by the time the child was delivered, we were barely speaking to each other, which is why he isn't on the child's birth certificate at all. I was in college at the time, and unable to adequately provide for myself and my son, so I stayed at home, and my parents provided for my son. My mom would rub this fact in my face throughout the years, but I figured she's right anyway, so I might as well endure, as I really won't be able to afford the same standard of living she can provide for me and my kid.  [2011] Moving a few years forward, I'm 21 (my son is 3) and my family decides to migrate to the US. My mom and sisters would be able to apply as dependends of my dad who had a work visa at the time, but my son and I could not, as I was already 21, and he isn't legally my dad's dependent. The plan was we all go together, visit other relatives and tour around the US, help my family get settled, then go back home with my son. When we got back, I'd finish with university and get a job to be able to support us both. I figured this would be a good time for a fresh start and to finally get away from her manipulative ways without stirring up any trouble.  [2012] When it was about time to go back home, my mom started hinting that I should leave my son in the US with them, as they'll be better able to provide for him. I told her I'd prefer to take him home with me, even if it'll be harder for me. She then started to say things like ""Well if you insist on going back, I can't stop you, but the fact that you're choosing to leave despite my objection means you don't need my help, so don't expect any support from me when you get back."" or ""How are you gonna pay for school, and where are you gonna live? Are you gonna live at my house?"" Being still quite young at the time, her statements scared me. I knew I'd be able to survive on my own, but I also knew it'd be so much harder, specially since I had to provide for both myself and my son. I knew I could take it, and for me it was worth the hardship to finally be free of her, but I didn't want him to suffer being poor just because I couldn't stand my mom anymore. I felt like getting away was something I desperately needed, but I also felt like I was being selfish - taking away an opportunity at a better life for him just because of my strained relationship with my mom. I had a talk with my dad afterwards and he said I'd always be his daughter so he'll always be there for me, but it really was in both my son's and my best interests for him to stay behind with them, as I could focus on finishing up school and getting my act together without having to worry about being able to provide for my son. So in the end, I gave in to what my mom wanted and left the country without my son.  [2013] Mom tells me that she needs me to grant her legal guardianship so she can enroll my son to school. She says she's talked to a lawyer about it and will send over papers for me to sign. It seemed reasonable and innocent enough at the time, and nothing untoward happened so far, so I figured it'd be alright. She sends me the papers and I sign then send them back, my son starts going to school, no problems.  [2015?] My entire family (dad, mom and sisters) get their green cards and become legal permanent residents, as opposed to just legal dependents on my dad's work visa. Mom says she'll need custody of my son so he legally becomes their dependent and would thus also legally qualify for a green card. I don't remember the entire conversation in precise detail, but she said something about how I'd have to legally abandon him, or relinquish my rights or something in order for her to be granted custody. I was of course taken aback by this and didn't wanna sign any papers because I didn't like the idea of abandoning my son or relinquishing my rights, even if it was to my mother. .She assured me it'd all just be on paper, that he'd still be my son, that it was just so he could get a green card, it was for his future, etc. Also we' (mom and I) have stopped fighting so much after we started living in different countries. She repeatedly said this was the only way, and I decided it truly was what was best for my son's future, so like before, I had her send me the paperwork, I signed and sent them back. I think it was around this time she said something like it might be best to stop trying to contact my son so it actually looks like I abandoned him, and so he won't get confused if he has to go to court or something. I figured I'm signing the papers anyway, I might as well do what I can to make this go smoothly for my son. It's the least I could do for not being able to provide for him myself. She gets granted custody, and they start the process of getting my son legal permanent resident status.  [2016] I'm finally done with university and am free to visit my family. My son (who's 8 by this time) and I make up for all the time we lost by being around each other pretty much all the time. He follows me around everywhere and sticks by me pretty much all the time, wanting to do everything with me. I think this is only natural, as we haven't seen each other in 5 years. Everything's going alright but I start to notice mom getting jealous. Every now and then she'll say things like ""remember that I'm in charge here"" ""he's under my care here so I'm the authority on him, not you"" ""you have no rights here so I get to make the decisions"". It gets offensive from time to time but I let it go for the most part because I figured there'd be no point in starting an arguement with her. She'll just go crazy til she gets what she wants anyway. I can tolerate her controlling to an extent, because she really is providing my son with a kind of lifestyle I can't afford to provide. I just graduated and flew here to see them pretty much immediately after, so I don't exactly have much saved up. I mean, she is my mom and she has been providing for my son this whole time, so I really do owe her a lot. Plus, her house, her rules, right? They get along quite fine anyway, and from what I've seen, she very rarely gets physically violent with him, so it seems like her relationship with him is nowhere near as messed up as mine. The only thing that really gets to me is every now and then, she'll call him aside, and tell him things like ""I'm the only one who cares for you around here, so you should listen to me"" or ""Your mom doesn't think youre the most important thing, thats why she left you here with me and that's why I'm in charge of you"", things like that. I don't know if that qualifies as brainwashing, but what bothers me even more is if she says things like that to him when she knows I can hear them, what kind of things does she tell him when I'm not around?  [2017] It's almost time for me to go back, and my relationship with my mom has pretty much gone back to what it originally was - extremely strained and borderline dysfucntional. We've had a few fights where she ended up getting violent (literally dragging my son away from me, pulling my hair, clawing at me, etc.) and it's gotten to a point where I've pretty much lost my patience so I actually fight back, specially when she starts pulling my son away. That just really gets to me fast. Fights like that only end when she decides to walk away, as I literally have nowhere else to go. Sometimes she takes my son with her, or sometimes she leaves him with me when she walks off. On a few occassions she's forbidden him to come near me and things like that, but things usually settle down and go back to normal after a few days.   Sometime last week, another such fight broke out, where she was again dragging my son away from me while yelling ""I'm the authority over him you have no rights here"", and as per usual when she started going for my son, I decided to fight back. She started getting physical again, so of course I fought back, and eventually my dad stepped in and pulled her away from me and my son. She disappeared for the rest of that day, came back the next day and everything was as normal as it gets around here. After a few days, she gets into another one of her ""I'm in charge of you and I'm the one who takes care of you"" talks with my son, and I really couldn't stand it anymore so I tell her to stop, and just say what she has to say without any of the brainwashing crap. We get into another argument (purely verbal this time), and she starts yelling ""I reported you to the police you know, I can have you deported"" among other things.  Ever since I left him here in 2012, I've always had that feeling of regret with me. I feel like I should have just taken him with me because even if we did end up poor, we'd be together, plus even if my mom stopped supporting us, my dad would still be there, and my dad would never abandon us. But I always told myself this was for the best, because this gives him the best chance at a stable future. I told myself it doesn't matter if I miss him or if I'm sad or if it's hard for me, as long as he's okay, because it's all for him in the end.   Now though, 5 years later, I feel like I'm facing the exact same situation again. I don't know if I'm being selfish,  but I feel like this time I shouldn't give him up and I should just take him back home with me even if it means my mom will withdraw financial support (or any kind of support for that matter). I brought it up briefly with my dad after the fight last week, and he said it's not a problem with him, and he supports me taking my son with me if that was what I really wanted, but that I shouldn't make a decision while I'm mad.  I'm still thinking things through, but I might be running out of time, so I thought it'd be best to explore what my options actually are before making a decision. If I decide to take him home with me, my mom is gonna object for sure, so I wanted to figure out if taking him with me is an actual option in the first place, and if not, what should I do about that? I know that if I do decide on bringing him back with me I'll have to get an actual family lawyer, but I figured maybe I could avoid having to pay for a lawyer first and find out if I actually stand a chance? Because if we do go back together I'll need every penny I have, so I'm trying to avoid having to pay a lawyer hundreds if not thousands of dollars if there's no chance I can get him back.  -----  TLDR; Signed custody of my son over to my mom a few years ago, relationship with mom has deteriorated beyond repair, I wanna take him back but I have no idea if I'm legally allowed to. She has a lot of money, and I don't."	Yes
Hi!  Our wedding is being held out of state in TN in a few months. We would like our friend to officiate the ceremony. I have read that some online ordinations aren't being accepted (Universal Life Church). We plan to use AMM, but was hoping to get a legal opinion as to if this would be valid.   AMM lists the legal info for solomizing a marriage on their website:  https://theamm.org/minister-licensing/tennessee/  Any help is appreciated. Thanks!	Yes
"I'll start with the brief background.  My mom has been an alcoholic for just under a decade, and she dragged my dad into it for a while too. My sisters and I were emotionally abused and berated for the last 5 years or so. I was getting the most of it and would instigate to prevent it from getting to my sisters, but I was at University this last year and it got to them.  Finally, my mom got into rehab. Instead of getting better, she cheated on my dad with an alcoholic 25 years older than her in rehab and abandoned us for him after getting out. She's refusing to help with any bills, even though my dad can't cancel her off the phone plan without paying a $600+ fee. She won't help with any of my sisters' activities costs or my schooling.  I'm 19 now. I built my car up from scratch with my dad, and it was given to me for my birthday at 16. Stayed in parents' names for insurance purposes. I've got a job now and am paying my own things because my dad can't afford it all on his own, but my mom is refusing to sign anything over. She won't sign off on the title of my car to me, or even my sisters car to her. She changed our legal address on our accounts so all of our bills, which she isn't helping with at all, go to wherever she is and we can't access them.   She's literally holding everything in our life ransom because she got sober for a hot minute and ""fell in love"" with this guy and has gone completely loony on us. (Yet she keeps texting us kids how much she loves us.) As a result of this, in addition to paying my own things as I mentioned above, I'm having to send my dad hundreds of my earned money (which I desperately need because Michigan raised public university tuition prices almost 3% again this year) because he can't afford everything on his own.  She apparently wants to do an ""easier"" (I know it's never really easy) divorce that doesn't require court or anything, just filling out the documents and seeing a judge or something, I don't completely understand how it works. My dad is trying to fill out the divorce documents, but it's hard. He's been struggling massively with depression since all of this started happening. (To make it worse, my internship is 10 hours away in Minnesota, so I can't be physically there to help.)  I guess the question/advice I'm seeking, is what are our legal rights against my mom as the remainder of our family (Me, dad, sister 16, sister 14), and what are my legal rights against my mom in terms of my car, when I have my dad's backing? (The plates and everything expire this month and I don't know what to do.)  Title has MI in it, but for clarification, we live in Southwest Michigan. Even though I'm in Minnesota for the whole summer my legal address is still our home there.  Thanks everyone. I'm sorry if this was a bit too long; I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, never thought I would need to use it for something like this, though."	Yes
"I divorced my spouse July of last year and part of the settlement involved being awarded a portion of their 401k. The 401k was operated by the local chapter of their union.   In December of last year the provider of the 401k merged with the international chapter's 401k provider and since then noone seems willing or able to help me.  I've been told to basically stop calling/emailing the international chapter's investment department as ""we've not received the final calculations from the previous provider and cannot give you an update""  What, if anything, can I do to compel them to follow the court order?"	Yes
My financial situation changed due to me leaving an abusive relationship and at the time, the best decision for my son was to let him live with his grandparents while I got into a better financial and living situation. (GA, USA) The problem is ever since I started talking about being ready they started alienating me from my son (now 6 yrs old). So now that I'm fully ready and without doubt can give him the life he deserves, I have filed a petition for terminating guardianship, which was rejected and now has led us to court soon. I have a few questions about what is admissible in court specifically: Text messages, and call logs (where calls were not answered or returned), a notarized statement from a witness, can I have a (sibling) character witness?  It has been about 2.5 years since I signed over guardianship and I've continually requested and been shot down for visitation through the last 2 years. and have been trying to convince them to terminate for at least 6 months now.	Yes
So.    My ex was arrested for child porn and i am divorcing him.  He is now filing motion after motion to delay not only his trial, but our divorce.    I can't get legal aid because of the circumstances, and don't have the money to get a lawyer.  I know Florida tends to have the spouse who has custody stay withibk 50 miles of the other parent, but I need to get out   Any ideas, info, advice....  Would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes
Hi Reddit - I'm asking on behalf of my mother, who's never used Reddit but would love your advice.   She divorced her ex-husband (my ex-step-father, XSF) in 2010. At the time, my younger brother was only 14 so they agreed to put off sorting out the financial settlement until Brother was 18 and going to university - he has issues which make him very unsettled with change and it was concluded it would be best for him to live with my mother in the family home, and then sell the home when he went to university. In the meantime, XSF paid child support, maintenance, his contribution to the mortgage etc.   Due to various different health circumstances, Brother didn't go to university until last year. In the meantime, my mother has got re-married and this has made XSF incredibly bitter. Her new husband does not live with her, they have no joint account and no financial commitment to each other. XFS is now refusing to co-operate with proceedings to divide their assets. My mother has proposed various different financial settlements (via her solicitor to his solicitor) which have either been ignored or rejected, with no counter-offer given. At one point he verbally agreed to her offer, said he would send the paperwork - and then a week later, rejected the offer and came back with a much lower one.   Around this time, my mother decided she would much rather just be rid of him altogether - XSF has become increasingly rude and aggressive via any form of communication. He refuses to respond to letters sent to his solicitor (claiming he didn't receive them although we have proof of delivery and there's no reason his solicitor would hide the letters). He's told Brother that our mother is lying about the letters, accused her of splitting up the family, said he will take her for every penny, claims that she should pay him maintenance so he can retire, etc. Finally, she decided to just accept his very low offer, for the sake of having a quiet life. She sent the acceptance over a month ago - and he's not responded to it. We know he's received it, but he's ignoring it.   Mother's solicitor has said that at this point, taking him to court is her only option - she's even agreed to his (pretty insulting) offer, just to get rid of him, and he's refusing to accept her acceptance. Presumably, this is just to make her miserable as he knows she's keen to sell the house and move out of the area (and in with her new husband) and she can't afford to do that unless she sells it. Going to court will be incredibly expensive (her solicitor is estimating up to ¬£30k in fees, which she may or may not get back from him) and a very lengthy process, up to a year and, if he's going to be as awkward as he carries on being, possibly longer.   LegalAdvice, do we have any options apart from court? I've suggested one more letter, sent to both XSF's home address and his solicitor, saying that she has accepted his offer on [date] and is waiting for his response - if nothing else, if she has to take him to court, then she'll have proof that he's deliberately ignoring her in an attempt to drag out the process. I don't know if it's better to just leave it and go to court, or if there are other options we can take. Thank you!	Yes
I am in an on-again-off-again relationship in which I have a six-year-old who I am almost positive is mine, and a two-year-old who I have always had questions about. She has blue eyes neither of us have blue eyes she doesn't look like me she doesn't act like me. So it raised my suspicion. I decided to do a home paternity test and found out that the chances that she is my child are 0%. I am named on the birth certificate as her father. I assumed it was the case at the time. I'm currently paying child support for both her and her six-year-old sister along with private schools for them both. Her mother constantly calls me a horrible dad and says that I should be doing more. What are my legal options at this point? I don't really know that I would do anything other than support this child, because I do love her. I'm just looking for my legal options. I am in Tennessee.	Yes
My friend has expressed her concern however the new girlfriend says that it was approved by my friend's ex partner (father of the children). Is there any precedent over what kind of control my friend has over the posting of images like this when the father says it is okay? I want to again say that the images are completely public on Facebook, not friends of friends, and not only friends.	Yes
Shortly after high school I brought my girlfriend out of her abusive home to live with me 700 miles away. Flash forward a few years. She is paranoid, frightening, and downright abusive. We live in a small trailer renting it under the table from my grandparents friends. We are both in our early 20s  We fight a lot and it usually always leads to her trying to take the keys to my company truck I use for work and to hide my work clothes and phone. I need my phone for work because I am always taking calls. She will throw things grab my cloths and stretch at me. And in the past month I have been telling her I'm tired of it and want her out but she won't leave she doesn't work and has no friends that I know of in this town.  Here's where I saw it really turning in he past few weeks she has been getting mad for my lack of intimacy (although I tell her I don't want to be with her already) and she will try to force me out of the room and then grabs on me and I snapped  she was holding my shirt and as it started to rip I hit her arm hard and her hand hit the wall. She started crying and it swelled up some.  Normally I'm a very easy going person and I never get violent with anyone but I feel my rage against her raising and I just want her out now. I'm afraid she will try to attack me and I'll seriously hurt her. I've never felt his angry in my life before. I'm rambling.  How do I just end it. She has nowhere to go and practically no work experience as she has always refused to work. She doesn't even have a drivers license. Could I get a restraining order on her even though we have been living with each other for a few years?  I'm sorry this is a wall of text I can't think straight right now I'm angry and sad I'm sitting in my car because if I go inside it will start a whole new fight. I'll answer any questions to clear up any confusing thank you.  TLDR I'm brought my girlfriend to live with me 3 or 4 years later I want to end it she's abusive but won't leave and has nowhere else to go.	Yes
My mother is forbidding me to go to college if I want to study computer engineering so would she be able to pull me out of college I would be moving across the country and I would be applying for federal aid?  Or would I have to get emancipated before I left  	Yes
My ex-wife and I separated nearly 3 years (8/2014), we were unable to file divorce paperwork due to a lack of finances. I was laid off a couple days after we split up. We eventually gathered the money ($200 ea) to file and I sent it to her along with my side of the paperwork as I was out of the state. This was in 03/2017. After she received it, she filed indigent and ended up only paying $10 in court fees. Unbeknownst to me, she was pregnant at the time and gave birth just prior to our 1st court date sometime in May. The court ordered her to filed an amended petition stating the child was not mine. The case manager would not provide me with a copy of the amendment, nor would she. I went to the clerk of the court where she reaffirmed that the new petition has the child as being not common to the marriage. So I went ahead and filled out the Answer Waiver and Request for Copy of Final Judgement and filed it with the clerk. Since then, I've now received a general form informing me about child support and their website. Then just today, I received another Case Management Conference date. This is asking me to file a Financial Affidavit and a Certificate of Completion of Mandatory Disclosure prior to the next court date in 2 weeks.   So my questions here, is this standard protocol for divorce proceedings with a child? I'm not sure if she's trying to come after me for child support or if this is the normally required paperwork. Also, why would I be required to fill this out, when in the initial Dissolution paperwork, we both signed that our finances were being taken care of between us. Now, if she is trying to get child support, can I get the judge to order a paternity test and have it thrown out? And I've been without any steady employment for nearly 6 months and I'm a full time student. What can they possibly expect to get from me for child support. If it makes any difference to the child support, she's already engaged to be married to the guy she cheated on me with and it is his child. Would this help me get out of paying child support for this kid?  Sorry for the wall of text, obviously just don't want to get stuck making payments for someone else's kid for the next 18 years.  Thanks for your time	Yes
"I went with a friend to his custody hearing yesterday, and I have an odd feeling about the situation.  He had cancer 18 years ago, and has been on SSI/SSDI after they overdosed him with Chemo and he was paralyzed. After years of physical therapy, he can now walk short distances with a cane, but is still very limited and had his disability reviewed/reapproved just 6 months ago.  During the case the Judge has been pressing him by asking things like ""Well you can still sit at a desk and answer phones right?"" And now she wants to see his Soc. Award because she is considering ordering child support based off of minimum wage instead of his actual ~$700 full disability income.  Is this a violation of the ADA at all? He was declared disabled by SSI/SSDI, but can the judge overrule this and charge child support because SHE thinks he can work, even though he has a full disability declaration?"	Yes
"Throwaway for obvious reasons. Long post ahead, sorry if this gets into r/relationships territory.  My husband and I recently decided to get legal guardianship of my nieces (ages 13 and 15). Their mother, my sister, had abandoned them at their father's house, who in turn dumped them at his mother's house, where they were living without proper care. So far, the transition has been bumpy. They have never been in a single home for longer than a year. Their mother is not self-sufficient and has always relied on boyfriends for housing. We are trying to help the girls transition to a more steady life and have emphasized that they will both have a home here until they are old enough to move out. We are getting them registered in our local school district and have gotten them onto our family's insurance plans.   The younger sister (let's call her Jane) ran away from our home in New Jersey at approximately 4:30 AM on monday. According to Jane, she was picked up by an Uber driver at our home address and was taken to a train station, from which she took two separate trains to arrive at her mother's apartment in New York, where she is living with her current boyfriend. This was not discovered until 11 AM, when I knocked on Jane's bedroom door. On her bed were several notes, including descriptions of her appearance written like a missing persons report. She wrote down her age, height, weight, eye color, hair color, and clothing, as well as a second note detailing her reasons for leaving.  When this was discovered, Jane's older sister (Grace for now) became panicked and called her. At this point Jane was already in New York. She offered scant details about what happened, and given Grace's emotional state, it was difficult to glean details about the call from her.  At 12:30 my husband arrived home early from work and we decided to call the police. A police officer arrived shortly after. We hoped that they would be able to bring Jane home remotely so that we would not have to confront my sister directly, but the officer stated that he did not feel that that was necessary. He said it was generally unheard of to remove children from their biological parents and did not want to get involved. He called his sergeant over, they took photos of Jane's notes, and then it was decided that my husband and I would have to go to New York to pick Jane up.   We brought Jane home close to midnight. She asked to be allowed to sleep at her father's and we let her. We didn't ask her too many questions about what happened, but now we are stuck in a bit of a jam. We were disappointed by the guidance of the officer, and we don't know where exactly we can go legally from here. Here are the issues which have arisen since this event:  1. We have tried to contact Uber re:picking up a 13 year old girl at 4:30 AM with multiple suitcases and have not gotten a response. It's difficult to believe that the drivers are not trained to have suspicions with circumstances like these.  2. Jane and Grace's father is now threatening to try to get custody because this event has proven that I am ""negligent"" in his eyes. He has no house and not much legal income (decent illegal income), but his threats are still scary, given that now he is trying to be a bigger part of Jane's life and Jane talks to him quite a lot. We have been letting the girls stay with their father when they ask, but now we are wondering if we need to scale this back.  3. My sister is not admitting her degree of involvement in this case. It appears as though she encouraged Jane's behavior, but we have no concrete proof (except for the notes, which seemed scripted.)"	Yes
"I have a 2 year old who does not have any father declared on her birth certificate. Her father turned out to be a drug addict and has not been involved in her life since I left him 22 months ago. He has made no attempts to establish paternity, but has threatened to try and sue for custody a few times when I have spoken to him.   He is very unstable, and his family is equally unstable and they all have a plethora of substance abuse problems. I am very afraid his grandmother may give him the money to sue for custody. I think he would end up dumping her with his mother and her heroin addict boyfriend because he is completely incapable of caring for her (or thinking of anyone but himself). It would ruin her life for them to be involved. Ruin it.   I have an advanced degree and am financially stable on my own. I don't need child support from him, so that is not a factor.  I read that if the parent is a drug addict and doesn't try to establish custody, it is possible to petition the court to terminate their parental rights.  What is the likelihood of this succeeding? What kind of proof do I need to file my petition?  How likely is it that this would just be an easy way for him to establish paternity without having to pay any money (which is probably the only reason he has not done it yet)?  He did complete a drug treatment program, and has a job / apartment now, but he is still making up excuses to go to the hospital and get pain meds - which is what he is addicted to.  He is so addicted that he actually hurts himself so he has a reason to go (punching walls to try and break his hand, jumping off things to try and break an ankle, throwing himself down stairs to try and get injured, he even faked needing a cane for after ""breaking his back"" several years before I met him)."

Please help.  I am a young woman undergoing a divorce for a very short term marriage. Here's the deets:  1. Married for 6 months - Separated for 8 months. I left, he filed.  2. No children 3. Annulments/dissolutions out of question - Can't agree on retrieving my belongings 4. He has wedding jewelry and engagement ring, wedding money, and all my premarital belongings (lived together 5 years).  I left with only the clothes on my back. 5. He has only let me retrieve anything I could list with the aid of a magistrates order. (i.e. he kept anything I didn't specifically list - things like college diplomas/tax return documents/mail/family heirlooms etc)  I have not been allowed on the property since January 2017. I want a walk through to pack because it's impossible to list everything I owned. 6. Got my clothes back after 3 months - clothes damaged 7. Got some family furniture back after 7 months - damages 8. He is asking for my 401K (he has worked for 7 years, I have worked for 1 - I have stopped contributing once I found out he wanted it, but don't know what judge would rule in his favor)  9. Attempted court ordered mediation, but could not agree on time to meet with mediator (his choice of course)  My lawyer is very...relaxed.  Tells me I don't need to prepare anything for our defense for our pretrial that's upcoming.  Any advice?    1. Should I be working to build a defense?  I have photos of damages, harassment, texts proving he still has my jewelry, proof he deposited all the wedding money into his own account, credit card statements proving I purchased a bulk of premarital items that he wont let me retrieve, etc. But my lawyer says I don't need any of that.  2. Does he have a shot at my 401k? Does he have a shot at the money saved between marriage date and now? Or between marriage date and date which I left the martial residence?  3. What happens after the pretrial?  Wishing I was more educated on my rights. Please help. Thank you Reddit fam.	Yes
I'll try to briefly sum up the situation. Brother was with his wife 17 years (Caifornia which I believe does not recognize common law) and married for six. He owned the home prior to meeting wife and paid most if not all of household expenses including wife's education during the relationship. Wife came into the relationship with nothing. Simple question...does she have a claim to a portion of his home? Her name is not on the deed or mortgage. House was underwater at the time of marriage but he has a healthy bit of equity. Thanks in advance.	Yes
Parents died, I assumed legal guardianship of my teenage brother over a year ago who starts high school this year. Husband and I are about to accept job offers for the Netherlands. Guardianship does not have specific restrictions on anything like this and I am talking with US lawyer this week as well but wanted to post here too.   But any lawyer from Europe or US know requirements for moving with a minor who has no living parents to a country in the EU?   Thanks!	Yes
"  Father has son on vacation in Florida while school is out. He is trying to claim his vacation address as sons current address for full custody. The father wants to take away custody from the mother on the grounds that I, the boyfriend walk the house naked in front of the child, as well as drink excessively and do drugs while in the presence of the child.  I have &lt;b&gt; NEVER&lt;/b&gt; exposed myself to that child, and I don't even drink.. or do drugs.. it also says she has moved the child several times during his VPK, and kindergarden years..  She moved to try and work things out with the father, who then abandoned her and forced her to move again.   If it helps, I have no history of drugs or alcohol.  The father who wants custody has served 5-8 years.. not sure.. for possession of cocaine over 150grams..  The paperwork we received says we have 20 days to write a written response to the court.  Mother is in North Carolina, Father is in florida. Mother has a job that can be home with her child every day. Father is gone for days at a tie on his own ""business ventures"" for weeks at a time.    HELP??   Side note: we are working class people, having enough money to feed and take care of our own, but little else.. the father has been known to do things outside the law to fund what he needs to, is this going to screw us?"

Home state: MA New state: NJ  Hello.  I am trying to divorce my husband. He is emotionally and financially abusive. I have proof that he had an affair with a 16 year old girl while we lived in Boston. I am going on vacation to my family's home in NJ. Would I be able to stay and begin the divorce process from there? I have a daughter so I am prepared for the reality that that may not be possible. I am just asking out of desperation because being here with him is driving me into a deep depression.    Here are the facts:   * Married for 4 years * He is a green card holder/non citizen * I have picture proof of his adultery and abuse in text form * Daughter, age 3, was born in NJ * We lived in Boston for almost 2 years * He doesn't want me to divorce him and has made marriage counseling appointments  * I have 0 support system in Boston * I have no job, he works under the table     I know this is a shot in the dark question, as I feel like I definitely have to return to Boston to divorce because of custody reason. But I am asking anyway. I just wish to get out of here as soon as possible. I am numb right now but want to make the smartest decisions possible before I break down.	Yes
My girlfriend and I got pregnant. She doesn't want to raise the child. We're both in our 30s. I have a good job, stable income, and own a home. I'm prepared to raise the child. What do I need to make sure she signs or agrees to so this all goes down legally?  She is currently 6 months pregnant. Right now she says she wants nothing to do with it's feeding or rearing, which is painful. But she had a troubled childhood so I'm trying to chalk it up to that. Forcing someone to mother a child they don't want to mother could be more damaging to a kid than esuring legal steps are taken for me to have stable full custody from day one. She doesn't seem adversarial right now, except in firmly stating she will refuse visitation or any physical caretaking. Honestly if she is this troubled I don't want her to have those roles.   What happens next?    This is in East Texas.	Yes
I'm currently paying child support to my ex-wife for our 3 children.  My income comes from railroad disability, she's an RN and makes at least double what I do.  She's getting married this coming weekend.  I'm just curious if her spouse's income gets considered in the child support amount?  Also, what if she voluntarily decides to stop working and become a stay at home mom?  I just got an apartment about 20 miles from my kids, after living in VA for the past 3 years.  I scrape by each month, so I was just wondering how the new marriage will affect things.  Thanks for your help!	Yes
I'm a Canadian-American dual citizen. Born in Ontario, spent most of my life between Montreal and New Orleans. I've always considered my stepdad's last name to be my own, even if he never legally adopted me. I would like to finally change my name legally to his last name, and switch out my middle name, but I'm confused as to where I'd have to go. Back to Ontario? Montreal/New Orleans? or could I even do it here in San Diego (my current location)?	Yes
I have an ex-fiance who is pregnant and want to get some advice as what to do. I want to get as much custody as possible while giving her as little as possible. Just like she will do to me. There is a story to this and it is a good one and a ride for sure. Please pm me if you are interested in helping.	Yes
"A couple months ago out of the blue my husband(34) said he wanted a divorce. I (32)was shocked and I broke down. He was adamant about it and went the next day and opened his own bank account and moved over his direct deposits from our joint checking account.   I make my own money and it is still going into the joint account, but his money goes into his and he moves it over to the joint account.    He was ready to walk until I told him I'm not selling the house and plan to stay. He was hoping I'd want to sell and split the profit (I put 30,000 down payment from money I had gotten from retirement- gained while we were married). After that, he suddenly wants to ""work"" on our relationship. In reality, he is preparing for divorce. He has a large sum of money coming from some back pay and I believe that is why he moved his direct deposit over to his personal account. He's waiting on it before he fly's the coop-approx. a year from now.   Anyways, a month ago he got a direct deposit from some disability back pay and it went into our joint account. He wasn't expecting back pay and doesn't check our bank statements so I was able to transfer it into my personal account before he seen it.    I want to withdraw this money and put it into    a fireproof safe and hide it- just until this whole thing has blown over. I'm hoping to stay together. If he sees it on the bank statement, I'm saying I gambled it away (I never gamble, but its all I got to go with).   So I want to do this and then close my personal account, if a discovery is done will they be able to look at closed accounts?  missouri"	Yes
"Over the past year or so I randomly every now and then get a phone call from someone claiming they are debt collecting claiming I have an old account opened up with a loan company. I have never opened up a loan. They seem to always know my information. One of the first times they called me they told me I could pay it all off with a small one time payment, I was intimidated and gave them some of my personal info at one point because they wouldn't tell me what they were calling me for until I did.Every time someone has called me I always refuse to give them my info and they always get mad and hang up. My credit report say there is nothing opened in my name that I'm not aware of. What scares me is that they say the dates of the loan being opened is when I was in prison and my current roommates at the time had access to all my personal information I left at the house.  Today I got a call again, it started as a message saying someone is trying to contact me and send me information and to press 1 to be connected. I pressed 1 and someone answere with ""Hello"". I told them they called me and she then said she is a company who helps other businesses collect debt. She ask me to confirm my SSN and i said no. She got mad and said I will have to take it up with the judge. This very same phone call has happened a few times. They keep calling and saying they are sending me information to sue me for the debt. What can I do?"	Yes
So a friend of mine was divorced a couple years ago: she cheated on him with his best friend (split up 2 families) now they are living together. In the past couple years she's accused him of a crazy amount of shit (all of which was investigated and turned out to be false)  -he beat her - false - he beat the kids - false - he doesn't pay spousal/child support - false -he's doing drugs and drinking around the kids - false So she's used the police and court system to make his life a living hell and everything has turned up false.  He recently had a court date to go over the custody agreement (he only gets to see his kids when she lets him which is extremely rare). And wouldn't you know it just a couple of weeks before the date she comes at him again. He came home to find his house raided and all his personal electronics gone. She called the police on him again. My question is this: this is the 5th time (that I'm aware of) she's made false accusations against him. Is there anyway to turn it back on her? She's basically getting the justice system to do her dirty work and make the guys life a living hell.  He's paying for his lawyer, her lawyer, spousal support and child care.	Yes
I will be 15 next month at this time and I was wondering if there are any loopholes of getting out of a bad family situation without being emancipated. I live in the US if that helps. I don't have any other family to live with, but I can't live with my father and brother as I do now. If there's anything you think can help me, please leave a comment. If more details are needed ask away.	Yes
I was in jail when my wife divorced me. She got granted ownership of everything we owned, custody, child support, and alimony. I live in Wyoming where alimony is rare. I don't make very much money, I am a chef with two jobs barely making it. They are going to take 50% of my income to supplement the child support and alimony, making it even harder to survive. I cannot afford an attorney and the courts have no paperwork to reopen our decree based on alimony. I don't know what to do! I will always pay my child support, but the alimony is killing me! Please, if you truly know any viable options for me, I need help!	Yes
"My mother is visiting from AZ this weekend (I'm in grad school in DC right now). She was supposed to get in at around 10. I got a call at 9:40 from my mom's phone, and another woman answered. I thought, right then and there, ""well, my mother's dead.""  I've been waiting for that phone call for over a decade. You see, my mother is a severe, barely functioning alcoholic. Fortunately she wasn't dead tonight, but instead was being escorted to her fifth hospitalization in two years for falling and hitting her head while intoxicated. Her last? Christmas. 7 stitches. Christmas eve, I asked the ER social worker how I could get my mother help. The SW's answer? ""People are allowed to do terrible things to themselves. There's nothing you can legally do.""  I remember her falling between the train and the train tracks when I was 14 (13 years ago). I had to drive us home that night. A year later she had her first DUI (that I know of) in NY and her first court-ordered rehab. It didn't stick. She went back again in 2012 (CT). That one didn't stick, either. Between then and now she had at least one DUI (that I know of) in AZ, her current state of residence (retired). I've since had myself made her power of attorney. But while on the phone tonight with the hospital outside of Detroit that she was sent to (where her layover was), they told me that a POA means nothing to them unless they see the paperwork in person. What I need to do, they said, is make her declared incompetent so I can have her put in a psychiatric facility (or some equivalent) to have her treated properly.  My mother is 70. The last time she went to rehab she had the highest blood alcohol level of any female patient at that facility. She regularly drinks herself into a stroke-like incompetency, where she cannot recognize the faces around her. Mother's Day 3 years go, she stopped during our brunch to ask who I was. She refused to get into my car. A few years before that, she spoked to me for 20 minutes in complete gibberish. The paramedic tonight, too, noticed stroke-like (or Korsakov-like) symptoms.  How do I start this process? If I don't, I'm afraid she'll be dead within the year.  **TLDR: Mother has been an alcoholic for 20+ years. Probably should have been taken away from her by CPS. Now that she's 70, how do I get her help, and which state do I begin in?**"	Yes
So, my half sister (same mom) has been staying with her half-sister (same dad) since their dad passed 4 yrs ago. They told her today that the money she gets isn't here, and they've been spending it. She was ordered into their custody by the state, she's 16 now and wants to move out and figure out how she can take action against them to get her money (or at least some of it) back.	Yes
To elaborate: my parents are currently separated, and went to a mediator to settle the divorce terms rather than sue. In the meeting, my dad agreed not to touch the money in any of the joint bank accounts, but he is now saying that what he did was legal. Can he actually do this? It's a shitty thing to do, especially when my mom, sister, and I are on vacation together, and it could really hurt hurt her financially. We just moved money from her other accounts into one he can't access but we are not sure what else to do.	Yes
"My SIL has been in and out of homeless shelters with her 5 children, including my 2 nieces for about 2 years. She has asked us to keep my nieces for a minimum of a year until she ""gets her life together"". She currently lives in NV and I live in CA. She is willing to sign them over to us. I'd really like to put them on my insurance and enroll them in school. What do I need to do? I'm at a complete loss."	Yes
So I am divorcing first and foremost as a preface. Awhile back my soon to be ex wife setup her child support from her first child with another man to be deposited in my banking account. I have sole access and rights on this account still. There recently was a large deposit through the state enforcement office of back child support paid out to her that was deposited into my account. I won't go into detail why but am I in a legal state if I refuse to withdraw and give this money over to her? Yes it sounds scummy but I have my reasons. I just wanted to ask. Thank you in advance.	Yes
Hello Everybody - First and foremost, I sincerely appreciate any and all assistance you can offer.  &amp;nbsp;  TLDR= Wisconsin - Never married, Child is 14, have 50/50 custody/placement, there has been no order for support since 2007 when we amended the custody order for 50/50.  Is my Ex entitled/able to acquire to any of my payout?  &amp;nbsp;   Full Story = Recently discovered I will be getting some money, not Millions but still a life altering amount for my situation(lowish six figures).  My primary question/concern is how best to proceed to ensure that my ex is prevented/limited in her ability to stake any form of claim in the payout I will get.  My goal is to maximize the positive impact this payout can have on my life and my son's life only.  &amp;nbsp;  Basics of it are as outlined in the TLDR, we have had 50/50 custody/placement since I got out of the Military in 2007, she 100% agreed to sharing everything, we developed the current agreement together, without lawyers and both submitted it, judge signed off on it.  We were never married, when the support order was active during my service (03-07) I never missed a single child support payment, voluntarily updated child support every time I received a raise.  We split every cost for him 50/50(I write checks and have paper record of everything), we share all major decisions, we agree/share the same approach when it comes to teaching/disciplining our Son, IE when he's grounded there I ground him here and vice versa, we support each other in that fashion.  Overall I would say my Ex and I have a pretty good co-parenting relationship, I really couldn't ask for more as far as all of that goes.    &amp;nbsp;  My Son has indicated a desire to live with me several times, he has also stated this desire to his Mother.  I would love for him to live with me, that said, I recognize the reason he wants to live with me is because he and I share a lot of the same interests and overall have a ton of fun.  This is largely due to the fact that he is my only child, so he gets 100% of my attention/recreational spending, at his Mother's he is the oldest of 3 children, so gets far less attention and a lot more misc chores due to the larger household.   &amp;nbsp;  I typed all of that out to attempt to help inform your responses, not trying to kill you with a wall of letters.  Regarding finances, she is married, they have probably double the household income that I have, we don't really share our finances but we did include in our court order, neither of us have asked the other about anything for years.  We alternate yearly on claiming my son as a dependent on taxes.  My basic concern is that once she learns about my anticipated payout she will file for child support.  I have performed some basic research, in WI it looks like they utilize a formula for 50/50 situations similar to ours where they analyze the difference between the two parents income.  How does that all relate to taxable lump sum payouts?  I know I probably need to hire an Attorney, there is also the possibility that I will get the payout and she would never even know unless I deviated from my current lifestyle to drastically.  &amp;nbsp;  Thank you again for any and all assistance	Yes
The reason I'm asking is because my girlfriend (17) lives with her mother who is incredibly abusive. She had a huge fight with her today and she told me that she can't take it anymore. I offered her to come and live with me and my parents, but to do that, she'd have to become emancipated which is something her mother would never allow. She IS financially independent of her mother. She works full time and makes enough to support herself and pay rent to stay with my parents.    What would it take to get her emancipated?	Yes
There is currently an open investigation on my boyfriend (I don't want to give out any details). Because of it, he was forced out of the home until the investigation is closed. My ex husband and I have 50/50 split custody. I was told by both the detective on the case and the child protective service worker that as long as I comply and keep my boyfriend away from the house then I'm allowed to have my children as normal. He has been out of the house since Friday. I was suppose to pick up my children on Sunday night but he was able to refuse them to me despite what the detective, CPS, and the court order custody agreement says. I've already been in contact with friend of the court and they won't do anything either. I just want to see my children. What can I do?	Yes
I have been the victim of what was deemed a case of domestic violence. Specifically, my SO was charged with Domestic Violence 4th degree for some injuries I sustained while he tried to restrain me over the course of 3 hours during an alcohol-fueled psychotic break.  I was hospitalized in a psych facility the following day and spent 5 days there in recovery, where I was (after some time of knowing something wasn't right) finally diagnosed with bipolar disorder with psychotic features and prescribed a heavily sedating antipsychotic.  During those 3 hours I mentioned, which are fragmented in my memory, a witness described me as being extremely combative toward others and myself while also trying to hurl myself into traffic. That witness was my own mother, who arrived an hour into the incident. The responding officers, however, refused to formally interview her and I was too disoriented to give a detailed account of what had happened at that time (I blacked out).  I wholeheartedly believe the situation was more suited for an ememergency psychiatric team, and while my SO should have called the police sooner, he feared for my well-being and put it off for much too long. He took the blame for many of my self-inflicted injuries when the police eventually responded to the scene, as I could not recall what had happened.  Now that I am in a more clear mental state, I would like to do what I can to help him plead his case. That is difficult, however, as there is currently a no contact order in place. I know that it cannot be dropped prior to the hearing, which is on the 20th, but I want to know what I can do to ensure that it is dropped then and that my mental health can be taken into account.  I lived with my SO, and he was my sole supporter prior to this incident. I do not currently have a job. And I cannot go home. I don't fear for my safety around him, and I would like things back as they were, but I don't even know where to start.  If you have any advice for me, it'd be greatly appreciated.	Yes
Hey there Reddits,   I live in Maryland with my boyfriend in a rental. We're unmarried, committed, and not really in any hurry to marry. We have a joint checking account, but also keep our own separate accounts. He has some (moderate) cash assets in his accounts. I have a student debt worth about half his assets.   We live in a pretty progressive area, but the local ERs/hospitals are all religious affiliated institutions, and we're gay.  In case something happens, I don't want either of us to have to fight for access/decision rights, etc.   We plan on seeing a local lawyer to get healthcare paperwork taken care of. Other than wills, medical POAs, and advanced decision directives, what else should we be working with them to do? Is there anything to worry about with his assets/my debts?  Anything else I haven't thought of?  TL/DR: Gay unmarried couple planning on seeing an attorney for health care paperwork. Anything else we should ask for to protect each other from debts/issues/etc.?  Thanks!	Yes
Hi! A little history, my parents divorced in high school and I am now in my thirties. Mom has no desire to find another partner, however my Dad has been married again, divorced, and then gotten back with the same woman again (after demolishing half of his 401k and assets to her) and broken up for a third time.   He is on dialysis but healthy otherwise: vegan, organic;  coming from being an abusive Alcoholic.   After retiring, the thought of his on and off again wife never coming back passed, and he joined match.com  He informed me tonight that he has met a beautiful woman. So I ask for details and pictures. He sends two pictures of a woman that seems to be much younger than him. She is apparently 60 and he is 69. I doubt the validity of that though.  He said he is picking her up from the airport next week after being abroad finalizing an inheritance. I think all of this is fishy and tell him that he really needs to know about squatting laws and tenant laws before inviting this woman into his house. He mentioned her having an apartment in a neighborhood near him but i think that is just smoke.   What references should I link him to to prepare or should he just talk to a lawyer?   Tdlr: dad met suspicious woman online. How can he protect himself from fraud if he is adamant about pursuing it?    We are in Texas.   What can my dad do to prevent fraud or a crazy trying to manipulate him?	Yes
My ex husband died on deployment a year ago. He left behind our 6 year old. I've always been the primary caregiver as he was often deployed/stationed elsewhere.   We are about to begin a lengthy court battle for custody as they have decided that I am unfit.   The reasons they give are below. I am not the perfect parent. I always try to do better than the day before. That isn't to say I don't make mistakes.   I've gotten a call, the first one , but they have been reporting for the better part of year.   They don't have grandparents rights but I have voluntarily let them see our son every other Saturday since my ex died and they also saw him every other Saturday during any deployment or out of state station. This isn't court ordered.  I do worry that some of their reports might have merit  1) Instead of distracting him or forbidding him from humping. I let him do that in the privacy of his own room where no one can see him. I've talked to a doctor about it. She suggested distraction but when I informed her a month after that it wasn't working all the time she told me that I should just keep encouraging distraction but not to make him feel ashamed and just make sure he does it alone in his room.   2) I don't spank or use negative reinforcement in any way. He earns things by making the right decisions and being a good person but if he makes the wrong decisions we usually just talk it out. Sometimes we compromise where possible. I only take away things when absolutely necessary.    3) Sometimes we don't always get to bed right at 8:30. He is a tough sleeper and we try every day but there are days where he just won't go to sleep until 9:30. A few times, especially since his dad died, he has outlasted me and I've fallen asleep by accident next to his bed and woken up at 11 to find him playing with toys quietly ( he goes to therapy, we are working on it)   4) One of my neighbors smoke weed and I hate it. You can sometimes smell it vaguely in my apartment and right outside the door. I report it to the office and security each time. I have three months of back and forth emails. I can't just move but I have moved my son's bedroom to the master suite near the back of the apartment so that it would never be smelled in there (the guest bedroom is closer to the living room and the smell). My ex mother in law came to get him once and smelled it and demanded to look around the apartment. I let her because it isn't in my apartment. It is upstairs. Not something I can completely control but while she was there the security officer stopped by to take another report since I had reported it immediately. I don't plan to renew my lease but I am going to have to power through it until I can afford to move. I've gotten humidifiers and purifiers and candles but it isn't insanely strong, just notable about once a month.   Now even typing that I see things I could do better and plan to implement them but I am worried about the reports and what I can do. This is all stuff they have reported. And I encourage them to report when I do something wrong but this doesn't seem rise to the level of DCSF wrong. More like I need to read a parenting book and maybe get some advice from an aunt wrong.    Is any of this stuff that I need to be worried about in the report? I'm type A so I have back ups of back ups of everything and I am CYA at every turn.   I'd ask my lawyer but it seems like $250 every time I call him about something and I know I should and would. But I just have to wait until payday.   I am not poor. I am just not I have tons of money to throw at a lawyer at the drop of every hat rich.   I just thought maybe someone here to could let me know if this is something, legally, I should worry about or if the report will come and go and be look into and then nothing will come of it.   I am especially worried about the smoke smell. I've a binder ready to go of all the information about it where I tried to solve it all outside of moving. Would it be a better idea to just move? And just owe the money (and eventually pay it but like maybe set up a payment plan or something)?   I should note that I don't have any family so basically his parents are using my lack of a support system ( I technically had one before the divorce). as motivator for them seeking custody. I'm no poor and have a job and support myself just fine, it just happens that my parents died in my 20's and I was an only child. I mean I have aunts but we aren't close.   Sorry this is so long. I'm in Northwest Arkansas if that makes a difference.	Yes
My parents have decided to eat *Soylent* and only that, I'm of course expected to do the same. Soylent  for three meals a day, no snacks, no other food in the house. I won't even be allowed to eat school lunches, I have to take a bottle of Soylent to school and drink that instead.  Is this legal? Yeah they're technically feeding me but it's been three days and I'm miserable, I just want a sandwich or even a piece of fruit so badly. This isn't even some weird temporary diet they plan on doing indefinitely.	Yes
Alright so I live in the US in Virginia and I'm a minor (15). My parents got a divorce and my dad is very abusive physically and emotionally so I ended up moving to my moms house. My dad gave me my clothes from his house but he's keeping my PC and other things from me (it was given to me as a gift for my birthday). Is there anything me and my mom can do (legally) to get any of my stuff back?	Yes
Hi,  I just had a text from a girl i slept with over a year ago saying she had a daugther thats potentially mine or her ex's - shes not sure and wants me to do a dna test. This was a one night stand, havent spoken or seen her since.  My question: am i obligated to take this test? If i dont am i liable to pay child support in any way? This would turn my life upside down, its not fair this bombshell has been dropped on me now after she is born than before when she was pregnant. I know i shouldve used protection and what the moral thing to do is, but i shouldve been told when she fell pregnant not after she was born! Didnt even know it existed till 30min ago!  Also im from the UK not US.  Any advice would be MUCH appreciated.	Yes
"A young friend of mine is 19 and has been bouncing around from house to house since she was around 17 because of her father and brother abusing her. She's constantly worried he'll find her and force her to come back like he did when she'd run away as a young teen. I've let her know that as she's an adult, he now has very little legal control over her. That was a relief to her, but her big fear now is he'll find a way to change that. I know that an adult can take the actions to legally have ""custody"" so to speak and control over another adult if that adult is mentally disabled and unable to make their own decisions and care for themselves. That's where the problem is. Part of his abuse was convincing everyone she's crazy. He would talk to her friends behind her back to tell them she's crazy, talk to all the adults she might report to with a sob story about her manipulative nature and tendency to lie, even talk to the therapist he got her after each session and tell her ""his"" side of everything and how it ""really"" happened. He had her on tons of meds with tons of diagnoses and going to a bunch of doctors. He covered it up when her brother sexually abused her and told everyone she made it up/ asked him to do it. Bottom line, she's got a VERY small circle of people who believe that she's NOT completely unstable. Right now she's lives with her boyfriend and is safe. Her fear is that he's going to convince everyone that she's so unstable that she can't care for herself and needs him to still be her guardian even as an adult. Is this legally possible and if so what should she do? She currently has very little money as she's been on the run and does not have a license (her dad wouldn't let her get one - he told her years ago she was going blind and could never drive because of it and that one day she'd loose her vision entirely. She only discovered she isn't going blind a year ago after an eye doctors appointment as an adult)."	Yes
I'm a 17 yr old female. Just wanna know under what circumstances could I file for emancipation without my parents permission? I tried to read up on laws online but it was confusing to me	Yes
So, my wife just separated and we may get a divorce. She has a degree, an apprenticeship and will soon be a tattoo artist, lives with wealthy parents, but makes some part time money. I am a pure commission salesman who pays for us while she is an apprentice. We live in MN and have no kids. How can I avoid alimony after 3 years and 10 months of marriage? I have tried to work it out, and she has decided that she just wants to be an alcoholic and not work on it. What should I do?	Yes
Does anyone have any examples for custody or visitation agreements for parents where one abuses substances?   Back story: other parent has been abusing OTC medication for a year, no test exists for this substance, but it alters mood. Also has mental health issues. Currently have an order for supervised visits, but that may not last long term, and I'd like to come up with something we're both sort of okay with instead of having a court decide.  I encourage a relationship, and the child's other parent wants one, but I'm not sure how much/what kind of visitation they should have other than supervised. Other parent uses sporadically, so I'm concerned the child could die if the other parent uses while watching the child alone.	Yes
"For as far as I googled, you only can really change your name if youre a) getting married/divorce, b) on the run, or c) are transgender. I just really hate my name, and pretty much every nicknamed derived from it for my entire life. It's not an abnormal name, I just feel like it doesn't fit me AT ALL and hearing other people call me it/derivations of it always makes me cringe. It has been and still is really hard for me to imagine the rest of my life hearing others calling me that, thinking about that name being the one on my degree, and seeing it on my IDs and associating it with me. Is there a way I can word or a name change request form for a judge to not think I'm being stupid or having a phase. The name I want to change into is fairly common (I'm thinking ""Cody"" or ""Ryan""), but I am female so I don't know if it will be taken seriously."	Yes
Me and my sons mother are about to start our custody battle next month and in Virginia the judge usually sends parents to meditation first. We have talked about 50/50 custody before but now she is talking about her only wanting me to have visitation after filing a false protection  order against me to give her an advantage with custody. With the video evidence I have I expect that order to be dropped when I have my chance to present the evidence in a few days at the Protection order hearing.  My question is there is usually a discovery period where both parties present the evidence they plan to use at trial. Should I send her all the video evidence I do have, which is not good at all for in order to encourage her working everything out through meditation?	Yes
This is for a name change, the hearing is at 9:20 AM so not really time to run all over the city (and to a county 2.5 hours away). I planned to mail all the info to MIL who still lives in the far county and she can do the searches there, while I'm doing my searches in my county, we meet up over the weekend to trade off papers and bam, done. It sounds so stupid but this process has been so stupid that I'm just being careful.	Yes
My parents got divorced when I was about 6 months old. As part of this agreement, any part of college that is not scholarships is supposed to be split 50/50 betweeen the two. Now, recently (and by recently I mean the past 4-6 years) our relationship has ceased to exist due to large disagreements between me and the rest of his family, and him, as in nobody really talks to him anymore. I just recently graduated with my Bachelors, and today received a Bill for his payment plan saying I need to pay it. In the past, he has always taken the route where he could not pay or steal what he can in regards to me. I.e. my college savings, avoiding medical bills, etc. Now that I am a completely independent adult, can I still go after him for this? Would it be worth it? For reference, its about 2 grand, and I make enough to make it go away within 3 months or so. But I have to pay back the amount of government loans i did take soon, and this may be rough if I do so.	Yes
Hello community. I need some advice how to proceed. I cannot afford an attorney. Been there, done that, came away with a huge hole in my pocket and nothing to show for it. I share a son with an ex husband. At the time of our divorce the halfway point for pick ups and drop offs was designated in the court order. I've since moved and as such so has the halfway point. My ex husband is now outright refusing to meet me in a new location. Just keeps stating pick up/drop off is in court order, blah blah blah. Can I contact the court directly to ask to see a mediator to rectify this? Any and all advice is much appreciated. Thank you in advance!	Yes
"I'm estranged from both of my parents. They're bad people who I don't trust at all. I currently live with my brother in Texas who is also in no contact with his/our parents either. I'm going to be a senior in HS this year.   I recently found out my mother has acquired my SS# because she wanted to ""help with insurance"" but I'm afraid she'll try to ruin my credit for her own gain. I have issued a fraud alert for my credit just in case and have requested a credit report via mail. Hopefully nothing will come up because I have no credit cards or anything under my name (as far as I know). I'm still worried though and would appreciate it if you guys could give me any more advice on how I can legally protect myself from both of them. "	Yes
I never took my husband's last name and now we're divorcing. We have a child together and I'd really like to have the same last name (his). Would he be able to protest my taking the same name as my daughter?	Yes
Here's my situation regarding my marriage..  I am American-Vietnamese, born here in the United States in the state of Georgia. My husband was an international student I met when I was 17. We started a relationship in which lead to our marriage when I was 18. I had our son when I was 19. We went through paper work to change his status and attempt to get his green card through marriage. I am not familiar with what the correct terms of the whole process. During the process I was pregnant with our son, so the initial interview happened to confirm if our marriage was real or not. We definitely passed really easy because of our baby. Since then he got temporary USA resident and temporary work permit (I think that's what it is), and the application for his actual green card applied for. We got lots of confirmation letters that the application had been received. We lived our lives as we waited. During this wait time our relationship went downhill. It was a very unhealthy relationship in which I needed to escape in order to recover myself and to do everything I could to provide for my son. He was arrested when I was 21 for domestic violence. It was an accident on his part but I was scared so I called the police. He had to pay a fine, take family violence classes, and was on parole for a few months. That was the end of our relationship.. the last straw. I immediately moved to Florida with my son to get away and start my life over. I left with nothing but our clothes. I've since then built a life for my son and I here. I am about to turn 23, he is 29, and throughout these two years I have let his dad see him many times. I am grateful for their father-son bond and do not ask much from his father. His dad asked me to continue helping him getting his green card because he does not want to be sent back to Vietnam. Out of fear that he would be sent back and my son would not have his father here in the states or him not being able to help with child support, I agreed. I am in a very healthy relationship right now with a man who loves my son and I for about six months now.  Now that I live in another state and in a relationship, I'm worried. He called to tell me that he got a letter asking for an interview next month. It's been almost two years since I left and this is the first letter. He asked me to fly in for this interview. Let me also add his family here in the states are the ones handling all the paper work and they are the ones going back and forth with the lawyer.. I pretty much have been doing what I was told since this whole process begin and I have no knowledge of what goes on.  All I know is I have to attend this interview and I am nervous. He was arrested and I moved out of state and am in a new relationship. I honestly want out, but I do not know where to start. I no longer care about getting his green card and don't really want any ties to him anymore besides our son. I want to get a divorce and move on with my life. Should I go to this interview and tell them our relationship didn't work out? And I don't want to do this anymore? And is there any chances I can get in trouble?	Yes
Hypothetically speaking, I live in Des Moines, Iowa and my soon to be ex-wife lives in North Carolina. She is having a lawyer draw up divorce papers. I have a feeling she's taking advantage of the joint checking account that we have and I can't take her off of the account because the nearest bank is in Chicago. Is there anyway, without a lawyer, that I can have her taken off of the account?	Yes
"curious about a situation a friend of mine is in. She is legally married, although trying to get a divorce from her child's father. They live in separate states and are in no way ""together"" anymore. He barely gives her any money for the baby and she is going to put him on child support. She recently found out that her ""husband"" got another woman pregnant and her sister has contacted my friend. She told her that he will not give her the money for an abortion and they are trying to get my friend to give her money for it. Threatening that if she ends up having the baby that she will put both of them on child support since they are still legally married. I've never heard of such a thing, is this something that can actually happen or is she full of shit?"	Yes
Texas.  I have a bank account which was opened when I was 18 with my mother and step-father being co-signatures (big mistake). This means they have full access to my bank account. I used the account to deposit social security checks that I collected in my fathers name since he died. I'm told that I was eligible for the checks (around ~1800 each month) as long as I am in school full time. Since I graduated High School last month I don't believe I will see another one even though I am attending a 4-year University in the fall. If anybody can confirm this that would be great because my parents haven't given me a lot of details.  Anyway the checks had my name on it since I turned 18 and I endorsed them when depositing them into my account. I was told that the money would be used to pay for college, but I always knew that my mom took out a little each month to pay for general expenses. However I recently gained access to online banking (which they didn't allow me to view) where I have found out that they have taken a lot more than they said they had been. I found over 3,000 dollars in withdraws at an ATM in a casino...  Let me repeat that. They have withdrew over $3,000 dollars from my college savings account and used the money for gambling. I am beyond mad.  I also found over $9,000 has been transferred from the savings account into their general checking account. All of this has occurred in the 12 months since I turned 18 meaning that every dime that was even in the account was 100% mine since I received it as an adult with my name on the check. I realize the difficulties that pose in the situation since my parents are co-signatures on the account and therefore have the same right to the money as I do...  I confronted them yesterday and they acted offended that I question what they are doing with my money (!) and attempted to kick me out of the house. My mom is 100% convinced she is justified in taking my money and spending it on gambling and is completely outraged that I would object otherwise. My mom is a narc and my step-dad is just a dick who hates me. I see no way in getting them to pay back the money they took from me.  Ultimately, I understand that legally I probably don't have grounds to sue. Nor do I intend on suing my parents. If possible, I would like to get a lawyer to compose a document indicating that I believe they owe me this money and they should pay me otherwise I will take it to court. This would let them know that I am very serious about the matter because otherwise they will just ignore me.  I have since closed my accounts at that bank and withdrew all the money I had available.  What is upsetting is that this money was the only savings I had for college since my parents have refused to save their money for my college (they can't even keep their fingers out of money I saved). They will certainly offer me no financial assistance while in college so I am forced to take out $100k in loans to attend college. Side note: if I declare emancipation will that open me up for need-based financial aid considering my income is 0?  Anyway, thank you for reading this far. I am stuck in a very difficult situation and afraid I cannot reason with my parents. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
"My Uncle was recently admitted to the Hospital in Houston and it took the Hospital 3 days to contact us, his family, because he was dropped off by a woman claiming to be his spouse who did not show back up until today wanting to pull the plug. We believe she is an illegel immigrant who has another valid marriage in Mexico, sorry for the lack of details I'm trying this as fast as i can because of the situation at the Hospital at the moment, he is located in Houston Texas and my aunt just made it to the hospital. We don't know who this woman who is apparently his spouse is, but we suspect it's some prostitute who was trying to become a citizen. What rights do we have as his family, can we stop her decision? Will she inherit everything he owns as he has no children?  What can we do as his family, nobody wants to unplug him except for his ""spouse"" who NOBODY know who she is."	Yes
Firstly, we're located in Oregon. It's been a long road and there's so much information that I'm not even sure to begin, so I'll just list the facts. My SO impregnated his (now ex) girlfriend after a couple months of seeing each other. He already had a son from a previous relationship and has shared custody of his 8-year-old with his son's biological mother. His son's biological mother is a heroin addict and is not in the picture at all.   The newly impregnated girlfriend (who I'll refer to as Megan for this post) and he decided that they're going to try to make it as a family because she wanted to keep the baby. SO's relationship with Megan lasted a little over 3 years and during that time, Megan attended a community college and was a stay-at-home mom for both the 8-year-old and their shared son. SO worked full-time and paid a majority of the bills. She used her refund checks from student loans to pay the rent only. The 8-year-old was encouraged to think of Megan as his mom. The end of the relationship seemed amicable and mutual. They even hugged after the breakup. Megan requested that SO not stay at the house anymore, so he started to stay with me. He and I were best friends and I lived in a small one bedroom apartment. There wasn't enough room for the 8-year-old and SO didn't want to leave Megan financially devastated because she still did not have a job. He continued to pay all of the bills for Megan which was about $1,100 a month and he would go to Megan's house each night to put the boys to bed. They were trying to keep up consistency so that the routine didn't change that quickly. He even spent his days off over there so that the boys didn't miss any time with him; he was at Megan's house as often as he was before the breakup. This pattern continued for about 6 months and during that time, SO and I became romantically involved. As soon as Megan discovered he was moving on, the entire situation became very hostile and ugly. Turns out she was harboring love for him still and had deluded herself into thinking they would get back together. Fast forward about a year and SO and I have moved into our own two bedroom place. The 8-year-old is in our care. His little brother is now a toddler and he lives with Megan. We have countless harassing texts, voicemails, emails and FB messages from Megan who has been a continued nightmare. She even went as far as to attack my SO's professional profile on both FB and Amazon. We have screenshots and countless prints of her erratic behavior. She became very fixated on me and insists that I'm taking her life away from her. She's convinced that I'm an evil mastermind and said she was going to make sure that I never got to be around either of the boys. A little about Megan, she's a very intelligent person, but she's also conniving, capable of delusions and has an obvious superiority complex. SO and Megan are still in an ongoing battle for their shared toddler and that trial will take place this September. SO recently received an email from Megan where she informed him that once the battle for their shared toddler was over that she fully intended to take him to court over the 8-year-old. She's not legally or biologically connected to him, but they did develop a mother-son relationship for a little over 3 years. We were still letting the 8-year-old see her every weekend until she threatened to take him away from him father. Her email wasn't stating that she wanted parenting time or visitations, she wants take custody of the 8-year-old and have him in her home. Can she legally do this? I'm baffled as to how she could. The attorney we spoke to said that her chances of winning were nonexistent. Megan has been very confident and stated in her email that the attorney she spoke to said the state of Oregon does recognize her parentage and she can take SO to court over the 8-year-old. Please help. We're stressed and quite frankly, I'm not sure what to believe.   TL;DR My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend helped raise a child for 3 years. She is not related to the child nor did she and my SO marry. We have a lot of documentation that she's not a rational or reasonable person. Can my SO's ex-girlfriend win rights to a child that's not hers?	Yes
All involved parties live in Georgia.   The following language exists in my divorce agreement (signed and executed by a judge) revolving the submission of expenses for reimbursement of child medical expenses. &gt;  &gt; ‚ÄúFollowing the execution of this Agreement, if the Plaintiff incurs any out-of-pocket medical expense for the minor children, she shall submit to the Defendant, within thirty (30) days of receipt, an Explanation of Benefits, bills, receipts, or other documentation showing: the date of service, the Minor Child for whom the expenses were incurred, the provider, the amount of the expense, and the purpose of the expense. Such documentation must be complete copies and shall be posted to OurFamilyWizard as described herein. The Defendant shall then have thirty (30) days from the posting of the Documentation to OurFamilyWizard to reimburse the Plaintiff for 35% of the out-of-pocket expenses. If the Plaintiff fails to provide documentation of payment within thirty (30) days of herself receiving the Documentation, then she shall have waived her right to seek reimbursement for said expenses.‚Äù  My X made a medical payment on June 16th, at which time she received a receipt and the standard documentation of the medical service. She sent me pictures today (1 Aug) of the dated documentation. There is NOTHING else in the agreement that references this type of issue.  **QUESTION: She claims that her ‚Äú30 day timer‚Äù doesn‚Äôt start until she gets the EOB, which she says she still doesn‚Äôt have.  I believe that her ‚Äú30 day timer‚Äù started the day she received the receipt and documentation from the medical provider. Who is correct? If a lawyer answers, could you possibly provide a case?**  *NOTE: I'm still going to pay my portion of the child's medical expense because it's the right thing to do.*	Yes
"After many years of no contact I reached out to my father in prison. He quickly sent me paperwork to become his POA, which my aunt (his sister) has had up to this point. My dad has legal trouble in both NY and PA and is constantly appealing and transferring between both states.   My father was in his 60s when he went to prison and actually retired from his job, so he gets checks each month. He wants the money put into an account for legal fees and other expenses, and some taken out for commissary. He thinks his sister is taking his money (I highly doubt it) and that he wants me to take over.   I have a general understanding of POA but my dad has a sketchy past financially. I'm in nursing school full time, and financial aid pays for my schooling, and I'm not sure if having this financial POA counts as my income or his own. Do I have to file taxes on it? If it counts as income this might cut my financial aid back which would be devastating. My dad claims he owes nothing, but I know my dad had debt (I watched many cars get towed for non payment growing up) and have gotten phone calls for outstanding bills. Will they/can they come after me if I have POA? Can that effect my credit?  I can't afford to talk to a lawyer about this situation, and I'm not sure of my fathers current credit or debt. His past was always a secret and he lies a lot.   My mom is advising me not to, saying my aunt had problems with other inmates sending her threatening letters wanting his money. My dad talks to ""jail house lawyers"" aka inmates a lot and they wanted compensation from his retirement, so they threatened my aunt apparently via letters.   I'm unsure what to do really. I want to help him but I don't know much about POA, and googling only tells me so much. I'm trying to keep good credit and my debts to a minimum, and I feel like this can come back to bite me. Please help!"	Yes
It seems that adult life has been set up in a way that makes things kind of complicated if you're trying to make financial decisions with someone who you are not married with. Some of the benefits of marriage include:  - Your spouse can make your medical decisions hassle free - If you're married your spouse can get health insurance through your job and you get the family rate if it's offered - Family leave is an option when you're married - Making big purchases is simpler  There seems to be so many benefits but I have no interest in getting married. Are there legal ways to get some of these benefits without getting married?   Location: Fl, US  Thanks reddit.	Yes
My boyfriend is the person in question. His parents had an extremely messy divorce 8 years ago; they have had joint custody (physical and legal) since then, with the kids switching houses every week. The legal battle has been going on all of the past 8 years. The parents are very hostile, and they hardly speak to each other.  His dad is a hedonistic, power-obsessed monster, and he's been consistently emotionally abusive. He is also an attorney, which is what worries me. His mom didn't work during the marriage, but she's since started her own business helping autistic children. She's not without her faults, but she truly cares and wants the best for him.  Recently, things have escalated greatly. My boyfriend is transgender, and he came out to his parents very recently. His mom is very supportive. His dad is not.  His mom had a major lung surgery earlier today in Boston (we live in North Carolina). My boyfriend is staying with his dad. His dad has taken away his phone, computer, and car, and he's not allowing him to leave the house.  I've talked to him on the house phone, and he's very scared and doesn't feel safe. He talked to his mom who said that they could fly him up to Boston tomorrow, but his dad has said he can't go. He doesn't want to live with his dad; he's repeatedly said that it's not healthy for him to be in that house anymore.  I'm seventeen years old. I have no idea what to do. First step is getting him to Boston. It's his mom's week, so I don't think his dad can stop him. Then there's the custody piece. This might have an easy answer, but I have no idea. Please any help is enormously appreciated; thank you so much.	Yes
"So my dad is trying to evict me, he doesn't have anything legal. He wants me to work for him, and is consistently harassing me until I do (I'm in between jobs and I'm looking for one ACTIVELY.) He was harassing me this morning in his room, yelling into mine. I went to his bedroom calmly. I asked why I have to work for him and why he is trying to take my car away (he bought it, pays for everything for the car), when I am actively looking for a job. He got angry. Shouted, charged me, and I backed up. He was pushing my hands away and spitting into my face. I backed up into my room next door, and he was still in my face arguing with me so I threw a punch and it landed. It busted his lip open. He's trying to file a police report. He took my phone and my car away from me.   This is not the first time we have had a fight. Last time I accidentally closed the door on my mom's finger during an argument, so he dragged me out of the bathroom by my hair and stomped on my back - knocking the wind out of me. The police that came searched my room for drugs, and they ultimately told my father he has every right to put his hands on me if I'm ""being disrespectful"".   So the police WILL take his side. They told me if I don't like it, get out.   He IS verbally abusive. EXTREMELY so. But he rarely fist fights with me.   How do I avoid going to jail?"	Yes
My mother is 64 years old. She's a retired church secretary. My father is still working, making good money, and has a large sum in retirement. He just revealed today that he has been having an affair for 14 years, and is leaving my mother. My main concern is that she is taken care of. What should I advise her to do?	Yes
"I'm 16 and I'm going into my junior year of highschool. My conservative parents and I often argue. They believe that I am ""the only child that fights with his parents"". Because of those previous arguments, they wouldn't allow me to have access to the papers I need to enroll.  They made me miss the enrollment days.   I get okay grades. Mostly A's or high B's and those C's in Spanish. I am in speech and debate and orchestra. I clean my room, my dishes, fold my clothes and take out my trash.    Is there anything I can do? I go to school in California.    I posted this in r/advice and someone told me to go here"	Yes
My wife and I were virgins when we got married in January 2016. She has been to pelvic floor therapy and several doctors, but still cannot have sex. She is not going to therapy anymore and we have not done anything physical for several months (no oral or manual stimulation). Do we qualify for an annulment, or is a no-fault divorce our best option?	Yes
"Created a throwaway for this.   I live in Belize, in Central America. I have an uncle who has three of his four children currently living with him and his girlfriend. The children's ages (who live with him) are between 7 years- 18 months. There's a lot to this story but I'll try to be succinct.  My uncle drinks and smokes heavily, and his girlfriend drinks heavily as well, and is affiliated with gangs. They have always had a tumultuous relationship, rife with domestic abuse from both parties, among other things.   They had their oldest, the 7 year old, and it was with her the abuse started. She has been burnt with flat irons (at the age of 2), sexually abused by the girlfriend's friends since the age of 3, beaten on a daily basis, and so many other things. I know all this because I can hear everything that goes on in their home, and the child tells anyone who will listen to her. Everyone brushes it off and ignores it.   The middle child is 3 years old. Since his birth he has been cursed and called names, now he is beaten on a daily basis. He has had remote controls thrown at his head and broken on his little body. Everytime we see him, he has new bruises. He as been chased out of his home by his drunken mother at 3 AM because she was mad at his father. My family and I are closer to this child because his mother would always send him over to our house (which is right across the street) because she didn't want to take care of him and thought she could get free babysitting services from us. We would bathe him, feed him, clothe him, take him on trips, you name it. He became one of our own.   The youngest, is almost 1 1/2 years old. Again, since her birth she has been neglected, cursed like an adult, and beaten.   About a month ago, shit started to hit the fan. One night we heard the boy screaming as if they were torturing him. The parents were drinking heavily with a friend and were not paying attention to the children. My father went over to pick up the boy and slammed the front door in the process. The boy was in a state of shock because it took him an hour to calm down and tell us what happened. His father had punched him in the nose because the boy was annoying him. My uncle started yelling death threats at my father, saying that he would shoot him in the streets because he disrespected him by slamming the door to his house. He screamed at us for over an hour. We called the police and when they arrived, he changed the story to us kidnapping his son. We went to the station and made a statement against him, but that statement was eventually lost and therefore is no longer valid.   After this incident we went to see a lawyer. The lawyer called the human services agency (there was already a case set in motion but they had all but forgotten about it) and the case worker decided to pay a visit to the 7 year old's school on that same day. They called the father (my uncle) to inform him and he told his girlfriend and they both went into a rage.   We were not aware of the school visit, so we were at our house at the time, and the 3 year old was too (he hadn't bathed or eaten from the day prior) when the girlfriend decided to come over to our house to curse at us. She screamed for the 3 year old to ""get his fucking as here now"" meaning to leave our house and join her by our gate. As she walked away with the 3 year old in her arms, she screamed death threats at us too, saying that she would burn down our house, place bombs in our cars, slit my throat, and shoot my little brother in the streets, because ""it is now war, and we were going to get it"". My mother and I were the only ones at home and we became incredibly frightened so we called anyone who could help, my grandfather, the police, my father, anyone. The police came and didn't do anything. The case worker who came with the police was more interested in going home because she had a vacation that started the next day. We went to the station and my mother and I gave statements against my uncle's girlfriend (they have been living together for quite some time so he refers to her as his wife now). After we gave the statements the sergeant in charge asked us, including my uncle and his girlfriend, to go back to the station to ""mediate"". It didn't do a lot of good, because my uncle and his girlfriend denied everything and called us the liars. After this they said that the boy would never be allowed at our house again. He tries to run away to our house whenever he can, and sometimes they send him because they get frustrated very easily with the children.   On Facebook, they are the perfect parents, but no one knows or understands what happens when the cameras are not on. Everyone in my family turns a blind eye to it. We were instructed to close our windows and doors when the children scream to that it doesn't bother us. We live right across from them so it is incredibly hard to ignore the noise.   They also blast loud music whenever they feel like it, sometimes in the middle of the day, sometimes until 4 AM. They have alienated themselves from my entire family, and still make themselves out to be the victims.   I apologize for jumping all over the place with this, but I don't know what to do. I suffer from a anxiety disorder so just typing this out has my mind reeling. We have done everything we could, and it has backfired in our faces. The children are still being beaten harshly, just now the boy was screaming in an agonizing way that I've never heard before, because his mother didn't want him to play with his toys, so she hurt him. We can hear everything that happens, sometimes we can catch it on video, but we are not always lucky when it comes to evidence.   The children are constantly neglected, fed ramen noodles because the mother doesn't feel like cooking most of the time, they rarely bathe unless they decide to bathe themselves, they stay shut up in their house all day and night, and they aren't allowed to interact with the rest of my family, they are beaten during the day by the mother, and at night by the father.   Whenever I speak to close friends about it, no one really wants to hear about it, and they just change the subject. I've been seeing a counsellor, but I guess there is only so much the counsellor can say.   We're living in a hostile situation right now, and I'm not sure how to alleviate the problem. I don't know what to do now. If someone can give advice, that would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
Married 14 years with two kids 10 and 12. Weve not gotten along for a few years now, i will save the details for another post.  She has also been withholding sex from me for almost two years now for grudges she holds against me. Shes a stay home mom and i just dont feel she is worth providing for anymore.	Yes
Hey guys! This is gonna be a little lengthy, and I might be all over the place so I apologize ahead of time. So, last July my soontobeex-husband and I decided to seperate. We weren't going to immediately divorce; one of those things that we would see how it goes. Me  and our 3 year old daughter moved home to NC where I started working and getting my life back together. He was sending money every week and we had a pretty loose custody schedule due to our jobs and the costs of going back and forth. In October, I asked for the divorce. After a long time of thinking about it, I decided to go ahead and do it. We're still great friends, and pretty good at coparenting. We discuss everything about our daughter before we do it, and any issues we have are discussed when they occur. In fact, we're better now than we were when we were together! So we decided to file in Kansas. Problem we are running into is we can not find any information about filing and not including the paperwork about child support and custody. We're being pretty chill about it. With us having a 24 hour drive time between eastern NC and central Kansas, trying to budget and make a concrete custody plan doesn't seem feasible, especially since neither one of us are at each other's throat about our time with our daughter. And I don't want him destroyed in child support either. I guess I'm just trying to see of there is a way we can go ahead and get divorced without getting the courts involved in our parenting.  Any advice would be extremely appreciated!	Yes
My ex has court-ordered child support payments that should be deducted from his pay. He moved back to Canada several years ago and was paying, but has stopped and currently is $28K in arrears. There is an order in place in Alberta, but they don't seem to be doing anything to collect, in spite of me giving them his work information and address/phone number. I believe he owns his own business but he may have lost it due to shady practices and not paying his bills. Is there any way, short of hiring a PI, to find out where he is and if he's working somewhere else? I've tried calling the Alberta child support enforcement but they refuse to talk to me, which is extremely frustrating.	Yes
"She got a PFA against him for sexual battery or something along those lines. He was told in the paperwork for the PFA that he isn't allowed to contact her, their kids, or her family members. I don't recall if it said that he can't contact us to inquire about her or just at all.   Well I have been ignoring his texts and calls because I don't want to be involved but I have watched her mother and sister continuously respond to him.   He is very clearly violating the PFA by showing up there and dropping off coloring books for the kids. He texts and calls her. He also thinks that he will be able to return to her when the PFA ends.   Then he is texting her mother asking things like ""is she working today?"" ""Can I come by and see the babies?"" (When she is gone from the house). ""Can I go and mow the lawn?"" And just today he asked if her mother could text her and ask if he could have some money. Her mother has been responding and she said today that he could not because she (his wife) had to pay bills. Then he asked what bills.   Her sister gives him rides to work and gives him pictures of the kid and tells him how they are and such.   My question is, are they breaking the law by doing these things? I have already talked to both of them and told them that they aren't supposed to be doing this because he is violating the PFA.  They insist they want to keep him talking to find out if he has a lawyer and see if he files for divorce or not. Because apparently if he files for divorce first he gets the house and more pick of what he wants??  TL;DR Are you breaking the law by being a line of communication between someone who has a restraining order against them and the person who got the order?"	Yes
I'll get right to it - wife is asking for a divorce, we have 2 children, 2 and 4; we rent a home in TX, she drives a car that's in my name.   What are my rights? Her rights?  She has expressed wanting to move to California with the boys. I'm pretty sure if we get divorced she can't do that.   I know that as the father in this situation it leans way in her favor of custody and child support. Is there any legal possibility that I can maintain custody?  We are both good parents, both good people, no cheating, no abuse physical or verbal.   Her reason for divorce is that she doesn't love me like a wife should and isn't happy - but that I'm still her best friend. I asked to try to fix our marriage and she doesn't want to try. I think her mom has more to do with the reason, also recently divorced (I.e. Last weekend for the 7th time) but that doesn't seem relevant.   I just don't want to lose contact with my two children.   She's asked me to move out, before divorce has been filed, I feel like that would put me in a bad position to then ask for custody of the children.   Not sure what to do; I don't want an ugly divorce, I also don't want to lose my children.   I know this is Reddit - so, Facebook is deleted and Gym membership is in hand - now on to the legal advise.   Thank you,	Yes
I'm self representing right now. My ex got an attorney and asked for a continuance. He was arrested but not charged since it was his first physical, and an apparent minor, offense. I have over 70 pages attached to the restraining order detailing the abuse, however, and the statement I wrote that I was going to say today included more dates of verbal abuse and threats.   I have a few questions.   My local DV legal aid may not be able to represent me due to having so many other cases, but I'm not in the financial situation to get a lawyer otherwise. I have called a few places to see their rates but I'm pretty sure it won't be possible. I'm also 32 weeks pregnant right now, 35 weeks when we go back.   So, my questions are:  - What should I do in order to be completely prepared for what this might consist of if I cannot find an attorney to represent me?   - I've googled and googled and googled. It seems honestly hopeless, but are there other organizations that can help me? (Trying not to name drop. It rhymes with Steve.)   - What should I expect from his attorney, if anything?  - His lawyer offered me a stipulation of a 6m-1y temporary restraining order. I've heard it's not wise to take it. Why?  Thank you in advance.	Yes
"Hello.  I currently reside in California with my long term girlfriend. We've been together for 5 years and have discussed many times that we both do not want children.  She's been on birth control for the past 4 years, and we never had an issue.  Just last week, she told me she was pregnant. Claimed to be the 0.01% miracle that happened even with the birth control. I was skeptical, but stayed calm and collected. We discussed an abortion, but she was completely against it. She explained that she would feel too guilty and wants to go through with the pregnancy.  This rang a few bells in my head.  How can someone, that was so against having children - all of a sudden get knocked up and then calmly proceed to keep the baby without much discussion. It just wasn't adding up.  Yesterday, while she was in the shower, I snooped around her laptop and found a chatlog via a Facebook group chat with her 2 best friends.  In the log.. not only did her friends convince her to have a baby because she might regret it later, but also, managed to plot getting off birth control without my knowledge.  I had never felt such betrayal. In an instance, I started questioning how much I really knew her.   The chat log was so shocking, I couldn't help feel more hurt than angry.  They were all just cheerfully plotting this without my knowledge while laughing their asses off saying stuff like:  ""yeah, he doesn't need to know LOL.""  ""Just do it now, and apologize later. It's no big deal.""  Not only do I not want this kid, but I don't even want to spend another minute with her in a room.  I can no longer be in this relationship, after such a backstab.  I realize now, is the time to be calm and collected but I really have no idea to do.  Do I have any options?  I've read stories about this throughout the internet, and it's terrifying me."	Yes
I'm 17. My parents are divorced and my mom has full custody of me. I'm not in contact with my dad. I'm trying to change my first and middle name, but the judge asked for contact information for my dad and said that he needs to be aware of it. Does this mean that I'm going to have to wait until I'm 18 to change my name?	Yes
Hi, this is taking place in Idaho. I am twenty years old and, for various personal reasons, want to be adopted by my step-dad. Unfortunately, I was told that I would have to notify my biological father to be do this. I haven't seen him since I was 3 because he lost custody. The dude is a giant, abusive cocksucker, and I don't want to see or talk to him again, or bring him back into the picture. I don't want my family involved. I want to cut ties completely and get adopted by my step dad. Please help me find a loophole so I can get adopted without telling him!	Yes
My aunt and uncle, who live in PA, are in their 80s. My uncle has had dementia now for a few years and it has changed his personality and decision making a bit. Recently he has been thinking about paving his driveway, which would cost them quite a bit of money.  This has gotten my aunt worried about my uncle's financial decision making, and she is concerned someone might take advantage of their situation. She was asking me what she should do, but I am really not very knowledgeable about legal stuff. I was hoping maybe someone could provide some advice about what her best options are before she discusses things with a lawyer. Thanks in advance.	Yes
Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	Yes
"I have been divorced for many years.  During the divorce I was ordered to pay my ex $300 a month and he was ordered to refinance and take my name off of the house and loan.  After an extended time of him not doing this I contacted my lawyer and asked why do I keep having to pay and he hasn't done anything he was ordered to do... after me nudging the attorney he finally let the judge know and the nudge put a ""Stay"" on my part of the order where I used to pay the $300 a month.  Years later and he (my ex) still hasn't done anything.  Does this mean years from now if he finally takes care of this I'm going to have to start paying him again while living on Social Security retirement or is there a time limit for someone to complete what a judge has ordered.   Needless to say I did not want to contact my attorney from years past he was worthless and I learned later he doesn't do divorces but only doors court cases for marijuana rights. "	Yes
I am a friend of the wife in question.  I know a little about evictions and stuff from lurking here but this is getting out of control and beyond my scope. Today the wife went to work. Apparently they have been considering divorce and yesyerday husband thought she was cheating cause she said hi to some guy? I don't know. Either way, while she was at work, he served her with custody papers for their child, threw her stuff on the lawn, and kicked her out of the house. He has also gotten violent but not today. I told her to call the cops and that she can't just be kicked out, but this is a hostile environment foe the kids. She is just getting out of work.  Firstly I need to know what to tell her to do about her being kicked out and her stuff thrown out.  Secondly, how does she go about fighting this custody? She is a great mother and in fact works as a teacher at the school her daughter attends. He is doing this simply to try and hurt her. He hasn't even cheated, which is the worst part, she said hi to a work friend.	Yes
Today my wife and I had a hearing regarding my step daughter. The court commissioner said we needed to research the afcc family court review green book. She didn't provide much more detail beyond that. Would anyone know what she is referring to?	Yes
Is it illegal for a parent to ignore consistent physical abuse by one of their children their sibling?  My older brother hits me a lot, and always has. I'm not talking about sibling ruff-housing. He hit me constantly, daily, for any reason, repeatedly. It would leave marks sometimes, and he'd dig his nails into my skin, making me bleed. I fought  back when I was younger but he's very strong and heavy and I was much smaller and weaker. It still happens now, even though he's 21 and I'm 19. It continued from when i was a toddler up until he left for college under my mother's custody of both of us, it happened right in front of her. She never made a significant effort to stop it, never sent him to therapy for his anger problems or anything like that. She'd usually just tell me to not be annoying to him, even though little kids are annoying and he'd hit me for other reasons. I remember getting the lyrics to a song wrong and he punched me.  They have both been emotionally abusive (screaming at me, manipulating me into feeling guilty, etc.) my mother has anger issues as well. I have mental disabilities that are diagnosed and I assume legally recognized (bipolar, stuff like that). I'm not sure if that combination makes things different?  I'd really appreciate any info, thanks.	Yes
I'm  here because I'm not sure if I should pay for a lawyer as of yet.  My wife and I are separated and we have a 3 year child  together. She is Polish and My daughter and I are American born.  I will just get the point of my situation and not get into too much back story. So my wife told me that she was going to Poland to visit her family for two week which I never objected to and I knew the date of her departure and everything seemed fine, I even had a chance to say bye to my daughter at the airport over the phone.  My wife promised that she will call me when she reach there but something seemed unusual,  she kept insisting that she just going to see her family and I just said fine and she just hung up; I found this strange that she was trying convince me of her intentions. At work later that day , I was bother by her last comments when then I got a call from my best friend, I explain to him my situation  and he ask me if I sign a child travel consent form ? I ask him what consent form ? He ask me if my  wife told me that she can't board a plane or leave the US with my daughter without my written consent? I wasn't aware of this and told him that I didn't sign anything.   My friend works for a major Airlines and he told that he will call me back, when he called back he told that he talked to his coworkers and that I should report her for kidnapping of a minor. After seeing this form online and realizing that she forge my signature , I was so mad but  I didn't want to report her yet , if i did she will be arrested and my daughter will be taken away by whatever legal system for whatever length of time. Until now , my wife haven't called or message me since she left for Poland over a week ago . My friend and I think it is best that I wait but it driving my crazy. If there are Lawyers or legal experts  here can I  please get some legal advice on international laws on child abduction and what advantages are in my favor ? Please help! üòî	Yes
Like I wish I was making this crap up.    My mother who has several mental disabilities just dropped it to me that she is trying to run off with some stranger a few states away via plane or train or car. Abandining her apartment and younger son/ might be forcing him to go with her.  The thing is she is currently in trouble with CPS and has other programs like disability and government mental health services.   Is there any way I can keep her from running off? Or at least making it a lot harder for her too.  	Yes
The kids are 9 and 15. Dad has every other weekend plus mutually agreed upon time. Mom is an alcoholic, usually in varying stages of recovery and relapse. She does have a parole officer and a record for beating up Dad.   She had an episode at the beginning of June and the kids have been living with Dad since, every other weekend with Mom. The PO was involved and she was to get treatment, but last i heard she didnt start said treatment until last week. She has a track record of asking for extra money from Dad for the kids or for herself. Sometimes she will take money for the kids and not spend it on them. The little one wanted to do softball in the spring, for instance. Dad gave her money, softball never happened. The little one also has some alarming anger issues (some sexual abuse years ago by the adult child of Dad's then girlfriend), and Mom hasn't kept him in counseling as agreed.   The big kid plans to move in with Dad, so there's bound to be some court in the near future, but what are the chances that Dad could get custody of the little one, too? I've heard that Minnesota is very friendly to Moms in custody cases. Dad isn't perfect by any means; he got a DUI a couple years back, but has no further record. I'm not sure the little one would say he wants to live with Dad (rules and chores and things).	Yes
So my ex wife and I were married in England and moved to Canada. We separated and a year or so later, she moved back to the U.K. with our two sons. She then legally divorced me from the UK and three years later sought to obtain a divorce agreement here in Canada. The resulting Court Order addressed support payments for our children (whilst they are children of the marriage). Since then our eldest son has started University in England, age 20, away from his home, on a three year Bachelors program. I was not consulted on this and simply expected to pay 75% of the fees (approx $15,000 a year) as well as 75% of residence costs (he now rents a home with other student, and I am expected to pay 75% of this. My ex wife also wants me to still pay her support payments in line with guideline table amounts, so that she could contribute her 25% in compliance with the court order that we currently have.  I didn't believe that this was correct, and am about to sit in a DRO meeting in an attempt to mediate a solution to facilitate a revised Order, failing which we will unfortunately end up in a full court hearing. (The DRO meeting will take place in Canada, with my ex wife dialing in).  I find it hard to comprehend how decisions can be made, without conferring with me but I'm expected to pay, pay and pay.  My son is working part time (his schooling takes about 12 hours a week) and he does not currently contribute to his tuition fees or his housing.  Me ex wife lives with her partner (in U.K.), she has recently had a third child with him, works for his businesses and is claiming that she earns very little. She does not pay for the home she currently lives in, so the argument for support to maintain a home for our son, should he choose to come visit in the holidays is, in my opinion, moot.  To add insult to injury, she has destroyed my relationship with my sons by using lies and destructive 'propaganda'. I used to see my sons often and text daily, and now they refuse to speak with me.  I have never shied away from my financial responsibilities to my children and never would,  but at 44 years of age, I need to be able to properly plan for my future, provide for my new family, and repair my relationship with my sons.  I am seeking any advice on the pertinent issues related to paying for education for an adult child, who lives abroad, we were divorced abroad and the rules for support are ordered here in Canada (in the U.K., support stops at 18, no matter the schooling being undertaken). Also in respect of her working for her partner and not showing true earnings, in order to reinforce her argument that I pay a larger portion of the education costs. Final note, I believe she has not paid her 25% of the first years tuition, and simply had my son take a student loan to top up the 75% that I have paid.  Sorry this is convoluted, I'm typing on my phone. Any further factual information required to provide advice, please let me know. I love my kids dearly and the ongoing dispute and the resulting damage it has had on my relationship is incredibly hurtful and is affecting my current relationship due to the stresses involved. Any advice is truly appreciated.  Thank you!	Yes
Divorce with the ex was final almost two years ago, but there is no official custody agreement as I filed in Colorado, and she and daughter live in Massachusetts. Fiance and I have agreed that we want to try to get custody (we will be married soon, that should help). Daughter has said that she wants to live with us. What steps do we need to take? Should we get a family law attorney in Massachusetts, since that is where she currently lives? Any idea how much something like that would cost? Totally out of my wheelhouse with this so any advice is appreciated.	Yes
So, long story short, my family is and always has been dysfunctional. My sister has serious mental illnesses that she refuses to take medication for. She has been in trouble with CPS multiple times. One of my nieces had been living with her biological father, whom had apparently been abusing her. CPS came to get her on 7/20 and now no one knows where she is (I was only told about this a couple of days ago!) I don't know if my sister has any custody or if CPS would have placed her there at all. I haven't spoken in over two years, and either way she hasn't answered me at all if my niece is there or not.   So my question is, how do I go about trying for custody? Am I even eligible? Who do I call to even inquire about this? CPS? A lawyer? My niece wasn't treated well at my sister's house either and I'm finally in a place where I can take her in. I just want her to be safe.	Yes
"My SOs (he's the father and shares equal custody with the mother) daughter (9 y/o) is in and out of the hospital. The maternal grandparents like to butt in and force themselves into her hospital room ""for support"". However they are incapable of being civil to SO, which causes stress and discomfort to his daughter. They are openly rude and disrespectful, even with the daughter watching.  Ex wife is a doormat and lets them do whatever they want. Can my SO ban them from visiting if they cannot be civil? Even if his ex wife consents to them visiting?"	Yes
Basically, my sister has a dangerous lifestyle. She into doing crazy mountain climbing challenges. She has two sons, and the children's father have died doing the exact same thing. Losing her is a reality that I worry about. I also worry about my nephews who I can't abandon if something happens to my sister.  Can I take a life insurance policy with myself as the beneficiary in case she died, so that I have the means to take care of her children? I'm assuming the premiums will be high due to her lifestyle but it's a small price to at least not having to worry about the financial aspects of her getting herself killed and leaving her children with nothing.  We live in Montana.	Yes
Long story short, me and my family are very happy. I have two stepsons that i love very much. They both have abandonment issues and I would love to adopt them, and they have brought the issue up themselves without provocation. One father is in jail for attempted murder and won't be out until my son is an adult. And the other's father abandoned him at birth and has not seen him or paid a penny in child support. I have spoken with both fathers, they both are very appreciative of my raising their sons but neither will go so far as to signing adoption papers.	Yes
I am a Korean American and my wife is a Russian citizen. We have a lawyer who filed all the paper work for us. But we are assuming she bailed on us after putting our paperwork through because she is not replying to any of our messages and phone calls.   We received a date for an interview with UCIS at the end of this month; we also agreed to pay her 500 dollars to come with us to the interview. Could we pay another lawyer to come with us even though another lawyer filled out the paperwork? Do we even need one? If so, how can we determine if we found a good lawyer? How can we determine if the price they ask for is fair?  Just to add to the background information. She overstayed her student visa date by a few years and planned on moving back to Russia in the future. We fell in love/dated for one year and I proposed to her. We both have pretty bad social anxiety so we decided to married in the probate court instead of having a traditional ceromony. Our finances are intertwined and we also have a general outline of a plan for our future together. Due to my low income my mother cosigned on our UCIS paprwork and occasionally helps us financally.   Thank you for your help  - hun and irina	Yes
My wife surprised me with getting an apartment, telling me she wants to get a divorce, and that she will no longer pay bills.  I can barely afford them all on my own (make about 60% of our combined income).  She wants full access to the house to get things and says I have no right to privacy bc her name is still on the house.  Obviously there's no way I can refinance it in just my name as I can barely get by.  On top of this, she took my son and wants me to have him every weekend.  I'm worried that if I try to keep the house there is no way I'll be able to help with his expenses.	Yes
Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I need help in a big way. It's a complicated story between me and my wife and children, but, I'm trying my hardest to remain in the relationship and I got us into counseling because I want to save the marriage. But I am not sure if I can deal with the abuse (pretty severe emotional abuse I believe is from a depression from past experiences) and so therefore I want to ask this question as a means of protecting myself should the worst happen. I put that out there as the background but don't want to get too into personal details about it and detract from the real question, which is how to sell a home I recently inherited but keep it separate from our joint marital assets in NYC.  I became 25% owner of a two family house, within an LLC, about 10 years ago in NYS, and became full owner after my mother died in 2017. I am now sole owner of the LLC and there is nothing else within the LLC outside of this 2 family home. I am interested in selling this this home within the next few months because it is a lot of work to maintain it, I have zero experience in home ownership and the place needs repairs, and each month it costs money which we don't have. I could manage to hold onto it and rent out both units, but really my wife wants to move into a better school zone for our children. Given all this, we are both interested in selling in the next 6 months. it's taken too much time and money from us.  My wife and I are going through hard times and I am not sure if we will stay together. I hope we do but I want to protect myself. As I understand it, since the property and LLC came to me through inheritance, it is not part of the marital assets that gets divided with my wife should we divorce. However, if I do sell it I believe it can become co-mingled and become part of the martial assets that can be divided with my wife. I don't want it to be co-mingled and I would like to figure out what to do to keep this separated from our joint martial assets. Are people here familiar with this at all? What is the best way to structure the sale so that it remains with me and separate from the martial assets should we divorce? I heard that if I sell it I can keep the money from the sale in a separate bank account, not co-mingled in a joint account, as a way of keeping it separate, but I am not sure if this is true. Someone mentioned something about a trust to me but I had no idea what that meant and if they were accurate. I want to see what other options there may be. thank you very much for any help.	Yes
"I am 19 years old and living with my 61 year old disabled aunt. Also living with us is my 30 year old cousin (let's call her Kayla) and her long term boyfriend. Kayla is living here under the title 'caregiver' under section 8. Her boyfriend is not supposed to be here, section 8 is not aware of him living here. Kayla has threatened/blackmailed my aunt that she will report her to section 8.  Anyway, Kayla and her boyfriend are supposed to leave by the end of the month. My aunt said if they're not gone by August 1st she will call the police on them. The housing manager also did give them a 10 day notice last week.  Just today my aunt noticed they had put a lock on their bedroom door without permission. Days before they're supposed to be gone. Also I don't see them packing... what are the laws about adding locks without the head of house approving?  Another thing I wanted to mention is I thought about reporting my cousin for vulnerable adult abuse. My aunt has done so many favors for them, including letting them live with her for very cheap. They never pay rent on time, they haven't paid the last two months rent I believe. They have stolen $160 worth of narcotic pain pills for my aunt, her weed, her cigarettes, and tons of food. They told her ""your food is yours, ours is ours"" and constantly eat her food, then lie about it.   They have argued and yelled and caused her so much stress. She has been trying to quit smoking but can't, she gets hives from the stress. She can't sleep most nights. She can't wait for them to leave. I feel like they do use and manipulate her for money and things/favors, especially since she's lonely after her mom died a year ago. Should I report this? Is there any point since Kayla is about to move out?"	Yes
So a quick bit of background - I suffer from depression and back in February I overdosed. I was in hospital in a coma for a few weeks, was then sent to a psych ward for evaluation, and was released after a few days.  During this time my ex illegally entered my home, took my phone, and illegally went through messages, finding one from a random friend along if I knew anyone selling ecstasy - I have not yet pressed charges against her.  After this she then went to court to have my access to my son removed (using the depression and drug message as the reason).  Since then I've been forced to only have supervised visitations, had a physiological evaluation (three times technically, one from the hospital where I was released, once from my normal psychiatrist who actually said that drugs were not needed, and then from the court approved psychiatrist), and drug test.  No problems with any, in fact she's been the one late to visitations and had tried to get out of some.  We're now, at long last, just about to go to court to have this settled, and suddenly she wants to have a deposition. She's also suddenly demanded my financial information for the past five years, including all pay stubs and bank statements (something that I just don't have and couldn't easily get) - child support is taken out of my cheques automatically in any case.  She also initially put this demand forward for next week, without any discussion with my lawyer to see if the time would work or anything.  Honestly to me this feels like she's just trying to put insane new hurdles up, trying to push back the court date, forcing me to continue to have extremely restricted access to my son, and force me to pay even more money that I simply don't have.  But I'm also not an expert so wanted to see what you all thought about this.   I should add that currently my lawyer is away. I did talk to her assistant who is also honestly confused about why she would be asking for this now.	Yes
I am recently divorced, I have to take him to court over the stupidest things to get him to do. I couldn't get my old tax returns without a long process from the IRS because he denied me access to the info I needed, so we went to court and judge ordered him to give it to me. We had agreed that since we were married all of last year and only separated in August, that we would still file jointly, and then do it separate after that. I am 99% sure he has already filed for last year, but I never saw it and I never signed it. He also hasn't given me my portion of the tax return. Is it fair that I am only supposed to get a third of that tax return? And what can i do to find out if he has already filed? The IRS is a NIGHTMARE to deal with. I can't talk to a person to save my life.	Yes
This is an extremely long story so I'm getting to the point. My girlfriend went to the police because of her mostly emotionally abusive mother who drinks every night and takes her anger out on my girlfriend. The police did not do anything except force my gf back in the house with her mother. They took her to a different town, took all her forms of communication, her mom left her with an aunt (very sketchy about how this all went down and I can elaborate if needed), and her friends and I have all agreed she's in danger. The issue is that the family has turned against her and would deny everything, we have a lot of proof of what's going on at home, but at the moment we just need to get her out of her aunts house. We don't actually know if she's there or what's happening because she can't contact anyone. She's 17 years old, and we live in Nebraska. What is going to be the fastest and most full proof way to get her out? We have screenshots of her saying depressing and suicidal things since she arrived there. Any help appreciated.. we are in deep need of help because her family knows the law pretty well. We have proof of her Guardian being unfit and plan on showing that, but we  we are scared for her at this moment and need a way to get her out.	Yes
I'm posting this on behalf of my girlfriend to find some answers. My girlfriend (23) is a single mother of a 3 (almost 4) year old. Her daughters father went to prison a few months before she was born (Child Sex Offender). He's now being released fairly early cause of a new law in California to let non-violent criminals out, something along those lines. My girlfriend didn't look for any government assistance or legal help during these 4 years. She's received no financial support from her baby daddy or his family and raised her daughter on her own with help from her own family. The father isn't even on the birth certificate.   It's tough for her right now. She has 2 jobs but doesn't make nearly as  close to what she needs. Her parents don't financially assist her aside from helping her pay for insurance. Now her baby daddy's family is buying him a house and car when he gets out of prison. She freaking out cause she has a car payment, credit card payment, rent, etc. while trying to support her daughter working minimum wage at 1 job and works event scheduling at the other. So fairly inconsistent.   I always tried pushing her to find legal advice, but she terrible looking for help, especially with this situation. Her baby daddy's mom promised to send money her way for support but never did. Now with him getting out of prison, she wants to take action against him. I can go a bit more in depth if needed.	Yes
(Ontario-Family law) Childs father lives out of province and hasnt seen child for almost 4 years( child was only 15months old when he last seen her and shes 5 now). Well after 3 long years of court they ruled in my favor for child support and now he wants access. Do i have to give him access? Does he have a chance of winning if we go for a custody battle? 	Yes
He plead no contest.  I haven't seen him outside of court for 18 months.  He made a lot of false claims on the application. 	Yes
"My grandma owns her home and has lived there for 25 years.  she was admitted to the hospital 1 week ago because she had a minor stroke. She recovered completely in the hospital and was told she could go home monday (today the 17th). However before leaving she was given a psyche evaluation, that said she had 'minor dementia' even at 96 she is alert, can understand, and can speak for herself, we've never had any problems getting her to understand something or to tell us what she wants, except she is hard of hearing and can't see very well. She is quick and sharp as a tack though.  When her daughter heard this who has the power of attorney pushed to have her taken out of her home and put into a care center. When i walked into the hospital today to pick up my grandma she was crying because she wanted to go home and they wont let her, because the power of attorney daughter insists she goes to an ""Assisted Living Center"" I've been living with my grandma for years taking care of her and she can say for herself ""I want to go home and i want my grandson to take care of me"" but even though she can say that and understand she is being taken away, and the daughter's true goal of selling her house is in reach.  Is there anything i can do to help protect my grandma's interests and what's best for her? even though her daughter has power of attorney? Do i need to get another doctor to test her to see if she can make decisions for herself? She is stubborn but very kinda, and is adamant about what she wants and her daughter the POA is ignoring it completely. and my grandma even said she regrets making her the POA and would make me it instead if she could."	Yes
"As the title says, I have no lawyer since I cannot afford it. I can't get any pro bono help since I do not live in Louisiana anymore(I live in Michigan), which seems to be a prerequisite for all the lawyers I've talked to down there. How can I go about fighting this?   Some details: My ex is claiming I haven't had contact with my son in 6 months, a lie which our phone records will show. The subpoena came in the mail 2 weeks before the court date. I scrambled getting together money, transportation and days off work and made it. The judge said I wasn't given enough time to prepare and pushed the trial date back 2 months. I tried asking him some questions about my options and he replied ""I'm not your lawyer.""   I believe I have a good case against the adoption, which would mean losing my all my parental rights, but feel totally overwhelmed by the court system. Can anyone give me some advice?"	Yes
Throwaway account here, if only because the obvious sensitive nature of the topic and I don't wish to air someone's dirty laundry in a way that could link to them.   My wife and I have a happy marriage and a 6 year old son, and her parents live with us in our home in Texas. Due to some medical issues that should have kept ANY kids from being possible, my wife had to have a hysterectomy at a relatively early age. We always wanted to adopt a second child and recently have been doing the research on what the requirements are in our state. One of the requirements,  of course,  is a background check for everyone in the family (I'm not sure if they mean just in the house or everyone genetically linked to you), which makes sense. But it raises my worry about something.   My father in law is a convicted sex offender. Now, I mean that legally speaking in that he has to go and register his location and all that,  but my wife told me this early on in our relationship. According to my wife's family he was caught up in this witch hunt back in the early 90's with these two kids who lied about a whole bunch of shit and he decided to take a plea deal instead of dragging his family through the hell of a trial. Not the choice I would have made but it is what it is and I don't know what I'd have done under those circumstances.   I believed my wife and her family when this was told to me years ago,  and after being around the man for almost 7 years I haven't had a single moment to the contrary to shake that. He may have his flaws,  but if I thought he had ever touched kids like that I wouldn't let him live in the same roof as my son. The issue is this: would his status on the registry prevent my wife and I from being able to adopt as long as they live with us, if at all?  Thanks.	Yes
Located in Canada, Ontario, they're about 25 living with their father (friend is separate, living with their mom.) They have diabetes that they hardly treat, a failed kidney (Getting dialysis often) and a serious infection in their leg that may need to be amputated. The father is hardly doing anything to help them, and actively hurting their health (going out for fast food when instructed to have a 0 sodium diet, not making sure they're taking insulin / other medications, letting the infection develop to the point of amputation being considered) they're slowly dying and it's tearing my friend up. We spoke to a lawyer previously and we essentially told that they're an adult who is responsible for their own choices and that there was nothing we could do to help get them treated.   Can I get a second opinion? Is there anything we can legally do to get them proper treatment?	Yes
Hi Reddit,  Sorry if this is lengthily there is a lot of background info. I live with my boyfriend and he has a 5yr old from a previous relationship. Last September it was discovered that the bio-mom's boyfriend was beating up the son and the mom was aware of it and also admitted to being complacent in the abuse. The DA refused to press charges saying that these cases are hard to get a convection on. The son was taken away from his mother and my boyfriend had sole physical custody for a period of two months. Then CPS agreed that the mother should get visitation rights and set out other guidelines she needed to follow. Note my boyfriend still has full legal custody.  The mother was told she had to attend parenting classes, attend personal therapy. That the cps agent would be doing monthly home inspections. She still lives with her parents, and that cps would meet with her once a month to check in. They went to court in February and the mother had done nothing. CPS recommended giving my boyfriend sole physical custody and determined she was an unfit mother. The court overruled that and gave her an extension to start the program. My boyfriend was obviously upset and tried to appeal but CPS told him they would follow up and ensure she was doing the things and that there would be home visits.  Since the last court date there is a new CPS worker and she is terrible. The son disclosed to my boyfriend that his mom was still dating his abuser and my boyfriend reported that to cps since it was violating court orders. CPS worker said there was no way to confirm it. A couple weeks ago when I was babysitting the boy he told me how if he doesn't listen his mom will hit him and that his grandpa beats him with a wooden spoon if he doesn't listen. I told this to cps &amp; put her supervisor on the email and never got a response. Also almost fot the whole month of June the mother refused to pick up her son at the scheduled times: while we obviously didn't mind the extra time my boyfriend had his lawyer file a complaint so it would be on the record. In response to this the CPS worker told my boyfriend he needs to take co-parenting classes to learn how to negotiate with his ex better.   They go to court in two weeks for another check in and today his ex sent him part of an email exchange she had with the worker asking some questions but the earlier part of the exchange is the worker and his ex talking about her getting more custody and some tax stuff which is not even in CPS' jurisdiction.   My boyfriend and I are very upset about this, not just that his son could end up spending more time with an abusive parent but simple because the worker has been in communication with the mom while ignoring any communication we've had. So my question is is there someone else to bring this up with outside if cps? Or should we have the lawyer bring it up in court? Also neither of us has dealt with CPS before so is there a way to appeal A decision from them?  Thanks!	Yes
"He had previously opened a bank account in her name before, as well as accounts in my other two children's names (previous marriage, not his children). My lawyer advised me to close the accounts with his name on them and open new ones in my name. He was supposed to be putting their Christmas money into the accounts and when I went to close them I found that he never did so. He's in a financial hole and so I do not trust what he may do with her SS number. I am the primary custodial parent. What rights does he have to this information? Can I deny his reauest based on his history of stealing money from the children? He also claims he needs it for health insurance but child support enforcement is handling her medical support through him and have advised me not to give him the number. I've tried contacting my lawyer but he has not returned my call and meanwhile her noncustodial father (only granted supervised visitation for now) keeps hounding me to give it to him ""because reasons"" which just sounds suspicious to me. If he is legally entitled to it then I will comply with the law. I just need to know if he is or not in this situation. Thank you."	Yes
Hello, broke up with my ex girlfriend in January after finding out she was addicted to opioids and cocaine. We have a daughter together who is now four years old. Found out of her addiction when money started going missing and finding valuables missing. After a confrontation she admitted to me and her problem. I found my own place to live and have had my daughter under my care since. She attended a short rehab in January. She went on to show no interest in being a mother and my daughter showed no interest in seeing or asking for her. She entered another rehab in April which last 60 days. She has since been out and is showing all signs that she is back on her drug. Money missing around her parents house (where she stays) she is up all night. Lies about her money and claims to never get paid. She demands to see our daughter and threatens to call the police and have her escorted to have her picked up. She told me over the phone she wanted to kill herself. I guess what I want to inquire about is what are my rights as a father as I am going to pursue legal action. She told me if I go that route she will keep our daughter from me the whole time until a judge decides. That is the only way I believe this will get settled but I am in deep fear for my daughters safety and well being while going through this process. Is there any way to ensure she is under my custody while this process unfolds given the circumstances of the past 8 months?	Yes
"My sister (27) has two kids (ages 2 and 4) with the same man (31).  She's been living with him for five years now, but things are looking like they're trending towards a breakup.  Her boyfriend earns his money under the table and doesn't have a declared income.  He has encouraged her to pretend that she is living alone and doesn't know where he is whenever she applies for any sort of government assistance (I'm not sure exactly what she's done, I do know she got some help with preschool funding, for example).  He's encouraged her to do this as he doesn't want anyone coming after him for child support and she has agreed because, as they were living together, he was already (nominally) contributing to raising them.  Now that their relationship is ending, my sister is looking to leave, however, he is threatening to report her to the government for lying on those forms if she does.  He says their kids will get taken away from her and that she'll go to prison.  He has various bits of documentation (bills paid from the same house, photos of them together, etc.) that he's planning on using as proof.  I've encouraged her to speak to a lawyer, but she's too afraid to do so.  I'd really like to encourage her to leave him.  He's abusive and neglectful (he makes her pay for all of the food, clothes, etc. for the kids because they're ""her problem,"" verbally abusive, might be physical I'm not sure), there's a lot I'm leaving out of this to keep this story from being easily identifiable.  However, I can't advise her on this issue because, frankly, I don't know if his threats hold water.  I'm sorry for being so vague, but can anyone give me an idea regarding what the consequences might be for lying on government assistance forms like that?  Would pointing out that she was in an abusive relationship and essentially coerced into it help at all?  Thanks, I'll answer any questions as best I can."	Yes
"Im being asked to sign a custody agreement. Im being told that I can bring this matter back to the court in a year. However, in big bold letters and a lager font than the rest of the document it reads ""THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO REVOCATION"" under that it says As part of the consideration herein, tge parties acknowledge that this agreement is binding and not subject to revocation.   My ex whom im having a hard time trusting said that was put in for me, so visitation can never be withheld.  can someone please help me understand if i sign this agreement, would I be able to change it in 12 mos?"

I'm 24 years old and just completed my degree with a job lined up in a few months. My other brother is out of the house. However, I came back home and discovered my parents on the brink of divorce. I've been living here for a month and got to see all what's happening first hand.  My father is a narcissist who completely controls my Mom and she is reaching her breaking point. He controls everything: money, who she can talk to, expecting every meal perfect, etc. He is a narcissist and will use any opportunity to make people feel sympathy for him.  My mother is hesitant about going through with divorce because she is a stay at home mom for over 30 years. She doesn't have the money to pay for a lawyer. This is seriously the only thing that's holding her back. It's devastating to watch her because the psychological fear has taken a physical, stressful toll on her well being and I'm super concerned.   What should we do?	Yes
"A friend of mine was born in Mexico and became a US Citizen at age twenty-something. He still has nationality in his country of birth (Mexico). He does not Mexican IDs...whatsoever. His name now (after naturalization) is different than the one on his birth certificate (Certificate: First Name Paternal Last Name Maternal Last Name | Current: First Name Last Name Suffix).  For some reason or another, he had to get a Mexican ID as the government entity in Mexico which requested an ID does not accept his American passport.  When he went to get a Mexican ID (voter card) at the Mexican consulate in the US the clerk registered the name as First Paternal Maternal as it is on the birth certificate. When asked to verify all the information was accurate my friend noted the issue and requested it be resolved to which the response from the clerk was ""in Mexico, you will forever be First Paternal Maternal.""  Did the clerk just change someone's name? Does anyone know how that works?"	Yes
"Let me give you a backstory so maybe you can give me solid advice..  I got pregnant and we split up within days of finding out. When I delivered, the father was there and has been apart of her life ever since. I have always been pro 50/50, ALWAYS! From birth-6 months, he got her two days a week after work for about 4 hours (5-9pm), and one full day on the weekend. From 6months-One year, he remained with that schedule with the exception of keeping her overnight on the weekend visitation. When she turned a year old, I agreed to 50/50 although there was no legal agreement in place. He got her twice a week overnight, and one night on the weekend (3 overnights/week). Like I said, I have always been pro 50/50.   Well.. He started cancelling his nights with our daughter for ""work related issues"". Now some of those cancellations were indeed because of work, but some of them were an excuse so he could go out to the bar, attend a party, or go on dates. I have documentation and proof of all of this. He was also taking a week off here and there to go out of state for work. I was getting a little frustrated because even though I agreed to 50/50, I was still taking on FULL PARENTING RESPONSIBILITY, on his time and mine. I thought it was best to revert to our original schedule for those purposes. He got angry of course.. and now we have a court date in a few weeks.   To be clear: the schedule interference is not the only issue with 50/50. Every time our child gets sick and cannot go to daycare, he refuses to take of work, so i end up taking days off of work, and caring for her. She has been to the doctor 24 times in her life, and he was not present (or refused) to go to all appointments except for one. I took her to the other 23. He also has cut back on my child support severely, so he could cover daycare. I receive $200/month now. While she is on HIS time, she is in daycare a total of 11 hours on his days, whereas she is only there for 5-6 hour on mine.   He also has 2 DWI's, (one was expunged and the other he is continually getting continuances on to drop to a lesser charge.. that's the way he works). He also had a DWI on base in the navy that resulted in a dishonorable discharge.. but since he had already requested to leave the military before that incident, he somehow talked his way into it being changed to an honorable one. I also have documentation of him medicating himself at night when he has our daughter.. so he can sleep through the night and her cries when she's hungry.   Now, we are set to battle it out in court, which is the saddest thing of all. He filed first wanting 50/50 with me remaining domicile. Well when I filed my answer, he got pissed to say the least. Out of spite, he then filed that he wants domicile. And he just returned to the country from a 7-day vacation out of country. Which FUELS MY FIRE, because he can miss work and use those vacation days for his enjoyment, but not take on the parental duties of caring for her when she cannot go to daycare.  To say the least, I am frightened. What are my chances here? I absolutely want her to maintain a healthy relationship with her father, and I was thinking about an every other weekend schedule for him that includes every other Wednesday night. He is adamant about 50/50."	Yes
Hi. I'm 18 years old and I would prefer to switch from both parents for a week at a time to one parent permanently. Are there any legal repercussions and how should I go about this?	Yes
Hello.  I think this is a simple question; just trying to work through language on a support agreement with my husband and his ex to make sure we do our fair part.  he and his ex  split the costs of dental coverage 50/50, per their support agreement. They decided to use ex's insurance since benefit was slightly higher.  She told him the cost to add the 2 kids is $63/mo.   Rates show something like this:  Insured (ex): no charge Insured + 1 dependent: $50 Insured + family: $63  Ex has a new husband and another son covered on the plan.   How much should my husband be paying for his 2 kids (@ 50%). Ex insists half of $63 is HIS portion, making him subsidize her husband and son, as they are covered, too.	Yes
I broke up with my emotionally abusive, sometimes physically abusive ex. I found out he had been recording me with a motion activated hidden camera pointed right at the bed. (I've contacted a couple of the girls in the videos and none of them care. They were more interested in telling me how much better they were than me. Can the police not contact them because I feel like they'll undermine this case?) I wanted to go to the police when I first found them, but my ex and his family basically told me if I did, they'd go after my family(I don't know what that means, but my ex has threatened to shoot my family. I've asked his parents to take his gun away, but they haven't said anything.) This is where it gets weird. They told me how close they are to 2 former Presidents and how they'll be forced to get involved in this mess. I know they're not lying because I've seen pictures of them with a couple Presidents and politicians. Everyone in his family is a lawyer. Any advice on what I can do? How should I handle something like this?	Yes
I want to make sure he doesn't kidnap our children or kill me. I only have joint money, no job but I need to leave for our safety.	Yes
"Hi everyone, thank you in advance for any help you can provide.  My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.  She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was ""acting like a slut"" and ""dressing inappropriately"" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent ""promiscuity"". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.  I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because ""[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.""  I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a ""you're starting high school"" gift, and thought it best to wait.  I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again. I'm so angry right now I cannot think straight, and she's taking a nap. What do I need to do? Who do I need to call?"	Yes
"My 92 year old grandmother is currently decaying away in her home losing her mind. She has been injured various times but plays it off with insane excuses. She is clearly not mentally fit to be all on her own.  Currently she is in the ""care"" of my aunt, in which her daughter forced her so that she controls all my grandmother's finances. Right now the aunt does nothing at all, and worsens my grandmother's physical state.  In general the aunt is a big obstacle.  What can I do to help this situation? Ideally I'd want my grandmother to move in with me so I can actually take care of her but im unsure if my aunt would let that happen. It's come to the point where the aunt drains her pension each month not even leaving her enough for groceries.  Legally what are my options, alternatively i'd want her in an old folks home."	Yes
He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.   He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there.   Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday.   What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.   TL:DR; Will trying for a green card marriage as a US citizen hurt the fact that I haven't been working legally (according to the IRS)?	Yes
"Sorry I've never poster in this sub so not sure if this is the right place.  My wife and I use to work together at the same small company years ago. I left there about 3 years ago for another job and my wife still works there. The company owner is a nice person but he used to do some subtle shady shit that made me think he was scamming people. A decade ago he asked me to photoshop and change some information on a contract that had already been signed by someone. Other weird things.  Anyways.  My wife calls me the other day to tell me what had happened at work that day. Her and another co-worker were trying to remember the owner's middle name because he was really embarrassed of it and they thought it would be funny to put it on some gag gift, so they started googling his name to see if it would pull up. On the first page of results, it showed some marriage records stating that the owner had just gotten married in 2006. Um thats weird. Owner, has been married to his wife since the early 90's. They even have two kids in college. Everybody at that office knows his wife (who is a financial planner) and she is very active at office events and friendly to everybody. Some of the older employees even went to their wedding in the 90's. She is very sweet and they are very loving to each other and don't seem to have any major problems in their marriage.   Scrolling down in the google results she finds divorce records for them in about the year 2000. My wife's co-worker starts to remember that years back, when she would check the office mail, that the owner would receive child support payment notices and she never really thought about it at the time. Everybody in this office is very close and would know if the owner had divorced his wife and remarried to her years later. My wife brought this info to her manager who has been an employee there since the owner started the company. She had been at their wedding in the 90's. She had house sat for them during this time they would have been divorced. Me and my wife even house sat for them while they would have been divorced. My wife's manager was weirded out about this whole thing and told her to delete her search history and not bring it up to anyone else.  So to get to my point: We are pretty sure the owner of this company and his wife (who is a financial planner at a large financial company) officially divorced on paper, kept living together telling no one, the owner paid child support to his ""ex"" wife to keep up appearances, and then secretly re-married on paper years later telling no one.   Is this some sort of tax scam? How could someone benefit from being legally divorced on paper from their spouse while still actually being married to each other and then secretly re-marry years later? I can try to get more details if it helps solve this mystery. Thanks"	Yes
"I'm 46, born and raised in the Bay Area of Northern California and now living in Omaha, Nebraska. My mother had me at 18 as an unwed mother. My biological father has denied parentage (left the state when he found out he knocked up my mom). Then I was adopted by the man my mom married when I was 1 year old. He and my mom separated when I was 15. My adoptive father and I became estranged almost 30 years ago and haven't spoken.   I did have one dinner with my bio-father when I was 21 and no contact since then. I was able to find my half siblings that he had after me on Facebook and my one brother verifies that some family members have verified that I ""exist"". My youngest half sister has listened to family members that say that I was only contacting the kids because I am a gold digger ... She won't speak to me. I am not a gold digger, but, rumor has it that both my biological father and my adoptive father have made out very well over the years in California real estate. From time to time I wonder if I will ever see a dime of inheritance from either one, and if I have any legal grounds if I'm not named in any wills... I have had abandonment and attachment disorder issues throughout my life relating to male abandonment stemming from these ""fathers"" leaving me at formative places in my life... Money doesn't solve those problems, but, it wouldn't be a horrible thing to have, maybe buy a house, have some financial security in my lifetime..."	Yes
"Long story short but I video taped my wife and I having sex and sent it to her via Facebook messengers secret conversation. The video was 15 seconds long and she now claims that she was not a willing participant in the taping. Felony charges have been filled but I haven't actually been charged or arrested yet. I should know more in the next day or so. Needless to say I have an appointment with a divorce attorney first thing tomorrow morning. What are the chances that I will be charged and convicted of this and what does my sentence look like? I have no proof that she was a willing participant and there are plenty of texts saying ""I'm sorry. I thought you knew"" so it looks really bad on me.   I'm sure to be a nervous wreck over the next couple of days. "	Yes
Good day /r/legaladvice!  I desperately seek advice in family law. My 'boy'friend had a girlfriend last year who - when he wanted to leave her - stopped taking the pill and got pregnant without telling him early on so then she couldn't have an abortion. Fast forward to today - she got the baby and he still lives extremely unhappy at her place not knowing what he should do, as this is also a financial matter for him. So to this point they are not really together anymore but he just keeps things up as they are - he has his own room in her apartment and also takes care of his baby. Now this takes place in switzerland where we have a law since this year that men don't only need to pay for the kid but also for the kid's mother even if they were not married before. Now for what she has done to him (and even more in the past) he doesn't want to pay money for her but only for his kid. Also because she works currently 60% and still earns more than he does when he works 100%. She could be completely self sustainable. Now she told him, if he leaves her for real, she will stop working just so he will have to pay her shitloads of money. He is now completely devastated and doesn't know how he wouldn't also become financially ruined by her.  Now I had this idea and I don't know if it would work and here I need your advice. I just bought an apartment and therefore I basically have a debt of 800'000$ - and as he and I anyway want to be together in case he manages to finally leave that place, I thought I could bring my 800'000$ debt into more use.  Now if I would let him join my debt, would he still have to pay her or could he get out like that? I mean he would probably not be able to get a loan after she would go after his money, but if he joins my debt before she has the chance to do so, he wouldn't be able to pay her aswell?  Or do you have any other idea what a guy could do to save himself from a corrupt girlfriend like this?  Also, what happens if he would leave, but gets at one point a new family. Will this reduce the payments to his current girlfriend because he needs more money to sustain his own family?	Yes
[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ltnlk/alms_child_endangerment_case_trying_to_obtain/)  We contacted a MS lawyer and CPS. The lawyer basically said that unless both parents agree to sign over custody, that it would be a long drawn-out battle, and we still probably wouldn't be able to get custody unless we could prove both parents were unfit. We contacted the father and offered to take over custody if he needs us to, but we will support him regardless. He was appreciative, but wants to do it on his own. The b/f who did all this has been arrested, and charges are pending against the mother. CPS knows about the issues with the father and is keeping a very close eye on his actions for the next 30 days. The CPS agent I talked to first is keeping close contact with us in case things go south with the father. We're just glad the child is doing much better and the people who abused him have been arrested.	Yes
My wife recently filed charges on me and dropped them today after she realized they were felony charges. We are going through a divorce and she is now threatening to bring the charges back up if I don't agree to her terms of divorce. Can they be brought back up? 	Yes
State: North Carolina  As the title says my mother is having her children taken away from her, she has 6 children I am the oldest (23) so I no longer live with her. I have two brothers and three sisters ages range from 2-14. My mother, Stepfather (were divorced years ago but live together for kids) and his mother all lived in the same house. A month or so after my stepfathers mother died my stepfather has taken it upon himself to give my siblings to my grandmother (mothers side) and he is planning to pay no more bills on the house they've paid upwards of $100,000 on and is letting it be foreclosed upon and he simply wants to move into his place of business and drink/smoke the rest of his life away (Age 70), this is ruining our family, my mother was told to find somewhere else to stay which would put her and my two year old sister on the streets. (She was born after divorce, different father) My mother cared for my stepdads mother for months before she passed away (was 92) taking her to Dr visits, bathing her, feeding her, cleaning her room, washing her clothes and linens ETC, and now that she has passed my stepfather is basically self destructing claiming he will let house be foreclosed on (It is his own house that was handed down to him after his mother passed) and is separating my siblings apart by letting them stay with my grandmother, when my mother and stepdad were divorced he won custody but she retained her parental right. My grandmother moved in to assist with my siblings when my mother moved out. After 2 years my mother moved back in  to care for his mother and my grandmother moved out.   My siblings went and stayed with my grandmother for the weekend (as they normally do), when they all left on Friday my mother was told that she would bring them back Tuesday, well, that turned into two weeks and about 50 missed phone calls from my mother to my grandmother, when she finally got in contact with her she was told they  were living there now. This was all done behind my mother and my back, we were completely unaware that my stepfather/grandmother were planning this.   Is there anything at all my mother can do to keep her children (take them back from my grandmother) and continue living there? If not living there just get her children back?     My mom does not have money for a lawyer and is really side  swiped by all of this as we didn't see any of this coming.  I really do not know what to do to help her so I'm posting here, Thank you so much to whomever can give me some advice.	Yes
"My sister's husband received his fifth DUI about a month ago while working out of town in Wisconsin. The court has ruled that he has to return to WI to serve time in September for six months to a year. This is his second time in jail and it has left him bitter and unpredictable towards my sister.  Last Friday night, he took the two kids to his parents house and refused to return them. He told my sister she could not have them and would not give her the gate code. She ended up calling the police and they told her since they were not separated, they could not bring the children back. This was the first time she ever called them because she feared that he  was lying and attempting to run off with them. When she let them know that he was an alcoholic about to go to jail, they told her they would investigate and if he had alcohol on him then they would call CPS to bring the kids back. Except, the police told him they were coming to check on him so he and his family hid any alcohol before they got there. The next day when he finally came back with the children, the oldest told my sister that his father had been drunk all night. He and his family claims my sister is ""crazy"" and that the police agreed. Now we fear that if the police truly said that then we have no help.  His actions make me fearful for the kids. There was a time once when he was caught trying to put one of the children in the backseat of  car while he was intoxicated. My sister caught him and stopped it. Though once they are separated and she's not there to monitor him, I'm afraid he'll do it again.  Now my sister refuses to leave because she wants to keep the house (even though I doubt she'll be able to pay for it with him gone). Does she have any rights to kick him out or keep the house while he's in jail? She is already filing for separation. The house is in a loan under his name but her name is also on the deed. What are her options for the next year as far as establishing custody and child support? I know documenting everything is an option. I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything else I should know."	Yes
Too much backstory for tonight but we've been married 15 years, owned the home for 11. He's an alcoholic and a gambling addict, currently has no access to any cash, our finances are separate and all household expenses are paid by his grandmother who controls the bank account that his paychecks go into. I have my own money.   Will filing for legal separation be enough to keep him out of our home? I have his family's support in this. He's currently locked outside sleeping on a beanbag in the middle of our yard because of his drunk behavior tonight.   I need a hard line in the sand. I do not want to be married anymore. I do not want him here. When he sobers up tomorrow he will act like nothing is wrong and want to come home. I can't live like this anymore. What do I need to do/know?  We live in Washington State.  Thank you in advance for the advice you give here, I don't have anyone else, not like this anyway.	Yes
In 2012 my mother had went to the hospital due to her lymph nodes under her arms being swollen. Two years later she calls me to say she has Hodgkin's lymphoma. She lives 3 states away, is a drug addict, her exact location is unknown, and probably hasn't gotten proper treatment. The number she had is disconnected, my brother has sent her packages and pictures without any reply. My brother and I haven't heard from her since 2015. It wasn't unusual to go without hearing from her for a few months, but it's been two years. I'm wondering if there is any way to find out if she has passed.	Yes
My wife and I have been going through a gruesome divorce where she's taken everything I've ever worked for. Long, long story short:  -Wife had partial custody of my daughters (12,14,16) but neglected them they came on their own merit with me overseas.  -I left everything I had to get away from her including my house and all the valuables inside. -She's now breaking into my said house and looting it.  I need to know if I can send back my daughter (18) without her getting in legal trouble or a way to retrieve all that I have left to my name.   I've abridged 4 years of a downhill battle so if there's anything that I've left out, please feel free to ask.	Yes
My father needs to file some court papers about a domestic violence incident.  English isn't his first language, so he has asked me to help him fill out the form.  Do I need to know any particular legal terms, or is the form pretty self-explanatory?	Yes
So, my wife (no marriage cert, but we lived &amp; function as man &amp; wife) has left, not really communicating at all.  While I adore her, and want things to work out, if she needs to leave to be happy, I can deal with that.  However, she has major medical issues (using the max FSA contribution in ~8 months each year), but if we are split, I can save ~150 a PAYCHECK by dropping her and changing to a high deduct plan, with HSA.  She has no job at current, and ~4 yrs ago when she took med leave from her last job, she didn't do the required appt's &amp;/or paperwork to continue to get paid from them. She also refused to apply for unemployment, or disability in all that time.  We also have a 5 yr old daughter, but I'm not concerned about custody today, although that will be it's own issues.  Open enrollment is typically in Oct. so I have time. But I want to be prepared.  So much more, I'm sure, but ask ?'s and I'll answer.	Yes
I'm about to get married. My dad just went through a really rough (second) divorce. I don't have the whole picture, but from what I gather, they each spent around $50k+ on lawyers to fight over maybe $500k in retirement savings and home equity. This sounds like an absolute nightmare and a total waste of money.  My fiance and I are both 25 and just starting out our careers. Neither of us have anything worth fighting over in terms of existing assets/savings so I wasn't planning on any sort of prenup. But, ideally in 5+ years we would have plenty to fight over, and that is what I'm worried about.   Is there any sort of prenup to make sure we don't both blow a ton of money on lawyers if we ever do get divorced? A sort of civil agreement that would benefit everyone involved? Should I bother bringing it up to her?	Yes
I can find all the steps involved in both processes, obviously changing your name on your birth certificate is much longer and more involved. Are there advantages to doing it that way?   If we decided to move abroad and buy property, apply for visas or file our taxes in anther country, would only assuming his name become a hindrance?  Thank you!	Yes
I'm a 30m in Florida dating a 30F. We were discussing what would happen after marriage and she mentioned that she would want a prenup to protect her parents.  I currently don't have many assets. My biggest asset being a car. I'm currently renting a house. I have about 15k in student loans. I have a good job. I can go into more detail if I need to.  Her income is currently significantly higher than mine. She's a very successful person. Her and her parents bought some property that's probably worth about 1.5mil. They both own houses on that property. She has two kids.   The issue: She would want a prenup to protect the property. I'm ok with that but I'd like to protect my best interest too. She wants me to pay rent and help her take care of the kids. I'm ok with that too. I'm just scared what would happen 10 years down the road if we got a divorce. Would I walk away with nothing after having helped raise her kids and pay rent for 10 years?  I was really hoping to not pay rent the rest of my life with nothing to show for it. Where is the middle ground in this?	Yes
"My ex husband and I have 50/50 time sharing. In our divorce decree it states ""mother's address is to be used for school designation"". Due to my last move, she was to be zoned for one of the worst schools in the state. My ex husband was also zoned for a failing school. I talked to him in May about what we should do. I asked if his connection (a pb county sheriff) could get us a variance, he said no. I asked if she could attend his school (he's a teacher). He said it wasn't a good school. I attempted to sign up for school choice, but there were no good schools available. He resigned to send her to the bad school and basically let me know I was on my own in figuring anything further out. I wasn't okay with this and told him I was thinking about moving to a better school zone. I recently got a job offer 20 miles away making nearly twice what I was making before and four times what I made at the time of our divorce. That city is also where all the A-rated schools are (and where my daughter was born). After losing the offer on two homes to rent, I secured a home in the new area, zoned for one of the best schools in the state. In my decree it states I should notify him of the new address 30 days in advance, but that I don't need to do anything through the court if it's under 50 miles. Unfortunately, as much as I tried I was only just able to secure a place as of yesterday. I notified him immediately. My lease here ends in sept., with school starting next week. I actually paid extra to start the lease august 15th so she could start school, but I have my current place until September. Today he called me, saying I was in contempt of court for violating the decree because I made a major decision without him (what school she was attending). Since it says in my decree that my address is to be used for school designation, I thought if I moved it means it automatically is my school zone. I've offered to eat the cost of pre-care and even to pick her up on his mornings to take her to school in order to compromise and resolve this, so long as he picks her up after school, but he won't budge. I should mention that when we divorced he was living 30 miles from the marital home. He took her to a school 30 miles away without complaint. This school is much closer. He's only moved closer to me in the last two years. I want to know if he has legal standing and if I need a lawyer. Thanks in advance."	Yes
My friend (not birth mother) asked me today if it is legal to adopt a child by signing the certificate at birth. Her co-worker (birth mother) is pregnant and wanting to put the baby for adoption. My friend and her husband have been thinking about adopting. The co-worker and my friend have the idea that when the baby is born my friend simply signs the certificate at the hospital with her husband and just like that the baby is adopted to them.  She is asking me what I think and I think it sounds illegal but I have no idea. Maybe the community here can give some in sight.   Note: If it is illegal they will NOT do it that way obviously. I suggested they see some one for a consultation to tell them their rights and explain CA's laws. 	Yes
Okay so this situation is fuuuucked up. Like you wouldn't believe.  I was told I might be able to open a case.  [This is what I just wrote up about the situation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj2qeIFjqzF1rDmku_AO9TjFifz_9i4A4Gx8tyKbQe8/edit?usp=sharing)  ^^basically ^^lots ^^of ^^abuse ^^and ^^children ^^are ^^getting ^^^psychologically ^^^^fucked ^^^^^up.   obviously i know nothing about writing a legal document. names have all been changed.   if anyone could check this out and help advise me, I have no idea what steps to take next. I've never made a legal case.  If it helps I'm in Washington County, Oregon.	Yes
I am not sure if this counts as child endangerment, I think it does... So someone I know just had a child. The child isn't even two weeks old and they moved the child into a damp home with wet walls, mold, and in some places holes in the ceiling. The make shift baby room is a space with one side of the room completely clear and the other packed ceiling high with junk. It's really not safe for anyone to be in there... Now the parents were warned by family not to bring the child into that house because it's unhealthy but they did it anyway. They have the means to live elsewhere but choose not to. Quite frankly I think it's time they grow up. Should I report this to child protective services?	Yes
NY state  To start, about a month ago I punched my then GF of 6 years in the jaw (hard, bad brusing and she took pics). The day before I was going to propose to her (day of incident), a man contacted me and told me I was basically living a lie. She had loved him, but stayed with me and pressured me for marriage for months (he had proof and she confessed after I showed proof). I had also loaned her a substantial amount of money that she now refuses to pay back (Over $10,000), had just bought her an engagement ring, she owes me $550 in tolls and $200 in traffic tickets, and that same day she had taken my car without permission and refused to return it until the evening. When she did finally return, I snapped. I am a military veteran and I can sometimes have a hard time with my anger. I have never hit her or any other person I was in a relationship with, but I was overwhelmed with grief, anger and disgust.  It wasn't right that I struck her despite it all. She wasn't right for the things she did, but I should have just walked away. Anyway, we broke up that same day. She decided not to press charges because she knew she really screwed me over. She went to the hospital but didn't come after me legally.  The past month she has begged for me to come back to her and I met with her. We had sex on two occasions, no violence, no issues, but I decided to move on. I should not have even done that, but I longed for the past.  So yesterday, the guy she was cheating on me with prior contacted me. He asked if I had sex with her two weeks ago. I said yes, twice. He wanted proof and I sent him the messages and a video. They are in a current relationship.  So now my ex wants revenge and is pursuing an order of protection or so she claims. She called my mother threatening me this morning. Should I be concerned or what steps can I take to protect myself. I would like to cease all contact with this girl.  Summation:  -I punched GF in jaw after I found out she cheated and other things (money also involved, large sum) -We break up and she doesn't press charges. -New BF she also cheated on me with found out that I had sex with her recently and approached her on it. -Now she is threatening an order of protection, I'm guessing using the prior strike to do so.  I just don't want anything to do with this girl. The money thing is another headache I'll have to deal with.	Yes
I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	Yes
This is in Canada. A friend of mine recently got through a relationship with an abusive boyfriend who emotionally abused her, threatened her, and leaked her nude photos after they broke up. There's strong evidence of him being a pathological liar and generally a sociopath.  He recently got a new girlfriend (a few months ago) and proposed to her. She broke up with him (told us about it and was okay with it because she already was getting the suspicion he was a sociopath), and two days later she committed suicide. She suffers from depression, but it seems really unlikely that she'd commit suicide out of the blue unless her ex was threatening or abusing her.   My friend doesn't want to go to the police about her own experience with emotional abuse from him because she was a minor at the time when she was dating him (she's not a minor currently), and believes that the police will be forced to notify her parents.  So my question is twofold - first, will the police search through the recently deceased girl's phone, facebook, and other messages to determine the reason for her death if not prompted? And if not, is it possible for my friend to tell the police about her own situation without the police informing her family?  tl;dr: Very likely that abusive boyfriend made his recent ex kill herself. Will the police investigate without being prompted? Can someone give information to the police without parents ever being notified (they live at home)?	Yes
"This is for a friend who's currently being investigated by CPS for what they suspect is child abuse.  I'll be keeping this as vague as possible to protect the identities of those involved, but I have a few basic questions that I was hoping someone would be able to help out with.  It sounds like this could get bad pretty quick for my friend if things aren't handled properly, and I don't want to see that happen.  **Quick Background**  One of my friend's kids got hurt from an accident in the home, and ended up having to go to the hospital.  Everything seemed normal, CPS didn't show up, and they were never mentioned during the trip to the hospital.  It wasn't until the next day when CPS showed up at my friend's house for questioning, and even then, no additional issues were brought up.  They showed back up the following day and said my friend was going to be investigated for possible child abuse, and everything since then has been an extremely hectic, mental and emotional mess.  **Questions**  * If my friend is unable to afford a lawyer from a private practice, how long does it usually take to get a court appointed lawer?  Is this something a court appointed lawyer would be a able to quickly act on?  * If my friend is required to have a ""supervisor"" in order to be around their kids, but they don't have any friends or family who are able/available, what will happen?  Will a lawyer be able to help with this?  (I read that some courts will counter CPS in some cases, at least with the ""supervised"" stuff, but I wasn't sure how often that happens.)  This investigation has only been going on for a couple days now, but CPS is already saying my friend is at risk of losing their kids.  It sounds like this could happen sooner than later if my friend isn't able to find a friend or family member that what would essentially be a live-in Nanny that could serve as a full time supervisor.  I understand the reasoning behind this stuff, but I honestly don't know how some families are expected to make it through these situations in one piece.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
Ok so somewhat of a long story so bear with me! My younger brother has been dating this girl for a couple years and they have a 16mo old son together. They currently were living with our mother to save up some money. Normally they text all day while he's at work and one day he noticed she wasn't responding or answering any calls so he panicked and went home to check on her (she's a school bus driver and currently isn't working) and when he got home all of her and their stuff was gone and her phone was wiped clean and left on the counter. No note, nothing else left behind. Immediately he panics because his child and the person who he thought was the love of his life had vanished with no idea where or why they were gone. I advised him to go to the police (obviously) to which he had been sent back and fourth from CT police to Massachusetts police because they live in MA. Although their licenses say CT (a bit of a confusing mess because the baby technically lives in mass) So both PD'd basically tell him because they were never married that it's a civil matter and needs to file for a court date. He also decides to report her vehicle that she has stolen because it is legally his, registered and insured in only his name, or so he thought. CT police determine that its registered to her now, which means she forged his signature on the title and registered it in her name. After learning that he decides to file criminal charges for forgery, so an officer begins to help him with that. He also calls dcf to try and see if they will help to find out that she has claimed that he's is abusive, which is a lie, she has already admitted to falsely claiming abuse from him once before. She was arrested back in February for hitting him with a car, to which he felt bad and decided to drop the charges and take her back. He attempts to go to MA court and they tell him because they have licenses in CT that he needs to file there, and dcf had been in contact with her but cannot tell him where she is. He believes she might have gone to Virginia to be with a guy she cheated on him with once before. He decides to go through her phone she left and managed to find a way to contact her and they started talking through messenger in instagram. This whole time before that he's attempting to contact people who he knows would be in contact with her to relay messages that she's going to have felony charges in the hopes of her just deciding to return. It sort of works because he ends up getting a call from her saying basically, how can we make these charges go away, so he tries to say, bring my son to my house tonight and I'll call the officer and see if we can get the forgery charges stopped (he called the officer after to tell him she said she'd bring him home and told the officer to move forward with the charges still). So later he tried to contact her again to find out she blocked him again and changed her number, so it was all a ploy to get him to drop the charges. The CT officer advises him to apply for emergency custody at the court so that way the police can get involved with finding his son and maybe even put out an amber alert.  He goes and applies and is denied the emergency custody and receives a court date (August 10th) and here comes the next problem. He has to have her served, he needs to know where she lives to have her served. The dcf officer knows where she is but cannot legally tell him. The police tell him if he calls the marshals that they can get in contact with dcf to determine where she is to have her served. He contacts the marshals but they say that they cannot do that and he needs to give them an address. Today he receives a call from the police department that she had returned and dropped the vehicle off at the station and took off (she parked it and then called the station later to tell them it was there) so we know at least as of the last 12 hours she's back in the state, he calls the dcf officer and she was not aware she was back and tried calling her but the number was changed. The last time she spoke with her they video chatted and she claimed she saw the baby and he appeared to be ok, but she hadn't heard she was coming back and can't get ahold of her.  Today he called a lawyer and she claimed that if he can't get her served they'll just drop the case and he will have to re file, but that will be futile unless he can get her served, so basically she can just disappear with their child and there's nothing he can do about it because even with the warrant for the forgery he can't do anything, the officers told him it wasn't a charge thy would go over state lines for. He can't even manage to hire a lawyer because it's just too expensive. He's feeling a bit deflated and beaten down because he keeps basically not getting any help at every turn. All he wants is his son back. We are all so worried about the baby and I truly feel like if the situation was reversed there would have already been an amber alert and authorities everywhere looking for him.  She has a history of depression and other issues and we are honestly worried about the child. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, sorry for the extremely long post!	Yes
How do you determine where the divorce is to take place? For example if you're married in Quebec (partnership of acquests) but separate in Ontario, is there a strong case to be made that you should divorce in Quebec if one of the parties now lives there?  Any help would be great!	Yes
"Hi I'm 30 and my parents are divorced as my mom left our family for a man. My sister is 20 and in undergraduate school.My dad pays 2000 a month in child support to my mom which covers more than enough for her tuition. Last night my sister informed me my mom has been taking out student loans in my sisters name but won't tell her how much she's taking out and that my sister pays for everything herself and my mom is making her move home from college unless my sister pays ""because she can't afford it"".  The amount of money she's getting in child support is more than enough to cover her tuition room and board and she's seen not a dime of it and my mom is taking out loans for amounts she won't disclose with my sister in my sisters name.  What can be done About this matter ?"	Yes
"also posted in /r/Custody So, my ex and I broke it off March of last year. She moved in with some ""roomate"" guy, but didn't end up really being just that, of course. She didn't think I would go through with anything related to courts, but we couldn't agree on a school. I was moving back to a county with 10/10 schools (which I attended), and she wanted him to attend a charter school which was nothing I wanted him to experience, as it it was in a run down area, etc. I hired a lawyer, fought for school of choice, went to a referee hearing and somehow she had a lawyer (last minute, she was terrible), and I won with flying colors. She objected to the recommendation, went in front of a judge some months later, and she was definitely ill prepared again, and the judge sided with me. (He was very mad that she refused to take him to ANY school, hers or mine, for 2 months until he made his decision. I was taking him to my school since it started, and she was taking him nowhere on her days). We were supposed to go to mediation. She didn't show. My lawyer filed sanctions against her, for the attorney fees of $1800 for preparing for mediation and her missing it, and asked the judge for 5 days with me instead of 50%, and he almost granted it. Said ""Do you see what's going on here?"" She really kind of looked foolish in the judges eyes. The judge granted the sanctions, and it was ORDERED that she not be late at all dropping him off to school or picking him up. We were prepared to enter another mediation. I told her we could sign a parenting time agreement and we would not need to go. That night, she signed it, and all was well. Which brings me to now. Every. Single. Part. Of. The. Order. she hasn't complied with. Hasn't paid the mediator the $100 she owed him (in the order), hasn't paid me or set up a payment plan with my attorney for $1800 (in the order), and has been late to drop him off 20+ times (in the order that that cannot happen). I'm trying to be lenient because of her situation, living 20+ min away, moving into her best friends house instead of her ""roomates"" (that didn't turn out well, duh). And now, I find out she's an escort to old men. That's not OK, knowing her history into getting into risky situations, and I'm worried for things going down hill from there. I work too hard and spent too much for my son to be in an unsafe and unstable environment like that. So I let her know my knowledge of this, and she kind of avoids talking about it. Yesterday, I bring up that I'm taking actions based on her willingly violating every single aspect of that court order. I'm hoping that will change her actions, because I'm scared of what will happen if she continues, and worry about my son first and foremost. http://imgur.com/a/uXOrB http://imgur.com/a/xOGNj Pictures for reference. I'm wondering what in your opinion would be the best course of action for correcting her behavior. Contempt? Thank you!"	Yes
My soon to be ex-wife and I are trying mediation, but she has already been very difficult and I don't have high hopes.  We have two kids and I expect her to fight me hard for an equal share of custody.  I left the mediator a message on Friday, but he never responded.  For mediators or those who have gone through mediation before, what can I expect in the first meeting?  How should I prepare?	Yes

I recently filled for joint custody of my daughter in the state of West Virginia due to the mother not letting me see my child. The court date got set back and since then she moved out of state without the judges approval or filling for relocation. Me and her were never married. Is she able to do that ?  	Yes
I'll start off by saying the friend is 18 and this takes place in Virginia. For the purpose of this story we will call her Friend.   The story begins in October when friend was working part time to build savings and taking classes online which her mom paid for monthly. She did not pay rent or have any legal lease to live in the home although she has lived with her mom her entire life.   Short backstory- friend lived with her mom, brother and stepfather basically all her life (stepfather and friend never got along.) mom and stepfather became separated and mom, brother (7) and friend all moved about 1.5 hours away from stepfather. Months later mom decides she wants stepfather to come visit and he agrees but says Friend can't be present. So mom asks Friend if she can stay the weekend at another friend's house. For the purpose of the story we will call her Roommate.   Long story short, mom and Friend got into a huge fight but in the end Friend agreed to stay at Roommate's for the weekend. While Friend was leaving mom took her debit cards, all the money from her savings, and her most recent paycheck. Mom told friend she would give the money back when she returns home after the weekend.   The weekend comes and goes and mom still will not allow friend to return home. After about a week she informs friend that she used the money she took from her to pay off friend's car (the car is in mom's name but friend is the primary driver.) friend does not give her permission to do this but she assumes that would mean the car now belongs to friend. Friend chooses not to take action against her mom as she wants to maintain a good relationship because she assumed she would eventually return home.   Another week goes by and mom tells friend she's going to come by Roommate's house to pick up her car and get the oil and tires changed. Mom picks up the car and informs friend the next day that she sold it and will not be getting her another one. Friend has to call out of work for the next week while she figures out how to buy a car with no credit, no money and no consigner. Friend buys a car with $0 down and a huge interest rate. Mom feels bad and says she will help her pay it off when she returns home.   Mom promises friend can return in November. November comes and goes. Mom promises friend she can return by thanksgiving. Thanksgiving comes and goes. Mom promises friend she can return by Christmas. Christmas comes and goes. Between Christmas and New Years mom promises friend she can come back soon she just wants friend to learn how to live on her own first.  The next week mom removes friend from all insurance plans, cuts off her phone service, stops paying for her online classes, and begins selling her personal belongings she left at the house when she thought she was only leaving for the weekend.   At this point it's clear to friend that stepfather has moved in permanently and she's out of the house for good. Keep in mind she's still living rent free with Roommate and Roommate's parents who were also under the impression that she would be only staying there temporarily. So now our question is can she do anything to get her money or belongings back from her mom? Can her mom legally evict her without notice? Does this count has illegal eviction even though 3+ months have passed? Basically at this point she no longer cares about staying on good terms with mom and she just wants her money back so she can move out from Roommate's house on her own.  Based on other posts in this sub it seems like mom can legally evict friend by giving her a notice with enough time to move out. Mom gave friend a few hours notice to leave for the weekend promising she can return. Therefore she didnt give her enough notice to legally evict her but it's now been over 3 months before it was clear that she cannot return home so is it too late to do anything?	Yes
I have recently gone through a really bad breakup and me and my family are being harassed by my ex. She calls from a blocked number, she somehow sees what I post on instagram even though she is blocked and I'm sure she doesn't have a fake account to follow me because I am on private and know who each follower is. I would just change my number but it goes beyond calls.   I don't want to have to do it because her family is cool and her dad works in the prison system but I really don't have a choice. She has physically hit me on multiple occasions, the night we broke up she ripped my shirt off and threw a cup at my head, she once started yelling loudly that I was physically hurting her and to stop hurting her even though we were just arguing (I called my mom and told her what she was doing in case she called the cops and I was arrested), it's just a total nightmare. She is diagnosed bipolar and has been 5150'd. When she was 5150'd I let them know she had been physical otherwise they wouldn't have take her.   Do I need to put all my family on the request for protection? Can I fill out the domestic violence one if I don't have proof of the violence? Also this seems like it should be the last of my worries but I have no time I can use to take off work because I've used it all from all the stress that has caused. Will the court let me request a specific date so I can not miss work?  Any help is appreciated. I can go a week with no calls and then once they start I get so anxious and sick to my stomach. I'm already in treatment for depression and anxiety and her contacting me is the only thing that causes it to flair up.	Yes
"We used to bank with Ally, we are 0 contact though I have attempted to reach out to her and her parents to have this issue addressed. Ally will not remove co-owners. They will not close the account if there are pending debits on the account. So, if she continues to use it there are very few opportunities where I am able to request a closure.   Yesterday I locked the debit, which she is able to remove, and had a day without pending debits. I learned the Account cannot be closed by me unless I have them send the money to my address on file or by ACH. I do not want to ""steal"" her money, even though it may be mine legally and Ally was more then happy to send it to me.   I want to close this account because in the prior 6 months she had a period where she frequently overdrafted, making me realize that she still could effect me financially. On one such overdraft letter the bank had issued a second request for payment of the overdraft prior to reporting the issue to the Chex System. She appears to be better now, but I just want all ties to be eliminated.   Getting a divorce was easier then closing this Ally account. Not really sure how to proceed."	Yes
I had a one-night stand with an Englishwoman while in South America a few months ago. She contacted me out of the blue to let me know that she's pregnant and thinks it might be mine. She is not open to having an abortion and is not thrilled about the idea of adoption. What are my responsibilities here (assuming the child actually is mine)? I've also found conflicting information on whether the child would even be a US citizen.	Yes
If someone just finds a baby orphan and wants to adopt it is the process as simple as taking it home and declaring in your own? I suspect not but don't know what the actual process would entail. How does one go about adopting a stray orphan baby?	Yes
So, I need to find a way to get my mom, siblings, dog, cat and me out of my home and away from my dad. We live in Michigan. I'm 20 years old. My sister is almost 18 and my brother just turned 15. My Dad is verbally abusive to my mom, constantly berating her and screaming about the smallest things. Occassionally his outbursts have been directed at me or my siblings, but mostly my mom. He loves to throw and break things. There have been several times where he has been physically violent towards my mom, hitting her or pushing her over. He pushed her down the stairs once. He has only been physically violent towards me once and never towards my siblings. Most of the time it doesn't escalate this far. He usually only gets really bad when he's had way too much to drink, but he's an alcoholic and drinks every day so...  Anyways, things have been pretty bad recently and my mom is done. She wants to leave, with or without my siblings and me. I'm pretty sure he will kill us if we try to leave though. He has threatened to kill my mom numerous times as well as threatening to kill us all and then himself. He has guns and once pulled one out during an argument, so I don't think they are just empty threats.  I'm just trying to figure out the best way to leave. We need to disappear. I'm tired of being constantly afraid. I have about $15,000 saved up, but my mom doesn't have much. We could make something work. I would obviously have to quit my job because he knows where I work and I wouldn't feel safe, plus we would have to move far away.  My biggest concern is that since my brother is only 15, my dad could fight for custody or if we just left, my mom could get in trouble. I don't know how any of this works, but my dad having any custody if this happens is not an option.  We have never filed a police report against my dad or anything like that, so there is nothing on record. He has no criminal background. During one argument, my mom did call the police (about three years ago), but it was so bad that we left the house before the police got there. They tried to call my mom, but she wouldn't answer her phone so nothing came of it.  Other things that could hopefully somehow help. My dad drives drunk a lot. He hasn't ever been caught though. He also used to smoke marijuana daily, but quit about a month ago. I'm not certain but I think there is still a plant in the backyard.  Any advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for reading.	Yes
My mother wants to divorce my father. And we need advice based on the information below.   My father has been cheating on my mother for years, he even passed HPV to my mother from sleeping with other woman.  She forgave him for it years ago but is now tired of it and wants to leave. Me and my younger brother are both over the age of 18. And she has the following questions.   1. Could she get alimony from my father even though both me and my brother are over the age of 18 ? She is 49 years old with bad knees to work.   2. They are currently in bankruptcy over the house. Could that affect her in anyway ?   3. She is no longer a legal resident. Could that get her deported ? ( I plan to help her get residency because I am a legal citizen)	Yes
My grandfather is 86 years old and stubborn and pretty much what the title says. He lives in his own room in my parents house where he has his own bathroom, he doesn't drive so my dad drives him to the grocery store for groceries.   He will not go to the doctor even if there's something wrong like he has a cold or something like that. He doesn't shower and lies to my parents and says that he does. He doesn't wash his bed sheets or clothes and he doesn't throw anything away. A lot of his shirts are stained with holes.   He has a mini fridge and freezer in his room, but he stores items on a shelf when they should be refrigerated such as mayonnaise and eggs.   I know my dad doesn't want to physically make him do things, what else can they do?   Can my parents get in serious trouble for letting this continue? Is this considered elder neglect?   Thank you	Yes
"I know, I know, but my friend is looking into getting a divorce.  She is a natural-born citizen who lives in Pennsylvania, and he is in the end-stages of getting his citizenship (from the UK) through their marriage.  As far as I know, all assets (house, cars) are in her name and she has been paying the bills.  I helped her with his citizenship paperwork when it was at the point where he was switching from a green card to a citizen.  The fact that he had joint pay-in to their bank accounts was included in the final interview paperwork.  As far as I know at the moment, he is waiting on the final decision.   His original UK passport however has lapsed.   There have been problems cropping up in their marriage.  He is ""threatening"" to go back to the UK.  Regardless of what he ends up deciding, can anyone here recommend what, if any, type of specialized lawyer she might need in case of a divorce?  Any kind of advice would be very appreciated.  Thank you in advance for your time."	Yes
Charlotte, North Carolina Asking for a friend. Spouse is the legal guardian for a person with Alzheimers. (Guardian and Alzheimer's person are married). The Guardian, while driving, Alzheimer person as passenger, got in a car accident, no other cars involved, so probably fault will be found with the Guardian.  Guardian seriously hurt, in hospital, rehab etc.  Spouse with Alzheimers only got scratched and bumped a bit, no real injuries.  Guardian remains in rehab home, Alzheimer spouse in care facility.  Apparently the insurance called the Guardian and said there could be the possibility that the kids of the spouse (her stepkids) with Alzheimer's can sue the Guardian for injuries to the spouse with Alzheimers, especially as an estate is involved.  A will already exists regarding the property. Again, from what I know the spouse with Alzheimers was checked out by the hospital, no injuries found, sent to the care facility because of the Alzheimers.  Does this seem correct?  Is there anything the Guardian should consider doing now with respect to the above?	Yes
"This is a strange situation. I feel like I am being harassed in a really weird way.   I broke up with my ex (we'll call him ""John"") 6 years ago. Recently, I've been getting mail (bills, mostly) in John's name sent to my address. Debt collectors are calling my cell phone looking for him. And I even had a man come to my door to deliver a court summons to him! Whenever this happens, I return the mail to the sender. I tell the debt collectors they have the wrong number, etc.   For what it's worth, he was highly abusive. We went no contact after I kicked him out. But that didn't necessarily keep him from harassing me. He eventually stopped. But now he's using my mailing address and phone number as his contact information, and I think it's just a weird way of maintaining some ""control"" over me.  So what on Earth can I do about him using my information? Is this fraud?"	Yes
"Greetings!  My ex husband has repeatedly violated our court ordered custody/parenting agreement. I am asking the judge to find him in contempt. The form asks me what ""remedial sanctions"" I want to request. I have zero desire to see him spend time in jail, and I feel a money award only hurts my children. A court order has already failed, so asking for another one requiring him to comply with the first one...seems a bit ridiculous. I do not know what is right or fair here - I just want him to stop violating our agreement. Any advice is welcome and I'll happily give anymore detail that could be needed! Thank you!"	Yes
Is there a way to see my full divorce decree online in Missouri? I have lost the paper copy and I‚Äôm hoping I can get a copy online without having to go to the courthouse.  Thanks in advance. 	Yes
"I am using fake names for privacy as this was a rather public and controversial incident. This takes place in Georgia, USA. Also, I will try to list everything in a timeline to avoid ranting and biases as much as possible.  - 4 1/2 years ago Jane gives birth to Matt, while using multiple legal and illegal drugs and consuming alcohol throughout her pregnancy.  - Almost immediately leaves Matt in the care of of the first couple who won't report her for abandoning her child weeks or months at a time. It should be added that she would stop by every other week to take the child support check out of the mail box and leave.  - Matt is 1. The financial strain is too much for them so they solicit the help of their best friends parents, my aunt and uncle. This includes them paying for daycare, clothes, etc, and watching him during the weekends.  - Matt is 1 1/2. My aunt and uncle take over care for Matt. Matts mother has been reported for abandoning her child whilst in their care.  -Matt is 3 1/2. Jane has, up to this point, visited Matt every couple of months which is largely due to the aunt arranging it. There is an incident where she wants to take Matt but when she shows up she is obviously impaired, they believed it to be illegal drugs, and refused to let her leave with him. No police report was made.  - Matt is 4. Jane has a ""coming to Jesus"" moment and aunt and uncle sue for custody around the same time. Jane does not show up to court. So the judge grants aunt and uncle temporary custody while Jane gets supervised visitation that she must pay for. The next court date is scheduled in 4 months.  - During the four months, she visits twice, paid for by the aunt, and encourages harassment of aunt via social media and spreads lies, including abuse of Matt. Aunt does not respond to any of it.  - Final court date. Judge says Jane has absolute custody and aunt and uncle will not be allowed to visit Matt unless Jane approves, which will never happen according to her.  I guess I'm just shocked that a judge, who saw proof of abandonment and total lack of care for this child, thought taking him away from the only family he knew (he is just short of 5 years) to hand him back to a mother who clearly failed at being a mother (my aunt and uncle wanted her to take her son back until it became obvious she was endangering his life and sought legal ways to keep Matt safe). How is this legal? How can a judge think she is the only possible guardian (with a clear history of abandonment and drug and alcohol abuse she admitted to) after this child grew up enough to remember the family that took care of him?"	Yes
So, my dad has been doing this to my mom and now that her credit is shit he's using my (19 year old college student) credit to open cards. I can't complain because he does pay off my credit cards and hes paying for a study abroad trip but honestly what the fuck? I just got a letter in the mail (my home address not uni address) one saying I was approved and there was a card for me and my dad in there (I ripped them up and threw them away) and the other saying I was denied.      I tried calling every customer service number I found but there was only a robot server, so I just ripped the cards up. The issue is he has my SSCN written down (he has all three of ours written down on all of our SS cards. For example mine has his and my moms, his has my moms and mine, my mom has mine and his)     I don't want to get in anything too legal but I don't want my credit to go to shit. Can I change my social security card number at all? (also would that require me to get a new passport?). He does end up paying all the credit cards off but he ends up racking them up and currently he has a full wallet full of them (ideally I think you'd need at most like 3/4, he owns at least 20) so I don't see why he'd need more ESPECIALLY under my name when I just started my journey to credit. I don't want this to bite me in the ass when I'm trying to buy a house. Should I just leave it or should I do something about this? He could have been doing this to me for god knows how long because I was getting credit cards in my name that he told me of left and right that he also has and has been saying I'm approved for them. Is there anyway I can talk to my bank and approve him JUST to pay my credit cards without him being able to open new cards and make himself an authorized user?	Yes
I received an order of protection (harassment, not stay-away) and a court date for family court. I cannot afford a lawyer and the public defender only talks to you when you show up to court. So I don't really know what's happening. I didn't do anything and I don't know what I'm charged with. What are the possible outcomes? Can I be convicted of a misdemeanor or felony in family court?	Yes
Some context.  My father and mother split apart five years ago.  I occasionally keep in touch with my father.    My father got arrested last weekend for domestic abuse.  Now I don't know the whole situation but I don't condone domestic violence.  My father spent the weekend in jail, and bailed himself out.  In the meantime his girlfriend took a restraining order out on him so he cannot return to the house to get his belongings.  He has personal artifacts (items he had long before he met this other woman), some jewelry (again he had long before he met this other woman), and his passport.    I want to know what my father can do to retrieve his rightful items.    P.S. My father and the girlfriend just bought the house he has been exiled from.  I would also like to know if this could be taken away from him or what his rights are.	Yes
"My spouse requested a divorce nearly two years ago and has since spiraled into debilitating depression and unknown/untreated mental illness (spouse flatly refuses to get help)  The children and I currently live separately from my spouse (in the same city, within walking distance) who texts randomly asking when the children would like to come over or go to a park or for a walk. Sometimes my spouse just shows up unannounced asking if they're ""ready to go"". Usually when this happens I ask the kids if they'd like to go and usually get an enthusiastic ""no"" or a half-hearted ""meh, not really"". Sometimes if I push them just a little to spend time with their other parent, I get tears from the youngest. Their other parent doesn't do anything to harm them, spouse just doesn't engage with them at all and often simply takes them for treats then goes back home for a nap leaving them to entertain themselves.  What's my obligation to the spouse and the children as far as visitation if there's not any legal separation or divorce yet?"	Yes
Hi,  I have 2 things that I need to do, but I'm not sure which forms I need to fill out.  1) I would like to file a motion for reconsideration because the court order is missing some important items that were supposed to be included (and were mentioned in the court transcript).  I don't see a form on the Superior Court website that allows me to file for reconsideration. How should I go about doing this? It's already been 6 months since the original judgment was made.  2) I'm being taken to court for contempt of court regarding child support by my ex-husband. I would like to respond to my ex's motion but I'm not sure which forms to fill out.  Can anyone give me some guidance?	Yes
Hi all,  I had a look at similar posts but I couldn't find my answer. I'm a US citizen living in France who recently got married. I want to change my last name (my maiden name hypened with my married name) but I don't really understand how to do it. France won't change my name until I change it in the U.S. I'm not a dual citizen yet (just American), but in two years I will be able to do that.  California still claims me as a resident even though I haven't really lived there for 4 years. Their process for a name change requires doing it in person and it seems like it takes weeks, which I can't do as I've got a full-time job. The embassy here in Paris doesn't do name changes either.  What I understand is that I have to file a name change with SS and then submit proof to the DMV, or do a court order and show up in person. How can I orchestrate all of this abroad?  Just for your FYI: I've got an American passport, a California ID (not a driver's license), and a French marriage visa + my French marriage certificate/paperwork.  Thanks so much for your advice!	Yes
My sister has asked me to post about this.   ‚Ä¢ She is 8 month pregnant and is about to give birth in Thailand.  ‚Ä¢ As the title has already stated, she is Thai (Bangkok), her husband is Chinese. (Yunnan province, Kunming city)  ‚Ä¢ My sister and her husband have only sign their marriage certificate in China; they didn't sign one in Thailand.  ‚Ä¢ She has asked a Thai lawyer who is her friend about this. The lawyer has said that in China, the child can only get the Chinese passport if both of the parents are Chinese. Therefore my sister's son will automatically only be qualified for Thai nationality. The lawyer, however, does not specialize in this field of legal matters.  ‚Ä¢ On a Thai platform, another Thai woman said that she has asked the China Embassy in Thailand and they said that if the birth certificate states that the child is Thai, they can only provide China's visa with annual renewal terms. However if the birth certificate states that the baby is 'not of Thai nationality', then the embassy can provide the child with the Chinese passport so the family can bring the child back to China to continue with the proceedings. When the woman went to ask at the district office, they said that since the mother is Thai, they can only state in the birth certificate that the child is Thai and cannot state that the child is 'not of Thai nationality'.  ‚Ä¢ My sister's in-laws have told her to not get the birth certificate at all and get all the proceedings done in China so the child gets the Chinese nationality. They are trying to force/convince my sister to make her son's nationality Chinese. They are using money and legal reasons to convince her but my sister doubts their knowledges dealing with legal matters as their have previously lie and made up stories to convince my sister of various things.  Questions: 1. Will my sister's son only qualify for Thai nationality?  2. If my sister is to have more children, will the terms be different if she is to give birth in China instead of Thailand?  3. Can my nephew, who is Thai, inherit his inheritance from his father who is Chinese? (My sister is worried that they may use this as reasons to force her to give birth in China and force her son to get the Chinese nationality.)	Yes
My boyfriend and I are starting to plan our engagement (I know...really romantic but alas that's how it is) and we have both agreed to sign a prenuptial mainly for eliminating any alimony requirements for either of us.   We live in Sweden, will have the ceremony in the US and for the time being plan on living in Sweden long term. My question is do we need to draw up a prenup for each country? and then file it in my state (NC) and Sweden? Or will NC even accept it as I'm no longer a resident there.   What we're also curious about are the implications the US could place on him as a non-resident married to me, a US citizen in the case of divorce. Alimony isn't easy to get in Sweden whereas the US seems to be easier. So for both our sakes we've decided on this as a just in case.   Obviously I have a lot more research to do but any direction would be helpful.	Yes
Pretty much what the post said. It's been a month since he moved out. He still has a job and makes a little over 3k/mo. He has stopped paying our cellphone bill, our credit cards, taken me off all the bank accounts, took our car and stopped paying our rent (July is now way past due).   Once his grandmother found out she immediately paid out rent to stop the eviction process and started paying for some bills and school supplies for our two oldest children. She says he is going to pay her back and that I should not seek reimbursement for back hold support this month because of it.  Could any of the money she has given us be considered child support from him, even though it hasn't come from him personally? He probably won't even pay her back, a mutual friend said he's saving up to buy a motorcycle.	Yes
My wife spoke to me about wanting a divorce last week. She packed her bags and left me Tuesday night.  Today is July 17th 2017, and I received an email from her asking me to move out  by Tuesday August 1, 2017 at 6pm.  What are my legal rights to stay in her condominium? (I live in British Columbia, Canada)  I have been sharing costs of the mortgage with her since we got married March 4th 2017.	Yes
"Hi, so this may not be the right place for this post but there's recently been a ""friend"" of my grandmother show up and is taking advantage of her.   Little backstory: She is 87, was diagnosed with dementia and early stage Alzheimer's, and is in the process of moving from Massachusetts several states away to be closer to her daughters (my mom and aunt). The ""friend"" used to be a TV service guy for her, maybe ~5 years in the past. In the last 6 months he showed back up in her life, mysteriously and out of the blue. She claims he ""helps her with everything"" but we are pretty sure that is not true, he has done a handful of favors for her (including admittedly two quite large ones, driving her ~1 hour 30 minutes and the other driving her and a truckload of her furniture ~5 hours.).   About 2 months ago, she gave him $10,000 with which to buy a car (which he supposedly would use to drive for Lyft and pay her back $100/wk, which isn't happening). The kicker of the situation is, she opened a joint account with him and he has a debit card with which he is draining her money. She transfers money from her checking account to his ""sub""/joint account and then from there he spends it (gas, groceries, shopping at malls, etc), or withdraws it (including recently a $4,000 cash withdrawal). When we spoke with the bank about it their attitude was ""she is our client and we have to respect her wishes, if she wants to open this account with this man she can do that"" blah blah. Doctors say they can't do anything because she is still compos mentis.  I'm at a loss for what to do. Can my family and I go after this guy to recover some of the money he has stolen from her? is this even illegal? It's clearly elder financial abuse in my mind, but I don't know what grounds we have for any legal or financial recourse. Any advice or suggestions would be much appreciated. I can also provide more info but will be at work most of the day so will only be on and off.  Thanks!"	Yes
In short, my girlfriend's father finally managed to get arrested after years of abuse and alcoholism. He's the main source of income for the household, and her mother is disabled and gets way too small of a disability check. She's been wanting to divorce him, but wouldn't know what to do to replace his income, so she never really looked too far into it. Now that we're forced into the situation, we don't know what to do about missing his income now. We don't make enough to support a whole family and house, and her mom's disability is nowhere near enough.	Yes
"Orange County/Osceola County, Florida  The father decided to jump the gun and instead of waiting to receive the paperwork to claim paternity through DCF (I'm on government assistance) he hired a lawyer. He did this because I wanted to go through custody hearing before he could see the child. (I know him well enough that he would try and snatch the child away.) I am not sure how to add photos/docs, so I'll try my best to explain. I get an email July 19th, showing I have been summoned. ""A lawsuit has been filed against you. You have 20 calendar days after this summons is served on you to file a written response to the attached complaint/petition with the clerk of this circuit court, located at: Orange County Courthouse, 425 N. Orange Avenue, Orlando, Florida 32801. A phone call will not protect you. Your written response, including the case number given above and the names of the parties, must be filed if you want the Court to hear your side of the case.""  The lawsuit was filed July 7th. I did not know the lawsuit was filed until the 19th when the lawyer sent me an email. 12 days passed. The address they have on the file is not my address. So if I was served, I would have no idea I was. Now I have to have a written response by the 27th. I sought legal aide in Orlando, FL on the 21st, but it was going to cost me $1 a minute. I did not have money to pay for legal consultation. Tomorrow I'm going to another legal aid location in Osceola County, FL, but just in case I am unable to get any help by July 27th, how would I write a response? Is there a template out there that could help me out?  A few other questions.  1.His lawyer wants me to pay legal fees (""Petitioner has employed the undersigned attorney to represent him in this action and has agreed to pay reasonable attorney's fees and costs. Petitioner is financially unable to pay said attorney or the costs of this action, but Mother is well able to do so.""), but how would I go about not paying that in case I have to end up self-representing? I am on gov. assistance unemployed with no bank account nor assets, and the father has 2 jobs. Also, I have been diligently searching for work, I'm so desperate I've applied to Mcd's and Wendy's. My indeed profile has showed I've applied to over 140 jobs.  2. How would I go about not sharing 50/50 custody and only doing visitation? I don't want to sound like a b-word, but I really do not trust him to be alone with a baby. I have text messages, voicemails, video, and witnesses as proof regarding his behavior. (He gets up and goes to sleep smoking weed. He drives erratically under the influence without a seatbelt. He has been in 3 car accidents in less than 3 months. He started a fight at a Target. He threw money at my face to get an abortion, grabbed me by the collar and threw me on his bed then proceeded to sexually assault me. He cursed out and almost started a fight with a mechanic who was working on his car after one of the accidents because the bill was $140 more than he quoted. He showed up at the hospital as I was walking to go to the elevator to get an ultrasound to be induced and refused to let me get on the elevator, security was called. He gave me an STD and proceeded to have sex with women while having sex with me - unbeknownst to me until I ""hacked"" into his phone. He had a felony for domestic battery. The list goes on.)  3. I am really having a hard time finding employment. Before I found out I was pregnant, I had a decent job in FL standards for someone without a college degree ($16.50 an hour). I think it's because I seem ""unreliable"" with an infant, they always asks why did I resign from my last job (Dr. told me to get off my feet). If I do not find something even minimum wage, part time, I am planning on moving back to my home state (CT) where it is easier for me to find a job, pay is better, and public transit in major cities is easier to navigate (different family members are going to chip in to pay for airfare and a friend has an extra bedroom rent-free if need be). How would I go about presenting that to a judge? I just started applying for jobs in CT, should I wait until I have a definite yes before I present the out of state move?   I am sorry for the long text. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
We have a 1 year old baby girl. Have been living together 13 months. He is the father on legal documents. Live in TX.  I want to move out. I don't know what to do legally. We aren't married. House is in his name. Some bills are in mine.  I pay for the majority of her stuff (she was on my taxes).  I don't know where to start or even what my question is I guess.  He is not attentive and I don't want to leave her with him on the weekends. Will I have to?  What's better, filing for full custody or not filing for anything and waiting until he gets a lawyer? I need someone to talk to who knows about this stuff. I don't think he's going to want her on the weekends - he will have stuff he wants to do. Don't care about child support if it means I have full custody.  Thinking of filing while I still live there so he doesn't  know. I'm in grad school and will graduate in May. I may wait to leave.  I  don't know how much more I can take and don't want her to see such a sad mommy.  This sucks.  Please let me know if I need to clarify anything. And this is my first time posting here.	Yes
I hope it won't be a battle, but I am scared. It's what has stopped me from pulling the trigger and actually breaking up. Long story short, been rough for a while, suspicious of bf, snooped and found evidence of his lying/messing around( at least on the computer) with another woman. I am ready to end it but want to make sure I am prepared.  We have a 15 mo old. He just started working a few months ago and til then I paid for most things or his mom helped him out. I handle bills, buy food, take care of baby appt. etc. he watches her during the day but whe. Something comes up, I have to figure out what to do. I have been trying to take some notes on happenings, because I heard that is a good things. I have my bank statements, and cc bills to show myself pYing and how much he contributes.  He is a good dad, so I want him in the kids life, I am just scared he will try to take her from me for more than half. Also our last fight, he told me I wou.d owe him half my tax return since it was partly due to his kid. Which I thought, bs man, I've paid for most everything I. Her life.  Anyway, any advise would be helpful of ways to prepare. I started looking up lawyers. I don't have lots of money, but if that's what I need, as he is a slick talker and has a mom with money and lawyers in the family, I'll have to find a way. Thanks for your help.	Yes
I haven't posted on reddit before so forgive me if I am in the wrong sub or not adhering to protocol.  My young son and daughter are currently in Japan with their grandparents and myself and my wife are currently in the US. My wife has hinted before that she might take the kids to Japan and never come back, but so far hasn't acted on it. However, she made the threat again during an argument last night and has demonstrated behavior today that suggests she plans to go through with it since the children are already in Japan.  We have not filed for divorce or separation and she isn't currently scheduled to fly to Japan for another week, but it's possible she might be changing her flight now. My understanding is that I will have little to no recourse to get access to my children once she decides to follow through on her threats and I'm wondering what my options are to either prepare for the long legal battles ahead or to try and stop this from happening in the first place.  I have sought local legal counsel, but haven't heard back from them yet. She is not a reasonable individual at the moment, but I am hoping to appeal to her for a more rational solution than taking this kind of drastic action. That said however, how can I prepare for the worst case scenario? Thank you for your time.	Yes
"My sister recently passed away under some very bothersome circumstances. My family has been involved in a lawsuit over this, which is reaching its end point. We were recently informed that before everything is finalized, my father is legally entitled to inquire about his possible share of the settlement. This naturally caused a collective ""WTF?!"" moment throughout my family, as he his an absentee deadbeat who hasn't had contact with the family in well over a decade, and even when contacted about becoming a co-executor of my sister's estate, he waived his rights by not giving a fuck and ignoring it. Here are some key points:  * My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate.  * My sister passed away as a legal adult; after emancipation.  * This lawsuit was initially filed by my mother as an individual, and soon turned into it being on behalf of my sister's estate, as she became the sole executor.  * My father waived his rights when it came to becoming co-executor of my sister's estate. He had an opportunity to pursue it but didn't, and has absolutely no association with the lawsuit, my sister's estate, or the family.  * My father hasn't had any contact with my family for almost 13-14 years, and has never made any attempt to make contact. He knows very little about us, made no effort to contact us and seek information regarding my sister's passing.  * My father owes tens of thousands of dollars in child support, and is a tax dodger. He's been to jail several times over both. Our attorney and the judge handling this knows, as we've provided extensive documentation about this."	Yes
"I am 18 years old and heading to university in September. My mother has always been emotionally unstable, bipolar, bpd, and very manipulative. She never respects my privacy (goes through my things when I'm not here, steals them and won't give them back for no reason, etc) - e.g: a few months ago she stole my girlfriend and I's polaroids and wouldn't give them back because she didn't approve of me dating her (very unjustified considering my girlfriend never showed any reason not to be with her). She never lets me close the door to my room because ""I shouldn't have anything to hide"" and ""there shouldn't be any secrets between us"".  More recently I bought a watch with money I had saved for years, and she just called me to tell me she's going to take the watch and return it (and most likely keep the money). My parents being divorced I left for holidays with my father and left my watch at home.   I don't know what to do anymore: She has been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive with me for YEARS, which has caused me to develop depression, severe insecurity and low self-esteem and anger management issues. Nonetheless, I have never gotten physically agressive with her. This watch I bought is one I hold very dear, and being 18 I don't think she's allowed to steal my things and sell them without my consent.   What should I do?"	Yes
Ex-wife and I have been divorced for a decade. Children reside with me and she receives standard visitation (Arkansas). We have a upcoming court date to show cause for contempt for her non-payment of support and ordered medical costs (as covered by our current orders) and her maltreatment of the children during her visitation.   During the children's visitation, she has taken their phones and intercepted and read text messages intended for the children. They were not of a sensitive nature. She also pretended to be the children and sent messages to myself and others in an attempt to hinder our communications. She also used the devices to attempt to (unsuccessfully) read my confidential e-mails and snoop on social media, in an attempt to gather evidence against me.   I have screenshots of this as proof, and the children themselves are the ones who told me what she was doing.   Had she been looking at the phones to determine if the children were engaging in risky internet behavior, I would understand, but she instead directly intercepted, tampered with, and interfered with my confidential communications.   Is this against the law, and what can I do about it?	Yes
Re uploaded to place state in title  Throwaway account here, if only because the obvious sensitive nature of the topic and I don't wish to air someone's dirty laundry in a way that could link to them.   My wife and I have a happy marriage and a 6 year old son, and her parents live with us in our home in Texas. Due to some medical issues that should have kept ANY kids from being possible, my wife had to have a hysterectomy at a relatively early age. We always wanted to adopt a second child and recently have been doing the research on what the requirements are in our state. One of the requirements, of course, is a background check for everyone in the family (I'm not sure if they mean just in the house or everyone genetically linked to you), which makes sense. But it raises my worry about something.   My father in law is a convicted sex offender. Now, I mean that legally speaking in that he has to go and register his location and all that, but my wife told me this early on in our relationship. According to my wife's family he was caught up in this witch hunt back in the early 90's with these two kids who lied about a whole bunch of shit and he decided to take a plea deal instead of dragging his family through the hell of a trial. Not the choice I would have made but it is what it is and I don't know what I'd have done under those circumstances.   I believed my wife and her family when this was told to me years ago, and after being around the man for almost 7 years I haven't had a single moment to the contrary to shake that. He may have his flaws, but if I thought he had ever touched kids like that I wouldn't let him live in the same roof as my son. The issue is this: would his status on the registry prevent my wife and I from being able to adopt as long as they live with us, if at all?  Thanks.	Yes
Long story short.. divorced 2 yrs. minor child lives with me alone. No contact from ex in over 2 yrs. he has recently started emailing me asking for pictures of child. My Atty advised I should send. He has increased requests to every month and now every week for the past three. Each email he is trying to get me to converse with him, &amp; makes references to our past relationship. I only respond with pictures, no conversation. I had pfa against him which expired and was not able to be renewed because he moved out of state. My question is what is reasonable for asking for pictures? I mean come on, appearance isn't going to change month to month and I feel that he is just using as an excuse to try and get me to talk to him. I feel like it's just more emotional abuse and harassment.	Yes
Alright, so every summer when I get my son I'm served papers to do with something she's in a tizzy about. This is year 7. This time it's to change the drop off/pick up location regarding summer visitation. She lives in central Arkansas and I have recently moved to Tampa, Florida from South Georgia, associated with the military. For the past 7 years, drop off and pick up have been a huge ordeal for her every time but it has remained that I am responsible for pick up at the beginning and she is responsible at the end of visitation.   She is now wanting it changed so that we meet at the beginning and end at the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport in Georgia and that we pay half of each other's cost. While meeting there isn't the issue with me as it's only a 7 hour drive for me, compared to almost 17 driving to her location.   I like the way it is now, getting it all done in one trip and not having to plan and or loose any extra time with him. She constantly complains about having to take off work and now she wants this?   I have to go to court in roughly two weeks as I was just served court papers after responding to the initial complaint that I was unwilling to change the current order.   Can anyone offer any advice on how to convince the judge to keep the order as is, or at the very least, not make us pay for half the others expenses?  My worry with that is she books whatever flight, hotel room, car rental she wants and tries to stick me with half the bill when I can get to ATL on a tank of gas that costs me $20 to fill.   Any help appreciated.	Yes
Im writting this on behalf of a friend.  A mom and dad are separated, and have a schedule for child custody. The mom sent the kids to camp at a location several hours away from the dad's home. When the camp is done, it will be time for the dad to pick up the kids from the mom. However, the mom purposely did not pay the camp to drive the kids home. This means that the dad is left to drive several hours to pick up the kids. Of course, he will drive there to pick them up. But, is there anyway to discipline the mom?  Is there anything that can be done?	Yes
Hi, Changed name about 20 years ago , cant find my deed poll anywhere, I just applied for a passport online and its asking for a copy of it to be mailed in!   What to do!!  Thanks a million for any help!	Yes
This might get long.  I have previously posted about this. I granted my ex primary physical custody of our daughter, since she wouldn't sign divorce without it, I did so with the condition that we maintain joint legal custody and that I would still get 3 days with her each week. So, technically the primary physical custody is only in name. I found out after filing, from her boyfriend, that she would move to a house further away. Google says the commute without traffic is 50 minutes and 39 miles, not counting actually dropping off my daughter at the school. God knows how long it will be with traffic, current commute is 20 minutes, and 14 miles. I drive a lease, so this will definitely kill my lease. She has decide all on her own to enroll our daughter in a school closet to her. How this affects me, is that I have our daughter Sunday, I drop her off at school Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday and I pick her up on Monday and Tuesday.  The ex has already stated that because she has primary physical custody, her boyfriends house is the address of residence, and that the joint legal custody does not matter. I will be forced to take her to court in order  o get things more agreeable and fair to both parties.  Now to the actual question, where can I find guidance in regards to what the court takes into consideration when deciding commute times and distances? I cannot afford an attorney and need to represent myself.	Yes
I'm 16, 17 in October. I want to leave my house as soon as possible possible after school starts in August. I will have my driver's license and possibly a vehicle then.  I just wanted to know about getting myself a job and a place to live if I'm underaged. Can I consider myself an adult without parental consent?	Yes
We live in California.  My fiance has a 4 year old daughter who's mother has been controlling his visitation with her since we have been together. He hardly gets to see his daughter and they had agreed through messages that he'd see her sundays. Almost every Sunday she has other plans or excuses as to why he can't see her or as to why it will only be 1 hr or so. Last year she allowed him an overnight visit which lasted from bedtime to breakfast only,  and that was only because we had just found out her bf at the time had been arrested for murdering his parents. About a month after that visit she moved to Florida without notice before his daughters birthday and denied phonecalls and video chats the entire time she was there which was about 8 months. Now a few years ago when they were together and their daughter was a baby they got into a physical altercation where she broke his nose and he slapped her back. Neither pressed charges but the DA pressed charges against him and he completed community service, 52 anger management classes and as far as I'm aware this is all true. She uses the domestic violence charge against him every time he tries to push about seeing his daughter more or getting consistent visitation at all, as well as threatening to file restraining orders but allowing him to visit her home to see his daughter when she allows him to. He works, sometimes weekends and we are restricted on our vehicle since there are two of us. His ex and daughter now live about 45 min away and she absolutely refuses to drive anywhere to allow him to spend time with his daughter. He brought up court to her as an option to get reliable reasonable visitation and or custody and she now refuses to respond to him at all telling him to go to the courts then and to stop messaging her at all. Please help with advice for us to prepare for this. I have no idea what to expect, but I am sure she will try to defame him as much as possible :(	Yes
I am 32 years old in Las Vegas, Nevada, and I saw my birth certificate for the first time when obtaining a new Real ID. While my parents are married now, they weren't married when I was born, and the father field is blank on the form.   I did some research, and I found that the certificate can be amended to add him. However, it's not something I want to bring up if there's no benefit to it.  Some information I found online indicated I would not be entitled to social security benefits if he were to pass away, which I'm not worried about.  What are some other consequences of him not being listed on my birth certificate?	Yes
Hey everyone, hoping the title wasn't misleading or something. Im new to reddit btw! :0 Anyways, by the way my knowledge legally speaking is very amateur so please see where I'm coming from here! my wording might not be the best. Emma give this a shot and keep it very brief I am aware of the premise of emancipation in America, when someone comes of age to basically legally sever themselves from their parents or guardians. I was wondering if there is anything like this in Korea? My girlfriend is Korean and is wondering, for her own personal reasons. Ive done what research I can, but I end up stumbling into complexly worded and misguiding articles, blogs etc. Someone help me out here, i would love and appreciate any and all advice. Thank you !!  PS.Am I even posting this in the right sub? If you guys know of anywhere else I could post this question let me know!	Yes
Wife called police on me last night after we had an argument. Claimed to police that I had shoved her. Both of us had been drinking. Under washington state law one of us had to be detained according to the police and since she claimed I shoved her,  I went to jail. I now am facing a DV charge and my court date is for tomorrow. I'm wondering if anyone can help with explaining my options and what to plea. Thanks.	Yes
"I'm looking to get advice on regarding what to do. I know the best way to get legal advice is through a bar approved lawyer, but I would like to have some second-hand advice on what I should do regarding this situation I'm currently experiencing.  My Grandmother has been ""ill"" for a while (see can't be by herself and someone has to always watch her) and currently has her house for sale. My Oldest brother has been taking care of her primarily (Being at home with her to watch her while he tries to live out his own life) and also my mother. (She can't be alone with my grandmother due to her inability to take care of herself.)(Tdlr she is a severe alcoholic and has really bad short term memory due to it.)  During most of the time, it has been my older brother taking care of her. He even transferred household utility bills in his name (Gas, Water, Electric, Comcast, ext) and additionally paying for other expenses. (Groceries, living expenses for my mother and grandmother to survive).  A Few months ago, her oldest daughter (my aunt) started giving her vitamins/pills/ect in other words ""alternate medicine"" (Whatever Steve Jobs did before he sought out real help) and in my past couple months watching over them I've notice she gets a tad better, but a bit worst each time.  In regards to what I want to ask, just recently my Aunt made herself Power of Attorney (Even though she is not the oldest sibling) even when my grandmother is in current state of mind. Her current state of mind consist of ""flashbacks"", random hysteria episodes and the inability to do the basics of living (Getting up from her bed, using the bathroom, washing herself, ect).  When she became POA she recently informed me that when the house sells that she (my aunt) will get all the money and then presumes to tell me I have to find a place for my mother since ""I'm her son"" when I can't even take care of myself in the 1st place.   So tldr - Aunt has POA, sells my grandmother house keeps the money for herself and then my mother, brother, and myself don't have anywhere to go. Honestly I'm pretty scared about this and I don't really know what to do so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
Hi, I was told by r/personalfinance to post this here.  So, I am going to try to make this as brief as possible, but I also need to add in enough background information that may also help provide a better answer.  My dad and mom have been living together for nearly 30 years, my dad has worked full time post of that time in various positions. He is retired now and receives a significant amount of retirement income each month, totaling between 3k-4k. My mom has worked, but only infrequently and only has SS of about $500 per month.  Their combined income should be enough to live off of, but... My mom has been recklessly spending money on various things, mostly dining out and groceries that seem to disappear. Not only that, but my mom and sisters are semi-hoarders and breeders of animals (cats and dogs) which are destroying the house and costing them hundreds if not thousands of dollars each month to maintain. The amount of cats and dogs combined are almost 20. My mom also has power of attorney over my dad for unrelated reasons.  I recently found out that my mom forced my dad to open several credit cards in his name and has maxed out of them to a total of 25k. Additionally, in the past week my mom and my sisters have left me and my dad at home with a barely operable car and we do not know where they have gone or when they are coming back. The biggest issue is a large settlement that is incoming for my dad to the amount of 200k. Since my mom has power of attorney over my dad I need to know whether or not she can take the money out right or if we have time to stop her.     He has already been to a notary public to revoke the power of attorney and has a set appointment date for receiving the settlement in person. So, my question is, what the hell do I do or can do? What the hell do we do when we get the 200k? My mom and dad also own the house, both of their names are on it. My dad wants to setup a living trust and invest the 200k and keep it away from my mom. Is this the right decision? I just need help or advice.  Additionally, my dad is going to see a lawyer on Thursday about getting the POA fully revoke and we'll see  Thank you.	Yes
"I've had custody of my niece for 3 years. My sister was involved in a horrific car accident and sustained a brain injury to her right frontal lobe (regressed in mental age to a teenager). She developed a crippling heroin addiction and I eventually took custody of my niece.  My sister got pregnant 3 times within a 4 year timeframe and lost 2 children due to her addiction. My sister had recently ""got clean"" although she's still taking suboxone regularly with an infant at home. We had to block her number because she kept calling and cussing at my niece/her daughter when she didn't hear what she wanted. We've blocked her number, but now she's sending letters without return addresses.   I want to adopt my niece, but I don't think my sister well simply relinquish her rights. How hard of a fight am I up against? Any insight or advice is appreciated."	Yes
My dad recently inherited a piece of property when my grandfather passed away. He was married at the time and still is, but him and his wife of under a year are planning on divorcing soon. So far she is not too interested in the property but I was curious on if she would be able to grasp at it if she wanted? The property is currently in my name, and the current plan is to wait for the divorce to happen before developing the land.	Yes
I am almost done getting my name legally changed. From there, what do I have to do? Go to my banks, credit cards, post office, landlord, DMV, etc etc etc to have the name changed?	Yes
What is the procedure to name change legally in MS. I have a minor who wants this before his permit next year. What paperwork do you need to present to license bureau for the name change on permit. How do you get gender marker changed for a child born in MS? 	Yes
I'll try to keep this to the point.  My brother and sister-in-law are getting divorced.  SIL just got served with divorce papers where my brother is requesting majority custody and decision making.   - Brother went on a 2-week military commitment - SIL blindsided him with a text message two days into this saying she was leaving, moving in with a boyfriend - SIL proceeded to turn into a nympho, opened a dating profile, showed and sent my brother explicit text messages of her meeting up with multiple guys, which we have copies of - Her boyfriend has openly posted about drug use on facebook for the past 4+ years, which we have screenshots of - Her and her boyfriend posted nude snapchats showing both of them, which we have screenshots of - Both her and my brother make ~$10/hr, but her grandparents are millionaires and allegedly going to finance her legal fight  She's seriously a terrible, neglectful person, doesn't change their son, doesn't bathe him, doesn't clothe him or even put blankets over him before bed. The thought of her drug using hookups being around my nephew makes me sick to my stomach.   My questions 1.  Are the screenshots we have worth anything? 2.  General advice for going up against people with an unlimited legal budget?   3.  We have no intent of cutting her immediately family out of his life, is there a way to make that intent clear? 4.  My parents have supported and financed basically all of my brother and SIL's expenses over the past 3 years (groceries, appliances, rent, bills, baby food), where her family had cut her off. They are just now stepping in to help her fight in the divorce.  Does this have any weight?  Thanks.	Yes
My ex-wife recently filed an application for divorce.  There were some issues pertaining to the separation agreement that I wanted ironed out prior to accepting the divorce (specifically fixing FRO arrears to $0 since the amendments to the agreement were not on file as I had assumed she would have done which had adjusted the support amounts payable, as well as some other access issues and firming up some wording on the agreement).  We were able to settle all these issues in our first case conference, and a court order was filed to amend these changes.  I just received, from her, Form 12: Notice of Withdrawal, requesting that I fill it out so she can proceed with the divorce.  Now, I don't want to get boned here, so I was just wondering:  Does this notice of withdrawal rescind my answer that I had on file, nullifying the court order or is it just a formality since we are now in agreement to move forward?  I've also read in the Ontario Family Law that if a Notice of Withdrawal is submitted, that I will have to pay the court fees.  What kind of fees am I looking at?	Yes
"So my brother and I have been living together.  We are both adults (I'm 27 he's 34).  Last week we got into a fist fight.  He managed to get on top of me and attempted to gouge out my eyes before I forced him off by getting my pocket knife out and slashing at him.  That night after I got home from work I tried to talk to him and he said ""the next time you hit me I will assume you intend to kill me and I will take my knife, and I will gut your fat sorry ass.  I will carve your fucking face off before I gouge your eyes out.""  Now normally that would be enough for an arrest but I hit him about 20 times and gave him a mild concussion.  I want to make sure I can press full charges and have his 2 kids put into foster care with out legal repercussions my self"	Yes
My friend's wife decided she no longer wants to be married. They've been separated for a few months and she's expressed to him that she wants a divorce. However, now she's stating that although she wants a divorce, she doesn't want to be the one to file. Is there any legal reason why she wouldn't want to be the one who files? Thanks in advance.	Yes
Hello, I need some advice and hopefully you guys can steer me in the right direction.  I live in Washington state, U.S. When I was 3-4 years old, my mother and father split up and she retained custody of me. They were not married. He has not paid a cent of child support and disappeared off the face of the earth after my mom took me and left. I recently reached out to him to see if he's someone I want to be a part of my life, and...he is one of the biggest pieces of human trash I have ever encountered in my entire life. Just a horrid human being. He lives in New York in a quarter million dollar home. My question is, can I (I'm 26 now) sue him for back child support, and if so, what steps should I take? My mom and stepdad raised me, I wasn't adopted, and they paid for me growing up. Just want to see some justice here. Thank you in advance.	Yes
Oh my poor mom.   First of all, she has a house in Fl where she says she's living at. That's where her FL ID says she is and that's where her mail gets sent to. She's struggling with mortgage payments and has the possibility of getting the house foreclosed on. That's a whole other issue but relevant to this story. She's been making money by renting out 2 of the 3 rooms for short or long term periods. This has been going on for 3 years but recently the HOA got involved and said she couldn't do this the way she wanted to anymore. Now the HOA only wants a minimum of a 1 year commitment from the tenants and they have to be approved by them with an application. She's struggling to find people to move in but she found someone last week. When she was trying to fly back from Idaho, her new husband (diagnosed with Alzheimer's) became distressed and the plans fell through(check out my history for that story). She paid for my plane ticket and I flew back to help out with the room rental instead.   Now I'm here and going through all of her mail. She wanted me to open everything and alert her of everything going on. There were several documents from the court. Here's what I gathered:  My father is an angry person who separated himself from all of us and then accused my mom of taking his children away (he said this in a threatening email to her, we're in our 30s, wtf). She was receiving alimony but recently he was able to convince the court to reduce alimony by 75% retroactively for 3 years.  The docs show that he gets a certain amount of money from SS and has a job. Apparently he no longer works and only receives SS. Makes sense to reduce the alimony. But making it retroactive? I don't understand that.  Yet, my mom, being ignorant and not realizing what you should and shouldn't do, didn't know that she would stop receiving alimony when she got re-married and didn't tell the FL court. She received 2 more checks, she thought it was weird, called SS, they said since the checks were already made then she can cash them. (I don't think she called SS to see if it was okay if she thought getting married wouldn't cancel alimony..). She was ordered by the court to repay money from those checks but also ordered to pay another monthly sum to pay back the last 3 years of supposedly receiving too much money from the alimony.   She is now aware that she shouldn't have cashed those checks and is paying it back now but wasn't aware of the retroactive payments. She's, umm, not very good at speaking and understanding English so it sounds like a miscommunication to me. She missed 4 months of payments. My dad alerted the court and set up a court date for March. My mom was never personally served, instead, the Sheriff's Office contacted her by phone and alerted her of the date. She refused to answer any questions and said she couldn't return for a couple of months. She thought this was about the house and not about those repayments.   So of course, she failed to show up. A hearing was then scheduled for May and then a Motion for Civil Contempt/Enforcement set for July. My dad was present at the hearing in July, but not my mom and she was not represented by Legal Counsel.  The conclusion shows that she has the ability to comply with previous judgements and orders of the court and has willfully refused to do so.  My mom had absolutely no idea that she was supposed to pay these retroactive monthly payments even though a year and a half ago is when the alimony was reduced by 75%. It's odd to me that she has to make those payments back and that the payments were required to start on April of this year.   She's dealing with a lot, can't travel/leave her husbands side, can't rent out her rooms and has the possibility of being foreclosed on. Any recommendations?	Yes
My step sons father is in prison for shooting my wife. He will not be out until my son is legally an adult.  Is there any way that i could adopt my stepson so that I can make decisions regarding his medical care and school issues? As of now the school does not recognize me as anyone with a say. Thanks for the advice	Yes
"My ex wife and I divorced about a year ago.  We have an 8 year old daughter and live in a suburb of Pittsburgh.  We have no custody arrangement for our daughter, as we both work full time jobs and rely on each other for childcare.  Personally, this has benefited me because I get the majority of time with my daughter.  However, lately, I feel like my ex has been really reckless with taking care of my daughter.  Examples:  - During the school year, it was my ex's job to pick our girl up from school at 2:50, at the latest.  She neglected to pick her up often and I would have to leave my 9-to-5 job downtown and drive against traffic for 30-40 minutes to go pick up my daughter, if her aunt or grandmother could not go pick her up.  This happened so many times over the two years she attended school that the school sent us both letters saying if it happened again, they would be forced to report it to child protective services and present this to the magistrate.  My ex's defense is ""I work nights and my alarm doesn't wake me up.""  - She recently moved to a new house in a different neighborhood.  Evidently, based on my child's explanations to me, once I drop her off with her mom in the morning, she basically spends all day taking care of herself while mom sleeps.  This includes running around the neighborhood with a neighbor child or playing at their house.  Often when I come to pick up my daughter in the evenings, I have to then turn around and walk over to this other person's house just to get my kid.  My ex's excuse:  ""I tell her she has to check in every two hours.""  When asked what happens if she doesn't check in, would she even wake up to notice? ""I set an alarm on my phone to wake me up"" (nevermind the above point of an alarm not waking her to pick up her own child from school...)  - I have reason to believe that she occasionally abuses prescription medication.  She worked at a hospital in the ER in the past and now currently works for a nursing home.  In the past, when we were still living together and were on the skids, I was doing laundry one night and a loose valium fell out of her scrub pocket.  This is coupled with the fact that she has admitted to having some drinking problems in the past, while we were separated but not divorced.  This is in addition to a really weird interaction we had this last Saturday where she arrived at my house, unannounced at 2pm, claiming she was there to pick up our daughter. (1. she rarely if EVER picks up my daughter from my house. 2. I always have my daughter on the weekend)  She mumbled a bit about being there to pick up our daughter, forgot and thought it was Tuesday (1. It's Saturday 2. She's literally never picked up our kid from my house on a weekday, I come home from work on weekdays and pick her up from HER house) and then she mumbled an apology and drove off...  I'm not terribly familiar with substance abuse, but that seemed extremely weird.  My Ex's excuse: ""I had been working all day and was really tired and just totally exhausted and out of my mind.""  When I told her it would be easily confused with being stoned, she simply said ""I'm not on drugs""  - She recently decided, against my wishes, to take in her 17 year old cousin who is currently being tried along with her boyfriend for selling pills, stealing her sister's gun, shoplifting from a department store and then getting pulled over by the police.  She is currently on house arrest (I guess?  I'm hardly an expert.  She's to stay there under 24/7 supervision until her court appearance and not to be left alone or see her boyfriend until after the trial.)  Anyway, I expressed my opinion that I did not want my daughter to be there with her and that I thought it was a dumb decision to allow her cousin to stay there and that it was her immediate family's responsibility.  She then told me that I could pay for childcare while I was at work, since I was the one that had a problem with the arrangement.  (I make 38k a year.  I just can't afford to do that for a month, a majority of my income would go to just paying for daycare.  I will be starting a job in a few days where I'll start making about 20% more, but it won't be in time to help with this.)  I was sort of coerced into moving here against my will when we were still married, and I can't lean on family for support, as my closest family is 6 hours away.  She currently is spending her days at my ex's house and I pick her up every night to spend the night with me.  - Today, the reason that drove me to make this post -- I went to pick up my daughter from her house at 6:20 like I always do, and my ex's housebound criminal cousin answers the door, tells me my ex isn't there and that my daughter is across the street with the neighbors.  I check with the neighbors and she's not there, hasn't been all afternoon.  I go back to the house and her cousin says she doesn't know where my ex or my daughter went off to.  I haven't heard from my ex all day.  She's not answering anyone's phone calls or text messages.  I call her family, no one knows where they are, but all basically have something to say along the line of ""I don't know what the hell her problem is, I never hear from her and I don't approve of what's going on with your daughter.""  About an hour later my ex finally responds to my calls and calls me back.  She took my daughter an hour and a half away to go out on a boat on the lake with her new boyfriend.  After about 10 minutes of me (embarrassingly) losing my shit, she finally admits ""I dropped the ball"".  Like it wasn't a big deal.  So, this is basically what's been going on.  And to be honest, I don't want to do it at all, but I'm thinking it may be time to look into filing for custody.  I didn't do it when we were filing for a no contest divorce because 1. It seemed unfair to my daughter and I didn't want to make things more stressful. 2. Her family is well to do and there's a lot of rumors about her dad being mobbed up.  In some of our more fiery arguments in the past, if I brought up custody, she threatened that her dad's lawyers would bury me and I'd never see my daughter.  3. If I got sole custody, I don't know if I have the support in this city to be a single dad and I'm pretty sure I'd have to move back home to the midwest, about 6 hours away until I could figure out what to do.  I'm really upset right now and I don't know what else to do.  Hell, I don't even really know what questions to ask.  This really isn't something that's in my wheelhouse and I have no experience with this sort of thing.  Do I have a case if I was to file for custody?  I know courts tend to favor the mothers in these scenarios, and I don't want to run the risk of losing my daughter.  How much would this cost?  At my new position with the raise, I think I could put away about $400-$500/month, currently, I don't have any savings, really.  I've been wiped out with some bad car stuff and it's zeroed my savings.  Is there any sort of evidence I could be compiling or a case I could be making at this time?  I have a lot of people and friends who know what's been going on and they have all said that they would be happy to help in any way possible, but my friends and family are all low class working schlubs and I couldn't ask them for money.  I don't know /r/legalhelp...  I just need help, or at least a direction to be pointed in."	Yes
Hey everyone and thanks for any advice in advance. I have already contacted two lawyers that specialize in this kind of thing. I am waiting to hear back.   So last sunday my now ex went back to the hospital to be admitted for the 5th time because of her refusal to stay in treatment for her bi-polar and psychosis.(im using that as a catch all because eash time she goes in they call it something different. Schizophrenia, schizophreniform and a number of other things)   I am just tired of it. We have put alot of effort into this and she drops out of treatment every time. This is the first time she has gone twice in one year. Just last month was the other time.  I really don't want her having full physical custody of the children because i dont feel like she will stay in treatment again anyways. Besides some of the stuff ahe tells them when she is having an episode i dont think she has the means by herself.   I have supported her for years, someone always has. The support she wouldb get from me would no where near enough to raise two children in a decent setting.  The other complication is we are moving out this week and she wont be welcome. I wont be staying in this house anymore and neither will the children. I told her i would give her a key to getv her things but the electric and water will be off on the 26th. So there is no point in her staying here. The only place she could go is her dads and he has begged me not to pawn her off on him. .  As far as the boys go.. I offered to do an unnoficial agreement where they live with me and she can come get them whenever she wants. But i dont know how well that will work. Or if it is even legal.  With the info i provided do i have a chance? This is scary because i have heard so many stories of how men get screwed on this stuff.   Isv there anything i can do to prepare?	Yes
My aunt died of cancer a year ago in August. She left behind my niece with her father. He immediately threw everything that belonged to her mother out and quit his job a month later. We are not sure if my aunt had an insurance policy or if they are receiving death benefits, but he hasn't not worked yet, but the cars and mortgage are still being paid.  He never got my niece counseling, and doesn't take her anywhere; she takes the bus to school. He doesn't buy groceries and is in the garage drinking all day, or at his families drinking and he leaves her alone. He doesn't have insurance on her, not even Medicaid. My mom can't get her healthcare because she doesn't have any documentation, and my niece doesn't have access to her documentation like her SSN and birth certificate.  My mother went to visit with my BIL and my niece told her she had no food. My mother and BIL both checked and there was nothing but a bit of frozen chicken. When my mom confronted my cousin (he is my cousin on my Dad's side, who married my mom's sister) he said there was food and freaked out. He was cursing her out. My mother ended up buying groceries and hiding them in my niece's room.   My niece was raised at my mothers house until she was like 6 or 7 as her parents were staying with my mom. What can my mother do to gain custody of her sister's child? My mother is very financially comfortable and has more than enough room for her. My mom normally takes care of her for the summer and she is here now. I know my cousin will put up a fight, and my niece is counting the years left until she is 18 and is very lonely and depressed.	Yes
Hello,  As the title says, I am on my ex (husband's) insurance plan as a dependent. I am not able to get onto a different health insurance plan without cancelling this one. They say that only the primary account holder can have me removed from the plan, but my ex and I are not on speaking terms. Is this legal? Do I really have no say in this? I live in Canada, btw.  Thanks in advance...	Yes
"Hey all,   We are getting married at a small town protestant church and asked one of the elders of the congregation to officiate.  He says it's his first wedding, and mine too. My question is are we good to go with him just being an elder, or does he need to get some kind of license?   Texas law says ""(3) a person who is an officer of a religious organization and who is authorized by the organization to conduct a marriage ceremony"" which is somewhat vague but sounds good enough to me.  Just covering my bases"	Yes
About 6 months ago I found out that my ex wife &amp; her new boyfriend were abusing my son. I took my son to the hospital &amp; filed a police report. Son was covered in bruises when ex dropped him off. CPS got involved &amp; all visitation was taken away from ex. I previously had him 70% of the time. Ex agreed to go to parenting classes &amp; the DA refused to press charges against her or BF despite them both admiring to the abuse.  We have now moved in to the maintenance part of CPS &amp; CPS is requiring we split custody. Both my lawyer &amp; myself are not happy with CPS caliver approach to my ex, but have discovered we don't have much recourse.   Yesterday the CPS worker called me &amp; said that she has yet to do her monthly visit with my son for July &amp; said she would meet with him on Thursday. I told her she could come by my house. She told me she had to meet with him at my ex's house since she realized she has never seen it. Side note: the original CPS order said CPS had to meet with my son once a month &amp; also meet with my ex-wife separately once a month. Which the worker has admitted hasn't happened. There is no obligation for CPS to come to my house but I have been allowing it because I don't care &amp; my main concern is my son.   So I told the worker that Thursday's are my custodial time. I have him from Wednesday-Saturday. So he was already at my exes house when I spoke to CPS. She said I have to take him to my ex's house. I told her fine but I want a specific time since I will be picking him up after they are done meeting &amp; keeping him for the rest of my time. She said she doesn't have a time since she has to be in court all day &amp; is unsure when she will get out. She suggested I just take him to my exes around 2pm &amp; then he can stay through his time with her. Essentially denying my custody time. I told her no I wanted to spend time with my son during my time. I also asked her if she had spoken to my ex to ensure she would be home. The worker told me no she hadn't yet &amp; asked if I could on her behalf. I told her no because of the no contact order I got against my ex after she threatened me.   Do I have to take my son to meet at my exes house? What recourse do I have? I just want to see my son &amp; the worker seems so against that. Help please!	Yes
Hi all.  My lawyer is on vacation for another week, so looking for some general guidance until she returns. It looks like I may need to make some decisions before she gets back.   I live in Massachusetts and am in the middle of an uncontested divorce with my husband. We are selling our marital home and I will be buying a new one in my name only. It looks like the house sale and new purchase will take place during the divorce nisi process. Is there something I should do to protect myself when making an offer on my new place to prevent my soon-to-be-ex-husband from having a claim to the title?   Thanks!	Yes
Hi,  I'm about to file for a divorce in NJ. I'm currently living with my parents but have yet to change my address, meanwhile my wife is in the house we both own. The other issue is that we are trying to sell the house so I'm hesitant about starting the process when the address may change during the course of it. Should I begin anyway? Or should I wait until after the house is sold and we have settled into new addresses?	Yes
"Not getting into details why or when. Just got couple of questions:  1. confused about CIS if still living together how to determine ""mine"" or ""his"" expenses. We have joint bank account and I have mine. He is too lazy to make his own bank account. Our expenses are shared - I pay certain bills, he pays other ones.   2. What if I can't get paperwork from him to include my case, say tax forms, 401K account info, his stocks and side businesses, insurances. He stonewalls me and just ignores my requests.  3. We have 2 kids together and I have one from previous relationship. I am now citizen, but my son from previous relationship came to US with K4 visa and he was the petitioner. No amount of talking made him continue getting my son's paperwork in order and now it's a moot point. Would anyone know if there are any issues if I file for I-130 even though he was the petitioner?  Basically he doesn't want divorce, but doesn't want to be husband either. He wants to date other people, but gets the benefits of someone cleaning home, prepping food etc and I want to move on."	Yes
My sister (23) and myself (24f) were sexually assaulted by our older cousins (I'll use their initials, E, L, C) when we were younger. The youngest E is 3 years older than me, and C the oldest, is 6 years older than me, L being the middle child. My sister had reported to my mom that E had done something to her when she was about 10 and demanded my dad do something about it. My dad couldn't believe that his nephew E would do such thing and decided they would no longer stay over. At the time, I was also going through some questionable things with the older sister L  and because of the lack of support, I never spoke up about her and I've suppressed those memories (for the life of me I cannot remember what she did, but that it confused me). Two other aunts, my father's sisters, contacted my mother about their daughters suddenly showing sexual behaviors at such a young age. These cousins are about 6 years younger than we are. Those aunts didn't report it, again, because it's family and denied it when my mom did decide to call the cops.  All of this caused strain between my sister and dad, and of course my dads side of the family. Recently I spoke to a counselor about a memory in which I woke up to my pants being pulled down and my cousins L &amp; C hovering above me, to which they giggled and said they were playing a prank. They stopped, but in my sleepy haze, I could see my other cousin E at my sisters waist with her pants down. I fell back asleep and always beat myself up for never mentioning that. My counselor reminded me that I wasn't the adult and what happened wasn't in my control. I eventually came and told my sister this, to which she responded that she knew I knew something this whole time but didn't remember that specific incident. She waited for me to be ready and she understood why I stayed quiet. I told her that if it would help her quality of life and help her move past her fears that I would be with her every step (as much as distance and work would allow) of the process if she decided to press charges. She did, or is trying to. The detective says none of the other victims want to speak out. I'll be talking to her next week and will be giving my account of one situation no one but myself can remember. Not having correct dates and ages makes me hesitant it'll do anything.   When dealing with old situations with little to no evidence, what can one expect in Illinois? It scares me like no other that they won't have any repercussions for taking my sister's innocence and then tormenting her, her whole childhood. One of the cousins got a lawyer, and the other two won't speak to the detective.  Any advice would be great.	Yes
I am unable to locate my ex-spouse.  We are in contact with their lawyer; however, the lawyer will only accept service if we delay our case conference--I would like to maintain our case conference date so we can start filing motions.  However, they have mail forwarding from the house to their new address.  Can I send registered mail with return receipt / signature to the house, and let Canada Post deal with forwarding it to their new address?  Is this acceptable as service?  Does this make sense?	Yes
Background : I'm 18 living in TX. My grandmother started a 529 fund for me in her name for college before she had a stroke and became hospitalized. She is still alive, however, my father, whom I no longer live and have a struggling relationship with, is her power of attorney. Previously this year I tried to get the 529 in my name so that my father couldn't take any money from the account to use for his own personal things, he has an untrustworthy past with money, and the bank that I have the 529 through basically told me to go away and they kept all information of the account secure from me. For this coming year, I am attending college online and need a place to live. I am renting an apartment this August and I am trying to save my money to have an emergency fund. I asked my father to pull out $2,000 from the account to help pay for my living expenses while I am a student and he said he would. Unfortunately, he said he would give me the money in cash which was weird because the money from the account comes in checks that are made out to me. This tipped off a few red flags and I looked further into it and found out that he has been taking $2,000 from the 529 account for the past 7 months (since January) in my grandmother's name. He is unaware that I know he's been doing this and I don't want to confront him directly because I need the $2,000 that he has for my rent.   Questions: What amount of money can I sue my father for on my grandmother's behalf?  Just the money that was taken from the account?   Is there any amount of money that I can personally sue him for? For things like emotional distress or anything like that?  He's been making my life very difficult these past few years and hasn't  paid a dime to help for things like my car, living expenses, or college.	Yes
The situation has escalated, these are the facts: - huge change in behavior - making grandiose claims - completely withdrawn from family, which is highly against their character  Essentially for almost the past year they have changed drastically.  They have a mental disorder (perhaps bipolar, they won't share their diagnosis but the behavior seems to line up with a manic episode).  Most of the family hasn't seen her in almost a year, one member saw her 3 months ago and was disturbed by their behavior.  Recently it came to light that they had sent a message to another family member speaking like they won't be here much longer, and apologizing for past misdeeds.  Both red flags for suicide.  Their spouse claims this individual is the happiest, most energetic they have ever been and to leave them alone.  When asking to visit or just talk this individual becomes irritable and hostile.  The parents just want them evaluated, if they see nothing dangerous/wrong with them we would all be ecstatic.  On the flip side, they could receive the help the they need.  I am concerned that because they haven't outright said they are going to harm themselves a police wellness check will not be successful.  Is there a legal procedure that allows their parents to force a psych eval?   Thank you for any and all input.	Yes
If both parties are in agreement and there is no mutually owned property or assets, how quickly can one get divorced? Does it need to be dragged out for 6 months if every thing is copacetic? Do you really need an attorney?	Yes
Ill try to keep this short. My friend was recently given custody of his child in Texas. Yet he has to pay back child support in Oklahoma. In the mean time she does NOT have to pay child support until she gets paid back in full.   WTF?  Thats the gist of it. I was there when the court awarded him custody of his son so I know its legit on that part. But my friend claims that because he was behind by 6k, he can not receive child support until he pays off the remaining balance.   How does this work? What can be done to fix it? This guy is seriously living in poverty until he can start to receive some money here. He worked 40 hours a week and has more than 60 percent of his check taken by child support. She recently started working again after finishing rehab and still does not have to pay child support.   How does this work and what can be done to fix it?	Yes
My mom has been dating the same man for a few years. I am an 18 year old male in Atlanta, GA. Last night I was angry with him and called him an 'old man' and a 'loser' and he pushed me against the wall and gave me a black eye. I got up in his face but did not throw any punches. Can I attempt to charge him for assault as I fear he does the same thing to my mom?  picture: http://imgur.com/a/pkYqr	Yes
I'm gonna try and keep this short. 3 years ago my parents separated. I had to live with my mom because my dad was deployed. I wanted to live with my dad for w years after that point and finally got my wish a year ago when they divorced and my mom gave my dad custody. well turns out he lied about everything. He had a new fiance and she had 2 kids of her own. I hated living there for the past year because my dad told me up to that point it would just be us and the fact that his fiance is insane. She controls him and  tells him what to do and constantly controls everything. Every notices this including my own sister. .This past year of my life has ruined me in every way possible. Emotionally mentally physically I'm just exhausted. This summer in July I was sent down to TX to visit my mom for the summer and it's been amazing and I am 100% certain I want to stay here. Problem is my dad is going back on his promise saying he would allow me to come back if I wanted to. My flight to go back to VA is on the 26th of this month and he's made it clear if I don't go he *will* call the cops on my mom. I don't wanna go away and I think I'm just gonna run away on the 26th tbh. I've expressed all of my emotions and that I will run away and he still doesn't care. I told him the only way I'm going back to VA is in chains because there's no way I'll willingly get on a plane. My mother said she filed for emergency hearing or something like that a couple days ago but it may not go through or something or not in time so she said I have to go back until then. What do I do? I won't go back. Please, any help is appreciated and forgive me for how horribly this was written and formatted I'm just writing fast and I'm desperate.	Yes
I have filled out a template that an attorney created in order to get my grandfather's birth certificate from New York state, I'm just not certain that in tailoring it to my specific case that I have maintained its accuracy. I need his birth cert. because I am applying for dual Italian citizenship and a court order is the only way to get it. I live in Oregon and will be doing everything remotely. Basically, I know nothing about court proceedings, filing, the process, etc. If I make a mistake in my documents, will I be given the chance to fix it, or will my filing fee be wasted and my filing ignored? Also, the template was created on the assumption that I would be going in person to file, and therefore includes blank spaces for dates and times of scheduled appearances. Do I remove those items entirely, or leave in (and leave blank) because my documents will eventually get before a judge at a certain time on a certain date? Thank you!	Yes
"My state appointed lawyer is trying to get the neglect charge dropped however, the lawyer informed me it's unlikely they will drop the charge. If the state refuses to drop the neglect charge, what happens when I refuse to admit to the neglect? Family law doesn't require the state to provide actual evidence in any charges therefore, the neglect charge is based on hearsay. My child was never neglected in anyway, shape or form and I refuse to let them put neglect on my record without fighting for myself. My state appointed lawyer told me its ""not a big deal"" however, I disagree. A neglect charge can impact a hypothetical custody battle and my career. I have worked with children for the past several years until a few months before this happened but I intended on returning to that field of work. A neglect charge will go on my CANTS report and will disqualify me for any position in that field. A family member was angry with me and decided to call dcyf with crazy allegations on drug use etc. When they came to investigate I admitted to being prescribed suboxone when asked what medications I regularly take. I have been prescribed this medication for nearly 8 years. My daughter is under 8 years old.  I was honest bc I didn't have anything to hide after all, it's a legal medication prescribed to me by a doctor. I've been clean since being prescribed nearly 8 years ago. However, the state used this against me. I've been doing everything they tell me to do including random drug testing which are all clean. My question is, once I tell the state I'm not admitting to the charge, what happens and how do I go about it?"	Yes
"I filed a preliminary protection order against a man for me and my son. I spoke with the judge explained what happened and she granted the protection order and marked the box with the most strict form of protection available which  states the respondent is to ""have no contact of anykind‚Äù with me or my son. In our city there are no other types of protection orders and there is no space for a note more specific instructions like a distance the respondent is supposed to be within.  My son's mother has taken our son to stay at the home of the respondent. After calling the police twice the police have shown up to the house and told me even though they are in the same house together the respondent has not violated the order. The first day they said they promised to stay on opposite parts of the house. The second day the same supervisor in charge contacted me and said he checked on my son and determined he was ""safe"" and that I was not to call anymore.  Not sure what to do but go request to see the judge in the morning and have her wrote a specific instructions for ""no contact of any kind"" on the protection order somewhere."	Yes
My husband and I are splitting up and we are in a disagreement over the division of assets.    I am buying him out of the mortgage and the kids will be living with me full time - at this point he won't have over night access.    My two questions are:   1) is he entitled to half of the children's furniture, toys etc  2) the appliances were included with the purchase of the house, is he entitled to half of them since I am buying the house from him?   Unfortunately things are not going very smoothly and things have escalated in his behaviour to where Women in Crisis and Children's Aid are involved. I don't want to provoke him to more anger but I also want what is fair.    My worker for WIC said that I was being more than generous in what I was prepared to give and my ex  thinks I am being unreasonable. I honestly want what's fair.	Yes
Hi r/legaladvice!   Here's a complicated issue for you all. This is regarding my aunt and uncle, and my aunt has to make a decision regarding a forbearance agreement by the middle of August. I've tried to keep the explanation succinct and impersonal.  There are 3 important parties in this discussion. Company, Partner A (Anna) and Partner B (Bob). Anna &amp; Bob are getting a divorce after 20+ years of marriage. The company was started by Bob, but Anna has signing rights. Bob has become an expat and has essentially dumped the failing company onto the company executives and Anna.  Company has been struggling for the past 10 years, and losing money. A unknown number of years ago (between 5 and 10) a loan of 1M was taken out for the company. The collateral was the family home. This was the only home at the time.  Now, Bob lives in [expat country] in a house that was purchased by both Anna and Bob but the house is listed only under Bob's name. Anna lives in Canada in the family home. Divorce agreements were set up such that Bob would keep the expat house and Anna would keep the Canadian house.  A couple of weeks ago, the bank decided that the company was too much of a liability and sent the executives a forbearance agreement. The forbearance asked for 600,000$ against Anna's family home. The company must prove that they are doing better by February or the bank will seize the house as payment. Note that the husband (bob) is not risking his own home and that Anna would not receive any money from the home since it is in his name.  Please advise! Anna doesn't know if she should sign this forbearance or not. Either, Anna doesn't sign and the bank could sell the house and she would receive approximately 900,000 after the bank takes what is owed. She would then need to split that with her husband. If she signs the forbearance than the company *might* do well in the next 6 months, OR the house might need to be sold in February and she would get half of 400,000.  Any advise regarding any of these things would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
I'm not sure if I have flat out proof of her premeditated planning to fabricate an altercation in order to get a restraining order, but it seems that way.   This is a no fault state, I understand that, so I'm not asking for sympathy about this sad situation, just advice.   I'm a Navy veteran, we were married for nearly all of my Navy career. I got out in 2009 because I couldn't stand her infidelity when I was out to sea. (pathetic, I know.) We now have a 9 year old son with his own story this has effected.  We purchased a boat inside a boathouse in the Seattle area a few years ago. I was in school on the GI Bill at the time but have never made as much money as my wife since the Navy.   We were renters before the boat and boathouse. Here's the kicker. I've always had the VA loan program available, but her grandmother died and left her plenty of money.   It was then that she quit her job, we bought this boat home with plans to renovate it, sell it down the road. It wasn't much, but COULD BE CONSIDERED PART IF HER INHERITANCE, even though we're both equal legal owners.    Since then, I've spent the last year working tirelessly to build equity in the investment we went on. She got another job and likes it. The place is worth much more now than when we bought it, because of my labor.   During this time, I've worked on the home or been a stay at home parent, doing side jobs here and there to support our dream.  She got a boyfriend though. She has insisted on a separation to retroactively excuse her cheating, but that's emotional crap.   Her and my son now spend three nights a week at this boyfriend's house and I'm here on the boat paying moorage.   Questions:  1) How will custody look if we don't already have a parenting plan in place?   2) Can she just uproot me from our family home at a whim because it was purchased in part with an inheritance from her side of the family?  3) Is it unethical to find her new secret address where my son has gone for months, or in my best interest?   Realistically, there is no way she can maintain a boat and boathouse alone. It's not in her wheelhouse. Clearly she plans to move him here to help.   Am I about to be homeless?	Yes
A few years ago after my mother's divorce she found a boyfriend, things started out well enough but once he moved in it went over the edge. He physically abused myself, and emotionally and mentally everyone else in the household (Mother, Sister and I). They have since separated and gone their different ways. After the breakup however new details came to light as to his past. Apparently he had innapropiate contact with his children and with other children. This came to us as he had left an Ipod/IPhone when he moved out where he recorded conversations with a counselor at his children's school and a psychologist as he went through his divorce. He currently works as girls soccer coach at a middle school in Durham NC. Both my mother and I fear what he can do as he is a master manipulator. I want to bring this to light for his employer, but I want to get my ducks in a row, by finding the names of his children or ex-wife in Georgia. How would I go about finding this information? I know divorce records are publicly available but as I live across the country in Washington State I don't know if I'll be able to access them. Any advice is appreciated and I apologize for the text wall and any mistakes I may have made wether it be formatting or posting guidelines.	Yes
"Okay, parents got divorced 7 years ago. Both have since remarried. I am their eldest child at 26; my youngest sister is 16.   Technically my parents split custody, with my mom as primary. My father (we do not speak; he blames me for the divorce) sees my sister maybe a weekend every other month despite my mother making her available.   So, onto questions. My father is moving to reopen the divorce, I am guessing to renegotiate my sister's custody and child support. He has never followed the parenting plan, stopped working full time in order to pay almost no child support (while living off his trust), and is now claiming that my mother is not communicating with him/keeping my sister from him. My mother has piles of emails to prove otherwise.   He has threatened to bankrupt her with court proceedings in the past. Is there a point at which  him repeatedly dragging her into court for non-issues or just made up ones becomes a legal issue?   He is also extremely likely to push for my sister (who has her license) to begin to do the 3 hour drives to and from his house, in order to make it more ""fair"". My sister has a restricted license as she has a medical condition that is well controlled but she still has occasional issues; currently he and my mother meet halfway for pickups and drop offs. This will be thrown out, right?  And at what point is my sister able to say ""I really don't actually want to visit dad and Stepbitch""?  And what does ""reopening the divorce"" actually mean?  Also his lawyer is openly bitchy, unprofessional and rude in emails to my mom and her lawyer. Can she be reported for this?  TL;DR: Dad is asshole who pulls mom back into court or mediation over non-issues in parenting plan, or flat out fabricated problems. His lawyer is openly rude and unprofessional in emails to my mom/her lawyer. What are the consequences of these two things/are there even consequences?   Also, he wants my sister (who has a medical issue) to drive 3 hours each way to bring herself to and from him on his weekends as opposed to him meeting my mom halfway. This will be thrown out, right? Is my sister old enough to say ""I don't want to see him""?"	Yes
Since I was 4 and my sister was 3, we had lived with our mother after escaping our abusive father. When we were teenagers, my mom finally got our dad to start paying the child support he owed us (somewhere in the realm of $90,000). And we have received fairly regular payments since then. We even continued to receive payments after we both became adults, and my mom usually gave the money to us to help with our college expenses. My sister and I are 21 and 22 now.  In March of last year my mom died. It was devastating to my sister and I, as she was our only real family in the world. We have never even met our father. My mother left us a lot of paperwork, instructing us what to do after she died. One of the papers explains that we have the right to continue to collect child support after her death (sec. 154.013 in the Texas statutes is what she referenced).  I‚Äôve tried to talk to our local child support office about it, but they were clueless and told me that the Waco Child support office would call us about it. They never did, so we called them but it was just never ending recorded voice prompts. I‚Äôve had to move cities, and transfer schools all while dealing with my moms death, and it‚Äôs hard for me to find time to drive to Waco. And it‚Äôs hard for my sister to find time too, as she recently graduated from college and has started working long weeks.  I guess my question is, how should I go about collecting this child support? Should I be able to change it with the child support office or will I need an attorney? Also, since some of the child support has been used during this time, are we facing legal trouble for not changing this sooner? Would we be better off just closing the account and sacrificing that money?  I‚Äôm way out of my element with all of this.	Yes
I have struggled with drug use on and off for the past several years. My drug of choice was opiates. Recently after losing my job I had a brief lapse and consumed a few ecstasy pills and unfortunately my high state was noted. To make it clear, this whole issue has risen on the accusations of me being addicted to and using drugs regularly again.  About a month and half ago, I was asked to find another place to live by my mothers roomate, for a completely non drug related reason. He has no idea of my past or anything , it was a long time coming.  I moved back to my hometown (Tacoma, WA)  with my son, but unfortunately was not able to find a home for both of us suitable enough in time.  So my son went to stay with my dad, and I stayed with friends. I continued my search for a home, obtained a part time nanny gig, and signed up for benefits (food stamps), all while diligently visiting my son everyday, or pretty dang close.  I found a place to live with my son and was set to move in on july 20th. I informed my parents and continued visiting my son. One day he is not at my dad and I'm told he's at my moms. Nobody plans anything with me my mom didn't even grab the car seat nothing. I already know it's going on but I give it some time. My parents continue to lie to me about when he's coming back when I continually ask. Finally I get my mom to tell me what is going on and she says that I'm going to be served with papers next week and that she has filed for emergency custody. Today is July 23, 2017.  I have some custody from the father, he is not in the picture currently. If was to come in the picture, could he retrieve my son? Could he over ride their custody so to speak?  Can I go and retrieve my son since I haven't been served yet?    I can't afford a lawyer.   What is the process of this situation?  What are the steps I should take?  What can I most likely expect?	Yes
I found that my child is not my child, the mother and I got married because I thought he was mine, she told me she slept with another guy, but he was sterile. Well 9 months after the baby was born, he doesn't look like me, we're fighting, I take the DNA test, and before I get the results back she moves in with her parents and takes all his things. Turns out he's not mine, we're filing for a divorce based on results of thepaternity, but what do I do to get off the birth certificate. I've called vital records and resources and they say they need a court order to get me off. Is that the same thing I am getting with the divorce? Do i tie it all into the same court case? What do I do? I don't want to pay child support for a kid who is not mine. Also, I know the other guy's name, and where he lives.She doesn't want him to get involved, but I don't want to pay for this kid.	Yes
So basically my gf's mother has always had substance abuse issues, until recently they were manageable. She lost her husband and has gone back to them harder than ever. Xanax being her drug of choice her young son has found her asleep in a bowl of food and in the garage with a cigarette. She just got out of rehab this last week and it didn't seem to help. She is going to endanger herself, the family's house/possessions and we don't know what to do. My gf of course consented to posting this. We are thinking of getting the license plate and name of the dealer that no one knows and is driving her around to find more drugs and calling the cops. Can they help? Any options at all here?  Thank you tons in advance and please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit.	Yes
From my understanding, different states have different rules regarding marriage, in all sorts of different ways. Without getting into a story that is the length of a novel, are there any major reasons why a woman marrying a terminally ill man would abruptly change plans and want to get married in Florida instead of New York? Would it change anything when the worst happens with regards to inheritance and his children?	Yes
Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	Yes
My father left my mother last week, and has officially filed the paperwork for divorce.  I'm trying to help my mother wade through this process as best I can.  The two of them are on pretty amicable terms, and he's presented a pretty fair division of assets offer that she seems ok with.  I just have a few questions on the process, and what else I can do/read to make sure we're doing what's in her best interest.  This is in Texas.  I set her up with a few consultations with various family lawyers when I found out he had gotten one, just so she would be represented.  One thing they brought up was spousal support which is it something that we had considered.  She works in a commission based field with minimal job history, is this something even worth pursuing?  If she doesn't have a lawyer, is she able to petition for spousal support herself if it's not in the initial divorce paperwork?  What else should I be reading, looking into to understand how to help best in this situation.	Yes
I witnessed my (Indonesian) wife attempt to murder our daughter (Two YO), forcing her to drink bleach. Daughter recovered.  I told my mother then and wife confessed to her days later also.  Wife has disappeared with daughter now, demanding ransom over the phone ($20k). I have no legal recourse currently there, and no escape path for her.  I want my elderly mother's witness to my wife's confession to her reported legally, ASAP.  It may be useless, however some day I hope at least that my daughter could see the confession, documented at law firm here.   Could you please recommend a service type?	Yes
Let me first start out by saying I have legal custody. I am wondering what I can do and if this constitutes me getting more custody. Or at least seeing my son more. My son was living with his father and his stepmother. They have recently separated and my son is still living in the house. His father has moved out and refuses to speak to me or my family.  That, the no communication part has been going on for years. No communication.   My son is still there living with his step mother.  My son is now currently living with someone who has no legal ties to him. ?  We did have a court order but he refused to abide by it. Unless it helps him in some way.   I live out of state now and i want to see my son more and need to know what to do. We have gone to court before in massachusetts. I am asking if I can file here in California and send it to Massachusetts then wait for the court date? Not really sure how that works.  update- I found out today that my sons father is now moving in with another woman who has 3 children. He's still technically married. He told my son he's moving in there too.  He told my son not to tell me anything that was going on for fear I would take him to court.  My son has a phone that his father takes away from him when he's with my family. He also looks at his text messages so my son was afraid to text me to tell me what was going on. The fact my child has to hide our conversations breaks my heart.   My son says he is okay with the situation.  I am not. He says he wants to visit me but his father refuses to let him until he's 18. I don't think that's legal? My son is now 13 and I was also wondering if he can speak for himself in court if needed? I just want my son to be happy. I am just concerned with the living situation. I also just want to see him more and be more apart of his life. I go back home as much as I can to see him but I'd like him to see California. His father makes everything impossible and I don't want to start any drama I just want to see my son more and make sure he is happy. Please any advice will be helpful.	Yes
You know, to have best of both worlds? Keeping the wife happy by knowing I wont ever leave her empty handed, but also having all the benifits of being two separate owners of our various assets in case something happens during a business venture or whatever	Yes
So I know similar questions have been asked about this, but my current bf's situation is completely different and I can't talk to anyone about this and feel completely alone.   My partner just got a call from a one night stand he had 5 years ago claiming he has a four year old child. (they worked together at the same company so she found his number through mutual friends on Facebook) Anyway, when she was 6 months pregnant she said to him that it might be his but then weeks later said it wasn't and that she had slept with two other men that same week and that he shouldn't worry. Well she called two weeks ago for the first time in 2 years and insisted it was his, wants child support and that he should come and do a paternity test immediately. My boyfriend only told me this yesterday, I've never seen him this nervous and upset.   The problem is, is that we live in a different country now. Have been for 3 years.  So he would have to fly a 13 hour flight and pay for the expensive test. Well he doesn't have to but is scared she might go to court, convince them that its his and put a block on his passport or a warrant for his arrest. Probably would have to get lawyers involved as well. He has a job, responsibilities here and can't just leave. We're quite serious in our relationship and this might change every dynamic of it, I guess I'm just lost and he doesn't really know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.	Yes
Person issuing my wife US Citizenship certificate a coupole of years ago changed the spelling of her first name and removed the middle name. She went to SS and was given a replacement with the new changes as they are on the US Citizenship. She didn't realize that the middle name was removed because it wasn't listed and that this would be the identity. My question is does she have to change her license too?  	Yes
I am looking for some help on how to best (meaning as easily as possible) adopt my adult step daughter. Her mother and I were married for 8 years. We are no longer married but we have an amicable and friendly relationship. After the divorce I stayed involved in my step kids lives because... Well I loved them. After we divorce I was obviously no longer consider her step-dad. Over the past few years I have gone to her graduation, sent her birthday and Christmas gifts. She is 19 now and soon to be 20. She currently lives in Tennessee and I live in Georgia. We both joke about how I call her my daughter and she calls me dad, but when people start asking normal questions about our family. It doesn't take long until they get that confused look on their faces as they try to work out the family relationships because I have a very not nuclear family structure. So it takes us each about 10 min of explaining until they get the full picture.  So we talked about it today that I could just adopt her and make it easier and I would then have legal rights as a parent. My ex is fine with it and so is my current wife.  What I really would like help with is what state to file in and if I can keep the costs down by doing it myself.  Thanks in advance üòÑ	Yes
Title pretty much explains it all. I pay all of my living and school expenses, while my parents pay my phone and insurance (which is changing after this.) I claimed myself on my tax returns last year, meaning my parents couldn't claim me. They proceeded to file an amended return on my behalf (without my knowledge/permission,) which caused me to owe the IRS $1200+, and my return to be garnished this year. They refuse to pay it. My mother also broke into my bank account yesterday, and transferred my savings into her account. When I called the bank to report fraud, she shut my phone off. I am planning to walk there myself (they hid the keys from me... yes, they're abusive narcs with whom I will be going NC when I move in a few weeks,) and my mom is saying she will report me as a missing person. Help!	Yes
I haven't seen my twin daughters in over a month. She told me she was moving with them to SC but never specified when, I didn't find out until I asked to see them yesterday because she has me blocked on social media.  It really caught me off guard and I was wondering if calling the police would do anything? Can she be arrested for taking them without my permission? Is what she did illegal at all? I know I'm definitely the father but I'm not on the birth certificate because I wasn't there at the birth and didn't even know they were born until hours later. Any advice would be great.	Yes
"Hello,  Let me start by saying, that I know very little about any sort of legal process or have even been in a court before.    I know this is poking my head into issues that don't involve me, but I feel like my mom and my aunt are rather neglectful of my Grandmother, and are about to offload their responsibility onto me.  Late last year, before the winter, she and my aunt moved out to Arizona, and my Grandma bought a trailer in a trailer park for senior citizens 100% on her dime.  My Aunt, who is the medical POA, lives with her.  She has done nothing with such power.  My Sister, who is a CNA at a nursing home, has implored her time and time again to declare her medically incompetent.  However, my aunt shows no interest in doing so, and this is the woman that was originally given this power because 'she'd be the one with the courage to pull the plug'  Now, my Grandma is coming back home to West Virginia, while my aunt gets to stay in her house on my Grandma's dime.  The second home she has done with this, but that's a different story.  Last week, my Mom went out west to bring grandma back, and time and time again complained on Facebook about how difficult it is to take care of Grandma and her dementia.    Before she moved out west, my Grandma said that she would like me to watch over her house while I complete College.  The last of the classes I need can be taken Online, so I gladly took her up on this offer.  However, now that she's coming back, my Mom has explained how I will save her so much money by no longer needing to put her in a home because I am up here for the time being.  I am in no way a medical professional, and honestly have a hard time taking care of myself.  I explained to her that I will have a trip to go on in the second week of August, and someone should watch over her while I am not here.  She simply responded with 'if she falls, she falls"", which is disturbing to me.    The worst thing is that my Grandma told both my aunt, my mom, and me that she's been thinking of giving me the house, since I've always liked it growing up, am currently taking care of it now, and long before my Grandma had moved to Arizona, *and*  the she didn't like the fact that her daughters will be selling it before her body is cold.  My Mom told me before she went out west, that she would do everything in her power as the legal POA to prevent this, as 'this house is my retirement plan, and I'm not going to let you take that away from me.""  If there is nothing that can be done, at the least I will treat my mom the same way she treated her Mom, in the future."	Yes
Title pretty much says it all.  I was born in Florida.  My mother placed her husband at the time as my father.  After 40 years I found out my father was not my bio father.  I have since located my bio father, completed the DNA testing and I'd like have my birth record reflect him.    Can this be done?    Thanks in advance for your help.	Yes
I tried searching online, but couldn't find any answers. My [23f] cousin [16f] is about to get her first job. She's already told me her mom has said she will get $20 a month to do what she wants with. The rest of the money will be put into an account only her mother has access to. Her mom is in a lot of debt and did the same thing with her older child. She does not spend the money on bills, she goes out to eat, gets new pets, and always has a different car. My cousin doesn't want her mother anywhere near her hard earned money.   Am I able to set up a bank account for my cousin? It would be only her work checks (and any babysitting money) put into the account. I would have access, but I have no intention of using her money. Is there a way where only she could have access?   Am I opening myself up to legal trouble by interfering with my aunts plans for the money?  I'm also looking into the possibility of her moving in with me due to family issues (specifically her mom), and I don't want to look bad in the eyes of the law when I just want to help her.   Thanks for any advice you have, I really appreciate it.	Yes
I have gone 6 days without sleeping. Having trouble even writing this. Help plzzz 	Yes
"I am trying to divorce my abusive spouse. We've been married 12 years and have a six year old daughter. He has been physically violent for years and has continued to stalk me pretty aggressively throughout our separation. I moved out in Nov. 2016 and officially filed with the courts in Feb. 2017 pro se. He counter petitioned and as I did not have an attorney I was bullied into giving majority custody to him of our daughter. This has proved to be a bad decision as he does not care for her emotional well being and she is now seeing a therapist. He also continues to break the morality clause in our custody orders. I have gone to authorities to attempt to get a Protective Order against him, once with a bruise from him on my body, and they stated that as we are still married and have a child together they thought it best to deny. I have had to fight to get a criminal trespass warning for my home. Since I decided to leave I have been seeing someone else. My boyfriend has been hit multiple times and charges were pressed but they never went anywhere. The local police told him he should just stop seeing me and that I'm getting what I deserve bc I shouldn't be seeing someone while I'm still technically married. On top of physical stalking, he works in IT security and cyber stalks me constantly. He hacks into ALL of my online accounts, wipes or locks out my phone (which he is not on the account or any of my accounts), gets into my bank accounts, paypal etc, and has begun hacking into the network where I work and messing with my payroll stuff as well as posting inappropriate pictures for all of my coworkers to see. Meanwhile, no one will listen to me or acknowledge whats going on no matter what I report. He even reads all my text messages, etc, tracks my whereabouts constantly, and does petty things like driving by my house and setting of my car alarm in the middle of the night. He has recently been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder after a suicide attempt and I feel he is unfit to parent our child. However, I cant afford a retainer for an attorney. I now pay approximately 45% of my income to him for child support, insurance for our daughter, daycare for her while shes with him, and other medical fees each month. My check is already small so this has left me on the brink of homelessness even though I work full time and clean houses on the side. He tells our child awful things like I don't love her and I'm a quote ""fucking whore"" etc constantly which has been very detrimental to her. At this point I'm at my wits end. I feel like no one is listening and I have no where to turn. I would love to free myself and my daughter from this abuse and unsustainable situation, but I don't know what to do. Could anyone tell me how long he can ride this out without signing divorce papers since he counter petitioned? What can I do to lower the amount I pay to him as I am in such dire straits and he makes a few thousand a month more than I do already? Without everything coming out I currently bring home less than a minimum wage employee and cant find an attorney willing to help"	Yes
Okay so this issue takes place in Austin, TX. Here is what is happening and I need advice on this subject...it's for my sister. She had a child when she was 19 with a guy she had only known for 2 months who was involved in some pretty sketchy things illegal things I believe but I am not sure enough to put the people around him at risk. Here's an example when my sisters child was around 3 he would still visit his dad and the dads girlfriend at that time had a twin sister who was threatened to be beaten if she didn't give them the whereabouts obviously they were going for the one who was dating the dad but they didn't know that she had a twin. Anyway, when my sister was with him for about 2 years, he hit her a lot the cops were called maybe 3 or 4 times but she never reported him officially. The child is now six but he stopped taking interest in him when he was 3. When the baby went to see him he would not play with him it was mostly his girlfriend at the time who would look after him. My sister then decided that she didn't feel he was safe seeing him or happy or well taken care of so she didn't let him see him. From what I understand he tried to see him a couple of times. The dad has never NEVER provided for my nephew my sister has always earned all the money and she has supported my nephew financially. The dad wants to see the child now after 3 years and he showed up. He is on the birth certificate my sister wants to get full custody of him. She's afraid for their lives is there anything that she can do to win and protect herself and my nephew from him??	Yes
I have 3 children with my ex, that we had when I was living in NC.  During and after my two pregnancies (twins and another baby within one year) he was very emotionally abusive and unsupportive causing me to bounce back and forth with my babies to my mother,  who was equally difficult to deal with.  Within 6 months after my 2nd pregnancy, I sought help and planned my move back to my family in NJ, where I'm originally from. I met with a lawyer that advised me I would not be kidnapping my children if I left state, for I was the sole caregiver of the children. The final thing was when he caused a disturbance at our house and got arrested, the county issued a temporary order where he could not come to the house until court, his Dad helped me pack the car and I went to NJ.   This was 3 years ago.  The father came once to see them within the first few months and didn't last a few days without starting the mental abuse.  Over The years we have gotten to where he can talk to me without resentment and everything is ok until... The second time was this past December. He stayed at my Mother's and it turned out to be a disaster. She was drunk and starting her bs while he's allowing it, so I left with the kids and he left as well.    Now he always had helped me with extra money for the kids, and pays support.  I know he cares about the kids and even though he was shitty to me in the past,  I  never ever held anything against him when it involves the children. When he didn't see his children all the times he promised in between, that was on him, because every time he would revert back to feeling guilty and holding back from seeing them.  I always made sure to protect the kids from being disappointed by making sure to keep it a secret until I knew it was going to happen. The kids are now turning 5 and turning 4 so they don't really know the difference of having a father.   So this is where the question lies. I'm going to visit in North Carolina with my 3 kids to see his family and spend time with him for 5 days. He is going to rent me a car to drive from New Jersey to him and take care of the kids for school clothes and supplies while we are there in North Carolina.   My whole family is saying I shouldn't trust him that he could pull some shady stuff with the law or the kids and try to have them taken from me. I don't believe that he would go to that extent to hurt the children but I want to make sure that I know my legal rights. They were born in North Carolina, I legally left and they have had residency here in New Jersey for 3 years.  We were never married and have no custody agreement.  How should I protect my children if something were to happen?	Yes
My father was forced to retire in November, due to being diagnosed with dementia.  Part of the divorce settlement between my mother and father was that he would pay her an amount from his retirement account after he retired.  We have since set him up with a financial manager to help with managing his retirement.  As of July 1st, I took over the bulk of his finances, excluding the his IRA.  Based on the advice form the financial manager, we learned that he can get out of paying taxes if he gets a QDRO.  We have an appointment to take care of that this week.  My question is this: is there anything we can do about the harassment?  He isn't able to explain things as well because of the dementia, and at this point, her behavior is nothing more than bullying.  Also, is he at risk of going to jail because he hasn't yet paid?  Additionally, can anyone help me understand the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) a little better?  Any tips for handling this situation would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
"Here's the original post:  ""I just found out that my ex never filed the paperwork I gave him IN NOVEMBER because he ""couldn't afford"" the $200 fee. Other than the fact that I'm still legally married to this fucking loser, I can't get financial aid for spring and summer because they want proof of a divorce that never actually happened. I'm fucking irate. This is just a testiment to how immature and selfish he is. I was actually doing him a favor by making him pay the $200 because he originally owed me $450, but I said I'd forget about it if he paid for the divorce. Now, as a student, he expects ME to pay for it, even though he works full-time and is just irresponsible with his money. I hope his girlfriend sees all this and has second thoughts.""   I'm coming up on my deadline and have no idea what to do. I already missed out on an education when I married him and I don't want to have to work low-wage jobs forever just because my ex is a fucking idiot."	Yes
Okay so I've been on my own for quite a few years now but all I have is my social security card. I just turned 18 few months back and I'd like to get my birth certificate, drivers license, and a credit card. However each of those things require one of the other to receive (ex. Need a drivers license to get a birth certificate, need a birth certificate to get a drivers license, need a birth certificate to get a credit card, etc.)  Please any advice is welcome, I'm going to need to get a job and find a house of my own by the end of the year and I can't do that without all of the above... help!	Yes
Sorry about the formatting, on mobile.   I am a 16-year-old student who lives in South Dakota. My friend, who I'll call Cassie for the purposes of this thread, is also 16 and lives with her parents. She has a younger sister who is 13.  In public, Cassie's parents act like some of the most wonderful people you could ever meet. However, in private they are very abusive towards their daughters. Most of the abuse is emotional, but Cassie recently admitted to me that her parents have hit her and her sister multiple times. They'll insult their daughters until they cry almost every single day, constantly berate Cassie for being dumb (despite her having straight A's) and a disgrace to their family, and tell Cassie and her sister on a regular basis that they are never going to amount to anything if they don't become exactly like their parents. These are only a few examples of the kind of emotional abuse that occurs every day.  Cassie has a whole host of health issues (anxiety, depression, insomnia, and ADHD), many of which are untreated because her parents refuse to believe that she actually has these diseases despite her positively testing for them multiple times. I am concerned that she may be suicidal or will become so in the future.  Her parents are also in a constant surveillance state. The mother has an app on her computer that allows her to look at her daughters' phones at any time, and she constantly goes through their internet histories. Her parents also search her room on a regular basis. This surveillance makes it very, very difficult for her to collect any evidence of their abuse.   My question is this: Is there anything I can do, as her friend, to get her out of this abusive situation?	Yes
"Hi /r/legaladvice,  I am posting primarily on behalf of my boyfriend and his newfound daughter.  To preface the situation, my boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years and have lived together just about as long with full intentions of marriage someday. We have a very stable household and both have steady upper management jobs with reliable incomes.  For backstory, my boyfriend and a woman were dating in California around 2003. Right before he deployed, she became pregnant. By the time that he returned from deployment, the child had already been born. He says that he never signed a birth certificate, but the child has his last name. He cared for her for 2-3 years after birth as if she was his own. When she was 3, he was PCS'd to Georgia and the mother then denied that he was the father entirely, that she had been with other people, etc. It was messy, but there were no legal proceedings then. He took her word for it and moved to Georgia, while the mother and child remained in California.  About 2-3 weeks ago, we were served child support documents (after a few months of notices via mail). When the papers were served, my boyfriend was incredulous because the mother had explicitly said that he was not the father of the child. The child is 12 years old and the paperwork came out of nowhere, nearly a decade after their last contact.  Within days, the daughter found us on Facebook and sent friend requests to each of us, as well as several of his family members with the same last name. Looking at her profile picture, the resemblance is undeniable -- they are 100% related. He accepted her friend request and they have started a relationship via Messenger. While most of the conversations revolve around favorite snacks, animals, innocent stuff, he has uncovered the following things: (1) She does not actually live with her mother, who filed the child support paperwork, (2) She lives with a young woman (older sister or younger aunt, I can't remember) who is ~19 and has two other children of her own, (3) She is often dropped off at Grandma's in a CA/Mexican border town and is allowed to freely walk around alone despite child abduction being all too common, (4) She has a mild case of scoliosis that is not being treated, (5) She commonly eats non-nutritious food and is very thin, including as ramen and ice cream, (6) She is often sad and yelled at by family. One instance involved a woman (whom I believe was her mother visiting) who yelled ""fucking"" at her about 18 times in a 30 second span while on video chat with her dad. The family members with whom she is staying know that she has started talking to her father and accept this and several have encouraged it via comment on a cover photo she created with a picture of her dad, and (7) She has repeatedly asked to come to Georgia over and over and over again.  We have reached out to a GA lawyer with no reply and he has also reached out to an old military buddy in law about the child support, but we are still a little frazzled (understatement) about where to get a foothold. He has decided to petition for full custody, and I am behind him 1000%. But where do we begin? He has already agreed to pay the $1200/month child support to the mother she does not live with, and we also received a petition for health insurance yesterday.  I am assuming we would need to instead find a lawyer located where his daughter lives? How does that conceivably work when we are located 2000 miles away, court-wise? I feel like we are lightyears behind, having waited 3 weeks when she needs us.  Thank you all in advance for any insight and direction."	Yes
Title. I pay court ordered child support that's automatically taken out of my check to my son's mother. I'm not behind, there are no issues there. Today she told me she had to take me back to court because she moved out of the court district that originally ordered the support, but that seems a little strange because it should all be automated within the system at this point (I've been paying for over a year).  Any idea if I have to worry about this being a trick to try and get more or something?  As a side note, when the original order was put in place we were both single and had similar incomes, though I think she had been making a bit more than I was. Now she and I have both gotten married (to different people), and she has quit her job to stay at home. Her husband has a child I believe he pays support for, and my income situation has only changed slightly, but not much more. Also, she is pregnant. My wife and I have not had any children. Because of these changes in life situations I'm concerned that her having to change because she's moved districts is just a cover from her for her to try and get more money out of me. She's a money hungry and incredibly self-centered person and it would not be unprecedented.   Should I be concerned?	Yes
I recently moved to Texas to be closer to my son. The agreements we had before this move (through the courts) was 50/50 legal custody and 100% physical to the mom with myself getting reasonable visitation. It was going mediocre, with the mom being flaky with available times or canceling on me last minute saying other things came up. I already have a court date in August to get formal visitation. On July 6 the mom told me she was going to Washington state to visit family and would be back July 28, today. Last night at 8 pm Washington time she texts me she might be back now August 10th. This has all been through texts and she won't return my calls. I have been unable to serve her court papers since she has been gone.  1) Is this some sort of violation of reasonable visitation or does it not matter since I do not have custody? Is it worth it to have my lawyer mention it to the judge?  2) will this get in the way of my court date since she has not been served yet? Who even knows if she will come back 8/10?  Also just me venting, she claims she works but after this I am posivite she does not have a job and is lying about that.  Thanks!	Yes
STATE: GEORGIA -daughter history of meth, heroin. -thought she was clean -came to town to testify FOR her in custody/divorce of youngest child -found neglected, unfed, unclean children- ages 4 and 5-- with her locked in her room most of the time -arranged a 3 hour meeting w/ her psychiatrist -he reported her to DFCS based on a private conversation with her, I am guessing -DFCS interviewed me yesterday -daughter asked me to leave her house (I own it, she lives there as a tenant but has never made a rent payment as she is unemployed). -I left peacefully, because...kids don't need to hear arguing. I'm at a friends.  QUESTION: Should I stay for a few weeks or return home (across the country)? The kids have lived with me 3 times and spent summers with me. We are very close. The baby will be with his father enough that I'm not worried about him. The older 2 do not have a father with custodial rights. He's always in jail.   I don't know how DFCS works except for the many, many times I cared for children in the ER when they came in for medical clearance as part of placement with DFCS.	Yes
Hey everyone. I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'm not sure how to proceed. My mother is seriously mentally ill and has been refusing treatment for as long as I can remember. I beg her to get help because at this point she's extremely paranoid, terrified of touching things (germ situation), repeats herself 100x times, and has pulled out all her hair, and sadly, there's even more :( I've tried pretty much everything, but she's ALWAYS been this way. It even had a huge effect on my upbringing and due to that I have CPTSD. She once tried to burn me alive as an infant, and would regularly slam my head into concrete and the tub for things as simple as knocking over my juicebox. I'm afraid that at the rate she's going, she's just going to crash and burn... hard. I have a 16 year old sister too, and I fear that if my mom really gets out of hand, we'll be evicted. She honestly screams 24/7 so I'm not even sure how we haven't gotten kicked out. Due to my cptsd and a slew of other conditions, I'm disabled and can only work a job from home, but that's not enough for me to move my sister and myself out... I was wondering if there was any way the section 8 could be transferred to me or my sister, as my mother isn't stable or responsible enough for this kind of thing and always submits their paperwork MONTHS late. It's like she's trying to go out of her way to get us kicked out. Anyway, I'd like to keep my little sister safe, more importantly. Is there any way we could protect ourselves and our housing as my mother continues to self destruct ??  Thank you, and sorry for the essay... It's just been a LOT :/	Yes
In a divorce, is everything split 50/50, even if one partner has been unemployed the whole time?	Yes
My mom has a copy of his will from 1981. The will is not notarized, therefore my family is wondering if it is a legal will. My mom's uncle, my grandpa's brother, is the executor.  If my mom needs a lawyer, which I'm assuming she does, she is in southern Cali and my grandpa died in northern Cali. Should the lawyer be by my mom or by my grandpa.   If the will is legal, my grandpa had two more kids after the will was written. What are those two kids entitled to get? My mom wants to add them to the will but I don't know if that is possible. If it isn't, I think she wants to give them what they are entitled to regardless of the will.   Last my aunt is also in the will. My aunt is bipolar. She is not really able to take care of herself. Most of the time she prefers to live under a bridge even though she has a home. My mom wants to give my aunt my grandpa's trailer but she is worried about leaving her money. She is hoping the money can go to someone who can monitor what is given to my aunt. But if the will directly leaves my aunt money is that possible?   Thank you in advance.	Yes
"This is a very long story but I will try to make it as simple as possible.   My husband is being asked to speak to a detective in a case against his brother ""Joe"".  We don't live near Joe, but another sibling does and is on Joe side saying that everything his ex-wife is saying is untrue.  Basically Joe is accused of molesting his five year old daughter. Supposedly, according to his ex-wife he has already lost custody of his daughter, but the court hasn't decided what will happen to their son.   When my husband was a little boy Joe molested him, and even though that's all in the past now, Joe's ex-wife is asking my husband to speak to a detective about it because she thinks it could help her case.  The problem is we don't know who's telling the truth. Joe says the court didn't take his daughter away, that it's a pending investigation, and his daughter was coached to say the things she did. According to his ex-wife she's worried that he'll molest their son too, but because he isn't  a named victim at this time the court might not take away parental visits.  My husband's having a hard time deciding what to do, because if Joe's ex-wife is telling the truth he wants to help protect his nephew. But if Joe is telling the truth he doesn't want to ruin his life. Also, if my husband makes a statement this will definitely divided the family as obviously everyone seems to believe Joe.  My question is if there's anyway that we can know, since we don't live near them, what actual evidence there are in the case. If my husband speaks to detective is he legally allowed to lie to my husband about the case?  Joe is a known liar... but his ex-wife can be cunning.  Is it possible that my husband's statement would really hold so much value?  Please help."	Yes
My parents are bat shit crazy. They use to help watch my kids while I worked, but I didn't like their influence. We finally had a big blowing up with my parents and we haven't talked or seen them in 2 months. Now my parents are threatening to take me to court for grandparent rights. My kids have two married, financially and emotionally stable parents---do the grandparents have any sort of case here? I live in Kansas.	Yes
I'm currently trying to get a divorce in Hawaii. My ex moved back to the mainland back in 2015, so this has been a wild ride. I've pushed for her to sign all the papers since early 2016, and she finally has sent all the documents *except* the appearance and waiver. Now she's gone no contact despite saying she would send the last document. She hasn't replied to any of my emails since June 1st. I'm kind of in a hurry now because I'm gone until September and then leaving to go overseas with the military in October for over 6 months. I'm not able to use the military legal services because she can't, which is a whole other story.  My question is, can a judge grant the divorce without this *one* paper? Do I have to get a lawyer involved? If I do have to get a lawyer and we can't get this figured out before I leave, will I not be able to finish it until I get back?	Yes
Long story short, I've detached myself from my immediate family. Moved 30 odd miles away, changed my name by deed poll, and tried to start a new life. Issues with debt from them are coming to me, (my sister was paying my phone bill, I then took over, and they're saying something is outstanding but they won't tell me what and she's being uncooperative to say the least) as letters regarding it are coming to me, but addressed to her (as the debt is in her name but I'm now the registered address for the phone contract) - I'm planning to go into a 3 store and talk to someone face to face about it, but how can I prevent this in the future? Is there anything I can do? Do I have to literally wipe everything and start again? :(	Yes
My girlfriend's dad wants to change her name. She's 16 and will be 17 soon. Next year she'll be 18. Is he allowed to change her name without consent?  I know she doesn't want it to be changed, but he can be quite abusive so she hasn't argued much about it.  If the parent wants to change their child's name without the child's consent, is that easy for them to do?	Yes
To start off, neither me or my spouse have any sort of record what so ever, we have a hard time even giving our toddler a time out let alone physical discipline. We could easily have 50 or more people testify to the care of our children who have spent several hours with us. We've never gotten any notifications from DHS, CPS or anyone prior ever about concerns with our children. No record of substance abuse or mental illness.   In May my infant daughter had a bloodshot eye, our daycare provider informed us and sent a picture. We asked if it seemed to be bothering her, she said it wasn't. We told her if it got any worse to let us know and we would come get her and bring her to our pediatrician. It cleared up in a day or so, so we didn't seek medical attention for it.   A couple weeks ago my wife was in a car accident with my son, the vehicle was totaled but my wife and son were perfectly fine. My son was sleeping, he woke up for just a second then went back to sleep. A ambulance came and checked him and my wife out, they said he was perfectly fine and didn't need to seek medical attention unless he was acting odd and to look out for any odd behavior. Which we did. He acted 100% as normal so we did not seek medical attention.  My daughter started crawling and is borderline obsessed with standing up, she has an accident in the kitchen where she tried pulling herself up my wife's pant leg and as she went to pick her up she slipped and unfortunately fell on her face. It left a decent size bruise on her face, she contacted me at work and we looked out for the normal warning signs, she was fine.    A few days ago my wife got a phone call asking how soon we could get our children and meet at the E.R. It was CPS, they wanted us to have them there in an hour. We went and got our kids, my daycare provider had called about these instances, because she said her licensor was there and they made her, someone else had contacted her.   We were at the ER for almost 9 hours, they checked out my son, did a CT scan, X-rays and blood work on my daughter.  About 4 hours into the visit the DHS lady said we had to make arrangements for our children to stay with for the night. This was too much for us and we came to the conclusion that my parents would come down for the night. The DHS lady agreed and did background checks and left to access our house after we agreed to a 'safety plan' where my parents supervised us with the children.  We were discharged and got home around 1am.  The next day we had to take our kids to an abuse center where a doctor interviewed us and evaluated the children. In addition to having to go to our pediatrician for more blood work because the original was clumped and there was an error.  Later that day we were informed that we no longer have to follow the safety plan and there was no suspicion of abuse or neglect. Every test came back normal and that Pretty much that we were all set.  We asked the lady if we were going to be responsible for the ER visit etc. and she said that our insurance should cover most of it, we explained that it was a $8000 deductible between all to us. Her response was that typically the people that she deals with were on (state) care and that they didn't typically have to worry about it.  We got on the phone with a lawyer to ask a bit of advice, he said that typically they send a letter to the parents first and do a parent interview and go from there and that he has never seen someone go to such an extreme.  He said we should sit down and draft a letter about how mistreated we were, and that if they try to make us pay the bills to contact him immediately.   Additionally, another parent at the daycare used to work as a CPS supervisor and think that she may have made the call and that's why it was escalated so much. She knew that the kids were taken to the hospital and asked our daycare provider if they were kept overnight, without having knowledge of any of this.  Am I worrying too much? Having to have our kids in the ER for nearly 9 hours was more abusive than anything me or my wife have ever come close to doing to them, we are  in horror, it was a nightmare. We're terrified that it's going to happen to us again anytime my son gets a scratch riding his bike or something. Should we do more legally? Can we? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you.	Yes
Hello Reddit,   Is it legal for a 16 year old to file a restraining order on a physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive 18 year old sibling?	Yes
My ex-husband and I have been divorced for two years. Communication has always been challenging. I feel I have tried and tried to take the high road and handle any conflicts we have had in a mature manner. As long as I keep my mouth shut, things have gone smoothly but anytime I speak up at all, it becomes a massive problem.  He was verbally/mentally abusive when we were married. Controlling and angry. He is still very angry at me for things that happened while we were married, things that happened ten years ago are still brought up and thrown in my face. He calls me names, cusses me out, hangs up over and over only to call me right back to continue berating me for various things.  Right now we have joint legal custody, I have primary physical custody. He sees them fairly consistently, every Wednesday for 4 hours and every other weekend from 4pm Friday - 4pm Sunday.   I am strongly considering petitioning the court to modify our arrangement in hopes of following a parallel parenting plan. I am regularly taking our oldest child to therapy as it is and the kids are being negatively affected by our inability to communicate.   We've never modified anything since our divorce in 2015. What do I need to do to request and be granted a parallel parenting agreement?	Yes
"A little backstory... I Dated this girl i thought i liked for a few months... ended up being a horrible, manipulative, compulsive lying, sending nudes to her other baby while she lived with me, bitch. Had sex a lot unprotected, i know im an idiot. Didnt bother to ask if she was on any BC.. assumed she was cause she already has one kid. At one point she was really pushing to have a kid with me. Its not that im scared of being a father, well yes i kinda am, i just dont want anything to do at all with her. I despise her. I could write 5 more pages about just how awful she is.. so i broke up with her back in late February or early March cant remember exactly. Blocked all communications with her but shes  persistent and emailed me.. she had been saying she was pregnant but of course i didnt believe her since she said she was pregnant while we were dating and had an abortion on a fuckin sunday at planned parenthood.. she obvioulsy thinks im stupid which pisses me off to no end. So she just sent me a few photos basically confirming she is in fact pregnant.. literally makes me sick to my stomach. The fucked up thing is i have no idea where she lives right now.. shes from cali and has friends out there so that'd be my guess but shes saying she lives in florida with her ""friend"".. im so lost, scared,angry idk what to do.. any advice would be great.. ill try to post pics still fairly new to reddit.."	Yes
Long story short: my ex wife broke my wrist and I am almost 2k in debt because of it. We had TRO's on each other and she had a harassment charge against me. Everything was dismissed, the deal was I drop everything if she drops her TRO and harassment charge and pays my medical bills.  She agreed and my lawyer sent her lawyer my bills. It has been 2 months and I still havn't gotten a dime. My lawyer is an old dude and I just dont wanna bother him anymore about it. He gave me copies of the agreement, I talked to my ex-wife but as expected she completely ignored it.  What legal course can I take?	Yes
We are divorced, obviously. I have primary custody and he has visitation that includes two full weeks in the summer (one in June, one in July. We live close to one another so I often help out sometimes during his time when work emergencies or what have you pop up. My schedule is way more 9 to 5 than his and we both care deeply about our child so it works out the best.   My family owns a winery so I have some amazing local wines around the house.   My ex is vehemently against drinking on principle.   I don't drink around our child at all but I do drink when he isn't there. Not all the time but often, either socially or alone.   This past week was his week. Because of this, I was trying to fit in some training at work to keep my professional license. It was pretty intensive and boring and by the time I got him on Thursday, I was exhausted. I had a glass of wine and then checked in with my ex to see how our child was doing. I try to check in at least once daily by text. Sometimes, since we live so close, our child wants to come home for the night or come home early from his week so I always like to check.   I didn't get a response back so I had another glass and ended up falling asleep on the couch. I am not a particularly heavy sleeper but I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep the night before and I had just had two glasses of wine so I slept heavy.   I awoke the next morning to find a ton of texts and missed calls from my ex-husband saying our child wanted to come home. They had apparently stopped by and knocked on the door for a good 20 minutes and I hadn't answered.   I feel bad that I missed the texts and calls. I feel bad for not being available. I even feel bad that it could have been a legitimate emergency.   But it wasn't.   I called him the moment I woke up. He didn't answer so I drove over there to see if I could help with the issue and apologize for not being available.   My ex-husband was very upset and understandably our child was sad that he couldn't come home.   I did get my ex-husband a copy of my house key to help prevent that sort of thing going forward but it doesn't seem to be enough.   He threatened to call CPS because I am the primary parent and was not available. He said I admitted to having a bit too much to drink (I said I had two glasses of wine not too much).   Apparently my son wanted to come and had been upset and cried a bunch while they were waiting outside.   I just now got a missed call (I was in a meeting) from someone who wants to talk about a complaint that was filed with their office regarding my child.   Do I need to call them back? Will they just call back? What do I need to say?   I am completely lost here and could use some help.   I do have bottles of wine in the house. They are in a child lock cabinet and he can't work a cork screw but they are still there so I can't deny that I drink.   Right now, our child is in the workplace sponsored daycare at my work downstairs and I am worried they will just show up and take him.	Yes
In order to fully understand the level of confidence I have in the opinion that my daughter is being abused psychologically would take a very long time. I will give the highlights.  My ex and I got divorced due to deployment related stress in 2010 when my daughter was 2. She moved back and forth between TN and NE during my deployments and eventually, after the divorce, she settled back in NE because of better schools and better standard of living (Omaha vs Memphis).  During the time that she lived in NE, I was unable to see my daughter frequently both due to a refusal to cooperate from my ex and my continuing deployments.  I got out of the military and hoped it would be a good opportunity for me to make up with lost time, but I was met with the same lack of cooperation as before so I really only saw my daughter a couple times a year (always only at her mom's house).  I filed for a custody hearing, my ex never responded to the notification so we had the sheriff's office serve her. The day after we got our receipt of service, she moved to TN.  Since the proceedings, the lack of cooperation because a full force of loathing and spitefulness from her. Her dad wanted to fight me in front of my daughter and told me I wasn't allowed on his property. My ex has sworn at me and called me things like an asshole in front of my daughter. My ex's mom has said, in front of my daughter, that I abandoned her.  After many proceedings and a trial-style hearing on the record I was able to secure some visitation times including the school vacations. I was so excited to get her for the very first extended period since she was 2 years old, now she's 8. That excitement and blissfulness of being with my daughter is now accompanied with total anxiety.  My ex got our daughter a phone, she said that she's supposed to have to have the phone on her at all times both in TN and in NE, but I have a lot of evidence suggesting that she doesn't get her phone in TN (i.e. a complete wipe of my text messages and phone calls from her phone when she showed up here this summer).  Through conversation it is fairly obvious that my daughter has been coached about a lot of this stuff with the phone (i.e. how to always keep location on, to call her mom every morning and every night, and not letting me or my wife see the phone as well as password protecting it).  All things considered, it was really easy to get access to my 8 year old daughter's phone and the things that have been going on this summer are startling.  My ex has interrogated her nightly about her situation and what me and my wife do, more so than asking about what all she's been doing and if she's having fun or not.  She has consistently thrown shade on me over and over, though that is to be expected I guess. I am the type that tells the truth to my daughter unless it could negatively impact their relationship, I'm not about that bullshit shade-throwing.  She told my daughter only to speak to her when she can be away from me and my wife and is always asking if either one of us have had access to her phone.  In the last few weeks my daughter has really warmed up to being here and has put her phone on the back-burner most of the time. She's fucking 8 years old and she doesn't give a shit about the phone, she just worries that she's going to be in trouble if she doesn't keep it on her (she's told me so).  During those few weeks she has been unresponsive at times that she's having a sleepover or she left her phone at home. On nights that she doesn't respond, my ex is very harsh.  During a vacation to Texas my daughter left her phone in the car overnight. The next morning, my ex had sent her a text before she went to work saying that she was up all night crying and didn't get any sleep because she didn't hear from her.  Tonight, she threatened to call the cops because she wasn't responding and had her FBI ex-boyfriend blowing up her phone as well.  1) I have all of these things from her phone backed up, but I don't own the phone. The communications are taking place in my house and concern my child. Is that information admissible in an informal hearing setting... I know that if I were able to subpoena the records from the phone company that would be admissible during a trial, I just want to know if I'm going to be breaching any privacy laws by having the information (hence the throwaway).  2)I'm legitimately freaked out about what my daughter is going through, what the fuck can I do to stop it?  Thanks for the help.	Yes
"I am friends with this girl who was a 7th grader last year and was supposed to enter 8th this year. She was held back a little while ago and so all us are now freshmen and she's stuck in middle school. Her parents don't care much. They don't live in a normal neighborhood, but in a house kind of deep in the woods where you wouldn't expect to see one. She just smokes pot all day and hangs out with a bad crowd. This year she says she's doing ""homeschooling"" online. I know for a fact her parents haven't contacted school officials or taken any official steps to be in a online program. Her cousin (15) did the same thing a while back and hasn't gone to school of any kind the past few years. I know she wont do anything. Any way of the schools or boe finding out? I hate to see someone ruin they're lives like this. Any way I can do something?"	Yes
"I've been searching google for the answer and am having difficulty finding the answer.  I only found one website that directly addresses this but don't know if it's accurate:  ""The parties‚Äô property settlement agreement, while completely enforceable as a contract, is not filed with the court."" http://www.divorceforgrownups.net/karins-blog/2011/9/13/keeping-your-divorce-information-private  I'm trying to help my mom by getting her divorce property settlement, but I don't know if it was filed with the court.  My mom's divorce took place about 13 years ago.  I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question so I don't waste an entire day going down to the family law courthouse which is far from my home and finding out that the divorce property settlement is not there."

My SIL just got divorced in January. Both vehicles they drove were her ex husbands and only in her ex husbands name. In the divorce settlement it was stated that when their house sells she will give him an agreed upon amount to maintain ownership of the vehicle. 8 months later and still the house hasn't sold but now the registration is expiring along with insurance. She can't register or insure the vehicle because he won't sign it over. He is saying he will repossess the car if she doesn't hand over the money owed even though the house hasn't sold. Is there anything she can do?  	Yes
Keeping things somewhat obfuscated for safety, if you need finer details, please PM me.  This happened in upstate SC. I am now in FL.  About 4 years ago, I offered to open up my house out of the kindness of my heart to my best friend and their spouse, who have a child. The next several months after that, it became very apparent that there were things I wasn't aware of. My friend's spouse was very abusive towards my friend, mostly verbally. I found out that my friend had been raped by the spouse as well. I confronted my friend about it after witnessing abuse towards the child too, and finally my friend recognized the need to end the relationship and demand a divorce. We filed to have the spouse evicted. My friend did not leave as they did not have anywhere to go.  My friend refused to pursue charges, mostly out of fear of things not going well, potentially some Stockholm Syndrome or something going on. The spouse accused us of cheating, openly vilified myself and my friend, and claimed to be innocent of what we witnessed.  No formal divorce or custody agreement ever entered in due to the previously mentioned fears.  There was peace some time after the split. The spouse seemed to be stabilizing. There was an agreement to allow visitation. The spouse however not only has a child with another person now, but has also kidnapped my friend's child as well, and has made wild baseless accusations.  I have been asked to submit an affidavit to what I witnessed. I am concerned that if my involvement comes forward, that the target will be drawn to me and I may have false allegations filed against me, forcing me to return back to SC, which could potentially have a number of consequences for me outside of legal. However, if I don't submit my affidavit, it could potentially weaken or ruin my friend's case and the chances of my friend's child being returned to the parent who is actually a capable parent.	Yes
"Hello r/legaladvice,  My brother has recently moved to a small town for work, and he has taken on a new girlfriend from this small town. Leaving aside how I may or may not feel about her, I have some concerns about how her situation may affect my brother going forward.   This girl is 24 years old, and has two young kids, each from a different father. She has had the kids taken away from her, and they are now under the care of their other respective parents. She is entitled currently to supervised visitations with the children (I don't know the particulars of how this came to be). She is self-employed part time- she does odd jobs around the little town such as cleaning, cutting grass, etc. My brother has a very good job as an engineer at the local power plant, and as time goes by, his good prospects will only go up.   My worry is this: this girlfriend currently has a dumpy little 1-room basement apartment, but is now spending ALL her time at my brother's house he owns. I can see that he is not far off from thinking, ""Hey- why does she keep on paying rent for that place? She spends all her time here anyway... She should just come and live with me!"" He is very eager to fall in love that way, and sometimes in the past, it has clouded his judgment.    So here is the question: If she moves in with my brother, they become ""co-habitating spouses, and the girl's baby-daddies come around looking for child support, will my brother's income be counted as hers for calculating support payments? Because that could make the support payments waaaaay higher than what she makes by herself, putting my brother on the hook for it. None of the people in this equation make decent money aside from my brother, and I'm worried about him becoming a target.   Thanks in advance!"	Yes
Let's say I have friend who is currently in an extremely abusive relationship to the point where it is affecting her work. I am also her supervisor. Would it be possible for me to ask for a restraining order from her boyfriend? Let's say she is in such a bad state the she cannot ask herself, is being forced not to. But me, along with a few other people see how bad it is and want to get her out. Therefore if we have several people that can attest to this, could this make a difference? Like can we make an argument that she has been abused so badly she cannot make this decision for herself? If this is not technically possible, what is my next best course of action?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
After a sudden separation my child has gone to live with their father and their grandmother. I am unable to have custody right this moment for a few reasons.  Once those reasons are settled on my end I intend to file for primary custody. One of my many reasons I believe it's in her best interest to be with me lies with my ex-MILs blatant disregard of our parenting requests and such.  The specific incident I am curious about is an allergic reaction to diaper rashes. She used a brand of diaper my child severely reacted to and was told both in writing and verbally to stop and switch to the brand we use due to the reaction. She didn't and my child reacted badly again, and ever since has had extreme stress and anxiety to getting touched down there. Diaper changes are now really, really upsetting for my child and although I made progress with getting them comfortable again they've completely regressed since entering into her and my ex's care.  My ex-MIL has a history of this kind of thing (ignoring people and doing what she wants) and there are other more minor incidents involving my child.  Is this diaper issue something to note since it caused physical harm to my child and has had lasting effects? With her past history of doing whatever I am concerned she'll do this again but with something else.	Yes
"I've been taking medication since I was 10, ones to help my depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder. I also got on a birth control pill when I was 17. My mother always kept my medicine in a lockbox and only set out a weeks worth of pills af a time which sucked because she's HORRIBLE at remembering to give me more at the end of the week and she procrastinates on it even when I remind her. Once I turned 18 I told her to stop keeping it locked, but she refused even though I'm medically independent. When I miss my meds I get horrible withdrawals that include vomiting and migraines. The birth control is locked away too, and the last thing I need to to become sexually active and miss a day and get pregnant because the pill isn't accessible. My mom justifies herself by saying she doesn't ""want me to kill myself"" via pill. The very pills I need to stop me from wanting to hurt myself. Is this legal for her to do?"	Yes
"This is a non contested divorce, we no longer live together and here shortly I will be moving to the opposite end of the country. She refused to sign the papers earlier and now I was wondering is my presence in front of a Judge (in the jurisdiction of where we previously lived) still necessary?  Her excuse (via text message) was, ""I refuse to sign the papers until you find somebody who loves you."" In other words, to be manipulative."	Yes
"Currently separated, going through a very ugly divorce battle with my (hopefully soon to be ex) wife...neither of us can afford attorneys because of financial troubles (excessive debt) accumulated by her when we were together.  Not to mention, she cheated on me for a year before I found out.  During that time, she got herself in to legal trouble (related to the cheating) which caused additional financial hardship.    However, she has managed to get an attorney through a women's legal center somehow by lying about me and how I have treated her.  When, in truth, I endured about 10 years of mental/emotional abuse from her before I decided the marriage could not be saved.   Now that she has an attorney, and I don't, she is trying to ""stick it to me"" with a vengeance.  She has kept the children from me on occasion (to be vindictive) when it was my rightful visitation time, and she also says negative things about me to our daughters.  Are any of you aware of lost cost / pro bono options for a father that has been taken advantage of but is still trying to do the best he can for his children?   It doesn't seem fair that she can lie and get an attorney for free, and I, the law abiding father that has never missed a child support payment and see my kids as much as possible, can't?  Thank you in advance for your time, I appreciate any advice you can offer that might help me find an attorney, or an organization that could help me find an attorney."	Yes

"Before I get barraged with ""You'll ruin your relationship."" posts, let me start with the fact that we have spoken about this and are BOTH on board with this decision.  We live in a state that does not have common law marriage and have been together a little over 6 years. During those 6 years, we've always divided up assets regardless of who made how much etc. We did this by having a single joint account that we would put money into each month (no direct deposit). My question is, how much would a prenup protect the two of us, and our finances, if we got married and things fell apart? Quick run down: I make roughly $110,000 to $140,000 (depending on overtime). She makes around $25,000-$35,000 (overtime again). I purchased a house while we've been dating, it's in my name only, and I paid for it 100% on my own. She's obviously helped out with groceries, bills, and handled her own expenses. Would a prenup keep the house in my name?   Also, not that I like talking about it, but I will be inheriting about $600,000 worth of real estate and property in the future. Would a prenup be able to keep all of that inheritance in my name, even if we are married while it happens?   I love this girl to death and want to be with her forever, but I've had friends and friends parents who've been screwed over because of marriage. Losing houses, paying alimony, forfeiting a huge percentage of pensions... it's so scary to think that you could be with someone for 20+ years, and they have the power to simply leave and take half of it with them.   Any advice?"	Yes
"Hi everyone, posting this to get some info about a situation in California.  Thank you in advance for your advice and help!      This is a question about custody over a kid.  I read some links (pasted at the end of my post) in an attempt to answer my question, but I'm hoping to get more info and perspectives here.      Will try and keep things simple in bullet form.  Here is some background:      * Anna and Bob have a daughter Sally (Sally is now 8 years old)      * Anna and Bob were never married, they simply lived together.  Bob is legally not the dad, but is the biological father (Sally has no legal father)       * When Sally was still an infant, Anna left Bob due to emotional abuse (not physical as far as I know) and general unhappiness, and has been raising Sally as a single mom for the last 6+ years (while living with Anna's parents)      * Anna and Bob are on civil, if not amicable, terms.  Bob usually takes Sally out for a day/afternoon once a week.  Sometimes Sally will stay with dad a few days at a time, when mom has to travel      * Anna is single, Bob is now dating and living with a woman Candy who has kids from an prior marriage and when he takes Sally, it is almost always with Candy or to her/their home    * Bob has never paid any kind of child support, whether documented or undocumented.  Bob (currently) has no legal rights or access to Sally, everything is worked out between Anna and Bob on a personal level.  Anna wants Sally to have a dad, so she wants to keep Bob in Sally's life, even though she does not care for Bob at all      Now for recent events:      * Bob's girlfriend Candy recently met Anna, and started interacting with (borderline harassing) Anna (over text and call), and long story short, as a result of those conversations, Anna fears that Candy may be a bad influence on Sally, or may even be trying to poison Sally against her.      * Anna asked Bob to see Sally alone, or at least not let Sally see / interact with Candy.  Need to emphasize that Anna is not doing this to spite or make life difficult for Bob (and certainly not to get child support).  It is out of genuine concern.      * Bob agreed to do so verbally and over text, but Anna has since discovered that Bob is still taking Sally to Candy's or going out with Candy together, just as before      Questions:      * Does Anna have a (legal) right to request Bob not have Sally see Candy?  Would this be a tenable and legal request?      * What are some ways this could play out from a legal perspective if a custody battle ensues?      To elaborate more on why Anna does not want Candy interacting with Sally--there is no apparent threat or evidence of physical harm / danger.  It's simply that Candy is a drama-filled, selfish, and manipulative person so Anna would rather not have her daughter influenced by Candy.  To be honest, there is probably little tangible evidence that ""proves"" Candy would be a bad influence (not even sure how that works legally), but that's just how Anna feels as a mom.  Bob is not necessarily a deceitful or bad person, but is extremely simple-minded, and likely being controlled by Candy, so Anna cannot rely on Bob to shield Sally from potentially bad influence, or even to keep his word about when and how he sees Sally.      I read the info in these two links in an attempt to answer my question      * https://www.thespruce.com/types-of-child-custody-and-visitation-2997637      * http://www.livestrong.com/article/140913-what-rights-do-fathers-have-if-they-are-not-birth-record/       Based on that, I think Bob will have to establish paternity, at which point he can enter a custody battle with Anna.  What are some ways a judge may rule in this case, with all of the factors above?  Any chance for supervised visitation only, or unsupervised, but specifically no contact with Candy?  I am aware that Anna may appear as a jealous mom in court with such a request, but that is not the case.  She was initially happy that Sally could have some semblance of a ""family life,"" but has since discovered that Candy would not be a good ""second mom,"" so I'm just trying to get a read on the situation from the experts here.    Thank you for reading!  Again, any additional help or advice would be greatly appreciated!  Please let me know if more info is needed."	Yes
My mother is ready to begin separation/divorce proceedings against my father. What are some general immediate steps that need to be taken to get things started? What sort of professional agency or council should she consult with first and how should she look for this? Money is definitely an issue (they are not wealthy and she has been a housewife her entire life). I feel like talking to a lawyer is probably the best first step to take ASAP on Monday morning but not sure how to go about finding a reputable lawyer for her locally. If there is something she should be doing first otherwise I would appreciate the guidance.      Thank you!	Yes
This is a throwaway for obvious reasons. My location is Mississippi. First let me give you the facts. I graduated high school in 2014. My junior and senior year of high school I had a teacher that I hit it off with. Throughout high school I was a very good student, had a 31 on my ACT, numerous scholarship offers, and 3 nominations from my congressmen for the United States Naval Academy. About Christmas time of my senior year, this 32 year old female teacher and I exchanged phone numbers and began texting occasionally. By two weeks before graduation, there were sexually explicit texts being sent. I visited her house at her request twice before graduation. I graduated on a Friday, and on saturday night as a 17 year old I was at her house, she provided me alcohol and we first had sex. We did this same thing a couple more times before I turned 18 in June. By this point I was so smitten by her that I had given up every scholarship and college opportunity I had.  We continued our relationship and she convinced me out of going to school and into the workforce as soon as possible, as well as convinced me to marry her and have a child as soon as possible. In July of 2015 we married. In September of 2016 after many months of trying, she became pregnant, and abruptly moved out without telling me where she was going. I held on for almost a year hoping that she would come back and that we could be a family.   The child was born in May. I was allowed to see her a couple of times until my then wife decided that I couldnt see her again until I agreed to her custody terms. I refused and consulted with a lawyer to figure out my options and within 2 weeks I was served at fault papers which falsely accused me of being an abusive alcoholic (I was under 21 the entire marriage, so any alcohol I had was provided by her) and she was suing for full custody as well as the meager possesions ive managed to put together since she left in October of last year.  after being served those papers is when it finally clicked for me that my family was right. She manipulated me into marrying her and having a child with her. She has even openly admitted to only marrying her first husband because she wanted a child.  At this point, I have a 3 month old daughter that I love dearly and she is keeping away from me, as well as my former teacher pursuing an at fault divorce for full custody. I think she is expecting me to just give in as I have over the past three years.   I want full custody of my child to at least be able to regulate her being around her insane and manipulative mother. I also am considering pressing seperate civil as well as legal charges against the mother for the manipulation and pain that has been a result of this, in order to get custody as well as secure the future of my daughter. My-ex wife has already ruined my life, I cant let this ruin my daughters as well.  My lawyer seems to think I could have a case against her, but he said he cant think of a cause of action for it. By some of the other things he said, it kinda seemed to me like this case might end up being more work than he bargained for. I dont know. Am I out of luck due to a dumb decision while I was in high school, or do I need to find another lawyer that could push ahead with my case, or at least suggest a cause of action for him?  I dont want to ever see my ex-wife again, but I also dont want her to do the same thing to anyone else, and most importantly, I want to be able to see my daughter and provide her a life away from the crazy that is her mother.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated. This has been a tough time and I dont know which way is up and which way is down.	Yes
My husband is a heroin addict and we are involved with CPS. He's been to detox and rehab many times and nothing is helping. While he was trying to get his medical marijuana card, I helped him fake urine analysis so he could smoke for his mental stability while he was clean from heroin. Obviously, that was stupid but I was in such a deep hole of depression I thought it would help him. I let him drive my son down the road once because I would have lost my job if I didn't show up on time that day, but his license is suspended. I fucked up and shouldn't have from the start.  Now, he's been taking my car everyday and I can't get to work (only income is my job) or get my son to a sitter. He doesn't pick me up from work and is gone for 8-12 hours. His use isn't getting any better. Every time I try to kick him out when he comes back, or tell him he can't take the car, he threatens to hurt me and then tells me if I call the cops or throw him out or not let him take the car, he will tell his attorney everything I did to help him and make sure that my son gets taken away from not only himself, but me as well. Can he do that? Or am I just being held hostage in my house fearing the worst when I could actually be doing something about it and still be able to take care of my son?  I don't know what to do at this point and I'm waiting on my attorney to call me back while I type this. Should I tell her that I helped him? I'm so scared he'll hurt me, he literally just ripped off a kitchen cabinet because I said I wanted to take out the trash first. I started crying and he mocked me and got in my face and I'm just so worn down I don't know what to do. I want my son safe, but I want it to be with me. I pay all the bills and I don't want to leave and lose my job, Ive had it for 7 years.	Yes
Hello everyone. I have a friend, she is 17. She lives in a Muslim household that greatly restricts her freedom. She is not allowed to leave the house for anything but work or school. She's had a history of self-harm, eating disorder, and various mental illness. Her parents have actively berated her for these issues, saying 'you're a disgrace to this family' 'you ruined our lives' etc. She's gotten in trouble for sneaking out and smoking cigarettes, sure, not right, but the punishment was a closed hand beating every time. She was caught trying to sneak out last night, and in a weird trance, told her mother everything she's done. She admitted to not believing in God, having multiple boyfriends (which is not allowed), and still smoking.    Now, her father, who is a pilot, is away for now, and she wants to get out before he comes home. There's been multiple instances of the mother having to stand between her and the father to stop further harm being done to her. Her life is genuinely in danger, as not believing in God is about the worst thing she could've said.   What should be done here? She wants to run away and call the police, will they help? Or will they send her back, as she has no markings from any previous beatings. Any other course of action to take here? Sorry if this isn't the right sub.	Yes
This whole thing is going on in PA. I'm 33, my GF is 25, her Ex is 28 (i think) and their son is 4  So here's a rundown of events  I'll refer to my girlfriends son as G from here on out  My girlfriend is very into giving her son education opportunities. Last year, she was able to get G into a very organized and solid Pre-K program (at no cost due to her low income)  Her ex fought her on it. They have split custody, almost even amount of time is allocated between parents (a little heavier on the moms time).   The dads main beef was he'll lose time with his son, not to mention he had no transportation to drop him off or pick him up. Her ex lives with his parents, and they are great grandparents, but I think they are tired of their sons bs. He doesn't really have his life together.   We understood, so we setup a special thing with the school where G could go part time (1/2 days, 3 days per week). Since G was only 3 at the time, he would be eligible for the same Pre-K program the following year (coming up) and go to kindergarten the year after that.  It was kind of a pain agreeing to her ex'es demands to go part time. Her ex has no ride, so my GF would drive across town before work to take him to school even though it wasn't her day with him. I was in a position to pick him up around lunch time without issue.  Her ex verbally agreed that if their son liked going to school, he could go full time the following year.  Now the time has come to officially enroll him for the upcoming school year, and her ex is absolutely refusing to allow G to go full time. He likes the agreement where G only goes part time and we drive G back and forth.  A couple weeks ago he said he would agree to whatever G said he wanted. And G said he wanted to go to school more, and his dad agreed, and even verified all this via text to my GF. But her ex also had G for 3 days following this conversation, and once we picked G up, her ex said that G had changed his mind and didn't want to go to school more. When we press G why not, he says he doesn't want to make his dad angry (I don't suspect any physical abuse). I told G that dad wouldn't be mad att him, he would be mad at mom. But G is clearly a bit upset about the recent mom &amp; dad fighting on the phone, and being pressured to make a decision.  My GF is fed up with it and told the school to enroll G full time anyways, the ex called the school and told them not to. And now the school says we have until the end of this week to make a decision or G will lose his spot entirely. We view her ex's attitude as extremely selfish at this point, and find the mental conditioning he's trying to put on G very disturbing.  Is there anything legally we can do to get things moving that benefit G the most? Something that might be a small wake up call to the dad?	Yes
"I am eighteen years old, in Oregon USA. moving out of an abusive household, I leave Thursday but mom, has my social security card, my passport, my birth certificate. All things I need. I understand I could duplicate them but that is difficult as you'd need verification from an adult that I exist with their documents (correct me if I'm wrong please) and think it'd be easier. (Especially for the expensive passport that my dad paid for three years ago if that matters at all) Anyway, I know she is not going to give them to me when I ask for them when I leave. Is there any legal matter in this? I need things now for learners permits and trying to acquire things to get on with the ""adult"" (haha 18) aspect of my life. Can't get a bank account without some form of I.d and fafsa is coming soon for college. Can't get I.d card without birth certificate or social security number. I don't have much money and so requesting would be a long process and I cannot go that way as I need to desperately get these things done in a matter of weeks. Can she really withhold all those things from me even if their not technically hers? I understand birth certificate and ss card was given to her in her possession but at some point it's for me right? My parents are not married either and he purchased the passport. Does that play into me getting that back? It's good for two more years and useful as form of identification."	Yes
I'm a mom to 4 boys, 11, 10, 8 and 7. I am also in college finishing my bachelor degree. This semester I have a mandatory internship which makes my getting home an hour after the boys get off the bus. In the state of Arkansas, is it legal for the boys to be home without an adult for an hour after school each day? Money is really tight and we cannot afford child care.	Yes
I received an order of protection and have no idea what the consequences are if it's not removed, or worse, made permanent. The order came from Family Court - which I understand is a civil matter. So does an order of protection from family court show up on criminal background checks? Are there different types of restraining order such that some do show up on background checks whereas others don't?	Yes
State: Alaska Situation: unwed father and mother seperate and voluntarily relinquesh their rights and guardianship to the maternal Grandmother, so the unwed Mother may join the military.   Long term Guardianship was appointed to the maternal grandmother in the courts, where the judge ruled no child support would be taken once Fathers rights were terminated. The court order stated that Grandmother maintaineld physical custody but the mother was still accountable for providing financial support.   5 years later, Mother exits the military, terminates the Guardianship order and regains physical custody of the child, and files for child support, and 6 years worth of backpay, while the Father took NO steps towards re establishing his rights or responsibilities.  Soooo, can the FATHER still be taken for child support when the mother exits the military and reestablishes HER parental rights? Even after a judge ordered no child support? And could she collect back pay for the time in which his rights were terminated?   If NOT, how does one contest?	Yes
My wife and I have two very young children (both under the age of 2) who are babysat and adored by family friends who are about our age. They love our kids almost as much as we do. We're trying to make plans for the future, including a will, and want the family friends to raise the kids if something happens to us. They have accepted (tears of joy were involved), and we just need to figure out the legal path.  Our own parents are late in their own life stages due to the age at which we chose to have children, with the youngest of our kids' grandparents about 60 years old. We have concerns with the idea of our kids losing their parents, and then potentially having to deal with losing a new set of parents in their teens (or earlier--three of the four grandparents have serious health conditions). Only one, the wife's grandmother, has what might be considered an ongoing relationship, and that's only once or twice a month for 2-3 hours at a time, always with us around.  The problem is that we expect the grandmother and the father's parents to not take this well (that's a relationship issue and not in play for this post) and to fight it legally. We'd like to know what to expect when we select a lawyer to figure out the path, and what is involved in ensuring that there is an opportunity for the grandparents to be in our kids' lives but not have the opportunity to gain custody. This is prep work to make as easy as possible what is going to be, at least in some ways, a very difficult process.	Yes
Whenever my sister and brother-in-law drink they argue aggressively and, unfortunately, they drink quite often. Occasionally, he has been known to strike her. This month it happened twice. Once on July 5th (her birthday) and again on July 18th. On the 18th I was floating down the river when I got a phone call from my niece who was hysterically crying, so I called the cops and came home as soon as I could. I later found out that he poured Bacardi on my sister‚Äôs head and when she rolled off the bed to escape he kicked her in the back of the head. The police took him to prison and placed a ‚ÄúNo contact‚Äù order on them where they can only text/e-mail and are not allowed to be wherever the other person is, which includes our home. He‚Äôs been charged with domestic violence (but only for throwing liquid), a second DUI since he drove away from the house, and having an open alcohol container in the car.  He‚Äôs been living out of his truck since then and has been posting/answering hook-up ads on craigslist all while saying he wants to get back together with my sister. In all honesty I think my sister will eventually end up getting back together with him and the only reason she isn‚Äôt now is due to peer pressure from our family and our small community.  Today we received a phone call from his lawyer who stated that he was trying to speak to the judge about being allowed into our stand-alone garage so that he can work (him and I work together in the garage). My sister, niece, and I do not want him back. Even if he was permitted to live in the garage we have no bathroom or air conditioner in there so I believe this is just his way of trying to get back into the house. My sister‚Äôs case manager has suggested they move to a woman‚Äôs shelter but my sister refuses to because she feels it would do more harm than good to my niece due to her autism.  My question is: Will a judge allow  a domestic abuser back onto the property so that he can run his business? He is the sole bread winner so it seems plausible. If so, can we add a ‚Äòno alcohol‚Äô stipulation?	Yes
I am the beneficiary of my deceased father's teacher's pension through the state of wisconsin (Which will run for 7 years we are approaching the end of year 4). My parents divorced in Iowa in 2000-2001 where it seems the divorce papers said the other was supposed to list each other as beneficiaries, but neither one ever did, instead putting them both in my name. They would even laugh about it when they talked about it since they remained friends post-divorce (I know, how weird, right?)   Winter 2014 I received paperwork about the pension and my Mother was okay with and excited for me to have a nest egg. A few months later she was fired from her job and threatened to sue me for the pension if I didn't do what she wanted with money (take a lump sum instead of monthly installments). She eventually backed off. At that time I had called the pension people who said they would have required special court-ordered paperwork in order to change the beneficiary in those conditions and they never received it. The lawyer whom I met with in Iowa (as I was living there at the time) had said the same thing. She said something would have had to been filed with the court while filing the divorce, which never was.   Spring of 2017 she threatened to sue me again. Sending semi harassing texts, letters to my home, and even showing up on my doorstep (She lives on a different coast than I)without invitation. She has been announcing on Facebook that I am dead or will be dead soon because I am a drug addict (never touched a drug in my life). I received a letter yesterday, 8\8\2017 from a lawyer saying unless I'm willing to settle this matter she will be suing me. I am not sure what to do at this point.	Yes
We all know how men get the shitty end of the deal in marriages and divorce. And we all know more and more men abandon the idea of marriage altogether. So it begs the question, if the court system isn't fair to men with no resolution in sight, how much can the marriage prenup be expanded such that it IS fair?  Example 1: Article about man having to pay $65,000 in child support for child that is not his.  I want to preemptively include, in the prenup, that in such a case I will not be responsible for aforementioned situation.  Example 2: Man makes more money than wife. Because I make more money, I can better support the child. Therefore, I want to include preemptively, in the prenup, that the child custody is solely mine.	Yes
He constantly holds it over my head that I am going to be left under a bridge without my children once he does get this money. I don't know what to add other than I've worked less than him throughout our marriage. Mostly because of childcare costs. There was a time that i was working two jobs and he wasn't.   Please ask me for details... i dont know what to add that is relevant  	Yes
"Years ago, I made a dumb decision to get a dog with a college girlfriend. We split all of the initial costs.  Que a few weeks ago when I get served for possession over my dog. I show up on the court date, go to mediation and we agree on terms.  The terms were that I give her money for her initial costs and she keeps the dog for 10 days to say goodbye. She was supposed to meet up with me yesterday to exchange the dog and now refuses to talk to me, and I'm stuck communicating with her father as a middle man.   Between her not taking to me, her father beating around the bush and neither willing to give me the dog back, I am stuck out money and no dog.  Our mediation agreement states the following terms:  ""As of 7pm on 8/10/17 (other party) give up any claim to dog.""  ""At that time (Me) will take possession of dog in permanent basis""  ""If either party violates the agreement, other party will receive judgement.""  These were terms made in mediation. Both parties, the mediator and the judge signed the document.   We had a scheduled ""follow up"" court date for this coming up Monday which was meant for two reasons. One being that if either party violates agreement, and two if both parties follow through, we don't show up and the case is closed.  It seems pretty cut and dry to me that as long as I followed through with my part of the agreement, and because she is refusing to give the dog back that I would gain judgment in front of the judge.   This is the first time I'm going through my sort of legal case so I don't want to be naive or too confident, but looking at the agreement and terms, it seems like I will end up winning judgement."	Yes
"I'm in MD, currently kids are visiting their dad in FL.     To make a long story short (and less identifying) there is an INSANE amount of inappropriate stuff going on at the fathers house where my 2 young children are staying, where they are currently on their court ordered visitation for the next few weeks.  I understand different houses have different rules, and I can't ""make"" their father do anything.  But in light of gathering some actual evidence of how out of control this is, am I legally allowed to record a conversation with my kid if they know they are recorded?  My guess is as minors the answer is I would need permission from their legal guardian, but since that's me I don't see it being an issue?  Or would their father have to consent?      Custody order is in MD, I have legal tie breaking authority.  Basically I have the final say over the kids well being education, health, etc wise."	Yes
My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	Yes
I need legal advice regarding the no contact order.  A friend got into argument with live in partner and she broke something.  He called the police and had her taken away on charge of domestic violence.  She had a no contact order put on her but she tried to see him after that to smooth things over.  However the court doesn't know that she broke the no contact order, only the live in partner.  My question is can he use knowledge and evidence of her breaking her no contact order down the road as a way to blackmail her into getting what he wants?  Thanks for your advice really appreciate it.	Yes
Someone I know had their daughter falsely accuse them of sexual abuse. She said to her mom that she was just trying to relate with her friend because her friend was talking about being abused. Her friend told the counselor at school, the girl freaked out and stuck to the story of molestation because she was scared. she was not expecting the situation to blow out of proportion. My friend's daughter is 12, she wants to fix this, what can she do?	Yes
My [19] dad has been an alcoholic my entire life. He drinks to the point of passing out every single night. I've been out of the house for 2 years now, but when I lived with my parents I never once saw a night where he wasn't passed out drunk by 11 pm or so. My mom has been putting up with this for 20 years and has been trying to hold things together for her kids. But rightfully, she has finally decided enough is enough and is considering a divorce. I have a little brother and sister who are 8 and 11.   My mom and I are both concerned that if her and my dad get a divorce, he will get some custody of the kids. She wants my brother and sister to have a relationship with their dad, but she's genuinely terrified that if they stayed overnight with him and there was an emergency of some kind after my dad has started drinking, he would be blacked out and unable to help. She's brought this up to him and he is a hallmark addict--he denies any problem and claims he could still parent the kids.  My mom doesn't have much evidence to prove my dad's alcoholism other than verbal testimony from her, me, family, friends, and the kids. To my knowledge, he's never gotten a DUI or had any alcohol-related arrests or altercations. My mom said she has started taking video of him when he's passed out, but other than that she doesn't have much. My question is, would my dad's alcoholism be able to be proven in court and is it likely that a judge would grant my mom physical custody of the kids until he gets help?   Thank you all in advance.	Yes
"My brother got a girl pregnant via one night stand, the baby is now 2. He wants primary custody. Here are the circumstances.  The mother has no criminal record. Has her own home. Has 3 kids. Works as a CNA and makes probably $25,000ish a year. She is the custodial parent. We are concerned about her volatile relationships. She has had several boyfriends since her daughter was born. She keeps getting back together with the other 2 kids's dad, an alcoholic who has been arrested for DUIs several times; as recently as March 2017. Everytime they've broken up, she blasts him all over Facebook, posts pictures of him cheating on her with her sister, goes into these huge drama posts. He supposedly threatened to set their house on fire during one of their off-periods.   My brother expressed concern the last time she got back together with him. She said he was still drinking, but that she would get him help by bringing him to a church sobriety program once a week. My brother used to check the fridge every time he'd go over there out of concern for Baby. 3 months later, they're still together, she's still having alcohol around the house. She posted on Facebook a few weeks ago a picture of her boyfriend working on their car next to a beer, and captioned it with ""yeah that's his beer, if you have something stupid to say about it, say it to my face!""   It's just a matter of time before they break up again and more drama erupts. Last time they broke up, she had posted on Facebook that the guy wasn't safe for her kids to be around, and that she'd never let him around them again. Before she brought this guy back into her life, she had a different boyfriend where there was a domestic dispute, they both assaulted each other but neither pressed charges, and the kids had to be locked in their room. Brother has a text of her talking about it.   She smoked cigarettes while pregnant with all of her kids and still smokes. She sent my brother a text about how she was smoking in the car and an ash flew under her butt and she crashed the car, several months ago. She's posted several videos on Facebook of her recording her kids dancing to music at a 180 degree angle from the road, and has one video (albeit a year old) where one of her kids is next to her in the passenger's seat.  Brother is a registered sex offender. Offense was committed 8 years ago. Makes 40k a year, has his own home and lives with a girlfriend. They've been in a stable relationship for a year. Never has brought the daughter around any other girls.  In the court ordered parental agreement, my brother is only supposed to see Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. However, through informal agreements, my brother has seen the baby every weekend Thursday-Sunday for several months. Before that, informally he had the baby Thursday-Sunday every other week, and visited on the alternating weeks.   My brother drives 1 and a half hours to see his daughter one way, it should be mentioned. He's driving 6 hours round trip each week to have his daughter.   Our biggest issues are her instability and that everytime Mother gets mad she threatens to ""enforce"" the actual parental agreement, which would mean that Brother only gets Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. She uses the daughter as a pawn to control my brother.   He used to give her $200 a month, undocumented, on top of his child support. He stopped after a lawyer advised him to, she went hysterical and nearly ""enforced the agreement"" again. It's walking on eggshells with her now. Any day she will probably pull their informal agreement. We don't even know if he'll  be allowed to get her this upcoming week.  Our question -   My brother wants to hire a lawyer and go to court. He wants the primary custodian title, shared decision making and to have Baby 5/7 days while the Mother would get her during the weekends. Is this possible, considering the circumstances? We have screenshots of everything I mentioned, texts she's sent him, etc. He just doesn't want to waste the $4000 retainer for a lawyer if this is going to be a waste of time or if there's not enough here, if his sex offender status would not allow for it, etc.   The mother likely can't afford a lawyer. Don't know if she would be representing herself or what, but probably.   Thanks."	Yes
I've been divorced for 10 years with two children and have been paying my ex-wife child support based on my 2007 salary of 60k. She never worked during our seven years of marriage so I pay her a reasonable amount, I believe it was 25% to 30% of my gross salary. In that time she has remarried and though that is specifically irrelevant to the circumstances, she has had two children with her current husband which have led me to take a greater role in the parenting of our two children. Over the past five years I've had the children residing in my town four days per week and going to school in my district. My ex-wife lives about 20 miles away and has them at her house about three days per week. She now is seeking an adjustment in child support due to cost of living increases. I think this would be fair if not for the fact that I have taken on greater responsibility as a parent. Though she may not agree with this assertion. I also do all the day to day driving of my teens relative to school functions and social engagement. Basically I always have to be around. Luckily I have tremendous flexibility at work.   If she seeks an adjustment, would the amount increase proportional to not only the cost of living, but also my current much higher salary of 150k? Based on my more significant role in my childrens' lives, would it be worth contesting the increase or would this be futile and not worth the legal fees?	Yes
I'm paying $805 a month for my daughter. I had resigned from my job as a corrections officer due to my mental health being severely affected. I developed PTSD, depression, and anxiety. My doctor had recommended another line of work due to the stress levels I was experiencing. I had left in April 2016.  My daughter is under custody of her grandmother. It was a mutual agreement at the time because my daughter's mom was a very neglectful parent doing drugs, didn't want to work, and I wasn't working so it was hard for me to financially provide while unemployed.  In August of 2016 (while I was unemployed) I was served to determine child support. The meeting was basically a child support agent asking me how much I make, did I have a pension, any savings, investments, etc. I had nothing. I was still waiting for a response to be eligible for a pension withdrawal at the time, but I didn't mention that. After that, I received no word from them.  January 2017, I receive paperwork stating that as of October 1, 2016, I was obligated to pay $805 in child support, and that I was in arrears. I'm dumbfounded by this information because I had no income. I didn't have anything from my pension because I used what little I had to pay bills. I got it in September and it was gone by mid December.  In June of 2017, I FINALLY got a job after months of looking. It doesn't pay as much as my job as a corrections officer did, but it paid something and I was happy. I felt like I could finally get back on my feet and begin providing myself and my children the lifestlye they used to have. I had to downside a lot of luxuries, but I made it work. That was all good until I was arrested for failure to pay child support. I had just started the job two weeks in, and then I'm thrown in jail. My bail amount was $750, my dad helped me out with it. Luckily I was still able to keep my job.   I've gone through so much and it's been stressing over this court ordered amount. I don't even make enough in a month to pay so much and have anything left over for living expenses. My tax return was intercepted to pay arrears. The grandmother listed she doesn't work, when I have her work number. I don't know what to do.   Can child support be determined from previous wages earned? Is that legal? I wasn't working. What do I do to make this right?	Yes
Hi everyone. I don't know who to go to for this but my parents have been married for 31 years and are discussing divorce. No one has cheated on anyone but they have been miserable for years (almost daily fighting for the past 17 years). And frankly, my mother is extremely emotionally abusive.  They have a house and lots of stuff but they are in more debt than the house is worth (they refinanced when the house was worth $200,000 more than it is now). My mother is trying to tell my dad that she will keep everything other than a couple things she has no interest in (like his workout equipment).  They live in California and have no minor children (three adult children - one of which lives with them).  I believe they should sell everything they can sell (they have lots of expensive furniture and antiques), including their house, to minimize their shared debt as much as possible and split the debt that is left over and go their separate ways. I don't believe my mother can make the mortgage payments anyway (she hasn't in months and months) and they have a tax lien on the house. But I have no experience or training in this field.   I am worried that my dad doesn't have enough knowledge to know what he can reasonably ask for / expect in his divorce. Neither of them can afford legal representation so my mom is banking on that to get everything she wants.  ***Most importantly,*** I'm concerned because my mother has made the majority of the mortgage payments the past 8 or so years after my parents left their well paying professional careers. It is important to note that my dad's contribution to their marriage is not less because she made more mortgage payments after their bank accounts were separated - he raised the kids, cleaned the house, took care of the pets, did all of the grocery shopping, all of the cooking, took us to all of our doctors appointments, emergency room visits, took care of the house, all of the cleaning, literally everything other than the majority of payments were done by him our whole lives whereas my mom took over as majority breadwinner the past 8ish years (all bills were shared beforehand). I'm concerned that this financial record will give her the say in what is done with the house and most of the things they bought together the past 31 years.  Any and all advice is super appreciated!  Thank you! From a daughter who wants what is fair.	Yes
Hi guys. Throwing away since ex is on Reddit. Thanks for reading.   I [30M] facing a situation where the [29f] mother of my son  (never married) and I are parting ways in the next month. We have verbally agreed on 50/50 custody and would like to avoid any court battle if necessary when it comes to splitting my son's expenses going forward.¬†  I first want to understand what I should be doing on my end / what my options are as a father to try and get us to create a legal document that will end with us splitting any costs for my son (either 50/50 or according to income) as they come up (medical, daycare, etc).  There is, however, one hiccup. My ex-girlfriend is heavily set on a need for child support and gets aggressively angry at the prospect of splitting costs.¬†I am so against this since medical, dental, and day care are all in my name and paid by me at this point. It would make no sense for me to pay her child support for her to turn around and give it back for me to pay these shared expenses.   I realize the alternative is going to court and potentially paying a lot more or, god forbid losing 50/50 custody. So what should I prepare and get in writing? How careful should I be to get our communication in writing? And, if you can spare it, how do I sell this to her/compromise fairly for the sake of avoiding court.  TLDR: EX and I are splitting. We both want to avoid court, but she wants child support and I want to split shared expenses as they come. How do we come to an agreement and what needs to be done to make that agreement legal and binding?	Yes
"Specifics of the situation:  Friend (we'll call her Stacy), is married to Adam (we will call him that for privacy purposes). Stacy and Adam have been (happily, for the most part) married for 5 years, and share ownership of most things they own, such as the house they own together. Adam has 2 teenagers that he had with his first wife, and Stacy has a 7 year old daughter that she had with her first husband. Adam had gone to Saudi Arabia for his job, and decided to cut off all communication to see who would try to get in contact with him.  Originally, this seemed like a screwed-up social experiment. Had Adam called Stacy and said: ""hey, you been goofed!"" It would have been fine. After the social experiment had ended, he still kept communications with the teenagers. After a few days, the teenagers took everything from the house, including the safe with the deed (which has Stacy and Adam's names on it) and left.   The teenagers are God knows where, Adam is still in Saudi Arabia lawyering up for what looks to be a divorce? But Stacy doesn't know what to do, since Adam hasn't paid any bills since they've been together and she has provided for the family since day 1. She wants to go to a help center that can provide her with a lawyer for family law, since she doesn't have the money to afford a lawyer.  Also, a lot of evidence has been found on the phones that the teenagers left, and the family computer that shows communication, meditation, and intent between the teenagers and Adam. They had been planning to take the stuff and leave as soon as they could. They left the cars and the phones because the ownership was in Stacy's name.  Is the lawyer from the help center Stacy's best and only option if she cannot afford anything else? Are there any other steps she can take to potentially start a new life with her young daughter? Stacy still has to pay for mortgage, car payments, etc, all by herself. Is this abandonment, and if so, how can she legally, and financially recover from this?"	Yes
Hello, Thank you. Here is the question.   I am in Florida and I just received a letter from Texas regarding child support.  I am listed as the non-custodial parent. The mother is a woman I haven't seen/heard from in 14 years.  She left 14 years ago to return to Texas. I was not aware of this child, this is the first I am hearing about this. I never signed a Birth Certificate.  I don't know this childs name or birth date. Doesn't there have to be proof I am the father? What are my options? How does this cross-state child support work? Do I find a lawyer in Florida or Texas? If mine, can I contest for custody?  Or Joint?  Please, any words of advice.  Thank you in advance.	Yes
My father has alcohol induced dementia (at least we think). I am 23 he is 61. He was being watched and taken to doctors by his siblings but they want nothing to do with him anymore. He is currently living in the northeast, I live in Virginia, but I think his legal state of residence in California. I think he said a neurologist said he didn't have dementia and a psychologist said he did but he is unreliable. He is incoherent the majority of the time and absolutely should not be driving and probably should not be living alone. He likes to jet around the country to live in all these different places with girlfriends or family and doesn't listen to anyone.   How do I get power of attorney for his legal stuff (he's been divorced from my mom 15 years but they still clown a house and she wants him to sign it over but he doesn't even understand what she wants). I also want to be in charge of him medically in case I want to put him in assisted living or get his license revoked. I'm very confused by what I have read online. Does anyone have basic steps I will need to take? And is it ever possible to force someone into assisted living?	Yes
My mom, she's in her 60s, married a man about 6 months ago. My mom is not financially well but the man is very well off. She's super religious, they met at a church and have been in a relationship for about 5 years now. She didn't believe in being together for so long without getting married and they finally tied the knot. They're happy together though. He's treated her so well.  He has adult daughters that didn't agree with this at all. They thought my mom was after his money. She promised them several times that she wasn't but that didn't go over well. She's tried to connect with his side of the family but they never accepted her. That's been tough. She's worried that if anything happened to him, that she would just be thrown to the side and be forgotten about.  Even though they got married officially 6 months ago, they had a wedding ceremony a month ago, and he didn't seem well. He became forgetful and was physically unable to do things he was able to do before. A couple of weeks ago he was diagnosed with Alzheimers.   When the daughters found out, they wanted to send him to a home and told my mom that there was nothing she could do and she should move on. She couldn't accept that. They visited a couple of lawyers to see if she could be written into his will but it seemed like none of them wanted to be a part of this. Now it's gotten worse. For the past couple of days he has been stuck in bed, and hasn't been able to talk. She's been crying on the phone with me everyday and it's incredibly heartbreaking. She's been scared to contact his daughters because if she did, she feared that she'd be cast aside. I told her that she had to immediately, that's his family and they had to know. So she did. They're about to move him to another state (NC) where they live to be closer. They told her that if she had other things to take care of somewhere that she should go do it and leave him with them.   Does she have any protections or rights as a spouse at this moment? I read that they had to be together for at least a year before anything takes place unless he was able to change his will but things have progressed much quicker than we anticipated. Now since she's not in the will and it's been less than a year, I fear that there's nothing that can be done.   Thanks.	Yes
Trying to help my friend who is getting a divorce. He  is active duty military. He and wife separated but were trading weeks with child. Wife decided to get out of the military, husband reenlisted. Child was supposed to go with husband to new duty station per military orders. 2 weeks before the move, wife takes child out of state without husbands permission and keeps child out of state until husband had to move to next duty station.  It has now been a few months and wife refuses to let husband see child at all except for a 3 min phone call each day. They have some sort of court date in November to decide some things.  My question is: how is her keeping the kid like this not illegal? If the divorce is not finalized and there is no official custody arrangement, don't both parents have equal rights to the child?  I'm aware that this hurts her in the long run, but my friend is desperate to see his kid. He has hired a lawyer but they aren't helping him on this front and not giving a clear answer as to how she gets away with this.	Yes
My daughter (age 7) lives in Minnesota with her father. I live in Washington state. We originally lived in Washington together, moved to Minnesota together into his father's house, and then I came home after I had difficulty finding a job, in order to get a job here and save money so we could afford to get our own place in Minnesota because his father did not like having me and all of my other children there (I have 5 other children).   The agreement between my ex and I was that our daughter would stay there with him because his father is ill and he wanted her to have a chance to form a relationship with him. That was 3 years ago. I ended the relationship with him after I came back. We never married and never established a parenting plan or any official custody or anything. He claims I wouldn't win anything in court because he lives on a reservation and tribal court always favors the Native child staying with the Native family.   I say the tribal court doesn't have jurisdiction because he doesn't live on the reservation affiliated with the tribe he's actually registered with and that any custody proceedings would be in standard Minnesota courts. Regardless, I haven't seen my daughter in 3 years and when I schedule time to call and talk to her, he often doesn't answer the phone or isn't home. I haven't spoken to her since January.   I've offered to fly out there to see her but he usually makes some excuse about why it's not a good time. I'm fed up and frustrated and I have no protection because we have nothing established in court about my rights to have access to her. What do I do?	Yes
I'm aware that prenuptial agreements cannot decide child custody. However, is there any type of agreement that an unmarried couple (with plans to get married in future) can have drawn up stating that Spouse A won't actively seek primary physical custody and will cede primary physical custody to Spouse B given a divorce or separation as long as the court doesn't see this as not in the best interest of the child?  If not, what steps can the couple take to ensure Spouse B would get primary physical custody upon the event of a divorce or separation?	Yes
I'll get straight to the point. I got a phone call today from my aunt saying that my estranged father has lung cancer, is in hospice, and has estimated a week to live. I'm currently in Connecticut (Litchfield County), so I'm not able to fulfill his request of going back to New York (Erie County) to see him before he passes.   My mother, being the money hungry narcissist that she is, is talking about how she's going to look into the possibility of his Social Security being used to pay his rather outstanding child support balance for my sister (20 years old) and I (25 years old). I'm not certain that would even be a possibility, but if by some miracle that is a thing that happens, I would like to be prepared with any facts or advice on how to make sure my mother doesn't get the complete sun so my sister and I can split it between ourselves evenly.   My father has no estates or assets. He's a homeless man who lives off of my Aunt's couch and a drug addict/alcoholic. Again, no clue if Social Security paying off outstanding child support is even a thing (highly doubtful), but if it is, I greatly appreciate the advice.	Yes
So my father has been in jail/prison for a while now, and my mother is a narcissistic bitch who blames any problem she has on him. I don‚Äôt want to visit him with her.   She says she doesn‚Äôt want me to go with anyone except her, so that‚Äôs a problem. It‚Äôs probably been almost 8 or 9 years  My question is, if I visit him with my grandparents (his side) and she somehow finds out, can they get in legal trouble for bringing me without asking her, since I am under 18  Also if he is located in a different state does that affect laws?	Yes
The mom and I broke up before she was even born. Since then, the mom has battled substance abuse problems so that is why she resides with her uncle. My name is not on her birth certificate. I just really want to gradually become a part of her life. Recently, I reached out to the uncle and he was not supportive of it. However, I don't want to give up and I feel that I have so much to offer her. Any advice?	Yes
wife's ex and us were working on a new visitation schedule for her daughter who is (now) 17. daughter suddenly decides she doesn't want to follow the CURRENT plan on file, and starts staying at dad's full time.    So now with the new plan almost signed, we really don't have any motivation to sign it, since what is on file is not being followed anyway and it doesn't give us a whole lot of faith the new one will be either.  Do we have any ground to stand on?  Should we just say fuck it and let it go?	Yes
My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	Yes
Hello everyone. So basically what has happened is right now I am 16 and my parents honestly hate me. They are abusive and neglect my well being and have caused a lot of mental health issues for me. Anyways I plan on leaving them FOREVER the day I turn 18 and finish school...however after today I do not think that will be possible anymore.    So what happened is that they wont allow me to buy my own car so instead bought the family a truck to use in generally, they told I have to PAY THEM BACK for a fucking 60k truck. They said once I pay them back fully It will be mine to keep however there is no way in hell i will ever be able to pay them back in fucking two years. Which means after i turn 18 i still am gonna be making them payments. I never agreed to this and I need to know   If i run away after i finish school without paying them back for this truck(which i never brough and it isnt legally mine) can they do legal action against me or like take me to court...  As of my location I live in Canada in the province of Alberta.	Yes
So I am moving out next week and my parents are becoming increasingly bitter over it. They told me I have to take literally everything that's mine with me when I leave (which I will not be able to do, I have a small car and also the house I'll be renting at has no space for anything and is already furnished anyways).   I'm wondering from a legal perspective if I have to do this? 90% of the things that would be considered mine, there would be no way to prove that it's actually mine (bed, nightstand, tv, etc).   I have a week to get rid of all this shit and I'm kind of freaking out. Most of it is unimportant to me and I wasn't planning on taking it. Do I legally have to?  I am 20 years old if that matters.	Yes
Hi I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question, I have just never had to deal with court or legal things and I figured I would give this a shot. I am trying to find out exactly what sort of paperwork may be needed or what can be done.  A little background, I have a 17 month old child with a man. He is not in the picture. My son is on Medicaid so now the state has said they want to go after him for money. When I was filling out the paperwork, there was an option for medical assistance only so I checked that. I don't want or need child support from this man but I understand the state wanting to go after him for the medicaid.  I have court later this week but I believe it is just a paternity establishment case since paternity has not been established and the father is not on the birth certificate. I am just wondering what to expect so any advice would be appreciated. Again, sorry if this is a stupid post. I am just stressing out over this whole situation even though I probably shouldn't be.	Yes
"Hello, Ex wife gets house in divorce. My name was supposed to stay on it until a Re-Fi by Jan 2019. Ex wife finds dude, gets pregnant, moves away. Attempts to sell house. Comes up that her ""refi"" she told me that she was going to do was a loan modification, resulting in a 24k lean on the house. Cannot sell house because of this. Tells me flatly ""I have no plans to pay"" after this deal falls through. Mortgage will be officially late on the 10th of this month.  Credit score is currently 745 (I work hard) and it going to tank because of this. Decree states that he has to pay/indemnify me of all damages/financial issues. Not sure how to proceed. How can I minimize the issue? I want to bring her to contempt of court. She told me she choose not to work this summer to stay home with her new baby. The irony was that I could have lived in the house and made all of the payments.   What is my next move?"	Yes
"I'm ready to divorce my wife of almost three years. We got married in October of 2014 because she needed to go back to her country for family issues and couldn't leave due to being undocumented. I absolutely loved her at the time but we really married for the wrong reasons. I'm so unhappy and ready to get my life back.   Anyway here's the stuff I'm worried about:  - We own a home together, but I'm the only one on the mortgage; if she tries to take the house is it true I'm also entitled to have her take responsibility for my debt? Would a judge really grant her hundreds of thousands of dollars and leave me to pay for it for the next 30 years without a home?  - I have a small retirement fund that started after we were married, is she entitled to any of it? It's barely $5000.   - She hasn't been working for the last year and a half but is perfectly able to find work. She worked while I was finishing my degree so I agreed she should take some time off when I found work in my field (we agreed to ""a few months""). She is not educated beyond high school.   - She is not a citizen, but qualifies for citizenship under our marriage early next year. Does this affect anything?  - I'd much prefer arbitration over a legal battle, what is a good way to get this?  - I have massive student debt, is it true I am entitled to have her take part of that debt? I would only use this as a bargaining tool if things got bad.   - I make just under six figures a year; do I have to worry about alimony if our marriage was so short?  Appreciate any advice!"	Yes
Hi all,  My husband and I separated over a year ago and have been living apart since. We live in Arizona. We verbally agreed to the division of our stuff and it hasn't been an issue so far. Part of our agreement was that he could keep the house when we filed for divorce - I will sign off on the deed and he will initiate he refinance to have my name removed from the mortgage. My understanding is that this is the process and that I can't just remove myself from the mortgage.  I'm finally moving forward with filing the divorce paperwork, but I have some concerns. What if he doesn't refinance the house? I am looking to write the divorce decree in such a way that gives him 60 days to make a good faith attempt to refi in his own name and remove me from the mortgage and if he doesn't, hold him in contempt of court or something like that. Basically, since it will be his responsibility, I want it to be enforceable in case he decides to change his mind and my name is stuck on a mortgage for a house I don't own.   Is this something I can do own my own or does anyone have any experience with something like this? I'd hate to involve an attorney if I don't have to.  Thanks :)	Yes
"Our joint custody agreement was made in Texas naming me the primary custodian, which, in Texas, means I make the decisions about where my son lives, goes to school. Actually, I believe the term is ""conservator,"" rather than custodian. This year his father and I have agreed that my son will be living with his dad in Tennessee for the next year only.  The school (I have called them to confirm) is requesting that I get a letter notarized stating that I give primary custodianship to the father, because in TN whoever the child lives with has custodianship. I am not about to sign my rights away. The father and I have recently had an amicable relationship though he has made attempts in the past to get sole custody and I do not trust him. School is starting soon, so what are my options?"	Yes
"This is my first post so I'm not quite sure how this works, but, I think I get the gist of it.  I'm a 22 y/o who got married at 20 years old. My husband and I have always had a very tough relationship, sometimes we have good days but a lot of the times it's very imbalanced and doesn't make us nearly as happy as we could/should be. I feel like a POS because to be quite honest I shouldn't have married him. I was unhappy a lot of the time leading up to the wedding and even the day after we got married we were already back to fighting. I'll save the rest of the background info for somewhere other than legal advice but yeah, essentially we were never really happy. Now, 3 months after getting married I found out I was pregnant with our first baby. We fought most of my pregnancy, and in a particularly explosive fight he shoved me. Mind you, I had slapped him earlier in the fight which I know is totally wrong and fucked up, so I accept my wrong there. But yeah, I thought about leaving him and I didn't. There have been a million times when we have ""broken up"" or come close to it, within and prior to our marriage, but somehow nothing changes and we just keep moving along.  I have come to the decision (for the millionth time.......) that we need to divorce. I don't want to be in this relationship, however, he has always been the bread winner and we're currently stuck in a rent-to-own situation where we have $12,000 (that came from his trust fund) invested as the down payment. I am a stay at home mom and my mat leave has ended, so the only thing I bring in money wise is my few hundred dollar a month baby bonus. Now, a bit ago when we talked about splitting up, he said he wouldn't want anything to do with me and would never cohabitate/split up our current house. But, we have a shared vehicle, (which he uses because we never cared about me getting my license since we were together all the time anyways), and we literally are in a 2-3 year agreement with this house, paying really really high rent in hopes of being able to apply for a mortgage and the end of our term and own it. If we don't get approved at the end of 2 or 3 years, we lose the rent/monthly savings from the program we selected, as well as our $12,000 deposit.  He has also made claims that he will not be the ""weekend dad"" and even though he currently works days as a contractor, he would want to split custody evenly, which would mean our baby would be in child care during the days that he has her, instead of being with me. I am currently taking a course that costs $500 monthly for the year, which is really what any money I have goes to, so I'm scared that if he won't cohabitate I won't be able to afford living on my own and paying for my course. I'm really scared because he gets very uncooperative and vindictive when we talk about divorce because he personally thinks we should stay married. Does ANYONE have advice on any of this?"	Yes
Hello everyone,  I'm located in Pinellas County, FL (city of St. Petersburg). I'm looking to add to my middle name/hyphenate it.  i.e. first, middle-middle, last name.  Do I have to file a petition for change of name to legally add this additional name to my middle name only?  I'm debating whether it's worth filing the paperwork, paying the fees &amp; investing the time.  Thanks in advance!	Yes
TL:DR-In my ‚Äúinfinite wisdom‚Äù I believed it a good idea to get married at the age of 21 as a US citizen to my long-distance boyfriend who is a Canadian Citizen. It was my first serious relationship as an ‚Äúadult‚Äù and while at the time I made excuses why, it was a very rocky relationship. After almost two years of being married it all fell apart and I moved back home with my parents. He jerked me around with dancing on the ‚ÄúMaybe I still want you‚Äù line for a bit before I finally said it was over. While back in the states it took him years but I finally got request for divorce papers in the mail. I believed that was the end of it, but after contacting him he swore up and down he still has a bunch of paperwork to work through before we can be properly divorced. I no longer believe him when he said he would handle it. I just got engaged 8 years later but I have no idea if the divorce went through or how to handle it moving forward as I plan my first proper wedding.  We were married IN Alberta and when he filed he was still there and I was (and still am ) in Rhode Island.  I‚Äôm going to preface this all by saying I‚Äôm very ashamed of the whole situation. I was a very stupid lonely kid who didn‚Äôt realize just how greatly I was screwing my life over. I‚Äôm sorry this got long, I still get pretty emotional thinking about the whole situation. If this is not the right place to post this I would really appreciate being directed to the right place.  2006 - I come from a pretty tense and dysfunctional family, so when it came time for me to go to college I chose something far away. While attending my first semester at college I did not know anyone there and spent the majority of my time by myself in the library or computer labs. It wasn‚Äôt long before I got officially involved with a long-distance boyfriend from Canada. Huge phone bills were racked up due to international calls and he even ventured out to see me on a very long bus ride.   2007 ‚Äì I ended up transferring back to my home state and after a short time spent back at my parent‚Äôs home I decided I needed to get out of there. If I went straight back to school the next semester my parents agreed to help me get an apartment if I could prove I could pay for it. I worked full time and went to school full-time that semester but ended up failing most of my classes because I was just not able to handle that load on top of depression. The Canadian long-distance boyfriend came to stay with me for roughly a month where I supported him as he had no job back home and had been living with his parents. Had I been smart I would have seen that the relationship was clearly toxic at this point, but I‚Äôve always had a quiet sappy romantic side that had me wanting to believe that this ‚Äúfirst love‚Äù was special enough to be the one.    In the fall I moved out of the apartment and transferred yet again, this time to a college where I could live on campus, but still close enough to home where I went back to my parents nearly every weekend. My mother was convinced I would do better in this setting, and to her credit my grades were all passing even though my heart wasn‚Äôt really in it. Many Many phone conversations later he (Canadian Boyfriend) convinced me to move out there with him so that we could be together. At that point he had gotten an overnight job and a small studio apartment that I had flown out for a week to visit so I honestly believed it was a logical next step.  Spring 2008- I packed up a single bag and two carry-ons and moved to Canada. Whether I believed it might not work out, or that I would be stopped by suspicious customs folk I can no longer remember, but I went there with a return ticket that went unused. While the relationship was okay in the beginning it quickly deteriorated. As I wasn‚Äôt a citizen I could not get a job, car or really anything else that required money so I was at his mercy when it came to pretty much anything. He insisted I have the same sleep schedule he did as an overnight worker and that pretty much killed any hope of a social life outside of him that didn‚Äôt involve the internet. Sex frustrated him as we were both virgins and he came to place that blame on me. While I was willing to work through everything, he was impatient and eventually decided it was all because I was not attractive enough for him. Yes, he would explain this to my face. Believing that I was indeed the problem I did my best to try to fit into that mold he kept claiming he wanted. But I came to learn that if I improved one thing he would quickly find another fault that MUST be why he wasn‚Äôt interested in me. He would pepper in romantic conversations saying I was beautiful and he didn‚Äôt know what was wrong with him and that he loved me in between all of this so I moronically stayed.    The six-month mark rapidly approached and I was told the only way I could stay any longer is if we got married. Believing myself in love I was for it, ‚ÄúIf I really love you and want to be with you, why now?‚Äù I‚Äôd thought. We decided that was what we would do. He did not pop the question he just called me over to the computer one day to help him pick out wedding rings from a cheap site online. I convinced myself that that was what I wanted so it didn‚Äôt matter that it wasn‚Äôt romantic. We filed for a marriage license and a short time later I was informed by him that we‚Äôd be getting married a couple days later in a park because he had already booked the officiant. I bought a dress I hated from some outlet store (It was brown and black with some green but it was the only dress I could find in that store at a low price that looked ok on me.) So on a muddy day when the trees didn‚Äôt even have enough green on them to look nice I got married. The whole affair was almost as miserable as that evening when he wouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with me because he was too tired. My family and friends were confused and more than a little upset that they were not invited or even told when this was happening and some of them stopped talking to me completely because of it.   The rest of the time (Less than a year of marriage) I spent there is a dismal blur of fights about filing paperwork for citizenship (He procrastinated for EVERYTHING. The only thing he stayed on top of was getting married to I could extend my stay) or where he said hurtful things and me falling into a depression so deep I started sleeping away the time I didn‚Äôt waste playing video games and started to rationalize jumping off a local bridge to just get out. Multiple times I caught him having long-distance relationships, the final one I knew about was some 17-year-old from Texas who he told we were already divorced. After weeks of sleeping on the couch after learning about that one (Clearly it was my fault for not being able to hold his interest on a physical level and being a moody depressed boring person. Oh yes, he said these things to my face.) I broke down and called my mother and told her it was over and I needed to go home. This was almost a year exactly after we had gotten married. I remember being on the road and laughing like a crazy person when I realized it was out anniversary.   2009- My mother has her issues and we don‚Äôt always see eye to eye, but on this occasion, she came through so hard for me. She quickly got time off work and drove with my sister from South Dakota to Alberta in two days. When it was clear that she was showing up and not leaving without me my ‚Äúhusband‚Äù did a lot of back-pedaling trying to explain that I had been irrational in being so quick to find a way back home. She showed up and he left while I packed my things into my mother‚Äôs car. When we were finished he came back and kissed me goodbye saying he had no idea if he wanted me to come back again.  When my family and I got to the hotel I had received an e-mail from him saying not to contact him, he needed space, he would tell me when it was ok for us to talk again. I was very broken. After getting home I spent a month so shattered I lost 20 pounds from not being able to eat much. My mother helped me get my license back (it had expired in Canada) sort my school debts out (He had refused to pay any of my school bills because it didn‚Äôt affect us in Canada). I moved in with friends for a few months before moving back home. It was at this time that my Canadian ‚Äúhusband‚Äù had decided he wanted me back and that some of our troubles were actually his fault. I was angry, but usually heard him out. After falling into an old fight I just stopped taking his calls after I told him I wanted a divorce. He popped up on my doorstep not long after trying to win me back. He convinced me to give it another try but it came down to me being unable to trust him. So we were over. He said he would handle the divorce, it would be cheaper if he did it himself without a lawyer. At that point I was so scarred from the whole experience I didn‚Äôt believe I wanted to ever get married again anyway so I wasn‚Äôt overly concerned and agreed he could do it.    In October, when I had been living with them, my parents started going through a messy divorce. During that time, I kept my head down, worked a lot of hours and started planning to move out. My mother and siblings had moved out due to the divorce and I guess because I was an ‚Äúadult‚Äù she just left me staying at the house with my dad. I‚Äôve never had a good relationship with my father, he‚Äôs a very angry man, with a touchy temper prone to violent outbursts. (My mother had been so convinced he would react violently she told him via text message which my father made me read aloud to him when he got home) It was pretty fucked up. Time went by, life happened and a long-distance friendship blossomed into a romance and relationship by December.   February I flew out and spent a week with my new beau trying to just move on with my life. Nothing physical happened outside of making-out because I had been completely upfront and honest about my situation and he wanted to take things slow. After coming back to South Dakota I became much more interested in the progress of the divorce, but when I contacted my Canadian Ex I would get a lot of excuses and run arounds. He would make brief progress after I threatened to get a lawyer involved from my side but it never seem to stay on track.   Unhappy with my living situation it didn‚Äôt take long for the idea of moving out to the east coast to sound really appealing. Initially I had wanted to get my own place and build into the new relationship slowly, but making minimum wage and paying for some of my parents bills I didn‚Äôt have the means to amass the money for a down payment or rent for the first few month while I got settled. In 2010 I moved to Rhode Island from South Dakota and into my new boyfriend‚Äôs apartment.   Years later my Canadian Ex got my address and sent me papers declaring intention to divorce. He had told me I did not have to do anything and the divorce would go forward soon. I was so happy that I had thought it was finally over. That stupid raincloud was going to be off of my head and out of my life.  After this in 2013 my New Boyfriend attempted a proposal at Disney World. I say attempt because I was still so skittish to the idea of marriage that in a panic I yanked him off of his knee and walked forward like nothing happened. This naturally caused tension, but he was very patient and understanding about the whole situation.  After a lot of serious discussions and talks about our future he finally got the nerve to ask me to marry him again on May 25th of this year 2017. I said yes. After a few months of excitedly planning and dreaming what our big day will look like I‚Äôve come to realize that the raincloud of my first marriage might not be fully gone. The last time I spoke to my Ex a couple years ago (AFTER he had send me the papers) he said he had messed something up and it was going to take awhile because it cost a lot of money. (Another excuse, he gave me this song and dance after telling me he was in an upcoming magic the gathering tournament, and that man never skimped on buying cards for his perfect deck)  My Future husband believes that I shouldn‚Äôt do anything. That there is no technical record of me ever being in the United states so I should just pretend like it never happened. I have always filed my taxes as single since moving back to the states and getting back into work so as far as the system knows and cares I‚Äôm single and I have always been.   While in Canada I didn‚Äôt file any taxes, I never paid any bills, had nothing in my name save for a single credit card where the Ex used my ‚Äúmarried name‚Äù (I never filed for a name change but apparently the marriage certificate was enough to open a joint account in that name)  I don‚Äôt want my stupid decisions of the past to have any effect on my upcoming marriage or future life with the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.   Is there a way to figure out just where my Canadian Ex is in the process? Is there somewhere where I could get this information to see if it went through or just is stuck in limbo? Or do I need to find an attorney to get to the root of this?  Or would it be better just to follow my Fianc√©‚Äôs advice and pretend it never happened? What possible legal backlash could this cause if any?  I feel a little slimy at the idea of filling out a marriage certificate saying I've never been married before, but if my last marriage is stuck in a hellish legal limbo trying to get that wrapped up with proof that it's legally over sounds like an expensive nightmare.   After over 6 years separated I just want this to be over.    Frankly I have no idea how to handle this situation moving forward. Contacting my Ex would likely only lead to another set of run arounds and excuses that give me no information whatsoever.  If you‚Äôve made it this far I am extremely grateful, I did not anticipate this would end up being so long or so‚Ä¶all over the place.   If I have made anything unclear or you have any questions please ask. Thank you for your patience.	Yes
"TL:DR at botrom...  Child was born in Texas. She is married in Texas but was separated when we started dating. The mother was apparently sleeping with both of us after a while and got pregnant. When she found out, she insisted it was her husband's and went back to work things out with him with very little communication between us until birth.   After the baby was born, at the end of March this year, I insisted on a paternity test to be certain. Finally bought a test from the company Identigene on Amazon as they seem to be reputable and accurate from reviews I've read. We collected the samples as instructed with mother's permission and mailed it back. We got the results emailed to us and it turns out I am the father.   Now that we have those results I scheduled a ""court approved"" lab test to be done this Wednesday. Her husband recently left for business in another state and will be relocating there and wants her to move with him. She has not told him that she had the test done but plans to tell him the results of the lab test this week as well as tell him that she is not planning to relocate out of state and she is actually looking to move into a house much closer to where I live so that I can be an active parent to this child.  To be clear, so far: she regrets getting back with him bc she thought he was the father and now that he's not she plans to divorce him and stay close to me, but we are not getting back together ourselves at the moment but she is being fully cooperative and wants me to have every legal right to be this kids father.  TL:DR  What do I need to do legally to change a child's birth certificate to remove someone else as the father and have me added instead. What else do I need to do? Mother is fully cooperating with me so far."	Yes
"I understand that getting legal advice like this on the internet can be complicated and I'm certainly not looking for definitive answers. I'm also aware how during a divorce there is always hearsay and he-said, she-said or just the old two sides to every story. I would ask though that given this is my life and my family, whom I know intimately and have decades of anecdotal evidence I'm basing this off of. I would ask that within the constraints of this post we just more or less take my statements and fact and then offer your advice accordingly. My intention here is to find a starting point with some good professional advice in what is likely to be a long and complicated road ahead.  My mother married a mentally unstable and physically abusive/alcoholic narcissist. It has taken me many years of living on my own to be able to get my bearings and see him for what he is and although he was certainly not always this way he has started to get worse as it seems he's now working towards an agenda.   I don't see him as this particular mastermind as it is clear he is riddled with mental issues which have gone undiagnosed all his life as he both denies any and all of it and also refuses treatment. However I have recently learned from my mother that a woman, lets call her Becky, with whom my father has had an affair with in the past is back in the picture. Rather she never left the picture, it's just that Becky and my father have gotten sloppy and my mom has noticed. Becky it seems also has a long history, looking back in hindsight, of being EXTREMELY effective at manipulation and extracting money from people. My father is also one of those people (some of you may be able to relate) who puts external social validation WELL above the needs/validation of family....  Becky started out as a family friend about ~15yrs ago. Because my father so vehemently vouched for her it took a long time for her shitty personality traits to shine through on its own and about 9 yrs ago my mother, brother and I all confronted my father and explained to him that she is no good. That we no longer are willing to deal with or finance any of her bullshit. Especially if it means doing so puts our family in financial distress. Then perhaps 5 yrs ago my mother had to overhaul their finances and discovered my dad had several maxed out CC's which he was in the process of having sent to collections. At the time just his off-center personality explained these away and we did not dig into it much more but I've recently found out. That as far back as 3 yrs ago my mother was informed through a trusted friend that Becky and my father were seeing each other a few times a year.... every year... now those CCs make more sense. My father also has not worked a 9-5 in his entire life. He has had some work in the past but has mostly been living off my mother and drinking for the last ~10yrs.  Again, I have to stress that I don't think my father is capable of scheming so much as Becky is capable of putting thoughts and words into his head. It would seem that he is convinced that if my mother were to divorce him, since they live in California, he would get alimony and half of the assets. He and my mother are on the deed to their house however my mother is only one supporting them and paying the mortgage. Given the most recent phone calls I've had with my mother and hearing the distress in her voice with all the mental gymnastics my father knows how to put people through I get the impression he is hoping that a suicide would leave everything to him. Not that he can afford the mortgage, but he could certainly liquidate, downsize and then Becky would be able to live off of that for quite some time. The thing we discovered about Becky, again, hearsay, but people who know her who have reached out to us... this was many years ago. Said she was involved with another man in the exact same way. She leeched off of him and his family for many years and then the wife ""killed herself."" I'm laying this out because this is the kind of sick and twisted people my father is associated with. I wouldn't put anything past him at this point because he does own guns and I'm sure if Becky told him to kill my mom, he would just do it. He has done more irrational things in the past on a whim and I know in a divorce situation emotions run high and these threats can be thrown around without there usually being much validity. It's just that knowing my father I know he is more than capable of it because he's not mentally sound and he's clearly working for the interests of a person who while not crazy is certainly not a good person and like my father I feel I would be making a mistake by believing there is some line of rationality and reason which these people will not cross.  In my mind I want to treat this as a ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"" kind of situation.  I hope that was mostly coherent enough, as it is I had to spend 30min on the treadmill to clear my head enough and organize my thoughts.  Any advice is much appreciated."	Yes
Hello my sister has Down syndrome and was recently put into a civil commitment by the court. We the family do not agree which is why it went to court. The services provider now is her temporary guardian for 1 year and has a lot of control. They have denied my sister coming to visit family which she really enjoys and desires. They have also controlled the visiting schedule. They say that she is being neglected when she comes to visit which we think is absurd. Basically I want to know our rights as family members and her rights as an individual in her circumstance.  In court they said they didn't want to cut out the family which is exactly what they are doing. Any help is appreciated.    	Yes
First post. I broke up with my emotionally abusive, sometimes physically abusive ex. I found out he had been recording me with a motion detecting hidden camera. I wanted to go to the police when I first found them, but my ex and his family basically told me if I did, they'd go after my family(I don't know what that means, but my ex has threatened to shoot my family. I've asked his parents to take his gun away, but they haven't said anything.) This is where it gets weird...er. They told me how close they are to 2 former Presidents and how they'll be forced to get involved in this mess. I know they're not lying because I've seen pictures of them with a couple Presidents and politicians. Everyone in his family is either a lawyer or working for someone with a lot of political power.  Any advice on what I can do? How should I handle something like this?	Yes
(I'm going to apologize for this wall of text, but I really need to get this out there. We need help ,and I can't find anywhere else on reddit to ask these questions.)  I'm in need of some serious help here. I'm 23 and out of the house, but I have sisters back at home. We were all adopted. To give you some back story: I have 2 other sisters, 17 and 18. They live in NJ while I'm in Ohio. Yesterday they visited and while we were alone, my 18 year old sister said she needed to speak with me. Long story short, she had confirmed my long-term suspicion: my father is a creep, and is sexually harassing her, to put it lightly. I've been *slightly* suspicious for a while now, after he made some off-handed remarks to me and a couple incidents of inappropriate touching. I gave him the benefit of the doubt with the touching; I always just assumed it was an accident when it happened. It turns out that he had been making the very same comments to her, only it and the touching has gotten more extreme to the point where she is petrified of being alone with him in the house.   That being said, my obvious first reaction is to get her out of the house. I have an apartment with my SO and we are both willing to have her here. Getting her here isn't too much of an issue. We do have a problem though: her bank account. I don't remember the details, but she said that the *only* way she is able to withdraw money is with our parents present until she's 21. We're afraid that, since dad has control over the account, he will withdraw all of her money. Yes, he would do that to her. Is there any way around that policy? Can we talk to the bank and explain the situation and can they make an exception based off that? Also, since she is 18, there obviously isn't a problem with where she goes. But like I said before, my other sister is 17. If I got her out of the house and dad got angry, could I be arrested for kidnapping? I just want all my bases covered.   And here's a second thing: what do we do about HIM? My sister has done what she can, I think. She has contacted the police on a few ocassions. They brought him in for questioning, but nothing came of it. The problem is that our father uses his clout of being an ex-police officer of 20 years to get him by in this situation. It doesn't help that my sister has had a habit of over reactions and exaggerations (this is obviously not one of them). It seems that local law enforcement will do nothing major for her now. There's also the fact that she's tried to bring this up to our mother. As I said in the title, no one, not even our mother, believes her. Dad is smart, and always makes sure that his creepiness can be masked to look like something completely innocent. Understandably, mom has always given him the benefit of the doubt (along with everyone else), despite warning signs that even she is aware of (ex: dad sometimes watches things like documentaries of crimes of women being raped (seriously dad, what the fuck). Mom tells him repeatedly to turn those things off. She doesn't seem to put 2 and 2 together). That being said...what the hell am I supposed to do about this? Is there nothing that can be done? Will he never be punished for this?  This is how it's starting to look to me, and I can't believe it.   If anyone has any answers, or even just advice, please tell me. I'm coming to my wit's end.	Yes
"Hi everyone!!! I have no idea if this is the right place and I'll gladly delete if not!!  Short story my husband and I married at 18 about 6 months after I got sick. I was still able to work part time and did so until he asked me to quit for the wedding and then we were stationed in Japan for 3 years. I didn't  work while there because we didn't need the money enough/it didn't seem worth it with my health. My husband has hated me from day one because I'm sick and I tried my damned hardest for 5 years to be good enough despite it all but I failed. We moved back to the states and I had a part time job for a couple of months and then quit while he was in school so I could go back home with family while he was away. About a year and a half ago I came to visit family and just take a moment to try and figure out why i was so unhappy and how to be better for him. (After he continued to be mentally and emotionally abusive for 5 years and refused to seek help with me) Well when I got back home we started counseling online and i became insanly sick in January less than a month after being back. I was vomiting constantly, in severe pain, couldn't eat (I lost 70 pounds in 5 months) as well as a few other issues. I wasn't able to travel but we continued counseling online. Well my husband decided he didn't want me to come home. I found out a few months later he was cheating on me and he had moved from our home and in with her without telling me. I've been to countless doctors where i live and I'm currently waiting on an appointment with a group of doctors at a major hospital because no one can figure out why im so sick. My husband's continued to support me financially (he pays my car payments and cell phone bill as well as a little money for food/groceries).   Well his ""fiance"" gave me a call letting me know I should be expecting divorce papers shortly and he's done with me completely. I have noooooo idea what to do. I don't want to screw my husband over because despite how god awful he was to me I just hate the idea of making his life more difficult etc. HOWEVER I'm freaking out about the fact that I'm going to have no money no possibility of working even part time and from what i understand if I even qualify for disability without a formal diagnosis it's going to take a while.  Do I have any options here?? Can i be ""rewarded"" some sort of alimony or spousal support or something until I'm able to work?? We're living in different states at the moment so do I see a lawyer here or call somewhere from the last state we lived in?? How the f can I even afford a lawyer?!?! üòì please please please any tips or advice would be very welcome!!!  I'm ""living"" in ohio right now. I've been staying with family but i haven't done any formal address change. Hes currently living in North Carolina."	Yes
We had an argument over a pizza since I realized I forgot my wallet when we got to the restaurant. So we drive back home and I'm trying to de-escalate the situation. I accidentally spill his drink and bend over to place it upright, but while I'm bent over he picks me up, walks over to my car and throws me against the car door. He picks me up again, I'm scratching at his arms in an effort to get him to let go, he throws me on the street and kicks me in the leg. He then gets on his hands and knees over me and I'm biting and scratching to get him off. When that doesn't work scream for someone to call for help. When to cops get there they arrest us both because we both had injuries and they don't know who started the fight. The only witness was the neighbor who called the cops and told them they saw a male on top of a female. We're both being charged for class 4 misdemeanor domestic assault. I've never had any legal troubles in the past and I'm mainly just worried that he will try to spin the story to make me look bad. It's pretty much just my word against his, aside from our injuries. What is likely to happen in this situation?	Yes
I fall 2016, my cousin lost custody of her children due to drug and abuse charges. My parents chose to foster them, and they lived with us for 4 months. However, we had to let them go back into the system, as they were in danger from their mother. DSS wouldn't supervise visits, she would show up announced, high or drunk, stole from us, among many other things. We made the hard choice to let them go into the foster system to try and protect them from their mother. Out of spite, their mother refused to allow visitation or any contact between us and the children. However, since then, the mother has lost any and all parental rights. I want to know if there's any way I, as a family member and former caregiver, could gain rights for visitation. I want to maintain a relationship with them, so that hopefully, once I have the means, I could adopt them and get them out of the system. I have no contact with their mother or their biological grandparents. TL;DR- I want legal visitation with my cousins who I fostered, as their mother has lost all rights.  Would this be possible? What channels would I need to go through to receive legal visitation? Thank you!	Yes
multiple times she has been incommunicado, for weeks.  7 at one point until we had a family blow up and she finally responded to our attorney.  This filing in family court being delayed is putting a major strain on the relationship between my wife and her daughter.  Do I have any options for grievance/complaint to BAR assoc or anything..or because I'm not HER client I am out of luck?  All this could have been settled 2 months ago had she been responsive.  We've been dealing with delays since APRIL 1!	Yes
"Hello everyone, so my little brother (17 years old, clearly a minor) got ""arrested"" and charged with possession of drug paraphernalia. He was being an idiot with some friends from school late at night in his car and they were smoking when I guess someone who lived nearby reported my brothers car for suspicious activity. A cop showed up, found a bong (this is the ""drug paraphanelia"" he was charged for) in my brothers trunk and the other guys he was with were charged with actual possession of weed and other things as they had a few grams and joints/blunts on their person. My brother did not have any of that on him, and the bong in the trunk isn't even his, it belongs to one of the other boys but nobody admitted to who's it was when the cop asked, so the cop said if nobody admits to it then they will all be responsible. Additionally, my brother said the officer made it seem like since my brother was in the drivers seat (car was off and parked) and its his car, he would be automatically assumed to be the owner of said bong, so he just ended up saying it was his.   Now my parents dont know about this and my brother wants me to be the one to help him through this. I went to pick him up from the police station where the officer was pretty nice about it and explained that we will be getting a letter in the mail regarding a court date and that is when his charges will be decided I guess.   **Bold**WHAT I NEED HELP WITH IS: what can we say or do when his court date arrives to ensure that this will not stay with him on his record after he turns 18? Basically I want this to stay as a juvenile thing and not follow him as he realizes his mistake and knows to never allow himself into this situation again. Will this follow him throughout life? Will all future job/loan/college applications be affected by this? Should he plead guilty and just explain how sorry he is or try to fight it?  Thanks in advance for any/all advise, it is immensely appreciated!"	Yes
My ex just moved in with her boyfriend. I've heard that the alimony I'm paying may be 'renegotiated' in this situation.  Is this true, and if it is, what are my next steps. How long of her living there should I wait?	Yes
"My family recently held an intervention with my sister and her husband about emotional and verbal abuse to their children. We have since been barred from having access to the children in any form.  - Is it illegal for us to talk to the children in a public place, such as a swim meet or at church or other places? We live in a smaller community and see them all over without any intention of our own.   - Is it illegal for us drive down the street and say hello to the kids if they are outside playing?  - Do we have any legal precedent to gain access to the kids? Someone recently mentioned to me ""Grandparents rights"" but I'm unfamiliar with what that is.  Thanks a lot!"	Yes
"Throwaway obviously and I'm looking for advice on how to help my big brother. Both families involved are from GA but soon to be ex wife is currently in NC and brother was recently reassigned to GA.  He is a Marine, been in over a decade and in his early thirties. About eight years ago, he married a woman who already had two children from different men. The fathers were in jail/on drugs/out of the picture and brother eventually adopted them both. She was ""finding herself"" and he enabled her to be a stay at home mom and payed for her to take numerous classes, from real estate to nutrition and now to yoga certifications, but she has never been gainfully employed since they've been married. She also has a chronically ill (alcoholic, smoker, possible MS) mother who lives in GA, who she drives to ""check on"" weekly and buys groceries for (with his money).  She has decided the military life isn't for her and she doesn't love him anymore, and wants a divorce. He is expecting to have to pay $1k per child per month + their mortgage payment (~$1k) on the NC house, which leaves him no money to support himself. He doesn't want to get a lawyer but I feel like he is totally being taken advantage of and that those sums are crazy.  If you need more info to help, please let me know and I will provide it. It breaks my heart to see him lose everything."	Yes
I know for a fact that my child's birth parent smoke cannabis for a good amount of time and could possibly still be doing so.  Would it be bad to ask my attorney to ask their attorney for a drug test before paying child support?  I just don't want the money to feed their drug habit.  So far we are in an informal stage between attorney's and I was nervous during the meeting, so I didn't bring it up.  Also sorry for the vagueness, trying to stay semi-transparent.	Yes
"The matter is important, and only came to my attention a couple of hours ago. I made a promise not to tell anyone, but I do not feel it is a promise I can keep. I require advice of a legal nature, and I hope Reddit can help.  The individuals in this story will be thus: L, nine year-old boy. R, five year-old girl. They share a mother with different fathers. E, the mother. H, the mother's current boyfriend and father of R. C, who is E's ex-husband and L's father.  It was explained to me during dinner earlier that L and R were caught engaging in sexual activity together at the home belonging to parents of C. This activity included things, as explained to me, such as ""Kiss me down there with your tongue"" and ""Do what you want with me, baby"". Stories appear to differ as to whether they were unclothed, clothed, or partially clothed. After some questioning, it was revealed that they had been doing this for some time. Kissing each other regularly, with L sometimes sticking R's hand down his pants. He has apparently also tried once to put his mother's, E, hand down his pants as well. E says it is possible, though it is not sure, that he touched her in the middle of the night when she was laying in R's bed and when discovering it was E instead of R, inquired where R was. L was made to call E by his father and apologize for what he had done, while R sat in the back of the car with her head down and ears covered by her hands. Stories appear to differ between who was initiating with whom, with some indicating L and some indicating R.  This is not the first time this has happened. Some time ago, perhaps a year or two, L and R were caught playing ""boyfriend and girlfriend"" at the home of C's parents. As the story was told to me, they were naked and R was ""bouncing"" on L while he was laying on the bed. She made references to ""taking care of him"" after he ""came home from work"". I was disturbed then, but I was eventually convinced that it was a case of kids playing doctor and it wouldn't happen again. Apparently, it has been happening again a lot.  The general motivation of the other parties in this situation, and those few who are privy to it, seems to be trying to figure out the ""who"" and ""why"" of it. L seems to be getting accused the most, being as he is the older. My motivation, and this is why I feel I cannot keep my confidence as I promised, is that both children are potentially victims. At the very least, one child has behavioral issues that need to be addressed immediately and one child needs victim support, whoever may fit which role. I was never sexually abused, but I have lived a life plagued with depression, suicidal thoughts, and self-loathing due to years of emotional and physical abuse that were never treated. I know the damage that caused me. I know the scars I carry.  My immediate advice was that E should get both children to a child psychologist as soon as possible. I am well aware that acting out in this matter is often a sign that a child has been molested, or has been exposed to sexual displays which are inappropriate for their age. It is possible they are both victims of child molestation. E seemed inclined to debate me on this, citing on reasons for which I come here to seek advice. Her stance, as well as H's and C's, seems to be ""We'll talk to them and this won't happen again"". Aside from the fact that was the plan the first time, if they are being sexually abused by another person this does nothing to solve that issue. I don't want L and R, whom I love very dearly, to grow up damaged as I did. I don't want them to hate themselves the way I have. I cannot live with myself by remaining silent on this.  My questions, then, are as follows. I would appreciate any advice that can be given.  1) E currently lives with H. C lives with his current wife and their two teenaged children. C's parents live just up the road from him, and regularly babysit the children. My sister is scared that, once CPS becomes involved, her children will be removed from her custody. I informed her that CPS would only do so if they could demonstrate that her custody was dangerous to the children's well-being, which I do not think is the case for E nor H. Even if they were temporarily removed, I have no doubt whatsoever that she will be cleared. Also of concern is the presence of D, a three year-old boy, son of H and E. Assuming what I have explained here is true, and assuming H and E are guilty of no wrong-doing, how likely is it that the children will be removed from the custody of H and E?  2) Assuming that it is discovered that one of the children is identified as the initiator and no signs of abuse by other family/friends/etc is present. Would L or R face criminal charges? Would L be more likely to face charges, since he is the older of the two? If one is initiating, and the cause is solely some sort of behavioral problem, I do not want the party to face criminal charges. I understand such things are outside of my control. Therapy is obviously needed, but I also want to make sure I know of potential consequences before I act. I cite issues of underage teenagers sending nude pictures to each other and finding themselves charged with possessing/distributing child pornography. I want them to get help, I don't want their lives ruined. I know that sounds awful to say, and believe me when I say I feel awful, but I honestly don't know what to do here. I'm afraid acting for what I feel might be right may just cause an avalanche of wrongs.  3) Who should this be reported to? My goal is to convince E to take L and R to a child psychologist, as I feel that will make this process much easier for everyone involved than if I initiate it. If she refuses, then I will do so because I cannot stand idle while this goes on. The State Police? CPS? My primary concern is making sure the children get the help they so desperately, and obviously, need more than anything else. I don't want to pile trauma onto trauma.  4) Assuming I am the one to report this instead of E. Am I liable for civil suit? It may seem ridiculous to ask, and obviously such liability would not stop me from reporting this, but I am currently unemployed. I have no money, and currently live with my father who is on Social Security. Neither of us could afford an attorney. If this blows up and goes horribly badly, could fault be brought back to me? Are there steps I need to take to ensure myself and my father are protected after the children are seen to? What kind of attorney would handle such a matter? Suppose E reports it, could C and/or his family take civil action against her? It sounds stupid, but I see a lot of stupid posts on this forum about what people sue for or are sued for.  This post probably seems all over the place, and I certainly feel all over the place. When the situation was explained to me, I felt quite calm and withdrawn from the matter. But after I left dinner and came home, this awful fear and dread has just been building in me and I know it's going to eat me alive soon. While I'm here trying to figure out how to handle this, two kids are hurting and I love everyone involved. I want them to be protected, cared for, and taught how to heal. I want them to have the tools to be healthy that I didn't get. I can't live the rest of my life knowing I sat by while their scars got deeper and more numerous. The thought of anyone hurting them fills me with such rage, but I am trying to fighting down the emotional aspects for now. I want to act in the best of interest of L and R. How can I best do that? Thank you for any advice.  I hope none of you ever have to deal with anything like this."	Yes
I went to a drivers ed school and asked about the courses, which included classroom instruction along with behind the wheel instruction. At one point I ask the lady doing the paperwork if i needed a parent with a license, to which she said yes, saying i needed it for the permit and later on the provisional. When i told her my guardians dont have DLs she said it could be a relative. So i asked if it could be an aunt, she said yes, but she would need guardianship of me. So is she right, or what are my options?	Yes
I got married really young and now I want to get a divorce. Ex says he doesn't want to get a divorce lawyer and wants to kinda just get papers and sign off because he's in a hurry to join the army and not allow me benefits (which I'm not fighting for). We have a house under both our names and he kicked me out a year ago and I've jumped around living here and there since.  We live in Indiana and I don't know what to do. I want to sign off on the papers because I don't want to have connection anymore to him. Even though I'm not fighting for much anymore I don't know if a divorce lawyer is still something I should do. I've never dealt with this stuff before.	Yes
I am the biological father of a 16 y/o female. She has been living with me for over a year now since her mom died.  Her mother and I were never married.  Her mother did not complete a will. There is also a 24 year old brother.  I would like to establish guardianship so we can sell her mothers house. Can I do this without a lawyer? I'm her dad, always have been, do I need papers?	Yes
27, male, married for 11 months here. No kids or assets besides the house, bought in my name before marriage with all of my own money. Unofficially separated at 6 months. (Have a letter she wrote agreeing to leave if I asked her. I did, she changed her mind.) I make around 90k/year. Wife's name is not anywhere on the papers. She does not work and has never held a steady job. I filed for a no contest divorce, as we have no assets or children together. She was served two weeks ago. She says she is going to respond that she does not agree and wants to attempt to pursue a fault case on the grounds of adultery. She says she is going to go after the house and half of what I earn. Right now we live in the same house, although half the time I live with parents because I do not want to be around her. My lawyer has told me that I cannot kick her out of the house, but I also cannot afford both the house's mortgage and a new apartment for me to live in. She pays nothing toward the bills and is living in the house full time, as she has done throughout the whole marriage. She is able bodied but just refuses to work because she feels she doesn't have to. Is there anything I can do? How do I get her out? If  judge finds me at fault, is she entitled to the house and half of everything I own?	Yes
My sister has been bouncing around from place to place for the last eight years. She had my nephew five years ago when she was living in a very rural part of North Carolina, and spent some time in various communes or squats elsewhere in the US.  For a good amount of that time, she was with this guy ‚ÄúDavid.‚Äù David is not my nephew‚Äôs biological father but he‚Äôs as good as. My sister and David also have a 4-month-old daughter together. She was born in Washington and also doesn‚Äôt have a birth certificate.  For medical reasons, my sister decided to return to civilization. She, David, and the two kids have been living with me while they sort things out.  But I/we honestly have no idea how to legalize the kids‚Äô existence. I‚Äôve been talking to David and my sister about it, but it‚Äôs overwhelming and there‚Äôs no money for a lawyer or anything.  There's basically no record of either kid. No schools, hospital visits, etc. The only thing is a recent emergency room visit for the 5-year-old (which is what prompted the return to civilization in the first place).  My sister was born here in Massachusetts, but there‚Äôs no record of her residency at the approximant time of either kid‚Äôs birth. David is legally allowed to be in the US but he‚Äôs not actually a citizen. Again, there‚Äôs no record of his residency at the time of either kid's birth.  David and my sister aren‚Äôt married though they‚Äôre open to a city hall wedding if it makes the paperwork/immigration easier. David has also said he wants to put his name on the 5-year-old‚Äôs birth certificate as well, and I‚Äôm not sure if that makes things easier.  The goal is to get both kids birth certificates, get the 5-year-old in school for this fall, get medical insurance/care for both kids, and eventually get them passports so they can meet David's family.  We‚Äôre anticipating a lot of legwork on this but we don‚Äôt even know where to start.	Yes
"First time asking for legal advice, so forgive me if this is maybe the wrong place?  Firstly im 24, living in Michigan. I was adopted privately when I was 2, after being removed from my birth mother's home for child endangerment.   Now, my adopted parents and I are estranged. My birth mom is actually deceased, she died in 06' and I have no idea who my birth father is as my parents have denied me access to my adoption file. My birth father also walked away when my birth mom got pregnant.   I'm wondering if its possible to legally unadopt myself? I identity with my birth name, my birth family  (who I found and am in contact with). I'm currently married so this wouldn't even effect my current last name, only what my legal ""maiden"" name is. Personally I want to be as completely removed from my adopted ""family"" as you can be. My adopted brother basically gives no fucks about his parents and I know for a fact I will be saddled with any sort of care for them, funeral costs etc if something happens. They are not my parents and I want to be untangled with them.  Is there any way to do this?"	Yes
So i have a few questions, can jeugdzorg really do this (inspect/searchwithout a warrant? Or are the parents-in-question lying to save face? I was just wondering. Even if their apartment was very dirty, isn't that justified by the joy/stress of having a baby?  Thank you	Yes
I'm a 17 year old who is home schooled by my mom in Missouri for most of the time. I get to see my dad every 6 weeks, sometimes here in Missouri and sometimes at his home in Florida. We both want to spend a lot more time together. Do I have the right to spend more time with my dad than my mom wants me to?	Yes
Seven years ago my sister [f30] pleaded guilty to a count of manslaughter of her then abusive boyfriend and received a sentence of 5 years. In her absence, my grandmother took custody of her three children, the two youngest (males, now ages 8 &amp;10) were the children of the deceased, and therefore received minors death benefits. My sister was released April 2016 and as of December 2016 my grandmother essentially kicked out the children and placed them back into their mothers care, despite her living with a guardian and only having one bedroom between the four of them. Being a convicted felon, she hasn't been able to get a job (and therefore her own place) and legally doesn't have custody of her children, and yet is responsible for all care for her children while her grandmother receives the money for the two and doesn't help out at all from food, clothing, transportation, etc. Btw we are in NC.   What options we have?	Yes
I'm a guy and will be getting married later this year. As I understand it, here in California, it's $435 to file a change of name petition. My fianc√©e will also be changing her name, to take me (new) surname. I *believe* the $435 covers a family, assuming the changes are done at the same time. If so, makes sense for us to change them together. Can anyone verify?	Yes
My family recently moved my Grandfather into assisted living after his Dementia got worse. My sister is his POA, and I want to buy his car. How do I do this legally so that family members do not make a stink about it down the road? I would like to sell my current car and put the money towards my Grandfathers estate in exchange for his car.	Yes
"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."	Yes
Question. Me and my ex got divorce about 7 years ago. In the MSA, she got the house.  The title/ deed and mortgage are still both still in my name. She wants me just sign the deed over so she can refinance, but I don't trust just signing over the deed without her promising to payoff the existing mortgage and releasing me from liability to the house and mortgage.  Do I need any other paperwork or is the MSA and deed transfer enough?	No
"**Yes, I know you're about to tell me to just hire a lawyer.**  My husband and I are expecting our first baby and we're working to get our finances and directives in order.  We have a relatively simple situation, the only ""big"" things being that we own a condo and we will soon have a dependent.  Given our situation, we feel pretty comfortable doing (and have been recommended by multiple sources to do) our documents DIY with an online service.  That being said, it's easy to find plenty of reviews saying ""it was easy and fast to use and the customer service was great!"" but I feel like the true test is in the actual execution of these documents.  You don't know if it was done right until it actually needs to be used.    So, has anybody out there executed a will and/or POA from an online service? Was it just fine or was it a disaster? We are particularly looking at LegalZoom and Willing. LegalZoom seems pretty solid but Willing is much newer so I'm curious to hear your anecdotes! Thank you!"	No
Is there anything against selling an appliance or device that has roaches? A friend of mine bought a ps4 on Facebook group and it stopped working the next day and found out it was full of roaches. Previous Owner blocked us.	No
"I have been in between apartments for 5 days. I'm staying with my mom in another town and everything I own is in storage units. My roommates and I were set to move in tomorrow so we can get settled and back to work. Today, halfway through the day, we learn there is a flea infestation that will take at least a couple weeks to clean. They are offering to let us stay in another of their units in town but they will not adjust the rent to what we had agreed to pay for the original apartment. It was very difficult to find a good location that was within our budget in this town so there aren't many other options and they won't help us pay to move an additional time. They are offering to ""let"" us break the lease and walk away but it feels like that is giving up all my rights when we agreed to this lease back in March. Am I just out of luck here or do they owe us something more?  I'm willing to provide any more details needed but I'm desperate for any advice at all. Thanks in advance all."	No
"I apologize in advance for totally butchering this but I really don't know the lingo.  February 2016 I was in a car accident (we were rear-ended). I opted to get checked out when EMS came by, they drove me to a nearby hospital, no big deal just some prescribed painkillers for the neck/back pain and headache.  Turns out the car that hit us was a professional driving service, currently on the job driving a couple to some event. It also turned out that the father of the driver of the car I was in was a lawyer. He drove to meet us at the hospital.  He offers to represent us and sue the company. I say that sounds alright, so I signed something saying he would be representing me in that civil suit, and he would only charge a percent of whatever the outcome is. He starts badgering me over the next 2-3 months or so to get physical therapy and send him the bills. I know he's just looking to blow up the damages he's seeking in the suit, but I'm feeling okay enough and I really didn't have insurance or the money to drop on the therapy when I didn't know what would happen with the suit.  So debt collecting agencies start calling me from both the EMS that drove me to the hospital and the hospital charging me for the check up. This goes on for a few months before I say ""I have a lawyer working on this case seeking damages from the company that rear-ended us"" and they just ask for his info and that's it. Haven't heard from the agencies since January 2017.  So back to my lawyer, he's totally MIA. I have not heard a word from him about the case. Is it normal for this to take almost a year and a half? I signed a contract with the guy, but I don't have a copy. Is there any way I can demand something out of this? I really need some updates especially since I don't know what's up with the debt collectors and when they'll be back. Also, is it possible that it's just too late now to pursue a civil suit? The accident was in February 2016.  For more context, the accident happened in the Bethesda, Maryland area. I'm a college student in DC, but my permanent residence is in Florida. I gave the hospital and EMS my DC address, so that's where I've been receiving the letters from them but I'm moving next month. Also, I haven't checked my credit reports, but I use CapitalOne's CreditWise credit tracker and the debts haven't been reported, is this normal too?  TL;DR I signed a contract with a lawyer to pursue a case against a professional driving services company for rear-ending me. I haven't heard from the lawyer in months. Debt collectors hounded me until I told them I had a lawyer working on pursuing damages from the company. I want this case to move forward. What should I do?"	No
My father was a probate/tax attorney in CT who passed away in April of 2015.  For the last 10 years or so of his life, he had a small handful of long-term clients.  All those clients have copies (or the originals as applies) of all their documents, and I posses all my dad's paperwork and computer files.  I am wondering how long is standard to hold on to these files?  All of his clients are aware of his passing, and have made arrangements with other attorneys to take over their matters as appropriate.  Immediately following his passing in 2015 they were given copies of everything they needed.  I'm just wondering if there are any legal standards to how long I must hold on to these files.   Thank you.	No
"I am a young girl and I was pulled over today after taking a picture at a red light. After the light turned green I no longer had any contact with my phone. I was soon greeted with blue lights and quickly pulled over. The first thing the police officer said to me was ""I saw you texting on your pink phone"" which was weird considering my phone is not at all pink. I told him I took a picture at the red light and he took my license. He came back after a while and said ""Now we are going to have some fun."" I didn't know what to say so I sat there and he said ""take out your phone and take a picture of my car and post it for everyone to see"" I obliged and he then said, ""Good, now everyone should make fun of you for it."" Then proceeded to hand me my citation where I could see that he wrote as a note that ""driver had both hands on phone typing while head was down looking at screen while vehicle was in motion."" Now this is a complete lie because all I did was take a picture at a red light. What are my options and how do I get out this expensive ticket considering I'm a broke college student!"	No
"I found a place I could live in on the 25th of Jul.  I gave a deposit of one month's rent (+$5) for landlady to give me right of first refusal, returnable if I don't get the place.  Due to several delays on her part I am unable to move in until 9 Aug.  On 9 Aug I pay her first and last month's rent in addition to security already paid.  She gives me keys.  She requests I move in at night so the neighbors don't see.  This morning she tells me it's not going to work out and I need to get the things I have in there out and give her back the keys and she will give me back all of my money.  This evening I emptied my stuff from the apartment and hand her keys as she hands me cash.  As I am counting it out she says ""Oh your security deposit is in escrow and I will get it for you on Monday.""  I had her sign an IOU for the month's rent, plus money I spent on cleaning the carpet.  If she does not come up with the cash on Monday what should my next steps be?"	No
I'm renting a room in a house in CA. I came to house today after midnight and found toilet flushing switch broken. Now I share bathroom with 50 year old man and house owner is pretty close to him (I'm only 18). What can I do? Will the owner make me pay for it? 	No
"Ok, so I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I recently found out that an ex of mine had called the police on me multiple times during our relationship and after it. He had claimed I was stalking him. I don't know how he convinced the police not to speak to me, or maybe he gave them my incorrect information, who knows.. But I never spoke to an officer. I only found out, well, I found out the first bit one day when I looked at his phone and saw him repeat dialing this number. When I called it, it was a sargents number. I woke him up and confronted him about it. That's when I found out he had called the police on me for accidentally breaking his window. He never set his buzzer up on his apartment, and when I'd come over, since he didn't want me to yell, I'd have to throw something at his window to get his attention to let him know I was there. One time it cracked the very edge of the glass, a tiny hairline fracture. (If I were intentionally breaking his window, I'd probably throw a brick through it, not my set of keys like I always did). Mind you, when he called the police he was texting wiith me saying he wanted to move in with me, etc... And he had called the woman he was cheating on me with.. right before calling the police (lol). Anyway, much later, I come to find out he called and made stalking claims against me when I'd be somehwere he was and I'd almost bust him cheating.. He'd then like.. stop communicating with the police about it, so it would never go anywhere. Anyway, I have printed off the proof that he's full of crap, he told me to do everything he subsquently called the police on me for, and that while telling the police I was ""stalking him and harasassing him"".. he was actually stalking and harassing me because I didn't want to be with him and he wouldn't stop bothering me. I mean, he messaged me on valentines day and I didn't read it for two weeks.. And I find out, recently, in that two weeks in took me to respond he was on here posting about how he ""just wants to be left alone"" and how I ""won't stop stalking him"".. He got meaner and meaner the further time went on and I didn't answer. Crazy ass behavior. Anyway.. is there a law against this? There freaking has to be?"	No
"Hi there, First time posting here and I'm hoping that it's helpful to my understanding of the system and what the circumstances mean. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible.  Location: CT and NY -CT is where the crime is taking place, NY is where the person responsible lives. Summary: An independent contractor, working for our company in the service industry, has been and continues to plan and execute the theft of at least $25,000. That amount is what we know of so far but it keeps getting larger. He's accepting and reporting (on weekly reports) that money is coming in (to make us think it's being collected and placed into the right account). In reality, he's having clients make out checks to him personally and depositing them into his own bank account. He's also accepting cash from clients for things that aren't being reported and further, he has clients paying for services without reporting that they exist. Again, in total that theft amounts at least $25,000.  The real question: Okay so we spoke to some police officers in CT and they said that once the warrant is out (which will take 4-6 week) they will contact the police in NY and see if they will also issue a warrant. Now, let's say there is a warrant out in CT and NY BUT they also said that they won't actually go and bring him into custody...Huh? There's an unbelievable amount of evidence we've compiled that should be more than enough to go out and bring this person in but what it seems that we're being told is ""he's basically free to be until he makes a mistake."" How can this be correct? I understand that some CT police don't want to go all the way to NY to arrest this person but, what if he's in the state? What if he happens to be in the same town? Will they take a call that says ""Here he is?"" The answer seems to be no, and my mind also seems to be blown that a criminal isn't being brought it and put through our legal system. I don't even know what the charges would be but maybe - grand larceny, fraud, damage to a business, forgery, like what would it take to mobilize and bring this person to justice? Are we just stuck with a warrant waiting for him to get pulled over for running a stop sign? There has to be an easier, more efficient, and just way to have him answer for his transgressions. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"	No
I went to Wisconsin in June for the only vacation I could afford in years. On my way back I was passing someone when they decided to speed up so I couldn't, I was running out of room so I too sped up and finished my pass then let off the gas. I came over the hill slowing down and about a quarter mile up the road I saw a state trooper. He claims I was doing 23 over, I wasn't, I was issued a 225 dollar ticket that I can literally not afford to pay. Nor can I afford the increase in my insurance if I pay the ticket admitting guilty. I read on multiple sources that all that will happen is I can't go back to Wisconsin since they will put a warrant out for my unpaid fine. What do I do?	No
"Hello! I live in Ontario, Canada. I'm a student and I work at a restaurant part of Sir Corp as a part time employee. I came into my shift a few days ago and got fired for not ""fitting the brand"". Asked them to elaborate and he didn't give me much detail. This is my first time getting fired from a job, it was during my probationary period that was soon to be over. Is this even legal? I never got any warning, they never put it into warning. I was a good employee and I did my job right. Also, I'm not trying to sound rude but there are a lot of people I work with that don't exactly ""fit the brand"" but they didn't get fired. I feel like I could've gotten more of a reason as that just wasn't enough for me. He said I didn't do anything specific that triggered it and they don't see me as a good fit.   I had a shift review a week prior and I was told I need more personality (I found it kind of rude of them to put it like that), I was ready to apply the feedback but they called off my next 3 shifts. I finally got to come in for a shift and they just threw that on me. I needed the money for my rent and saving for school and now that I have no income I don't know what to do or where to begin. I received no warning, no write ups or anything. They have fired people for ""not fitting the brand"" before and it doesn't seem right to me.  Is there anything I can do? I'm planning on applying for EI soon but this just doesn't feel right."	No
I am having a hell of a time trying to find out if this is legal or not.   Does anyone know if a doctors lawyer/legal advisor is allowed to be present in the exam room with the patient, while the doctor and patient discuss the patients medical information/diagnosis, without the patient being aware of or introduced to the lawyer? In California.  In what situation would a doctor do this?   To me it screams guilt/liability but this isn't exactly something that happens frequently so I am unsure. Especially when the patient is unaware of any serious medical issue that the doctor might be liable for.	No
So I signed up for a property online where I gave me esignature. I went through a housing agreement, and signed it. Now I'm in a position where I have provided no bank information, but the place still expects me to pay $1000 even though I never moved into the property.  Like I said, never paid a deposit, never moved to the property, is there a way out of this?	No
As the title says, just bought a split level house in PA two months ago and the basement has a severe leak.  When we bought the house the sellers said they had seen no evidence of flooding or experienced anything of that sort. We did have an inspection done and there were stains in the unfinished portion and a small puddle in one corner. The inspector told them to seal by the driveway to resolve this issue and that was it, which they did. The other portion of the basement was recently finished and had brand new carpet etc done. It was a bit musty, but the inspector did not seem to find that concerning, noting the lack of airflow since the AC was off.    Fast forward to now.   We have not used the lower level till recently, the only thing we had downstairs was our laundry. We recently moved furniture down there and started to use it as a living space.  We start to notice a dampness on the floors and bought gutter extenders, cleared the gutters, thinking that was the problem. The next day we had a heavy rain and the carpet was SOAKED. Water was coming over out feet when we walked on the carpet.  Ended up having to toss three bookshelves and had minor water damage to other pieces of furniture. Carpet and padding was not able to be salvaged and when the carpet was pulled up there was mold growing on the tact boards.  Those got removed as well. Two days later it rained again and we could see how bad the flow of water was coming down. I took video and pictures and there were pools of water everywhere, including by a door frame that has water damage.   The unfinished portion is leaking even worse than before and coming in from another area as well.   My question is do we have a case against the seller for nondisclosure? They do not want to cooperate and the next step is litigation.  They say that since the inspector saw water in the corner of the unfinished part, and we did not ask for repairs,  we have no claim to stand on. They also state they had no knowledge and blame the recent storms for these issues.	No
"Friendly old-guy neighbor learned I was planning on moving, and approached me offering to sell my home for 3% of the sale price. He wants me to put a ""for sale by owner"" sign in front of the property with **his** phone number on it, and says he knows cash buyers eager to move into the neighborhood. He says he has provided this service for other sellers in my neighborhood, though he is not licensed to practice real estate.  On the one hand, this seems super-shady and makes me more than a little uneasy. On the other, I'd be happy to quickly find a qualified buyer, and wouldn't mind paying my neighbor to bring me someone from his social network.  What kind of headaches am I setting myself up for here? What kind of headaches might he be setting himself up for?"	No
"I need help. Throughout the month of July, I found it pretty difficult to breathe in my apartment. I thought maybe it was due to my nose surgery about a year ago (after stupid accident). I found it odd that I hadn't had any nose complications until then, but I figured a bone had suddenly moved or something.   A week ago, I woke up and it was surprisingly easy to breathe. It was great. There was some construction going on outside my apartment, but I thought nothing of it. A few hours later and they were still working. I wondered how long it would be - a day long project or weeks? So I called my landlord and asked what they were doing. He just said they were ""fixing something with the gas"". He was also surprised to hear that I was already back from visiting my parents.   This whole week I've been able to breathe normally. Maybe I'm reading too much into this, but do you think the gas issue had anything to do with my difficulty breathing? I don't have knowledge about different kinds of residential gases that can affect breathing. The only one I can think of is carbon monoxide and if that was the issue, wouldn't my landlord have had to evacuate everyone? Are there any other types of gasses or lack thereof that would have caused my landlord to have to dig through the concrete to replace some of the gas lines? My apartment is right above the area where they were fixing things. I'm on the second floor and my apartment is basically an overhang above the concrete walkway. So if there was a leak or something I guess it could affect me more than others? Possibly? Idk.   For two days after construction, I had headaches - the same pounding headaches I get when the air pressure changes (like on a plane). I could finally breathe, but I had headaches. Now, a week after the gas line replacement I feel great.   Could this all be just pure coincidence? Any advice would be appreciated.    Also, do I have the right to know exactly what the issue was? My landlord seemed vague when I asked. Is he required to tell me? Location is the state of New York."	No
We have been trying to close on this house for a while with aVA loan. We were at the closing date, but he didn't realize that he agreed to pay closing costs. What is my recourse here, he won't sign unless we give up another 1000 dollars.	No
My mom has been figured from her 20 year job because they say she no called no-showed.  For the last 3 years the company has been under new management.  It's been said amongst coworkers that there has been firing among anyone not young, fresh and modern to represents the companies new image. Out of everyone that worked there before management took over, now only a handful remain. Seasoned in their fields, they are all scared.  Should she seek a lawyer? Can they reject her of anything she has earned, such as Retirement, 401, etc? We're worried all of her commitments will be degraded.  By bullying I mean she has been harassed with text messages, people demanding her to come in on days she has scheduled PTO. Demanding her not to enjoy her days off and cover shifts.. just all around pressuring her to feel stressed and she feels bullied. Please advice   The company is a healthcare facility in NV. Please and thank you for sharing anything we should be aware of moving forward.	No
I've tried to supply all the infomation that I can (so it's long) - questions at the bottom. Thanks!  Obviously, talking with a VA lawyer is on the table, but I'd also like to wrap my head around things.   Backstory: - Current GF bought a house back in 2004, VA - Lived there for years with her sister.  - Decided to go to Med School, Sister got married and moved - Rented the House out to a friend of a friend - No property management - Everything was fine, until recently - We are all going to sit down and talk about a plan of action this weekend. I've been reading VA laws to try and get a handle on options.    Downside(s): - GF is in residency in OH (3rd year) and hasn't had time to visit VA for a little over a year. Being in VA will be next to impossible until July 2018, but could be around xmas if they give residents time off. There may be options to trade days with other residents and get a weekend off - Lease is up in January; very simple cookie cutter lease (just pretend a lease doesn't exist outside of ending in Jan) - No security deposit made, no last month's rent   Recent Events (last year or so) - Tenant has been systematically later and later on rent and will pay portions.  - In June, Tenant was behind a month and send 3 checks. June and July's rent were post-dated until the 10th of the month (when rent is due on the 1st). 3rd check was a partial payment for the behind amount (about 80%) - My GF has always been lenient, so there are no late fees in the lease and no warnings outside of text messages - GF's sister was driving through VA to visit in Ohio and stopped to do a walk through of the property - Apparently, the place is a wreck. Garbage everywhere, doors off of hinges (or broken), un-kept yard, smoke detectors hanging from the ceiling, mold from soap scum growing in the bathtub, etc.  - A strong odor of weed in the basement - tenant admitted to her co-tenant smoking weed inside   According to the sister, the place is absolutely trashed and will require a couple of thousand dollars to make the necessary repairs. She apparently took pictures, but I haven't seen them yet. Sister believes tenant should be evicted, repairs made, and a new tenant found. Brother in law claims to have had property in VA and mentioned it taking a very long time (8 months or so) for the eviction to happen. He was awarded a large sum to cover damages, but never actually got any of the money. I'd like to avoid that here.     Eviction: - LL must provide a notice, depending on 1) not paying rent (giving 5 days to fix) or 2) Violating the lease (30 days notice, but 21 days to correct the issue) or 3) Criminal Activity (no notice needed, straight to filing a complaint with the court) - If tenant doesn't fix the problem in the time frame, we file a complaint with the appropriate court in VA - Have a hearing where the judge hears both sides and decides (or potentially pushes back to another date for a fuller trial)? - Tenant can supply a defense   **Questions** - Since my GF is super busy, can I represent her in court or for any of the proceedings?  - There are some obligations that the LL has to maintain the property, but it looks like VA law requires the tenant to provide notice. 21 days for the LL to fix or the Tenant can break the lease. Since the Tenant hasn't mentioned any necessary repairs (not in writing, text, or voice), can she still use this as a defense?  - If there is no real lease, is essentially trashing the place enough to count as violating the lease? - Does the LL have a good chance at winning small claims for any damages caused by the the tenant?  - If we follow the rules, how long should we expect an eviction to take place? (Let's say tenant gets a notice to fix or quit on the 15th and does nothing. We could file a complaint in court on 8/15? If we're blessed enough to get a trial soon after (9/1) and the judge rules in favor of the LL - when would the tenant have to be out? Another 30 days?   Is there anything else I should consider?  We're mainly trying to avoid periods of time when my GF has to pay both her current rent AND the mortgage on the house. Any time that the house is unusable and no one is paying rent, it's going to be a huge strain.	No
"I live in an apartment and the house it's in is being sold.  I'm looking for a new place to live but until then, there are going to be some open house showings and I can't be here for all of them.  I have Nest cameras in my apartment already.  My intent is to have them running 24/7 when I can not be here and have a posted notice at the entrance that says ""Premises are subject to video and audio recording.""  Or something along those lines.  MA is a two party consent state for audio recordings.  So my notice will serve to inform anyone who enters.  Any issues I might run into?"	No
My family is part of a 'tennants in common' summer house. It was first owned by my mother's aunt who passed away and gave it equally to her family. There are seven 'shares' and for those that don't know, tennants in common mean that each of us own it 100% equally.  The shares were first divided as:   My mom (M) =1.5 shares  Sister 1 (S1) = 1.5 shares  Sister (S2) = 1 share   Aunt1 (A1)= 1 share  Aunt2 (A2) (has 2 shares after her brother died)  1. Aunt2 is also the 'head' leader with everything in her name because she was the closest to the house, had the time and energy to run the bills and we all paid the bills to her and she was so brilliant with everything running smoothly.  2. Aunt2 has developed Alzheimers and is now being taken care of by Aunt1. Legally, everything has been turned over to Aunt1 since she is the primary caretaker.  3. Aunt1 is going through legal troubles (a foundation company accidentally did something to her basement and caused her house to collapse, so she's in that legal battle that may not be over for a couple years and she is literally living off of Aunt2's money (who was always very good at managing her money and has quite a nice amount).  4. She also recently divorced JUST before her house collapse and was old fashioned and never had to work before, so now that she's in her 60s she isn't exactly able too. So she doesn't really know how to get money except from sueing everyone. she's stressed out from taking care of Aunt2 full time, and has finally reached a breaking point that she no longer wants part of this precious house that we all own. So she has decided to sell it/ make us buy her out or-else.  5. Because Aunt1  is legally in charge of Aunt2, that also means she technically has 3 shares. So she's trying to make us buy out all three shares even though the rest of us desperately want to keep this. It's been in our family for almost a century. Aunt2 is unfortunately so far gone that she cannot understand what is going on and can't stop her.  We have been battling this issue since last summer and we are truly worried we might actually lose this house, despite four shares  wanting to 100% keep it. My twin and I were both proposed to there, my big sister was married there, and we've had so much life lived there that we all want to do anythig to keep it, we can't afford the $50k x 3, for those shares.  Any help at all, any guidance, anything you wonderful people could offer as help would be so so SO great.	No
My roommate took a trip to California last month, leaving his cats and all his things for me to take care of. We didn't sign a lease, I just moved him in. He hasn't paid for this month or next.  What steps do I have to take to get his things out of my house and out of my life?  Thanks in advance!	No
"Okay so, I didn't have a written/signed lease with my land lord as well I did not have to pay a security deposit. I paid rent every month for six months to live in a room that had the washer and dryer in it that everyone in the house used and I broke the sliding door to the closet that they were in. At the end of May/early June I was evicted from the house without being given a written notice from the Land lord( it was a "" you have 48 hours to get you things out of the house or I'm throwing them out."") I currently haven't lived there for over a month and they are wanting me to pay for the door repairs. I'll pay for the damages if I have to but legally do I have to? This was in Colorado but now I'm Kansas."	No
"I let a girl I've been friends with for years and her yoing kid move in a couple months ago until she could find a place. She agreed she would help with rent and keep the place picked up. Flash forward and its been a couple months and i haven't seen a dime. She claimed she had a job when she moved in but that was a lie and she still doesnt have one. I'm top of that she is constantly trashing my place. I will clean before I go to work and by the time i come home there will be trash and clothes all over.  I asked her to leave last week and she called the cops saying I was ""screaming at her"" which even the cops didnt belive. She even threatened to get a child order of protection against me so that I woukd get kicked out of my own place which I found out is how her own parents got her out of their home when she pulled the same crap on them.  As it stands i dont know what my best option is. If I try to evict her my.landlord is going to find out that I violated my lease. If I simply end my lease and she refuses to leave then according to my lease I may be on hook for those legal bills.   Just trying to get out of this the lest damaging way possible. My thanks for trying to help a yoing mother and her child I guess."	No
"I recently moved out of a house where I lived with the landlord. My other roommate moved out on the same day. The landlord looked over her room, said all was good, and paid her the security deposit in cash.  I had to wait for my landlord to take a phone call before she was able to check me out, which was fine because I wanted to do some last minute spot cleaning (wasn't necessary, but I like to leave things nice). After reviewing my room, she said that everything looked great and asked me for my Paypal information. She said she didn't have anymore cash and asked if Paypal was fine. I agreed.  I asked her if we could go ahead and make the transfer that night so I didn't have to worry about it and she followed up with a strong ""No."" and said she would be waiting for 30-90 days to refund my security deposit. I asked why she was doing that after just paying my other roommate in cash.  Her response was that her Ex's lawyer had contacted her lawyer to inform them that a ""friend of mine"" had contacted them and offered to stand as a witness against her character and also that I engaged in illegal activities in the home making it unsafe for their child to visit.  She currently has supervised visitation of the child and is fighting a kidnapping case (charged with kidnapping her own child). I was completely taken back because besides hearing her vent about the custody battle, I know very little details about the case and did not know she had a pending felony when I moved in.  She told me that she was holding onto my deposit for the maximum legally allowed time to deter me from testifying against her in her custody battle. A friend of mine that was helping clean the house was in the room when she said this, as well as the locksmith she hired to change the locks as we were checking out (I got his information after this happened).  This seems really really crazy to me and I'm not sure what to do. I never got involved in this case, never even thought about getting involved, and don't want to spend any more time dealing with this person, I just want my deposit back. I don't know who the person is that they have to testify that I make the house unfit for visitation, or if that is even a real possibility.  In Texas, the only laws I can see about deposit refunding is that the landlord has 30 days to return it.  What should I do? Just wait out the 30 days and hope it gets refunded?  Thank you for taking the time to read!"	No
About 6 months ago, my boss got allowed the request of one of my coworkers to get a cat for the office. I protested and said my wife may be allergic but he/she said that they had always wanted a cat and it was going to happen. It did.   Come to find out, my wife is severely allergic and can tell if the cat has been near me at work. Coincidentally enough, for the first time in my life, I have had allergies that have really hurt my health as I have preexisting conditions that affect what medicine I can take. I am considering getting a allergy test and if the results are positive for cats, then show it to the boss with a request we no have a cat.  What can I do? Should I just say I will only work from home.	No
Upstate NY, Exact Town or county unknown as of this time but most likely within the 518 area code.  Basically as the title states.  I'm currently shopping for a home, and as a single person, I would like to potentially rent out the spare bedroom firstly because I prefer not to live alone, and secondly to recoup some of the costs of owning a home.  I would like to rent to a single person, or a childless couple, which is what leads me to this question.  To be frank, I won't have children living in my house.  I myself am permanently childfree, and I do not want to end up having to childproof my home, or be asked to babysit.  I know that as a landlord, this would be discrimination, but as I am using this property as my primary residence, would the same rules/laws apply?  I have tried to find information via Google but it seems like a lot of sources I find contradict each other.	No
A friend and I are renting a two bedroom condo in Atlanta, GA from the unit's owner. He has asked for an in-person meeting tonight and won't tell us why over the phone. This and some external factors has led us to believe that he would like to sell the condo, and break the lease with us (with the in-person meeting serving as an opportunity to deliver written notice to vacate).  I went to the lease to see what it says and the relevant sections reads as follows: &gt;**Early Termination by Landlord** Tenant agrees that Landlord may terminate the lease prior to the lease expiration date and Tenant agrees to vacate the property if the following conditions are met: &gt;**A:** Landlord gives Tenant sixty (60) days written notice to vacate (Tenant still owes rent through the sixty (60) day notice period). &gt;**B:** Landlord pays to Tenant an amount of $_______ as compensation for disturbing tenant's quiet enjoyment of the property and for the inconvenience of moving early. This credit will be applied to the Tenane account at the time the Tenant vacates the property and will be included with any applicable security deposit refund. The foregoing shall not relieve the Tenant of his or her responsibilities and obligations regarding any damage to the property.  Obviously, the unfilled blank in B is a huge problem. Do we have negotiating room to now agree on fair compensation or does that blank default to $0? If we can negotiate, what amount of compensation would be reasonable/typical/possible?	No
"I'm renting a 2 bedroom in LA and got a new roommate, who signed a lease and got approved by the management company. 6 months later she said she was going away for a month and gave her keys to ""a friend"" who may stay a few nights. A month later, she never returned. She told me via Facebook messenger that she'd be back in a few weeks for a while, then said this friend wanted to sign on to the lease. I told my roommate I wasn't comfortable with her friend doing that. About a week before the end of my roommate's lease, I told her ""friend"" that she had to leave, since I needed a new roommate and she wouldn't let anyone see her room. I asked for the keys and she assaulted me, throwing me on the ground and then calling the police saying I'd attacked her. The police came and threatened to arrest both of us, I cleared out and got a restraining order. Despite this, I couldn't get her out of the apartment and I no longer feel safe there. As of July 1, my roommate no longer is on the lease, but the squatter won't leave. My actual roommate and I have told her many times to go, the police came by 4 other times and even threatened to arrest her, and the management company has served her a 3 days notice. She's still there and it's become clear to me that she squats habitually-- she knows the laws too well.  Questions-- 1. What can I do to get rent and damages from the roommate who let her in? What kind of lawyer would handle this? 2. The management knew about the squatter and hasn't acted. Is there anything I can get them to do? 3. Are there any other options besides the management evicting me and my roommate (the people on the lease) to get her out?"	No
"My employer is cracking down on bathroom breaks and is starting to insist we only use the bathroom during scheduled breaks and lunches, unless we request a job accommodation via the Americans with Disabilities Act. ""No exceptions."" The company, or at least this branch of it, has been making some shady policy changes recently that rides a grey area where ethics and legality aren't clear. So this isn't just about me, but an entire work force as well.  -  Illinois has no laws requiring employers to provide breaks other than meal periods. I believe OSHA has some requirements for bathroom breaks but I haven't found clear wording on that, or whether it differentiates bathroom breaks from rest breaks. I don't think it would. The company gives us two 15 minute breaks during an 8 hour shift and a one hour meal period.  -  This is a desk job where we spend all day talking on the phone.   -  I have been told that I go to the bathroom too often and I either need to hold it or get a job accommodation through ADA, which if approved would mean clocking out to take bathroom breaks when they aren't scheduled. Other people are getting the same talk, some of whom have medical conditions that make them have to go more frequently (UTI, diabetes, Crohn's, etc.). Some have suffered medical issues from holding it. I will withhold my personal situation.  - My questions, and questions on behalf of others are:  1. Would this be considered an ADA job accommodation if it's forcing the disability to be handled off of company time?   2. Would clocking out like this have any relevance to the Equal Pay Act if it's forcing the person with a disability to make less than an equally qualified employee without the disability? I don't know if it only takes into account actual time doing work activity, but that goes back to unclear bathroom break regulations.  3. Instead of ADA, would FMLA be an alternative? Seems like either is rather extreme for needing to relieve oneself, but here we are.  4. What about otherwise healthy people that need to use the bathroom and can't wait for the next break? Drank too much water/coffee, diarrhea, or other non-disability-related waste disposal need?  5. Relating to the previous item, is this a reasonable policy when some conditions necessitating frequent bathroom breaks clear up in less time than it takes to get an ADA request approved in this company (around 30 days last I heard)?  6. What does OSHA or other labor laws say about employee rights to bathroom breaks?  -  Any input that can be provided is welcomed. I have no preconceived notions about the answers to any of these questions. Any sources I can be linked to to get a better understanding would be great--whether it's for or against any of the items listed--if it's convenient for you.   - Thank you for your time."	No
I am going on vaction in a few weeks and want to rent my apartment out for 3 days for some extra cash.  I read over my lease and there is a statement saying we can't have guests stay with us for more than 3 days. Am I obligated to even tell the landlord that I want to do this?   I read on here some posts defending landlords not to let tenants do an AirBnB type of thing because of liability and other things.  Also if I do this, what is a good way to protect myself in case something happens?  I don't have renters insurance but plan on getting it.	No
"I'm dealing with my TX HOA for the second time in 7 years because of some damage that has been done to my fence through poor landscaping choices on their part.  The timeline is below:  - In 2010, the HOA agreed their poor landscaping choices led to my 7 year old fence being destroyed and agreed to pay half of the replacement cost. The main destruction came from a rapidly growing bush (pampas grass) being planted too close to my fence, but some ivy/ground cover had also destroyed the bottom of my fence since it had been allowed to sit on it for years.  - When I was replacing the fence I was given permission to remove the ivy that was in front of it to avoid rotting out my new fence pickets.  I have before and after pictures showing the ivy was effectively removed.  I have this in writing and gave my HOA rep a copy of these when I this new ivy was planted.   - 5-10-2016 - After the ivy was replanted randomly one day I emailed my HOA rep explaining the history and politely requested that it be removed so that we didn't have a repeat of the previous incident - On 6-7-2016, after ""discussing it with the board"", the HOA rep told me the landscaping company would ""have the work completed by the end of the work day on Thursday, the 9th.""  The landscaping company came and possibly cut it back a little, but it was not removed as expected.  The company also dropped off a dozen or more bags of potting soil, so I waited for something to happen.  - A year later, 7-12-2017, nothing more had happened.  The bags of potting soil are still sitting in the public space and the ivy is clearly growing all along the bottom of my fence and has begun to rot out all of the pickets and the lowest fence runner.  I once again ask my HOA rep to remove the ivy. - 7-25-16 - My HOA replys saying they will instruct the lawn service to cut the ivy back.  There is not explanation for why they ivy won't just be removed. - 7-29-16 - I email asking the above question.  I never get a response.   - Today - The landscaping company has come by and cut the ivy back to ~1' from my fence.  My HOA rep emailed telling me that it was completely removed, and I replied to tell her it was not completely removed and once again requesting that it be.    What I would like advice on is: 1. Can I legally force my HOA to remove the ivy?  I was given permission in writing before to remove it due to damage that it had previously created.  It is frustrating that they can replant it, refuse to remove it, damage my fence again, and there is nothing I can do about it. 2. How much damage is enough to seek compensation?  I have about 20' of a 7 year old fence with the bottom 3-6"" completely rotted away, this includes pickets and a some of a pretreated runner (http://imgur.com/a/KufJ3?).  The rest of the fence is in great shape (see pics).  I know structurally it isn't destroyed, but this ivy has done damage to my property and I'd like to know what my options are.  Thank you for reading the long post.  TL:DR HOA replanted and now refuses to remove ivy that I previously removed with their permission.  This ivy damaged my fence in the past and has now done so again.  How do I get them to stop and/or pay for the damage?"	No
I moved out of a location in Saint Louis, MO at the end of June.  Former landlord says that the returning security deposit was sent erroneously to my former household 5 weeks ago and the check was cashed (but not by me).  I'm 100% certain it wasn't cashed by the current tenants (I know them), if the person who cashed my check can't be found, who is responsible for the lost money?	No
"My parents are being evicted from the home they're renting. Long story short, they're in dispute with the landlord and decided not to pay the rent (which I advised against) and are being served their eviction notice.  While home, my mother heard a man continuously and loudly knocking on the door as if he was trying to break it down yelling ""I have the eviction notice!""   She was frightened and did not answer.  At that point the courier went to the backyard of the property and started knocking on the windows and the glass doors.   After that point, he went back to the front of the house and started yelling ""I'll bring the cops and tell all of your neighbors you're being evicted!""  Is the way this was handled legal? I told my mom to record the situation if it happens again."	No

We just moved into an apartment in Norhtern Virginia (VA) Memorial Day weekend and he will likely leave in early October. I know that, under the [SCRA](https://www.justice.gov/crt-military/scra), active duty servicemembers can break their lease when they receive orders more than 35 miles from the location of their residence. His new location is definitely far past that. I pay about 40% of the rent and literally cannot pay for 100% on my own. I'm happy to break the lease as the only reason I moved into this apartment was because we are college buddies; financially breaking the lease makes the most sense to live on my own and pay less in rent.  I've been trying to find specifics to the SCRA and VA law, but can't find much. If I can't find anything straightforward and if my landlord isn't understanding I'm planning to lawyer up, I just want to know my options. Thanks so much!	No
Here's the situation: I'm an engineer. I've been working at my present company since May 2014. My wife and I are moving from Canada (Alberta) to England in August. My manager, who is a close friend of mine and knows we're moving, accidentally let it slip to my director yesterday that I was going to be leaving the company. My director called me today and asked me about it, so not wanting to lie, I told him that I would be leaving soon, but made it clear that I would be available to work until August 11th which is a week before the move. 5 minutes later he emailed me and he is now asking for me to submit my 2 weeks written notice by the end of the week, in effect shorting me of 3 weeks of work (and thousands of dollars in pay.) Do I have any options or am I screwed?	No
Hi,  Florida.  My employer issued a new handbook today, containing a change in policy how they pay out PTO to employees who quit with two weeks' notice. Previously we got all unused PTO in our pay. Now they will only pay half.  Is this legal?	No
Back in January 2017 my 5 roommates and I signed a lease that would be from May 1st 2017- April 30th 2018. 4 other roommates and I paid the first and last months rent as a deposit. I did not know that the 6th roommate had not paid his deposit until in April I got an email from our landlord saying there is outstanding payments from him. After asking for him to pay he informed me he no longer wants to move out from home and wants to back out of the contract. I told him he would need to find someone to replace him in the lease or he would need to pay every months rent as he signed the contract. He paid the first and last months rent and said he would find someone replace him, while in the meantime pay the rent. However in June we received another email from our landlord saying he has not paid rent in the last two months and this is where they usually start the eviction process. I spoke with the landlord about legally forcing my 6th roommate to pay his rent and he said that as we signed together it is our responsibility. Yesterday my other 4 roommates and I decided to just allow the eviction and find a new 5 person house and cut our losses. When we told our landlord this he said he will send a collection letter and not let us terminate our lease, we either have to pay the difference of our 6th roommates rent between us or he will send a collection letter.   Can i go to small claims court and get our 6th roommate to pay his share of the rent? We all signed a contract to pay $2700 a month but we also signed saying we'd pay $450 each. What are the next steps I can take so I don't get evicted?	No
This is a complicated situation but I will try to keep this brief and clear.  We have a mixed relationship with our landlords who are selling the unit we live in.  Our lease is up on August 31st and the sale closes on August 2nd.  The landlords are both lawyers, and we have been dealing with their real estate broker who is an idiot.  She claims they want us to pay them the entire month's rent for August, after which they will transfer the prorated amount to the new owner along with the security deposit.  We plan to negotiate an early ending to the lease with the buyer, as they have indicated they'd like to get into the unit to do work and rent it out before the end of the month, and we have a new lease beginning August 1st.  It seems strange that the landlords want us to pay them the full month's rent when the apartment will only be under their ownership for one day of August.  We are slightly afraid that they will simply keep the money.    What's the best course of action?  The penalty for not paying rent on time in our lease is very minimal.	No
Hello,  I'm trying to move into an apartment. I've signed all the legal paperwork, and they have been giving me the run-around once they received my holding deposit.  One thing they did was that despite only having only policies for cats and dogs, they suddenly decided my pet bunny counted as a large animal as well, and I need to treat it as a cat or dog. I decided it was fine, since some apartments do do this, and though my bunny doesn't chew, I could see why they'd want an extra deposit.  However, they are claiming I MUST vaccinate my bunny against rabies.  The issues is -- there is NO legal or approved vaccination for bunnies in the US. Whatsoever. It shows up again and again when you google it -- there are vaccinations in the UK and Denmark and so on, but not against rabies.  I have called five different vets who confirmed this.  The apartment claimed to have called around *until they found a vet who disagreed*. I called that exact vet because they gave me the information. They said they had a universal vaccination. I asked how it could be used on bunnies if no vaccination is approved for them in the US. After the person on the line spoke to the vet, they confirmed that no -- this is NOT an approved vaccination for a bunny. I was relieved because this vet has 1 star reviews, but even THEY were honest and adamant about it.  I then called the apartment again, and they told me it's too bad, I need to vaccinate the bunny despite no legal or approved vaccination for them. I have read from several people that such a vaccine has a decent chance of harming the bunny since they are usually for carnivorous animals.  Can they legally do this? They already agreed bringing my bunny was fine, they signed and I signed a paper stating so, and I'd understand if there WAS a vaccine, but literally none are approved in the US. Even their own vet that I called confirmed I'm right.  They claim that someone did this to their bunny in a sister-complex, which I think isn't true. All the vets (even the one they sent me to) I spoke to said no reputable vet would give a rabies vaccine to a bunny unless there was some sort of serious risk of that bunny running around outside in dangerous areas.  Is there anything I can do? They already have a deposit they took from me. I'd lose it if I say I can't do the vaccine, according to them.  Thank you for your time.	No
Hello legaladvice peeps,  In 2016, I worked for a smallish tech company with a whole host of problems, including sexual harassment, unequal pay given to employees with the same responsibilities, internal nepotism, etc etc. I was asked by a journalist to speak on these problems, in particular about how several employees banded together to bargain for an HR representative and equal pay for the same work.   I spoke to the journalist already, but I've negotiated anonymity and am debating going on-record. The thing is, I signed an NDA, and I'm not sure if it's enforceable in this instance. I can send a copy of it privately if you're curious. But this article will come out within the time period specified by the NDA (2 years). My question is, can an NDA protect against claims of employer retaliation? AFAIK, that's not a business strategy, intellectual property, or anything of the like. It's just how I was treated by my employer, and as far as I can tell, collective bargaining is a federally protected action.  Anyway, any help would be appreciated, here.	No
"So. Let it be known right off the bat that I was told by this minor that they were 18 years old on this mobile app called Grindr. Over the course of a few days we are talking, chatting, getting to know each other, the works. For about half a day they block me, but later unblock me saying they had to. Someone ""they had been with"" had caught them on grindr and he had to lay low. Weird, but as they are talking to me again, I assume all is well.  Anyway, as I am speaking to this supposed 18yo, I was also talking to other profiles. We decided to make this fun and invite a third person to this party. One particular profile seemed very interested and wanted to meet up but refused to send a face picture in response to my own picture and a picture of the 18yo. Eventually I tell this Faceless account to shove it after them giving me the run around. I was stupid. I sent Faceless my own face picture, as well as my cell number. I block them on grindr and just agree to meet the 18yo at a hotel they are already at because of a ""friend's party.""  I arrive at the hotel and am told to go somewhere. By this time I receive a Facebook message request. I ignore it. I continue driving around looking for 18yo. Don't find him. Eventually I get fed up and start recording on my phone of my current location, trying to get 18yo to give me better directions. Keep in mind this entire time I am texting 18yo over Facebook messenger, I have also sent the pics and videos of my location through FB messenger.  Then, the 18yo's messages bubble tells me that I can no longer reply to the conversation. I've been blocked. Huh, odd. I go to their FB profile and can still view it. I log into a secondary FB account and navigate to his profile, and that I cannot start a chat with him with this secondary account. The 18yo has not blocked me, but disabled messenger.  I finally look at my message requests, and find that this stranger has messaged me:  ""I'm calling [Local Police Force] right now. Reporting you for trying to have sex with a minor.""  Initially confuaed, but with a slow frightening realization, I book it. Haul ass off hotel grounds and take the long way home  This took place an hour and a half ago.  If what this stranger says is true, I could be charged with solicitation of a minor. I repeat again I was not aware that I was talking to a minor. No where in any of our conversations was there a number other than 18.  Redditors of r/legaladvise. Assuming that this"	No
Dear Reddit,  I really need your help!  A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.  Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.  I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.  How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?  How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?  And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?  Tbh, I've been really scared of this day. I've been trying to avoid even talking about it but the 2-year limit is ending. I really do need you guys' advices.  Sincerely,	No
Yesterday, I was given an application to rent from an apartment complex, I disclosed that I was building my credit and that I had none. I filled out the application and turned it in, they gave me a signed lease which I signed as well. The lease has no mention of at-will termination of contract on either side, or demanding of a cosigner in place of a non-credit holding tenant. Today I was called and told I needed a cosigner and that my apartment wasn't secured until I had one. Do I really need the cosigner?	No
"I am a college student in the College station, Texas area. The lease at my apartment is a full year contract and so I as many students that do not have school in the summer, they find subleasers that do. This lady I found on craigslist decided to sublease a room for me. I wanted to leave paperwork out of it since it cost 160 dollars to have those papers documented. She paid her first month rent fine but the second month her account was refused for being a non transaction account. She really just squandered all her money in Austin the weekend before, but now she claims not to have the money to pay for it. Late fees racked up $10 everyday it is not paid and it accumulated to nearly double what she was supposed to pay. I had to resort to dishing out my own money to pay it. Thing is, when I threatened to kick her out she claimed that I couldn't because the court takes 30 days to get trial/she put her address down as my apartment so she ""legally"" lives there because her mail comes there. But her name is not on the lease in any way so why or how could she get away with staying at my apartment rent free? It wasn't until my roommate was moving out did we discover she was about to leave the apartment and leave us to pay the bill because she assumed that all college students have rich parents. She is also using an insane amount of utilities and I don't have the money to pay for it. Do I have a legal case here? What can I do about her? Can I call the police to kick her out? I need to get money from her but she keeps saying she has no money and complaining about being disabled. Calling her does not get me anywhere since she has an attitude. Thanks in advance"	No
"My husbands previous employer is wanting him to pay to have the office rekeyed because he did not have them sign off that the key was returned. My husband left all of his keys on his desk on his last day. It was only him and the owner there that day, and the front office person who is now contacting him after 7 months was not.  For a little more explanation, my husband used to work for a small office, he had to leave due to our daughters health issues and constant hospital trips...his former boss lost his mind when he told him his plan to leave. He resorted to calling him names, and berating him for hours at a time in his last two weeks about how he is ""not a man"" and it's the ""wife's job to stay at home"" among other even worse things. My husband didn't want to cause a scene or stoop to his level so he pretty much just put up with it until it was his last day. His boss kept saying that ""he would be back"" and when my husband actually tried to hand him the keys he refused. So instead, he left them on his cleaned out desk."	No
"Hello,  I am absolutely infuriated by this situation and wanted to know if anyone had any advice on what to do. I personally live in Arizona, however this company is located in Southern California, Newport CA to be exact.   So I rented a home at the beginning of May for the fourth of July weekend for me and 4 of my friends. I am 22 years old and wanted a place for me and all of my friends who have recently graduated to rekindle and hangout for the 4th of july. My friends and I each paid an even amount for the rental and gave it to my friend Joe. I went ahead and made the reservation and paid for the reservation with Joe's card. The full amount (roughly $4,000) was charged to the card immediately after making the reservation. The company sent me a confirmation email stating that the reservation had been made and sent me a bunch of information, including and email stating that the realtor would send me the lock combination to get into the home closer to the date of our stay.  I want to make it clear that a lot of homes in newport require you to be roughly 30 or older to rent a home. That is why I searched for days and finally found a rental company that allowed you to make reservations as long as you were 21 years of age or older. Considering that I, along with everyone in my party, was over the age of 21, I found that home to be perfect for us.   Fast forward to the day that we are supposed to arrive. We had the place booked for July 2nd-6th. On July 1st, at 5pm in the afternoon, I recieved an email requesting a photo of myself, a photo of my driverse license and a picture of the card on file. Unfortunately since I was traveling, I did not see the email until the next morning. (July 1st was a sunday, I did not expect to recieve an email on a sunday from them) Anyways, the very next morning I was happy to send them all of my information, however I explained to the realtor that I did not have a copy of the card on file considering that it had been lost by my friend Joe a few weeks back and he had since replaced the card. The reservation had already been paid in full nearly two months prior. Immediately after stating this, she said she would have to speak with a supervisor and get back to me. This was on July 2nd around 10 am, when our entire friend group had already traveled to newport and we were essentially pulling up to the driveway of the home. She then calls me back and states that since we do not have the card, that she has to cancel the reservation. She proceeded to cancel the reservation and said she would refund the money. I kindly explained to the realtor that the card had been cancelled, and that we would HAPPILY give them another card to keep on file for security purposes. She told me that since it wasnt the card that we paid with, there was nothing she can do.   Since they sent me that email less than 24 hours prior to our check in time, I had no idea that they required that card from us. Or else I wouldve called and notified them prior. When I asked her ""how was I supposed to know"" she responded, ""its in the rental agreement"". I immediately read through the entire rental agreement from beginning to end and I found NOTHING that remotely mentions anything about us having to have the card. She then said that ""since the card doesnt match the name on file, that is a red flag, so we cancelled your reservation"". So at this point, I feel like I am being lied to because now shes changing stories as to why she cancelled the reservation. I called back and kindly spoke with a supervisor and asked them to show me where in the rental agreement it states that we need to provide a picture of the card on file, or where it states that the card used to make payment needs to match the reservation. She hostilly responded, ""Sir, this is not a negotiation. Your reservation has been cancelled. Goodbye."" and then hung up the phone.   We were left there, sitting in front of the house, after traveling several hours, essentially homeless. They said that the money was refunded, however, that takes on average 3-5 business days, so we couldnt even use the $4,000 to rent another home or hotel room. We ended up having to pay for a hotel room for the night and buy flights back the next morning/drive back home.   I am honestly at a loss for words about this situation. I could not believe that a company could do this to a client. I believe that when I sent her a picture of my driverse licsense, she saw that I was only 22 and figured that since it was the fourth of july, that they could rent the home to someone ""Better"" for more money. I eventually found out that they ended up renting the home to a husband and wife for the fourth of july.   I am very upset because I had paid for this reservation two months prior, and they held the money in their account for 2 months. They then proceed to send me check in instructions less than 24 hours prior to my check in, and then cancelled the reservation. I do not understand how they can get away with this. I wish they would atleast have contacted me with the check in instructions a few days prior to our reservation.  Does anyone know what kind of attorney I should speak with about this? Or does anyone have any advice who works in this industry? I would greatly appreciate all advice.  Sorry for the long post.  Thank you!"	No
This is for a friend of mine in Mississippi. He started a month to month lease in a condo that included water and electricity in the rent. Within a week or two or him living there it was sold to someone else who decided they want to live in it. They told him he needs to leave asap (within a few days) and they're not gonna pay for water or electricity anymore. Some googling seems to show they have to give him a 30 day notice but we're not sure if they still have to provide water and electricity for those 30 days.	No
Hello. I am student living in a rented accommodation by an agency. Basically I moved in last month and I have had poor really poor WiFi for one month. The reason being is that this room I live in was newly built. The agency did not tell the broadband provider about the new accomodation room in a flat. Honestly I don't like this place and would like to move out but I signed a contract till next year summer.. the contract states that I get WiFi. Is there anyway of getting out of this contract. Thanks please move to a more appropriate group	No
I was recently using Airbnb to rent a room for the summer (~10 weeks) in Brooklyn. The host and I got along well enough at first, but she is far more germaphobic and detail-oriented than I. She has a long list of very minor rules (e.g. close the shower curtain when it's not in use), and I failed to comply with a few of them. They were innocent mistakes and no actual damage was done to her property or the apartment, but the Airbnb policy does allow her to cancel the stay if I fail to follow her rules. She's also not obligated to refund me anything less than 30 days after the cancellation. I am not disputing that she is within her contractual rights to do this.  I politely requested she at least put the room back up on Airbnb and refund me the remaining rent if she finds a replacement. She adamantly refused, saying that because she's not in the wrong she doesn't need to do anything like that and can just keep my rent. Is she required to take steps to mitigate my losses here? There were 3 weeks left in the agreement, which comes out to over a thousand dollars in rent. I understand I can't demand an outright refund, but is she required to at least put the room back up for rent and pay me back what she can if she finds a replacement?  Additionally, I believe her landlord does not permit residents to rent out rooms, but I'm not sure if that has any relevance here.  Thank you.	No
Last night, my roommate told me about a copyright notice from our ISP. It was the third one and first that I knew about. I have no idea who did the other two. Unwittingly, I said it might have been me. I live in a house of 3 and my landlord owns the account. He called me today and I said that I did it for the most recent notice. He then said he needs to call my ISP tomorrow or else the internet will get shut off. I thought that this was a simple warning and would have never admitted it had I known our internet would go down and he would possibly need to mention me to our ISP.   I live in Washington and I'm in the military. Should I talk to a military lawyer right now or wait until my ISP possibly contacts me? I have no idea if my landlord will be able to work this out without mentioning me. I know I'm an idiot for outing myself but I didn't know that this was the last straw for our internet service. I'm pretty scared and I need everything I have right now to get out and be financially straight. What should I do?	No
I live in an apartment building and someone in the neighbouring building has an incredibly loud motorcycle. I live downtown in a major city, and next to both LRT and heavy rail train tracks so I am used to road noise, motorcycles, trains etc.. This is way beyond normal. I live on the third floor in a different building and him leaving is so loud I can't hear a TV over it.   This is a particular problem for me because I have a serious issue with tinnitus and the extreme loud roaring will trigger my ringing to be much worse. i should also note that I have poor hearing, and so if it is loud to me it must be worse to everyone else.   I called 311 and they advised to call the police non-emergency. I did that but the police seemed very reluctant to do anything (even come issue them a warning) because I did not want to give them my name and contact information. The reason I don't want to give that information is because I am fairly sure that the guy in question is some kind of skinhead or neo-nazi, and essentially i don't want to have problems with him.   Would anyone know if he is actually violating a noise ordinance (he comes and goes in the middle of the night fairly often)? or if him modifying the bike to be louder would be illegal (I am suspicious he has done this since the bike is so extremely loud)? or how I could get the police to take my complaint as credible without sharing contact info? If anyone knew the consequences for the issue that would also be helpful (i.e. will he have to stop using the bike)?	No
I have had to do some travelling in Texas for business and I had went through some tolls this year and last. I received some letters stating I needed to pay my tolls and meant to do it but unfortunately got busy and forgot. I recently got a letter saying that the toll bill went to a law firm for collections and if I didn't pay they would send it to court. Some of these tolls are for like .50 cents but they tacked on $35 dollar fees.  I wanted to try and call the law firm but every time I call any of their numbers I'm on hold for half an hour and then it goes to a full voicemail box. I feel like this is part of their strategy to get you to pay to full bill.  What are my options? I'm willing to pay the bill and be more responsible with my toll bills in the future but that would really suck in the short term. Ideally I'd like to at least pay on it and work out terms with them. I mean I can't even get a hold of anyone to verify that my account will be cleared. Has anyone else dealt with something similar? 	No
"Back in Oct. 2010 I got a DUI in FL. My license was suspended until the completion of 6mos Interlock and a DUI class. I've spent the past few years using public transportation and have also moved out of FL. Where I've most recently moved in NorCal is very, very rural (I live on 40 acres, and all the plots are 40 acres) and I'm also in the process of getting a small Tech Support business started. So, I knew I'd need to get my license squared away.  FL tells me I need to get the Interlock device on a vehicle (which I have), then go to CA DMV with the paperwork, they will verify and issue a limited license (for work, school, errands, etc.), and once they issue my temporary license to mail a copy of it, along with some paperwork, to the FL DMV and they'll start the 6mos for my Interlock ONLY THEN.  I go to the CA DMV and they told me as long as FL has a hold on my license there's nothing they can do for me, Interlock or no. The DMV worker gives me the Mandatory Actions number, but they tell me the same thing.  It seems I'm stuck in a catch-22- the lasy with Mandatory Actions actually told me ""you may have to move to FL for 6 mos."" :|  Does anyone have any insights? Feel free to ask me any questions to help clarify, etc"	No
My girlfriend works in a special needs school and a student has brought bed bugs in from home.  She has followed the workplace policy on prevention (seems very minimal to me), but I am concerned she could bring them home.  Our apartment has been bed bug free, and our lease indicates that we are liable if we introduce bed bugs.  Is her employer liable for any costs we may have for taking care of this?	No
I've been working on a game and I have it pretty fleshed out. But I'm worried about moving forward without having some protection of it. How do I make steps to publish this to the public?  Is Kickstarter a good method to move forward? I hear that it's hard to successfully do a Kickstarter without having already made a game or some previous experience.	No
"Hi guys. I have a lot of questions. Thank your for being well versed in insane minutiae. I did a lot of googling about this and found only bits and pieces of answers    **Scenario**   I am a toddler teacher at a daycare with about 70 employees and two locations, NAEYC accredited. Our location is in a very old building. Today we came in to find that the storage facility connected to the designated break area (they share a door) is undergoing asbestos abatement. All proper signage, warnings, and info packets posted. The room was blocked off with a sheet of plastic and some plywood. None of the employees were alerted, nor were the families. We were also not offered alternative locations to eat lunch. This break room stores all of the food for the children, as well as all cleaning supplies, classroom supplies, extra toys, eating utensils, and a fridge where the employees store lunch and some snacks for children are stored. My boss claims the owner of the building told her to ""keep kids out of the break area because work is being done"" but that asbestos was not mentioned.     **Action sequence**   I am on the playground with my children speaking to another toddler teacher. I ask her if my boss is informing the families and she isn't sure. I indicate that I'm going to let them know that they should keep their children out of the designated area, as they are often in there. My boss's sister (this is it's own problem obviously) hears this and immediately texts my boss. Boss storms onto the playground, interrogating me about why I would want to tell parents about these ""chemicals"" and saying I don't know what I'm talking about, etc etc. When I immediately agreed that i would keep it to myself if she so wished, she continued. She said I just like to caused trouble, that I was a gossip, immature, strange thing like that. I mostly ignored her as I was with my kids, and holding one of them. At the end of her ranting she asked me ""Why do you even come here every day?"" I just kind of gave her a blank stare because that question made no sense to me. I reminded her that I'm putting in my two weeks notice on Friday (going to grad school) and She tells me I'm not needed and I should leave that afternoon and not return. So, humiliated and devastated, i did.  *Note: When I say boss, I refer to our assistant director, as our director is out of town. That's why i was waiting to give my notice, as the Director would return friday. The AD indicated that she was in communication with the director the whole time. I have had no luck contacting the director.*   **Questions**    *1* Does a landlord have any obligation to tell the tenants when asbestos removal is being done? Is the presence of children relevant?   *2* Does my boss have an obligation to let employees know that this work is being done? Does she have an obligation to tell the parents?   *3* Does the landlord have the responsibility of having the air tested for asbestos levels after removal?    *3* Is there anything shady about her reasoning for firing me? I understand at will and all that, but does the safety concern change anything?    *4* Will I be able to collect unemployment from them?    *5* Will I find myself in legal trouble if (now that I am no longer an employee there) I let the parents I know/have contact with that there is asbestos work going on?    I know this is a lot so I truly thank you for reading and considering. I am so lost right now and sadly no amount of googling is bringing me solid answers to these questions. Any help or insight would be incredibly appreciated. And if there are legal issues that may arise that I was unaware of, please let me know! This is turned my life right upside down. Help.  **tldr**: Asbestos abatement being done in a daycare, no one was told it was happening. I found out halfway thru the day when my coworker asked what all the cancer signs are about. Boss/acting boss fires me (allegedly with permission from real boss) for indicating that I wanted to tell the parents of the children who attend the daycare."	No
Today I found out Cigna denied part of my FMLA paperwork for a small error on the form that my doctor made.   The doctor failed to include two days I have missed from work in his date range for my intermittent leave for Migraine.   When I spoke with Cigna about this they stated that I can get a second chance, but only because I live in Washington State. Washington State has its own FMLA law. If I lived in a state without secondary protection, Cigna states that they would not reconsider if my doctor corrects the form.   Cigna never called me to inform me of the error on the form, and just denied my claim.   When I brought this up, they told me that they aren‚Äôt allowed to call. They also said that the law as written allows them to deny a claim and not reconsider it.   When I asked them where in the law it says they can do this, they mentioned that sections 825.306 and 825.307 of the 1993 FMLA pertain. She stated that it reads that the employer cannot call the doctor to question items on the form.   This section was obviously intended to protect the employee from the employer unscrupulously contacting doctors trying to prevent the leave from being approved under the law, Cigna is trying to make it about them.   I want to get this information out there. People living in states without secondary approval could lose their jobs because of stuff like this. People in desperate situations and in poor health could lose their jobs and their ability to pay for their insurance and their ability to receive care because of this policy by Cigna.   Upon research I read something about a 7 day cure period, and I think my situation applies.   What can I do? I feel like this company is taking advantage of people and it makes me sick.	No
"My lease just ended earlier this month, the way I pay rent is online through a 3rd party system that didn't know that my lease was ending and I got charged ~$1100+.   I contacted my bank, however, they haven't done anything about it (yet?), and I came back to my apartment to give them the key before I left. I told the person at the front office that I accidentally paid an additional month and was wondering if I was capable of getting that back. They said I would be getting my deposit back once they remove the furniture from my place and would be charged for that, which is totally fair and fine (assuming it's $100-$200 which might be over doing it, but whatever it's okay). In total, I had one bed, one desk, and one dresser that I left there. A few days later I received a letter that I was charged basically the entire additional deposit to replace the carpet of that apartment that was supposedly ""damaged and had pet urine"" on it. My cat lived with me, and has always used the litter box in the bathroom the entire duration of my time being there. I will admit, there was one stain of some drink next to my bed that I scrubbed a handful of times before I finally left that apartment and it honestly wasn't too bad at all. I don't believe in the slightest that that would warrant over a grand of the money I didn't even have to give them in the first place. My current living situation is not going well as a result of this, I have emailed the front office about this letter and have not gotten any response many days later. What should be the next step from this? A few people have just told me ""that's life, life is garbage, that's how it is"" but I can't just lose a thousand dollars and be okay with that."	No
Someone has been filing lots of code violations against our neighbors. I got hit last week with a totally bogus report saying my house was neglected and that my wife refused to clean it up. The code enforcement showed me the report but it was filed anonymously. Am I able to petition the government for information on the person filing the complaints? It appears that you have to create a sign in and give personal information before you can file a complaint. I'd like to have this stopped before this gets out of hand or our neighborhood has a major issue. 	No
I was working at a stadium tonight, and at the end of the night it turns out the till was down. After this the security guard searched me, he searched my pockets (no issues so far), then after nothing was found he asked me to remove my bra and lift it up and shake it (with my top still on of course), I felt weird doing this but was tired and wanted to go home so I did it and after I did it the guard seemed seemed really awkward. This took place behind a fridge behind the bar so no customers could see, but the person behind the other bar would be able to see if he looked over. This feels pretty weird to me and I've never experienced this before, I'm not looking to sue or anything but is searching like this (especially by a member of the opposite sex) allowed? If not I'll bring it up to my supervisor tomorrow.	No
"Today I was pulled over.  When the vehicle came to a stop I cracked the window to about 1/2in, enough to hear the officer's commands and hand over my identification.  The officer approached my driver's window and stood there.  Said nothing, then opened my driver's door.  I was flabbergasted, I asked him what right he had to open my door.  He replied, ""You didn't put the window down.""   As I see it, if I had something illegal in the door of my car, he would not have known about it until he opened the door.  Which seems to me like an illegal search.  Could someone weigh in on this?"	No
"I've done coke once with a friend (and their other friend, who brought it) and ever since then that friend has grown very cold about it in front of me and said they were pressured into doing it by their friend who was present. Even though I know they're just saying that to hide it. Cuz I asked them to bring some one day after that and referred to it as ""‚ùÑÔ∏è"" (snowflake emoji) over text and they flipped out on me. I was later told that's dangerous because she could get in trouble for supplying. But I don't get it, it's not like someone's spying on our conversation? (WhatsApp is secure)   Anyway I'm not looking to sell drugs, I just wanted to do it with this friend while we hang out. For recreational purposes. I was thinking of asking them again this time (6 months later) and refer to it as something like ""üîå"" (plug emoji which is common for this) . Basically something like ""hey can u hook up the üîå"". Could that get someone in trouble?"	No
I'm pretty sure it happened when I just turned 16...  it's still on my record as a misdemeanor. How do I go about getting this off?	No
I am leasing a house with the option to buy. April 1st will be three years and the lease will be up. I put a down payment at the time the lease was signed, which is subtracted from the purchase price. Nothing I pay monthly goes towards this - I am strictly paying rent.  The lease stipulates that I make all repairs and perform all maintenance. Six months after moving in I had to replace the water heater. I didn't have the cash for the water heater at the time so the landlord wrote me an eviction notice so that I could get a hardship withdrawal from my 401(k).   We tore up the carpet (she had TEN dogs in the house when she lived here so the carpet was super stiff and disgusting), and all the floors had beautiful wood under that just needed to be sanded and finished. Half the tiles were cracked in the kitchen so we tore those up, and got all the floors tested for asbestos. The laminate under the kitchen tested positive. I let her know this and provided a copy of the report. We purchased new flooring for the kitchen and dining room after tearing up the tile.   During this time, we had a really bad storm and because of how poorly the gutters are laid out (they had them drain straight into the ground by the house? Like, STRAIGHT down???), the sump pump couldn't keep up and the basement flooded, as did the garage. Because we are not in the floodplain, renters insurance did not cover my belongings, and her house insurance didn't cover anything either. She did have an inspector come out to assess things a few days afterwards. So, of course the floor was torn up at this time upstairs. The landlord then told me in March if I can't purchase by the lease period ending then she will not be renewing the lease, and I need to repair everything in the house. Mind you - we take excellent care of the house - the floor was just torn up because we were literally in the middle of laying new flooring when the flood occurred downstairs.   She is now harassing me via text about purchasing the house and repairs on the house. We intend to purchase the house, I am just clearing a few things up on my credit and saving for a down payment. I have okay credit, but want to raise my score even more before we buy so I get a better rate. I've always made rent payments on time - aside from maybe a day or two past the due date early on when she had a set due date of the 8th with zero room to account for pay periods (she's since moved to the 12th which helps).   She is personally attacking me via text, even after I told her several times to please stop, twice that she needs to contact me through my lawyer, and then finally, she texted me three times after I told her I would file a police report for harassment. She also threw in my face the 401(k) hardship loan to get the water heater.   I know that she's got property in another state and she's having issues with that tenant so she's feeling quite stressed about getting rid of this property I'm in.   I would appreciate any and all advice you can give, thank you.	No
Hello. I am a renter currently living in Pinellas County Florida. I would like to break my lease.  I have payed rent on time for the first 6 months of my 12 month lease. There is one other person on the lease who I share my apartment with. We currently with to find a new place to live as the duplex we are renting is too costly to be considered practical.   From light research I have discovered that, from what I can tell, If I am to break my lease early I will still be responsible for the remainder of the rent due for the next six months(Bad!). There are two ways that I can see in which I may be able to circumvent this and would like to know the validity of these approaches.(Good!)  First off, I believe that I was rented the property under #FALSE #PRETENSE. Upon viewing the property before renting I asked several questions about the property, the most important in this case is in regards to the back patio of the duplex. When asking the property manager (at the time) if the back patio was a shared space, or if it belonged to a particular tenant, the property manager indicated that the entirety of the back patio was included in the rental and that it in no way was shared with the other portion of the duplex. The back patio stretches from our back door, across one of our bedroom windows, and continues underneath a bedroom window of the other tenet. In addition, the power/water meters for both portions of the duplex(I am not very knowledgeable on this topic) are located about halfway across the patio, between the two windows. Lastly, on the far side of the patio from my back door is a water hookup that belongs to the other duplex. Upon moving in the couple that resides in the other duplex insisted everything up to the power meter belonged to them, and as a result the back patio has become a point of contention. The other couple has even restored to storing some of their things on my back patio as some strange show of territorial dominance. This is a hostile environment that I have no desire to be a part of and as a result I have stopped bringing it up with the other couple and stopped using the back patio entirely.   It is of note that over the course of the first three months of us staying at this property that the property management company switched two times and we had to sign a total of three leases.   Secondly as of around two months ago we began to see evidence of termites. Just some damage to the woodwork in the kitchen, VERY minor. We called the company, and they said they would take care of it. A couple days later the pest company calls us and we miss the call. WE call back and leave a message and they never got back to us. Two days ago the towel rack fell off the wall, and in the hole it left were termite wings. We suspect that the issue is getting worse.   What can we do in this situation.	No
"I noticed that my LL is getting mail from companies that assist in foreclosures on the outside of the envelope (We live in the same house and 1 mailbox). I looked up the house it looks like they were issued a ""Notice of Lis Pendens"" on March 2017.   He hasn't told me anything and I am wondering if I should get ready to move out. I'm about to buy a house that is going to close in 60-90 days. How long does it usually take to get into foreclosure status and do you think the LL will ask me to leave soon? I don't want to get movers twice."	No
I‚Äôm not sure where this falls as My knowledge of all this stuff is pretty much zero, would appreciate some help.   Riding bicycle this afternoon and I hit a huge unmarked pothole. Flipped over and messed up my knee pretty bad. I called 311 but was told, after they asked if I needed an ambulance which I said no to, I have to go into police station to make an accident report.   Went home cleaned myself up then visited hospital. Will be going back after the hospital to accident sight and take pictures of pothole then will go to police station to file accident report and provide all the paperwork from hospital.   As this was an unmarked pothole in the bike lane will the hospital bill and bike damage bill fall on the city of Chicago to pay? Or am I paying for this myself even though it wasn‚Äôt my fault? I am uninsured at the moment but will be insured at the end of August through my colleges insurance plan which I filled out paperwork for already.   Thanks for your time	No
1 year lease was signed, clearly states that each month of the one year, rent is due. They‚Äôre deciding to move out now, many months before the end of the lease. What‚Äôre my options? I‚Äôm definitely keeping the deposit since that‚Äôll cover one months rent that should‚Äôve been paid.	No
Hello, I'm posting this for a friend who's too old to probably post here and handle the situation.  He's been at the apartment for 6 months, it's actually an extremely small room that violates a few codes I'm sure but he's paying low rent so has been dealing with it.  The landlord snapped last week (we think he might be crazy) and started making outrageous demands including an immediate $500 security deposit and bump in rent to $700 or more (it keeps changing).  Obviously my friend doesn't know what to make of this and can't really afford paying $1200 in one go and given the place, it's probably not worth it.  He and I have tried looking for a new place to live but it's hard finding something for $500 (unless some people have ideas?) and under such short notice as well.  My question is, doesn't the landlord need to provide at least 30 days written notice even despite there not being a lease?  Ideally he could stay there for at least another month or longer so he can at least make other arrangements.    The landlord reminded him today that he needs to be out this Sunday (and also made physical threats apparently - but I wasn't there to witness it).  Thanks so much for your help!	No
The estate has plenty of assets to cover all debts so that is not the issue. Am I okay as executor to cover the post-funeral dinner for the relatives of the deceased from the assets. It will probably be $1000 out of an estate of $4m. 	No
Hello everyone,  I just moved to California from across the country. It's kind of a rural area so it was difficult to find a place to rent. I went out to look at properties beforehand but all the ones available for show were already rented out by the end of that day while I waited for my application to be approved of and I couldn't afford to travel back to look at more properties before deciding to apply for a place.  My application was approved for a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath, with standard kitchen appliances such as an oven, dishwasher, and refrigerator. I made sure to read the lease thoroughly and it states that the unit fits that description.   After taking possession, it turns out there's no half bathroom nor is there a refrigerator. I think the solution the the refrigerator is easy: they should just provide the fridge like the lease states. This isn't exactly possible with the half bathroom, though.  I really like the place otherwise. I'm disappointed that it's not as advertised nor as described in the lease. I don't want to break the lease, but I don't think I should have to pay full rent for something that was not as described in our contract.   Here are my questions: can I negotiate a decrease in rent for the lack of half bathroom or how can I best handle the situation? This is a property owned by a third party who has the unit run by a local property management company.   Tl;dr: lease says 2 bedroom, 1.5 bath, refrigerator included. Unit only has 2 bedroom, 1 bath, no fridge. What can I do to negotiate to make up for the lack of half bathroom?	No
Hello. Pretty short question. I live an apartment complex in Vermont and the septic tank busted. Causing a sink hole of sewage in the back yard. We have been given no notice that they are going to do anything about it. We live by a river, and I am unsure if the sewage is seeping into the river.   I am unsure what I can do, so any info you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thanks!	No
In December I bought a new house in a new neighborhood.  I received a copy of the CC&amp;Rs that made no mention of restrictions to street parking (in front of your house).  Yesterday, everyone received an email with an updated CC&amp;R document that among other things added the following restrictions...  &gt; Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall park and store Vehicles owned or in use  by such Lot Owner, tenant or occupant, either in the driveway or garage  appurtenant to the Lot owned and/or occupied by them.   &gt;Guests, invitees and licensees of any Int Owner, tenant or occupant shall likewise  park Vehicles in the driveway or garage appurtenant to such Lot Owner, tenant or  occupant's Lot.   &gt;Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall submit written request to  the ACC for permissible street parking to accommodate guests no less than  seventy-two (72) hours prior to any planned event, and as soon as reasonably  possible for unplanned events such as funeral visitation for example.   &gt;Any vehicle observed in violation of any part of these Rules and Regulations  whether continuously or within twenty-four (24) hours of the first observed  violation, shall be considered a continuation of the previous violation and thus, be  subject to the Enforcement provisions herein.  I wasn't aware that changes to the CC&amp;Rs could be made without a vote, but apparently the neighborhood hasn't been turned over to the HOA, and the developer can change them on whim until such time.  My three questions are, can the developer really change the CC&amp;Rs at will until the development is turned over to the HOA?  Can the HOA enforce parking rules on city owned streets?  What recourse do I have as a homeowner if I receive a fine from the HOA?  Thanks in advance for any feedback or advice.	No
We moved into the apartment in April, 12 month lease.  Several weeks ago we noticed evidence of mice in one of out bathrooms.  We thoroughly cleaned the droppings, notified the property manager, and 3-4 days later an exterminator came and sealed the holes in the wall where the mice were getting in.  Last week, we noticed new evidence of mice in our kitchen.  We notified the property manager again, and they came out and did a more thorough inspection to find that mice are chewing holes in our kitchen, both bathrooms, and the bedroom where our 2 year old sleeps.  We want to break the lease, the complex wants us to give 60 days notice and pay an additional 2 months after we move out.  Even if they fill all these holes, the building has a larger mouse problem and the rodents problem will persist.    I am arguing that they did not comply with the NC General Statute 42-42: Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.  There is also an 'imminent danger' clause that specifies a rat infestation, but nothing about mice.    We keep the apartment clean, never any food or dirty dishes left out.     Will this evidence be sufficient that the apartment is not inhabitable? The complex has offered us the buyout, which is our lease goes 60 days from the date we sign, and we pay a buyout fee of 2 months rent, so we effectively pay for 4 months that we are not living there.  Should I sign the notice to move out they provided?  Can we just move out and not pay anything?  I have reached out to the city housing department to see if they think this situation is 'uninhabitable'.    Thanks for any advice!	No
Title. This is in Ireland, I don't know what difference that will make. I'm visiting an information center tomorrow on her behalf. We live in separate counties, and she fears that word will spread in her very petite town if she consults her own info center.  Is there any real basis? It wasn't from her HR manager either, but a higher up, similar to a teacher saying it to a janitor. The co-workers job is also, supposedly at risk.	No
So my neighbor owns the lot behind our house. The lot seems to be used not so often and they're home is on the lot behind another neighbor's house (they own a lot of land). Anyway, the lot behind my property is overgrown. No big deal, don't really care about that, my only issue is they have black berry bushes that are growing over the fence and into our back yard. Can I cut the branches that are in our yard without worrying about any legal repercussions?	No
Some clarification and backstory: I am asking on behalf of a family friend who isn't technologically-savvy enough to know about reddit. He has a daughter who will soon graduate from college in the US, who does not know that he was once deported - and he wants to keep it that way if possible. Also, first post here, not sure about the rules, the whole nine yards - will edit accordingly if I've broken any posting rules.  Story: My family friend (Bob) was an illegal immigrant for about a decade or so, until the mid-90s. He went there on a tourist visa and illegally extended his stay. In the mid-90s, Bob returned to his home country to settle some family affairs, and was detained when he attempted to return. From what I understand, he was flagged by the system upon arrival at customs, and it also didn't help that he had less than $100 on him (apparently, it seems that it signals an intent to stay illegally). Bob's visa was revoked and he was sent home on the next flight.  When his daughter was starting college, Bob tried to apply for a tourist visa to visit with her, and help her settle in. But the American embassy still had his records, and denied him his tourist visa.  Now, Bob is in the process of changing citizenships to another country on America's Visa Waiver Program (legally; his wife and daughter are from said country and he has been living and working in since being deported). If he successfully changes his citizenship, would it be possible for him to legally visit the US again? Or are there any other possible (non-illegal) workarounds to allow him to visit? He no longer has any intention of being an illegal immigrant.  Thanks in advance for any advice!	No
**To the point**-  My Grandmother is at the time where she needs someone to take over her finances and care.  She distrusts most of the family, for a long time.  She has decided that she wants me to handle this if I am willing to.  What is the preferred way for us to accomplish this. I am thinking that a poa at first will work, but I am unsure what means to use for a more long term solution that is more difficult to contest. I would like to be able to eventually prohibit any significant access to her assets without my approval.  Potential problems are a few money hungry worthless relatives who I will no doubt have to eventually fight when the gravy train stops.  Second, what sort of 3rd person can I use to do a periodic financial audit to show proof that her money is being used for her and her alone. A CPA?  I am thinking this could help insulate me from the greedy relatives if I can show proof that everythings ok.  Assets are for sure &lt;$1M.  I would guess between $400K and $500K.  So I am not sure if there is really enough there for something like a trust.  **More detail** -  My grandmother is in a bad situation currently.  She feels threatened that someone is going to get her placed into a nursing home and steal her money.  Unfortunately one of her kids has tried to do exactly that in the recent past.  For whatever reason she feels like its going to happen again.  She and another family member she trusts contacted me after they refused the offer to take over this position.  This family member is dealing with their own severe medical problems and isn't in the position to do it.  So they discussed it and determined that I was the best option.  So I was surprised when she asked me to do this.  She is estranged from her kids for various reasons and one of them is a terrible choice anyways.   I feel like there is real potential for one of the relatives to take her for a ride around town and clean out her bank accounts.  Just to give you an idea, one of them recently gave her a sob story and talked her out of several thousand dollars which he promptly blew on season tickets to a NFL team and bragged about it on fb.  Real piece of work.  Another one got a new car.  In short I am willing to do this because I care about her and I see a real potential for elder abuse or at the very least her being taken advantage of.  I think the long term solution is what I am most concerned about.    The kicker to all this is that I stand to inherit zero from her will.  The person that does stand the most to gain isn't interested enough to take care of her and my Grandmother doesn't trust them anyways.  Thats fine with me, so I stand to gain nothing from this but trouble and assurance that she will be taken care of.	No
I moved out of a one bedroom apartment and into a two bedroom apartment within the same apartment complex at the end of May. I paid the landlord the security deposit and first month rent for the new apartment before moving in. It is now 17 days into the month and I have not received the security deposit for the old apartment despite asking for it multiple times. I have an email from around the end of June asking when I shouldn't expect it and the landlord said 6/30. 6/30 came around and I received nothing. Waited a few days and still didn't receive anything, called him after the July 4th holiday and he said it should be here Monday or Tuesday (7/10-7/11) Still nothing. Called again and he told me to check the old apartment. I did and there was nothing there, which I told him the next day. Then he said he had to call some woman and ask her about it tomorrow or the next day, whenever she was in the office. Didn't hear from him, sent and email asking about it, no response, called him the next day (late last week) and he said we should receive it today or tomorrow. We got our mail today and have still not received it. Perhaps we will receive it tomorrow.  I have a few questions. If we do not receive it tomorrow, is it required that I send a demand letter requesting the deposit before taking him to court? My second question is, even if we do receive it tomorrow, can I still take him to court for being 2+ weeks late in returning it? And finally, after looking up some reviews I found someone that dealt with this landlord and apartment complex to have the same issue I am having and when they finally got their secuirty deposit back, they only received their secuirty deposit but none of the interest it accumulated so she took him to court and got the interest, plus some additional money for getting the security deposit back late. If that happens to me, what would be my course of action in getting that? Thanks for the help.	No
"I recently had to shut down my business, it wasn't working out. i wasn't making any money, but i own the office space i was working out of. this was three months ago.   last week, i broke up with my girlfriend and we will be moving out of the apartment we are currently renting on July 19th.   the space i own is pretty large. the bathroom has a drain on the floor so i can most definitely build a shower in there no problem. shouldn't take me more than a couple hours work, and it'll look decent when i'm finished.   there is a small room in the back i used to use as my office, i was thinking about moving my desk and putting a bed back there. there is also a break room that already has a refrigerator, toaster oven, and microwave. i don't need more than that for a ""kitchen"". anything i cook is in the toaster oven or microwave.   that leaves the rest of the space for me to ""live"" in. can i legally furnish this place up and just live here for a bit? i live in florida if that matters"	No
Alright, so a couple months back bedbugs found their way into our apartment.  There were 4 of us living there, but only 3 were on the lease.  My room was situated next to the living room, and they appeared in mine first.  We don't know where/who they came from (I'm a shut-in homebody, and one of the other guys brought tons of people into the apt), but they blame me since I noticed it first.  Well, I couldn't shoulder the burden alone, and since only our apt was affected, our landlord said he wasn't responsible for the cost.  He did say we could use the security deposit to cover the cost, so that was pretty much the only choice.  Well, one of the roommates on the lease is saying I owe him his portion of the security deposit since it went to cover the cost of the treatment.  Is there any legal action my roommate can take to try to get me to pay it?  I'm not confrontation, so I was just gonna ignore him as I really can't afford it right now, but I wanna cover my ass in case he has some ground to stand on.	No
I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this sub but I figured it couldn't hurt to try!  I rent in Chicago and my apartment building has had problems with theft from our mail room in the past. To remedy this, the landlord installed a locked Dropbox that UPS and FedEx drop packages off in (because they do not have keys to the mail room). USPS does not deliver to the drop box, they put packages in the mail room which kind of makes you wonder what's the point of the box I guess.  The box would be fine, except the only people who have keys to it are the landlord himself, who lives over an hour away in the suburbs and his son, who lives in the building, and they never seem to check the box on a daily basis. I have to order a lot of supplies for work that is time sensitive and I will pay for fast shipping or use Prime, and yet I never actually have my packages in my hands when I pay to have them in my hands.  I have come to the end of my rope today because I broke my glasses and had a replacement pair overnighted to me. My eyesight is incredibly poor and I'm close to useless without them. My package was delivered Monday. It is now Friday and the package still hasn't been taken out and given to me. I've texted the landlord's son multiple times asking him to please check the box (it's a 30 second walk from his apartment) because I very much NEED these glasses. I called him and no answer. I called/texted the landlord and he said he'd talk to him (that was Wednesday).   Despite the landlord and his son being hard to deal with, I still like where I live, the rent is fair and it's a good area and nice apartment. I just want my packages. Is there any way to go about solving this issue in a more firm manner that doesn't involve my landlord hating me so I can continue to renew? Thanks!	No

I'm moving out of the US and from what I understand, should have a POA to act on my behalf if needed with regard to banking, taxes, etc. I have a sibling in MI and a friend in FL that I would like to give independent POA. Obviously they can't sign one form at the same time in front of witnesses and a notary. Is it okay if I create two separate forms as long as I reference the other POA on it? Thanks in advance.	No
Hey Legal Advice, I'm working on putting together a crafts business.  I know I need to register for a business license/tax ID from the state, but it's not clear to me if I also need to trademark my business name federally.  It's an extra fee I'd sort of prefer not to incur, and I am not making unique enough things to worry about copycats.  If I were to start selling unique patterns or instructions, I would definitely trademark. Mostly, I'm looking forward to a tax-ID that allows me to pay wholesale/tax free for supplies.   I have verified that my company name is not taken (in VA or on the federal database), so that is not the issue.  If anyone can provide clarification, I would appreciate it.	No
My grandfather passed away recently.  More than a year ago he added me as a co-owner on his bank account. What happens to the money in that account? Does it become part of his estate, am I entitled to it?   I thought I was entitled to at least some of it as the co-owner, but my aunt said not to spend any of it because she would have to pay creditors with it.   The whole point of putting me on his account was because he wanted me to have the money. (I was his caretaker &amp; he lived with me). It's not a whole lot - prob about 5k.   I'm in PA.  TLDR had a joint account with my grandpa, in PA, what happens to the money?	No
On September 4th, 2017; my father Tommy Wayne Baird jr was brutally beaten (held down, boot heel prints on each wrist, broken nose, sub dural brain bleeds, bruises all over his body, tased in the neck and chest with no defensive wounds, etc) and killed at the age of 49 by 4 Canton, MS police officers (of which 15 minutes of the killing was on Facebook live) after passing up an inspection sticker checkpoint and being followed for several miles while on his way to Jackson, Mississippi to get his PTSD medication from the VA clinic. He served two tours in Iraq and medically retired because of his PTSD. My father would never fight police and he did anything and everything for people; he would give you the shirt off his back if that's what it took. The articles in Mississippi news have slandered and made my father out to be a monster but he wasn‚Äôt. Any legal advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
I told this landlord I wanted the apartment and she took it off the market for approxamitely 2 weeks. The rent is 1100 a month and I gave her my security deposit of that much. I changed my mind about moving in as I found a cheaper option and I would have had to double rent for a month and a half. Is there any legal way to get my deposit back or have I lost the  money? This is all happening in missouri.  This was the email my potential landlord sent:  Not only have you wasted my time but you‚Äôve cost me income. You did not take responsibility to know when your current lease ended. On July 11th when asked in writing, you confirmed you DID want to take possession on July 15th as previously agreed to verbally. On July 12th you informed me you don‚Äôt. Your current lease termination date should have been considered before you committed to take possession of my apartment July 15th when you gave me your deposit on June 29th. The unit was available July 1st and I compromised and split the month with you. From June 29th to July 12th, you still have not provided the requested information to complete your application.  I have now lost, at the least, one month‚Äôs full rent of $1,100. I‚Äôve paid for two background checks at $25 each due to the information you provided for your social security number was incorrect. Both of our time is valuable and I‚Äôve spent at least 8 hours dealing with this issue. All totaled I‚Äôm out, at least, $1,150 and I need to begin the entire process over.  For the above reasons, your deposit is forfeited.   This email is accurate, except the listing was off for 14 days, not a month.  Thanks for any insight.	No
"I work for a small company doing manual labor. For the sake of keeping this somewhat private for now, we will say I do lawn maintenance although what I actually do is specific to the area I live and is in high demand. I started working for the company about a year ago. My boss (owner of the company) hired me to fill in for someone who had recently been fired, and him and I (as his helper) were the entire company. I started at $10/hr. As time progressed, i took on more responsibility and after about 4 or 5 months, started doing nearly 100% of the work by myself. My boss then hired a worker to be my helper, and began more of a role that consisted more of doing estimates and taking phone calls. He is not a super presentable guy, though he is very friendly, he's just kind of got this very country/hillbilly vibe about him. Ever since I started working with him, business has been growing substantially faster than it did in the previous 2 years of him owning the company. business is now stronger than ever, and i am being worked to the bone in the summer heat every day using and depending on equipment that is far beyond being in need of repair. It has gotten frustrating to be in charge of everything, (working my *** off), and maintaining to represent the company to the best of my ability, all while making $12/hour on jobs that bring company $2,000-$3000 profit every two days.   This being said, I learned a few months ago that my boss had taken my social security number that he made a copy of when I first started working for him to make me an LLC, unannounced to me. This also included filing a ""workers compensation exemption form"" on my behalf for me. The worker who is my helper is also filed on that llc as my employer/subcontractor (not sure which)I do like my boss, and don't really mind the work if it was for more money, I just feel underpaid for the major role I play in the company.   For the past few months I've been saving and working towards gathering all materials I need to begin doing jobs myself (trailer, about $2000 worth of equipment). I now have almost everything I need, and am only short of getting my own business liability insurance and business license to have everything complete.   My question is, how would you approach the situation if you were in my position? I do like my boss and wouldn't mind continuing to subcontract for his company. However, I'm not sure how he will handle the news that I may become his competition. The way I see it- For the entire length of employment with this company, I have been miscatagorized as a subcontractor. I am now doing what is necisarry for me to actually be subcontracted by him (or another company in the same field.. 2 of which have offered to pay me more than double what my current boss does, but those two company's were both under the impression at the time that the equipment I had with me was all mine when it was actually my current bosses). An arrangement where I help to train my worker to fill my position while my own business picks up seems ideal to me, but am I being too hopeful thinking he would continue to employ me when he knows I'm going to give him competition on my own? I know he is going to feel betrayed and tell me it's a bad idea etc. I'm just trying to think of the best way to present it to him so that the process that both he and I will soon undergo is relatively seamless. I feel like we could both still help each other to an extent, I'm just not sure how to phrase it."	No
"This happened last Friday. I want to believe that I'm worrying over nothing, but just to be sure I thought I should ask for some advice here.   **Background:** I am a university student and have lived in this apartment for 1 year with three roommates. The three roommates also lived there the year before that (I took the place of someone who moved out). We have had cockroaches for the past year at varying degrees of disgusting. Two years ago, my three roommates said that there were some but they made efforts to be clean to keep the bugs to a minimum. I moved in last summer and the heat brought them back at full force. The landlord had my apartment fumigated (as well as several others) before school started and that helped with some of the problem. Now as you can imagine, since the exterminators only locally treated several apartments, the cockroaches were gone for a bit but came back soon enough. I believe that she would have had to tent the whole place to really fix the problem. As a poor college student I decided to just keep the place clean and not move out and break my lease and deal with the bugs as they came, and this worked for most of the year. The landlord also fumigated the place at the end of the school year (this past June) but again, that only solved the problem temporarily and we still see bugs occasionally.   **The problem:** My apartment was being shown to potential new tenants and the landlord was there with them. At the end of the trip this dialogue occurred:  Me: ""Are you guys looking at this apartment?""  Them: ""No, not this one.""   Me: ""Well just to let you know, but the first floor has cockroaches.""   The landlord came back with someone after they had gone (a higher up?). The higher up (HU) told me that what I did was illegal because the entire first floor does not have cockroaches, only this place. I disagree with this because I did not say the entire first floor has bugs, I just said there were bugs. It would be foolish to assume bugs are localized to my apartment only because that's not how bugs work. I know that other places were treated for the bugs and I have a friend on the fourth floor who also says he has bugs. In any case, the HU told me to not do that again, and that they would come into my apartment on Monday to check for ""cleanliness.""   **My question:** Am I going to get sued? Are they going to try to say that my apartment is the only one with the problem and they're going to take away my security deposit? I truly think I didn't say anything patently false and I know that CA residents have a lot of rights as renters, but I just want to know what I'm up against for the rental company. Also, if it helps I'm moving out at the end of August for other reasons, so I won't have to deal with this landlord ever again soon."	No
Hello. Our Landlord is attempting to give us 60 days notice to vacate when we are only 2 months into a 12 month lease. We know that by law they cannot do this. The landlord seems to have figured this out as well because they have sent us a series of emails where they go back and forth between saying they are applying to the Board to have us evicted to then begging us to leave so they can move back. Should we file a T2 against her for interfering with Tenant Rights?  Is there any order we can get from the Police that can tell them to stop harassing us and contacting us or showing up for reasons other than necessary as a Landlord/Property owner? Or are we screwed because they are the owner? Thanks!	No
"My girlfriend and I signed a lease a few months ago with an apartment place/corporation and then realized the next day that we rushed into it too quickly and wanted out since we couldn't afford it. We went back two days later and filled out paperwork and paid a fee for releasing to put us on a list so that they could give our room to people after they filled their empty rooms. Long story short, they still have empty rooms and ours isn't filled and we can't find anyone to fill it, and probably won't before the move-in date. Our parents never signed any guarantor paperwork that was sent to them. The people working at this place said that since they don't have guarantor information from us we won't be allowed to move into the place, but we are expected to pay rent for it. Does this make sense? I am afraid of us having an eviction on our credit but we simply can't afford this place. It doesn't seem fair. If anyone could give me some insight or a little advice that would be appreciated. I don't know what else to do, we've spoken to lawyers and were basically told ""you've made some mistakes."" Clearly. Anyway, sorry for the rambling. Thank you."	No
Renting an apartment. My lease ends at the end of this month. Since I didn't give them 30 days notice that I'm vacating at the end of my lease (which seems ridiculous, but fine) I'm having to forfeit my deposit and pay a cleaning fee, which you would normally only pay if you did a poor cleaning job. My question is: If I'm paying the cleaning fee anyway, do I still need to leave it spotless? I'm not going to trash the place or anything, it's already pretty clean, but my parents think I shouldn't even wipe off the counters (they're kind of vindictive like that though).   Basically, if they're already going to charge me for cleaning, are they going to be able to charge me more if I leave them something to clean?  If there's a better place to ask this, please let me know. I searched for similar topics and they all led here, so here's where I posted.  (Before everyone downvotes me for being an asshole, I AM going to clean the apartment. I'm mainly just wondering if my parents would have ground to stand on if they were in my place and didn't.)	No
[TL;DR I have an assumed bench warrant out for my arrest because I failed to show up for an out of state court summons. I was offered a chance to pay a fine after I emailed the Colorado DA but couldn't afford it at the time. Now that I'm wanting to go back to Co, I need to figure out if I even have a bench warrant or anything to pay]  I'm from California and have (had?) a bench warrant out for an unfortunate event that I was ticketed for in Breckenridge, Colorado. I got the the ticket about six years ago and have never taken care of it because I thought I would never be going back to Co.. that is, until a month ago. I was just curious if bench warrants expire after a certain amount of time? I'd like to get this taken care but was curious to know if there'd be anything to even take care of any more. I googled whether or not b.w's expire and I read that after 180 days they fall off, is this true? IF they don't, I'd like to take care of it and was wondering what the best way to do that would be.   For the backstory: A close friend and I were snowboarding and were riding down a groomed trail when we (stupidly) got the urge to ride down an unmarked section. There was a big gap in the boundary line so we veered off and started down some back country. It wasn't anything insane, just a densely packed forested area with some pretty heavy powder. We ended up going a long way down and basically got stuck as there were no trails or roads at the bottom and going all the way back up in heavy boots was impossible because of how deep the snow was. Finally got a hold of ski patrol who managed to find us from a service road which was literally about 100 feet away.. just couldn't see it from our vantage point (face palm of the century). Shouldn't have happened to begin with though and I certainly learned my lesson.  Ski patrol and police were obviously not very enthused with our decision and we were promptly issued with a summons for a court date set for a few months later. I ended up sending an email to the DA asking if there was anything that could be done so that I didn't have to go all the way back to Colorado and he basically extended an opportunity to just pay a fine (somewhere around $400 I believe). However, I was young and didn't have that kind of money at the time and after a while, just decided to not pay it as I chalked it up to not ever having to go back to Colorado again. Now that I actually want to, I'm worried that I could get arrested on the off-chance I get my id checked. Regardless, I'd like to handle things now that I can afford to pay the fine (if that would still even be an option).  Apologies about the novel, just wanted to be clear. Format might also be messed up because of mobile	No
I filed this patent with her in September of 2015. I have tried everything I can to reach her. As of recently I received a mass email from her law firm stating that they have new contact information. Something seems off and feels like they are covering something especially due to the way the email was written and phrased. I just want my patents out of this hole.	No
"I made an offer on a house on Friday (in Virginia, USA) that was accepted Sunday. The seller stipulated that the fireplace and flue came as is. The inspection came back last night and the interior fireplace is fine, but the chimney itself moves when pushed.  Is the chimney legally considered the fireplace? I've already followed up with my realtor and mortgage guy about it to be like ""what do we do"" but figured I would check here too. Common sense makes me think it is, but common sense doesn't apply in legal/real estate stuff all the time, and having to specifically stipulate the fireplace and flue separately makes me wonder if it's done piecemeal and the chimney is its own separate entity.  Thanks for any help you can offer!"	No
"I've been eating at a particular Carl's Jr restaurant. I am always greeted in the drive-thru with an immediate promotion, which I have to decline politely, before I get a chance to speak and order what I actually want. After my order is taken, the employee will always prompt me with an upsell, ""add a cookie for just a dollar?"" or something similar. However recently I noticed one employee was automatically increasing my combo to a medium, which costs more than the regular small size. At first I let it go. But today I decided to order inside at the counter. I recognized the employee as the same one that took my drive-thru order last time. As soon as I stated which combo I wanted, she automatically reached for the medium-sized soda cup and that's when I had enough. I pushed it back and told her that I didn't ask for medium, to please give me regular size.  I was very annoyed by this type of slimmy sales tactic--I wish I caught it on video (next time I visit, I will record with my mobile). Is this illegal? Can fast-food employees try to slip a fast one on me without first asking if I want the bigger size combo? I can only imagine how many people didn't notice and paid more without knowing, or guys like me who noticed it right away and now have to deal with this pushy sales trick all the time.  Is it worth writing an email to Carl's Jr. complaint department? Should I catch this on camera?"	No

Am I entitled to a copy of a trust in the state of Arizona? I am a beneficiary of my grandfathers will and the trustees claim that I am not entitled to any paperwork, including the trust. Thinking of hiring an attorney if they do not provide these documents.

"They keep saying I signed contracts and are giving a date from over a year ago which is before any of this even happened. I asked for proof of this debt, then they hung up on me. Afterwards I called back and they are saying I need to pay the balance in full, or they will be filing court papers on Friday to put a lien for the balance on my house. I kept being hung up on and then transferred to some other guy, who then claimed they weren't a ""debt"" collector and they were only hired to put a lien on my house, despite the last girl asking for payment and payment arrangements. Since these people obviously are doing the typical debt collector thing, I don't know what I can or should do, outside of maybe mailing a letter disputing the debt, even though they claim they aren't a debt collector (They are)  The house is in DE, but I live in a different state"	No
Just like the title says. I have a recurring payment the first of every month to have money automatically taken out to pay rent. However, for some reason it was not taken out yesterday and now the apartment wants me to pay a late fee. I dont plan on paying that fee since it was the complex's system that did not take money out. However I am worried about them threatening the lease if I dont pay the late fee. What can I do?	No
We are a business in Idaho and had a customer from Utah call to purchase a $2,000 computer system from us. We had to have the item shipped next day air via UPS to them and they made a payment via Visa credit card over the phone.   About 2 months later we received a call from a lady asking us why we  charged her card for $2,200 and we explained the situation. Today, about 2 weeks after the phone call from the lady, we noticed that Visa had pulled back the funds and when we called they explained that it was because the purchase was fraudulent.  Are we really on the hook, because either Visa, or that lady's secitlrity was bad? What do we do in this situation?	No
I was caught by a speed gun going 85 mph in a 55 mph zone, after the fine was payed I was told by my fathers legal adviser to plead not guilty and to fight for a lower punishment. What steps can I take to not make myself look like an idiot. Here is what I have noted so far: * I was in a 55 Mph zone * I have driven over 10000 miles since I got my car this fall, driving to soccer practice for the school, for my soccer club that is an hour away, school , work, games, leisure.  * Driving for me is a daily task, and to be able to accomplish the things I need to do at this time in my life (Soccer identification camps, touring colleges, work, odds and ends) I need to drive because of my parents work schedule. * The car I was pulled over in was not my vehicle, it was my ex-girlfriends, it was a newer, better accelerating car.  *I am not saying I had a justified reason for speeding, I am cut and dry guilty, but I had SAT's in the morning and I was driving home from a late soccer game, I wasn't thinking right and I just wanted to get home.  That is all I have for now, can I get advice on whether this useful information, and what else I can add. Any advice is appreciated.	No
So we're in a conflict with my neighbor. There is a tree on his property but all the branches grow out on our side and it leaks sap all over ours cars in the driveway. They're constantly covered in thick sap. Asked him to cut it down he said no. So my plan is to cut all the branches that hang over my property line. I'm going to sheer all the limbs off tomorrow. Is that against the law?  Thanx in advance for any advice.	No
"1.	We are in a rental agreement with a roommate on a apartment. We pay rent on time every month to other roommate who pays the rent. For the past couple month‚Äôs roommate has not told us about other fees such as electricity, gas, internet, water etc. So we have just been paying our half of the rent and that‚Äôs it. Because we are renting and have signed a contract with a landlord, we pay our rent. Well our time is coming to a close with this roommate and just to make sure could he bring legal action against us for the fees from the apartment. Just to make it clear we are and still paying our rent, this question is for the fees that come with a apartment, but is not included in our lease with our landlord.    2.	Interview with a company. Had 2 great interview and constantly told the entire time that I am being considered. Even told last week that I am high on the candidate list. Well I didn‚Äôt get the job. I was wondering if I write a review on a website could the company come after me? Also is there any option to report this company for doing this to me and other people.   Thanks again. Hope these are stupid questions"	No
Hi all! If I was parked in a parking lot and I open my door as another person drives into the spot next to me (fairly quickly) and my door creates a deep dent in his bumper, who is at fault?   We're currently trying to settle this through cash and haven't notified out insurance agencies, but I feel like it might not have been my fault.   I do recognize that I erred in not checking to make sure it was completely clear next to me before opening my door, but I would think that a pedestrian getting out of a car would take precedence over a vehicle driving into a spot, no?   This is my first time in an accident so I could be ignorant.	No
"As a preface to this story I drive a truck for the nation's largest retailer and they pay me very good (six figures good).   I was on my off day and took an out of town trip with my wife and kids in the family minivan. We started to approach the small town of Uniontown AL and I was immediately pulled over by a police officer (he passed me going the opposite direction then proceeded to do a unturn to get behind me). I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam.   I know the obvious answer is to ""lawyer up"" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well?   And to revisit my beginning statement where I drive truck for the nation's largest retailer... They will not tolerate a serious violation on my mvr. So I'm possibly facing a $100,000/yr job loss. Who knows, they might be understanding and give me a slap on the wrist but either way I'm scared!   Where do I go from here?"	No
This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	No
Good Morning r/legaladvice!  I am looking for a little clarity on what exactly my options are in this situation.  I moved in April of 2016 with a roommate. I gave my roommate money, and they wrote the checks to my landlord/property management company. About 2 months after moving in, my roommate moves out, then another month after that my landlord switches property maintenance companies.  Earlier this month my landlord comes to me, with my security deposit check in hand, telling me I need to pay the security deposit. I told him to deposit the check we gave him at the time. Which he refused to do.  I guess my questions is what are my options, while I am not opposed to paying a security deposit to him, I want it to be fair. I have already payed it to my previous roommate so I feel I am being screwed out of extra money.  Any advice, even if its not in my favor would be helpful.  Thanks again	No
I just closed on my house in May. Between my house and my neighbors house is, what we were told by the neighbors, a strip of land owned by the town and a dock owned by the town and shared by two of the guys down the street. Over the weekend, one of the neighbors let it slip that we might actually have the deed rights to both the land and the dock. My SO and I researched and found a dock parcel number, my deed that has noted 2 different lot numbers (but on two different maps so we think it may be our lot number on each map. We can't find the second map online), and a legal notice of release of an easement somewhere on our street back to the original owner but when I google the coordinates I can't really find it's exact location and when I google the block and lot it comes up with a home on the other end of our street. Googling for 2 days has returned absolutely nothing concrete and I have no idea what to do now. Who can I call to find out? How was this missed by my attorney and real estate agent in the first place? Do I need to hire a new lawyer? I tried checking my county records but, again, hasn't led to anything solid. Any and all ideas are welcomed. Thank you!	No
I drank yesterday and while drunk cut myself because I was mad at my landlord for yelling at me to clean the bathroom. I live in this house with 6 other women, and they were bitching about me not cleaning the bathroom. I don't even fucking take showers, and they're saying the hair in the shower drain is mine. It's not even the right color. Because of that, my landlord now says I need to keep my bedroom door open. That's fucked up. Can she legally do that?	No
Hey all, sorry if this is worded poorly I'm writting this pretty shaken up.  A year ago I signed a contract for a room for rent that basically said that I have to give her 30 days notice if I want to move out, that if there is damage done to anything in the room I wouldn't get my security deposit, and that I'd pay rent on time. She made copies of my ID and the contract, got some info from me (where I worked, who to call if I die) and I moved in.   A few weeks ago she went absolutely insane. I'm assuming she's always had a problem but something set her off. I have had the police at my door many times. Without saying too much just know she has paranoid delusions and I do not fee safe here at all.   Here's the legal part: I have no money. I want to get out as soon as humanly possible. If I just packed up my things and left tomorrow, what are the odds I'd face any repercussions? She would have my security deposit (which is the price of rent) but she may end up deeming something damaged.  Sorry if this is a stupid question. I don't know anything. Please help.	No
My fianc√©e and I rent a house in Vermont (if that matters) from her grandfather who owns the house. It's all legal, we have a signed lease etc. we've been here 1 year with nothing go wrong or any mishaps or damage, and have a good relationship with the landlord. We pay our rent and bills on time every month, etc.  we've had one of my friends sleep here 3 nights total over the past month, once each weekend. Anyway, our landlords wife (Fianc√©e's grandmother) was very upset about my friend sleeping in here and subtely threatened evicting us. Are there any grounds for this? Aren't I allowed to have a friend sleep here every now and again? He was quiet and respectful and didn't cause any damage or cause any trouble.  And just to clarify, this is not a regular thing and won't become a regular thing.	No
"I am 30 years old. I have Autism, Gastritis, IBS, Crohn's, UC, have a permanent lower spine injury and need a cane to be mobile.  I also live in Indiana.  I live with my father, because I cannot get a job. My only income is Social Security Disability. I pay a majority of the bills in this house. Electric, TV, Internet, help with groceries, help with chores, i've bailed my father out of financial troubles several times.  He and I are fighting, and he keeps threatening to make us ""part ways,"" or kick me out of the only home I've known on a regular basis and I believe this time he's serious. The man is ex-military and has intimate knowledge of unarmed combat techniques, and therefore i am in a real and present fear of him getting physical with me instead of the verbal abuse i usually get.  This man expects me, a person who can hardly be on his feet for longer than 20 minutes at a time to do ALL the housework and refuses to clean up after himself, even though he has a job, that is no fucking excuse to refuse to help with your own living space.   I have a very sensitive digestive system and have to eat different food than him to prevent flareups of my gastric diseases that can leave me bedridden for a day or more, screaming in agony. That means I also have to buy separate food from him.  I only get $730 a month, and by the time my share of the bills are paid, i hardly have any money for myself.  My cousin recently moved out and left behind his things because he had nowhere to store them, and my father has attempted to sell them off for money.

I've got nobody I can turn to, so I'm asking r/legaladvice for assistance in what I can do to protect myself from a vengeful asshole dad. I need to know what kind of laws are on the books to protect myself with from him and his bullshit. I have nowhere I can go. I have nobody I can go to for help."	No
My water bill went up $150 after the landlord sent someone out to power wash the house. I am responsible for the water bill, but the lease doesn't say anything about power washing. I called the leasing office and they basically said there is nothing they will do because there is no proof the increased bill is due to the power washing, but our bill has never been this high in the year and a half that we have lived here. My husband wants me to call a lawyer, but do we even have a case here? I'm not sure what to do at this point because we just can't afford this right now.	No

So I feel like a total idiot, but it has already been done. A couple months ago I had a guy ask tons of questions about a smartphone I was selling, and I answered. After some back and forth he bought it. Once he had received it, he said the Sprint SIM card he had would not work. He formally requested a refund through eBay, then opened a case against me for 'product different from the advertised product'. I was exasperated after he asked me to act as tech support, and I had tried, with no results. I refunded him. He never sent it back.  PayPal and eBay both tell me I shouldn't have refunded it, but the case against me made it sound like I had to refund quickly. I feel like an 80 yr old with her first computer to fall for whatever scam it was.   They also say to report it to my local police. I keep putting it off because I see no hope in doing so. Does anyone know if the police in Iowa could do anything? Thanks for your time.	No
Is there any legallity to his rule? He will not allow a window or porable unit. He pays the electric for all the units in the building and claims its too expensive for us to run ACs.	No
Hey guys, I was hit and run over by a car and I need advice on the next step. My insurance as well as the insurance provider of the person driver have all been contacted. Today I received a call from my rep that insurance of the driver is not admitting full fault and will not cover full replacement of my bike (it was totaled).  So, my rep mentioned I need to hire a lawyer to take driver to small claims court OR convince the driver's rep to back down and take responsibility in full (my insurance sides with me 100%).  MAIN QUESTION: Should I contact the driver directly (I have her info) and give her a heads up that I'm moving this to small claims court in an effort to have her convince her rep to take full responsibility so she avoids court? Or is that not kosher/illegal?  Thanks!	No
"I've lived in the same two bedroom apartment with the same roommate since August, 2014.  In that entire time, there has been no real legal relationship between myself and the roommate, we each dealt individually with landlord (/management company) and individually paid 50% of the rent.   In May of this year, the owner decided to change management company.  All in all, that's been for the best- they're actually cleaning the place up a bit, removing some problem tenants.  But as they were taking over, I get a call from the new agent.  Apparently, he said, they had no lease for my unit and so needed to get one on file. And hence the problem starts.  I should have been due to renew (or not) at the end of August, and had been considering leaving to move somewhere closer to where I'm now going to school.  But then this happened in May, and with no lease I was made to feel as though my choice was either sign a new year-long lease or else move on very short notice (which would have been a significant financial hardship).  So I signed and told roommate that he would need to talk to them as well (as they had nothing on paper for either of us).   Between May and now, things continued as normal- we each continued to pay half the rent and there were no issues.    End of July, roommate does tell me he plans to move out in the near future, as he's moving jobs.  Doesn't seem like a big deal, he gives me plenty of notice and makes it seem more like something that will just be ""eventually"".  Today I get a message from leasing agent, informing me that my roommate has moved out (news to me- our schedules are pretty opposite, so I rarely see him, but his stuff is all still here), hadn't paid for August (rent due 1st each month) and I have a week to pay the other half.  As it turns out, between May and now, he somehow managed to avoid signing a new lease, just continuing to live here and paying 50% of the rent, but with nothing on paper.  Needless to say, I'm a bit annoyed that he did this, thus enabling him to just leave as well as annoyed with the leasing agency for allowing this.   The silver lining is that I do now live alone, which I was a change I was wanting to make, and I knew it was coming, but expected some degree of sufficient notice before my rent doubles overnight.  I knew I'd be able to manage the rent when he did eventually leave, and should be just able to deal with his half for this month (that I've been given a week to cover- does ""end of next week"" mean Friday or Saturday?).  But I'm left with a few questions.  Do I have any recourse against roommate.  With nothing on paper, it seems like it would be a difficult case to make.  Physical presence (or lack thereof) notwithstanding, I would consider him to have lived here at the start of August and to be continuing to live here (as personal possessions of his still occupy the apartment).  Any chance I could force him to at least pay August (or pay it myself and recover later)?  With regard to those possessions- On paper, this is now (and apparently has been since May) solely MY apartment.  What rights and obligations do I have to allow roommate to enter to collect his belongings? Presumably he still has a key.  The door actually has two locks- one we always used and both have keys for, one which we never used and he does not have a key.  Suppose I began using that other lock, thus preventing him from entering without my presence and consent?  Would that create any problems?  Is there any point at which I can consider property left behind to be abandoned and dispose of it as I see fit?"	No
"All,  I apologize if this is the wrong section to ask this question, but I felt like this was the most appropriate place since many of you have probably dealt with something like this in the past.  I have a friend that is currently living with me in a condominium I own, and he is not on a lease. At the end of the month, he is leaving to go live on his own with his girlfriend, but I am at a point now where I just want to end the tenure. For the past six or so months, his girlfriend has been basically living here not paying any bills, and giving a stressful passive aggressive attitude almost like being entitled to live here. I've brought it up a few times and we've mutually agreed on a few things like cleaning around the house, but I am at a breaking point since the attitude doesn't stop. Because of this, we mutually agreed to end the living situation based on the aforementioned timeline starting on September 1st.  A few days ago, I had a talk with him since he agreed to pay me a bit extra since she would ""officially"" be moving in for the month of August as a transition period from her lease ending to when their new lease starts on September 1st. The problem is, the passive aggressiveness is not stopping and now she is causing damage to one of my vehicles. I have a car in my parking garage that she has started parking next to and for the past three days, there have been three brand new, fresh, black door ding parks on my passenger side rear quarter panel. I know every mark on that car and I barely drive the vehicle, so I know it is her.  My question is, so I have a legal basis to kick them out regardless of the reason if there isn't a lease in place? Since I physically own the property, am I able to just ask them to leave and if they don't, it is considered trespassing? For what it's worth, I am located in Texas."	No
"I'll try to be as brief as possible.  It's my senior year. My school is trying to make me get on a mandatory meal plan. They changed to a new provider with a new requirement that all students purchase it (it makes the school money). I already lived off campus so I could cook my food and because of my mental health am not always able to go to a huge dining hall with hundreds of other people every single time I want to eat. I would just eat at home but I can't both pay for the plan and buy food.   I have anxiety and depression as diagnosed by a medical professional. The school knows this and has known it for three years because they give me accommodations.  When I spoke with a woman in the accessibility office (who has not answered any of my questions in a timely or complete manner), she told me there is no longer a medical meal plan option and that students who used to have one would have to work with the dining company in the first week of school to work out a good solution. I know for a fact that since my refusal is rooted in a health issue this could be breaking HIPAA among other things (please let me know). It smells really illegal and discriminatory.   Does the Americans with disabilities act make it illegal to force me to go to the dining hall? Title 9? What legal language should I use? Interested in any and all suggestions.  One girl said the school wouldn't help her until she used the words ""eating disorder"" so I'm thinking about trying that. But I still have a diagnosed mental illness and can get a medical professional to request accommodations accordingly, so it still feels like they should not be able to sweep me under the rug legally even though my illness' connection to food might fall in a grey area according to some people.   Please help me fight my school that only cares about my money and not my health. I'm mad."	No
"TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.  First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.  Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.    The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.  Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays.   Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?"	No
I have a petty misdemeanor for shoplifting in New Mexico from 4 years ago. I left the state without dealing with it and now I'm living in Colorado. I finally have my shit together and I want to resolve this but have no idea what I'm doing. I looked into it and obviously I have a warrant for not appearing in court. I talked to a criminal lawyer in Albuquerque and he would charge 1000 to represent me and would first file a motion to quash the warrant.   So I'm wondering if this would be my best option or is there some way I can deal with this myself without having to get an attorney? Maybe a public defender? I'd like to not have this on my record but I'm mainly worried about this warrant. I'm currently trying to find an apartment in Colorado and I feel like this is definitely going to cause problems when I start applying. As it is I don't have very much money so paying an attorney 1000 on top of whatever other costs I'll have is going to be hard. Should I call the Albuquerque court house and try to deal with this myself or will that just make things worse? Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.	No
"Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.   As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her.   I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked.   When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me.   Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes.   and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record.   There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.  Thank you. TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it."	No
"So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I'm in a relationship with this person. So yeh this is your typical, revenge porn or nonconsensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	No
I just got caught going 108 in a 75 on a deserted highway in Colorado; just under the 40mph cutoff. I read that it carries a six point penalty on the license, which is fine, but being unfamiliar with the law in Colorado I was wondering if anyone knew what I could expect at my court date in Burlington; or if there is any way I can avoid traveling back to appear (I'm from the east coast). Are they typically lenient with out of state drivers? Is there anything specific I should say to the judge? Where I'm from the court will virtually always plea it down to something else. Is that how it works out here as well? Do I face jail time? I have some money, but not a lot, and the plane fare both ways is going to kill me this year.	No
My friend had his parole transferred from another state to VA and is two months out on a 3 year parole after a lengthy prison sentence. His sister was supportive all through his sentence and offered to have him come live with her. Turns out his sister is a raging alcoholic, and her boyfriend who also live with them is an active junkie (my friend found him ODing in the kitchen one night). The sister and her bf fight nonstop keeping my buddy up all night when he has to work the next day (thankfully he found a decent job in the service industry). One night after asking them to keep it down at 4 a.m. the sister pushed my friend, hit him, and threatened to call his PO on him.  Now, the friend obviously wants out, he did not expect to be thrown into this hellhole, nor does he want to violate his parole, yet he is afraid to tell his PO the situation thinking they will throw him in a shelter (I believe the shelter here has a 10pm curfew which would cause him to lose his job). Nor does he want to live in a shelter.   I think he should just tell his PO everything, but will they actually throw him in a shelter, or are they more flexible than that. What does he do when living at the place his parole dictates can violate his parole. If anyone familiar with the system can give their best two cents that would be awesome.	No
I think some lawyer would benefited just to follow me around. Seriously. I have a series of bad luck despite of trying to be very positive. Just this week alone: 1. The president of a dumpster company trespasses my property. I complained to his worker previously but have no intention to pursue it. He took pictures and denied that his worker broke the driveway. He's going to call another expert into my property even after I said he's trespassing. I have the before and after drivrway pictures btw. His company worth 1 million and the damage only worth a few hundreds bucks. Lol.. 2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up. 3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out. 4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools..  5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it. I've dealt with many more.. IRS double charge mistake (1 year to resolve), real estate agent knowingly sold a property with many violations (didn't disclose mold, structural, etc and inspector was her brother), etc.  Disclosures: Not sue happy, PhD in science,  just wonder what the heck life at 1 am..

"My landlord set up posters mentioning they were doing ""green"" upgrades to apartments throughout the week for things like LED bulbs and eco shower heads. I originally thought these were optional, opt-in upgrades but it turns out they were ""required"".  I came home to find two people from another company replaced things in my apartment to make it more eco friendly. Don't get me wrong, I would have loved the eco products installed. But I had no idea they were coming or that they entered until after the fact.   Now, technically my landlord sent an email telling me the day they were going to come in. I disregarded it since I thought it was optional, but noticed it wasn't when I went an read the email.   Even though they gave 48hr notice, the Chicago RLTO https://chicagocode.org/5/5-12/ under 5-12-050 specifically lists reasons a Landlord may enter, and the eco upgrades aren't covered under any of them.  Do I have a case? My understanding is I have potential relief of two-months rent or contract termination. But maybe I don't fully understand that section."	No
I am currently in the process of buying a new home from a builder. When we first started the process, they told us that there were incentives to go with their preferred lender. For example, some incentives were a free separate tub and shower, $5000 in studio upgrades, and a couple of other smaller items. I along with a family friend who works with home loans thoroughly read through the contract, we could not find where these incentives are tied to the preferred lender. Both the lender and the salesman have told us since the beginning have told us that these incentives were tied with the preferred lender so if we didn't go with the preferred lender, we would lose the incentives. I am sure they have also told others this and it does not seem to be true after reading the contract. This may have kept us along with many other home buyers from getting the best deal on their mortgage. Would there be any grounds to sue here? If so, what would the next steps in the process be? Any information is appreciated. Thanks.	No
So my situation is this, my family ( me my wife my 5yr old 3yr old and 10 month old) were renting a house with no signed lease whatsoever. Numerous issues came up with home, downed rain gutters, broken retraining wall off porch and mainly squirrels living in ceiling all of which landlord did not fix. Ssooo I decided to pack up and leave without giving him any notice and now today he showed up at my job demanding to talk to me. Is there any legal recourse he can take???And if he continues to come to my work is that grounds for harassment??	No
Hello! I'll try to keep this short.      I live with 3 roommates in an apartment in Brooklyn, on the bottom floor of a 2-apartment building. 2 months ago, the tenants above us all moved out.     A week later, we started waking up every morning to our apartment shaking, with all manner of pounding above us. We received no notice of construction of renovation.     We tried to get in touch with our landlords for an entire month with ZERO response. The dust in the building's hallway and foyer was insane. My roommate had to get an inhaler. The old floorboards were temporarily stored right next to our apartment in a garage, and vermin from their floorboards entered our apartment.  After a month, our landlords, a husband and wife team who own many properties in NYC, finally get back to us with no apologies, explaining that the apartment is being renovated for the owner of a local design firm that moved into our neighborhood recently. They explained their absence with their daughter being in the hospital and tried to guilt-trip us.     They had their workers patch up gaps around our steam pipes (where most of the debris was falling in) and promise to keep things cleaner. (It is cleaner, but there is still quite a bit of dust and debris.)      Since then, we've had a massive hole punctured into my roommate's ceiling, a water pipe break above us and leak all over our apartment, a power outage, and debris falling in almost everyday -- even after the repairs. The workers upstairs have responded fairly quickly to these issues, but there is a new issue constantly. Debris is still falling in spite of their fixes.      [Here are some photos.](http://imgur.com/a/CGIp3)      We have not been offered any apologies or compensation. In fact, our landlords are rude and dismissive and act like they're only causing minor inconvenience for us that we're blowing out of proportion. After the ceiling puncture, our landlord verbally offered us the option of ending our lease 1 month early (August 30th), which we accepted. This has not been confirmed on paper.      I checked the Department of Buildings records, and they do NOT have a permit to be doing these renovations.      I currently have a complaint with 311 that has been open for 3 weeks.      Do we have any legal recourse? We would like to get back the rent we've been paying since construction started at the beginning of June. We are planning to look for a pro bono lawyer, but would like to have a better idea of what our legal options are.      Thanks in advance for any help/guidance!	No
Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.  When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay.   My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!	No
I started to work with a startup 3 months ago. They wanted to know my hourly charge and how many hours I am going to work in a week. Then they said they need the app asap, because they are going to release their product within 2/3 months. So I worked overtime and made the app almost usable (according to other fellow devs) within 2 and half months. Now when I asked for my overtime payment, they clearly denied my payment. They did not pay me 3 weeks payment. They did not pay me overtime payments. Then they stopped to communicate with me. Removed me from slack. No reply to my emails. How should I deal with this situation ? I am working as an hourly freelancer from India. This startup is Brooklyn, NY based startup.	No
"I was arrested approx. 12 months ago due to DUI. However, I blew barely above the legal limit, and only failed the field sobriety test because it was extremely cold outside and I was shivering, something the officer noted in the police report. On my court date, the cold, along with discovery that the breathalyzer was far past calibration date resulted in the DUI being dropped and I received a ""Failure to Reduce Speed"" charge. As my lawyer explained it, this was very good because usually if the DUI gets dropped, which is rare, you receive a Reckless Driving. Regardless, my license was suspended due to the DMV being a separate entity as I understand it. My question now is, I've now graduated college and am applying for serious jobs that inquire about previous arrests and such. Is there a particular way to go about explaining what happened? I will definitely seek legal advice in person ASAP, was just curious what Reddit would advise. Thanks!"	No
Hi. I went to Miami with a girl, and had her sign an electronic contract that we were splitting all costs. Total came to $507 for the trip. This included festival tickets, rental car, gasoline, lodging, and parking fees. I paid for all pre-trip because I get good deals on things if I do. I have texts also backing up that we agreed to split them all.   She gave me $55 before we left for Miami. When we got back, she said she was moving to Tennessee (lie, found out where she works in our local mall) and would pay me gradually as she was settled. She's sent me $65 over the course of two months, and an $50 Amazon gift card.   She blocked my number and all my social media accounts, so I contacted her boyfriend. He said he would pay me back the $, but he wants to see my messages with her from Feb - July. I have all of the messages, I never deleted them. But we were actually friends and some of them are about her selling nudes online for $ and him cheating on her. I would rather do this a legal route through small claims court, but how much is it just to file a claim? How much stress is it?	No
I currently live in Ontario with my father. As I understand tenant and landlord laws, the landlord cannot raise the rent more than once every 12 months, and only by a certain amount, and that the landlord cannot charge more for having another person move in with you.   I moved in with my father on February of this year, and since then the cooperative has raised his rent once or twice and is now attempting to raise it again. Are cooperatives allowed to do this, or are they subject to the same renter's laws as regular landlords? Do we have any recourse?	No
"California  Earlier this month, a drunk driver crashed into my parked car. My car was towed and later deemed a total loss. During the entire ordeal I was studying abroad.  It's been taking quite a while to get this sorted out. The claim has just been sent to a settlement adjustor who is hunting down the responsible party's insurance. My question is, since this is not a personal injury issue on my part, is the settlement only limited to the value of the car? Or is it possible to argue for a settlement that considers the stress of dealing with the problem while abroad, the emotional ""pain"" (for lack of a less dramatic word) of losing a prized possession, and the inconvenience of not having a car for over a month (I need to get a job for the summer, but not having a car is making that more difficult than it would have been)?   Must these negotiations take place solely through insurance, or is it possible for me to file a separate claim outside of insurance? And would I need to hire a lawyer for that?  Some supplemental information: if not already obvious, it's my first time dealing with anything car accident or insurance related. I'm a student that classifies as low income by most measures in my area.   A quick Google search indicates the responsible party comes from the family of a wealthy and powerful former city council member, so I have some trepidation in trying to negotiate as good a settlement as possible."	No
I'm finding a lot of different answers when searching for a definitive answer through google. My best guess is that it is legal unless they are under 16, in which case the vehicle must be going 25 mph or slower. Besides the overall legality of it, are their stipulations? Like a maximum speed limit, number of passengers, etc?	No
"Hey guys. The title pretty much sums it up. Here's the situation:   Smoking of any sort is not allowed in my apartment, so I smoke in my car. I don't smoke much, so I'll have a single puff in my car for about 5-7 minutes, then go back inside. We have street parking on public roads. Anyway, I guess someone complained, because then my landlord shows up from out of nowhere, and approached me in my car.   Now, where I live, weed has basically been decriminalized. At least, when you get caught with it in small amounts (all I ever carry is maybe 1g) you get something like a $100 ticket.   Anyway, my landlord approaches me, and tells me to get out of the car like he's some sort of cop. I do, and greet him. He says, ""I can have you evicted for this."" I say, ""for smoking weed?"" and he says, ""yes, the lease prohibits it."" I say, ""the lease prohibits smoking inside of the apartment."" He says, ""we'll see about that,"" and drives off.   He then sends me an email saying, ""tomorrow I will be serving you with a notice to vacate for violating the lease.""   My lease does not end until October. How is this going to play out for me?"	No
"Hello all,  I read the FAQs and still had a brief question. As the title states, I'm a Wisconsin driver that got a speeding ticket in Georgia.   The ticket is for 20 over the posted limit on an interstate, which qualifies for the ""Super Speeder"" classification in GA, according to the cop. I was not driving a vehicle that I own. I've already learned my lesson and am prepared to deal with the consequences. I have 3 main questions here:  -WI DMV site says ""No points are assessed for convictions from other states, however, the conviction is entered on the Wisconsin driver record."" I already know about the DLC and NRVC (both of which WI is not a part of), but can anyone put into simple terms what this means, mainly in reference to insurance? If it means that my insurance may be able to see this and raise the rates, it may be something that I want to work to get reduced.  -When I go to the website listed to pay and enter the information, I can see the fee. However, it says nothing about the ""Super Speeder"" fee of [I read $200, but that could be incorrect]. It's not really clear whether the additional fee is something that I'll hear about after the fact, or if that's included. Can anyone clarify that by chance?  -Has anyone else from WI gotten an out of state speeding ticket that can comment on whether it was/wasn't worth taking time off from work to go to court in hopes of getting the charge reduced?  I'm leaning towards just paying everything and being done with it, but I want to be sure I'm not setting myself up for other consequences further down the line by doing so. Any *advice* is appreciated, and I fully understand that I am only seeking advice.  Thanks!"	No
"Hi,  I live on a second floor flat in London. A few months ago we had a party and some cigarette butts were dropped over our balcony into our downstairs neighbour's garden. They were absolutely furious, we apologised, and let them know it wouldn't happen again.  This morning I received this text from our landlord:  ""Hi, I've had another email complaining about more cigarettes being thrown into the neighbours garden and this time they are about to call a solicitor and possibly confiscate the flat from me. I've spoken to the lady at the council and she says the only way to avoid the solicitor getting involved is to issue you a final warning saying if it happens again I have to evict you. I am going to put this in an email (and cc her in), I just thought I'd let you know in advance. I would strongly suggest not letting anyone smoke on the balcony at all in future as they are obviously taking the matter extremely seriously.  Thanks.""  We do not smoke and none of us have even been on the balcony in the last week. This must have been from people in one of the flats above, but they are clearly convinced it's us.  Should I be concerned? What's the best course of action?  Thanks in advance for your help."	No
So my town does angled parking spots on some streets. Town ordinance (though it's not actually posted on any signs on the streets) states you have to park head-in in the angled spots.  I was pulling out of a lot onto a 2-way street with angled spots on the right side. Before I did, the person in the angled spot immediately to the right of the lot exit I was using left the spot.   The proximity of the spot to the lot exit was such that, instead of turning right onto the street, reversing, then pulling forward head-first into the spot, it was faster/easier/safer to just pull forward and back right into the spot.  When I got out of lunch, I had 2 tickets. One for $30 for violating the head-in ordinance - that one I understand. Ignorance is no excuse, etc. However, I also had a $54 ticket for a Section 39:4-135 violation. Here's that text:  39:4-135. Parking; direction and side of street; angle parking; one-way street The operator of a vehicle shall not stop, stand or park the vehicle in a roadway other than parallel with the edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the right-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway, except as follows:  a. Upon those streets which have been designated by ordinance and have been marked or signed for angle parking, vehicles shall be parked at the angle to the curb designated and indicated by the ordinance and marks or signs.  b. Upon one-way streets, local authorities may permit parking of vehicles parallel with the left-hand edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the left-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway.  I think that violation is in error. In (a) it states only the angle of parking in reference to angled-parking ordinances. I took photos of my car, it's at the correct angle and between the space markers, it's just backed in.  What do I do here? I doubt it's worth it to fight the head-in violation since that one's pretty cut-and-dry, but the 2nd violation really seems like it's not valid. I've literally had 2 non-parking tickets in my life, one was speeding that I hired a lawyer for when I was like 17, and 1 was driving without an inspection sticker on a car I bought on eBay that same day, so I'm pretty green to this. If I plead not guilty, am I gonna have to go word-against-word with some douche traffic cop? This is also the town I live in, and it's a very quiet town with a ton of bored cops, so I'm worried that making any sort of waves is gonna mark me and my car to every cop in town forever. $54 isn't going to break my bank account or anything, but it really steams me. We literally went out for lunch, and it went from a $50 meal to a $134 meal.	No
Specifically Fairfax County, VA  Our landlord has physically lost our lease. Does this mean we can get out of it? Can someone give me some statutes to quote for the landlord? She is saying she needs to see the lease before she makes any decisions about letting us out. But she doesn't have the lease. I'm tempted to put in my 60 day notice and peace out.  Also, I have the lease but she doesn't know it. I'm not going to give it to her.	No
I‚Äôm having an issue with my neighbor and I‚Äôm educating myself before I take my next action.  I have a flag lot with a driveway leading to my house, planked on both sides by fencing from the street up to my gate.  The fences were there when I purchased the property 10+ years ago.  One property adjacent to my driveway was sold about 3 years ago.  This new neighbor recently opened up a section of the fence and excavated the ground on both of our properties and prepared for paving, to connect his driveway to mine.  If he were to succeed, it would give him a convenient loop for his driveway.  He does not have a (recorded) easement to use my land, nor did he ask permission or even notify me that he planned to do this. Attempts to communicate with him have been fruitless.  He tried this once before, not long after he moved in.  He took down the fence sections without asking. I put them back up, and sent a letter demanding him to leave the fence alone and stop trespassing.  He refused to accept the certified mail.  I recently vacated the property and put in on the market.  This latest attempt of his started a couple days after the realtor‚Äôs sign went up.  I presume he thought I moved away and would not catch him, or care, and a new owner wouldn‚Äôt know any better.  I had the sheriff come out.  He told the sheriff that the fence is his, that it‚Äôs on his land, and that he has a prescriptive easement to use my driveway.  I asked the sheriff if the neighbor had any proof and he said he had ‚Äúpaperwork from a lawyer‚Äù but no County records.  The sheriff bowed out of the situation, saying they can‚Äôt make judgement calls in such civil matters. I understand.  I‚Äôm reasonably confident that the fence is mine, and that it‚Äôs on my land.  I could get a survey done to prove it, but even if it‚Äôs mine, there is still the claim of an easement, and I would like to avoid the cost if possible.  Regardless of fence ownership, if he can prove easement on my land, he‚Äôd be allowed to cut through, I assume.  Regarding his claim of a prescriptive easement, I have some ideas and questions.  Here in California, if I understand the laws correctly, the occupant of his lot would have to use my driveway for 5 years, without permission, yet unchallenged.  Looking back using historical imagery, it‚Äôs clear that about 20 years ago an unimproved connection existed between our driveways (then the fence got built and has been there ever since).  Thus, it‚Äôs remotely possible to establish the 5-year statutory. But did that previous owner use my driveway with or without consent from my previous owner?  I don‚Äôt see how he can possibly prove it was without consent, which is a factor for the establishment of a prescriptive easement.  We‚Äôre talking about a window of time some 20-25 years ago, minimum!  The old owners from that timeframe are deceased.  I think my best angle isn‚Äôt to disprove the possible creation of a prescriptive easement, but to prove that even if one existed, it would be terminated by now.  If the owner of his lot built the fence, blocking the path, is that not a reasonably clear indication that he abandoned the easement?  If the owner of my lot built the fence, wouldn‚Äôt that then prescribe the easement back after just 5 years?  What do you all think?  Is my strategy sound?  -Mia	No
he was in the process of giving a ticket to someone else. He was in his car. I passed him and i moved over a little in my lane without crossing into the next lane. He caught up to me about a mile and a half and said he pulled me over because (unbeknownst to me you cant pass an emergency vehicle) I did not move into the next lane. Gives me a citation and sends me on my way. It 438.00. Is there anything i can do to bring it down or to argue it. I had never heard of the law before, nor do i have any tickets or accidents. Just 1 warning for speeding.	No
"My family are having issues with a trust fund set up by my father who passed away in 1998 and think we have been treated extremely unfairly for almost 20 years. This has now come to a breaking point ‚Äì the trust has informed us they no longer think we (my brother and I) are beneficiaries due to an deed which was signed by Protector rather than my father and the firm are seeking legal and tax advice on the outcome of this.  In order to tell this story right I‚Äôll section my post.   **Background:**  Relevant parties: Myself (f25), Mother (49), Brother (20), father (deceased), half-sister (no contact), half bother (no contact), my uncle who is protector (some contact but not close).  My parents were never married but had been together for 10 years. Previous to this my father was married and had two children. They divorced a few years before meeting my mother.  My father had a trust fund set up in in 1991 (before my brother and I were born but when my parents were together). My parents moved from the UK to another country were they made a life together ‚Äì owning a property together, a boat and were in the process of building another property. Around 1996 my father sold his business in the UK.  The unbuilt house, the business and the boat were all assets of the trust.  My father passed away unexpectedly back in 1998 when I was around the age of five and my brother (M20) was a few months old.   **History of the Trust:**  The 1991 Deed The trust was set up in 1991 ‚Äì the original trustees were UK residents. The trust was established by a deed of settlement and expressed to be a Guernsey law trust. The protector of the trust was appointed to my uncle.  The beneficiaries of the trust were declared: 1. The settlor (life tenant) 2. The spouse and any former spouse of the settlor 3. The children of the settlor.  Change of trustees 1991 The trustees retired in favour of a new trust to take over.  1997 Deed 1 ‚Äì Addition of my mother: My mother was added as a beneficiary.  1997 Deed 2: This introduced different terms. To pay the income of the trust to his children and my mother in equal shares until my brother reached 25, when of which all the capital will be divided between the beneficiaries.  1999 Appointment: Additions of beneficiaries and appointment of assets A deed was prepared that added myself and my brother as beneficiaries. This was due to them finding we do not come under the definition of children for the purposes of the trust or the 1997 Appointment as our parents were unmarried. This added new terms, notably allowing the discretionary distribution of income and capital before the youngest child (my brother) turned 25.  In order to be a part of this ‚Äòdeal‚Äô, my mother put my parents shared property in the trust portfolio (this is important information ‚Äì bear with me!)  Change of Trustee 2002: The trustees retired in favour of a new trust to take over. This trust remains the current trustee of the trust.  2008 Deed: Appointments of the trust fund Under the 1999 deed the trust gave my half-sister and half-brother their full amounts as they are ‚Äòlegitimate‚Äô children.   **The Problems:**  For years my family have had battles with the trust over unfair treatment. I wont go into the details of this, it‚Äôs so lengthy and an issue itself but we have asked to leave them a number of times. We were always told its not possible for any of us (Myself, Mother, Brother, Half-sister, Half-brother). We were told we would need to wait until my brother turned 25. Over the course of the years we‚Äôve (my immediate family ‚Äì not half siblings) lost about ¬£60,000 + combined from fees.  Back in 2015, I asked for a deposit for my first home. After a lengthy email battle over the year, they finally agreed. At some point during this it came to light that my half siblings walked away years ago (we were never made aware), and that my mother has had the ability to walk away since 2008 (again, we were never told despite continuously asking to leave). When this came to light my mother instantly asked for her funds, they agreed to start making this happen.  It didn‚Äôt happen. Instead they sent us a letter a year later stating that after investigating our Trust as something came to light which means me and my brother may not be beneficiaries after all.  In preparing my distribution for my house deposit, they reviewed the 1991 Deed concerns were found/ raised.  **Problem 1**  Basically, my dad didn‚Äôt sign the ‚ÄòChange of trustees 1991‚Äô document despite having priority power under the terms. It was executed by my uncle ‚Äì as this dates way back we aren‚Äôt sure why, perhaps my father was unavailable. But he did instruct my uncle to do so on his behalf.  The second Trustees have communication from 1994 regarding this issue ‚Äì however they, and the previous trustees decided they ‚Äòwere satisfied the Settlor was not available and therefor a change of trustees executed by the protector was valid‚Äô. This was because the settlement listed three person with the power to appoint replacements ‚ÄòThe settelor, the protector and the trustees‚Äô  Flash forward 20 years and a law firm now thinks that the second trustees (1991) decision was ‚Äòwrong‚Äô and that our current trustees should take the matter to court seeking a clear idea of the tax consequences.  The law firm advice found there are two outcomes: 1.	The 1991 retirement deed is invalid but the 2002 deed is valid.  2.	Or they are both invalid and the trust should have never moved from the UK and there will be serious tax implications. There are serious tax implications for both and the trust are currently investigating these and we are awaiting results. This investigation is costly (¬£10,000 so far) and the distributions are being made from our ‚Äòaccounts‚Äô with them.   **Problem 2: Me and my brother being added post 1991 Retirement Deed.**  As the 1991 Retirement Deed is likely to be found invalid, it is also likely me and my brother are invalid as this was exercised by ‚Äòinvalid‚Äô trustees and after my fathers death. Yet my mothers appointment is fine as this was exercised by my father while he was alive and under the terms of the original 1991 deed.  Therefor we are awaiting tax information and investigation into the 1991 deed,1997 appointment and 1999 appointment as it has bearings on 1. The tax positions 2. The validity of past distributions 3. Whether to continue with court application 4. How to respond for future requests for distributions 5. Whether the second trust have any obligation to assist.  **Where we stand**  We‚Äôre currently awaiting the tax information but the trust have said to us that they would be looking at hopefully distributing all capital to us so we can walk away from this (yeah right ‚Äì I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre going to offer that).  From our point of view we are an innocent party to this. We‚Äôre angry that: 1. It seems we will have most of the capital taken from us due to mistakes that weren‚Äôt ours. 2. That they convinced my mother to put her shared home into the trust under a now false promise. 3. They may seek the past distributions from us! 4. Our half siblings have been able to walkaway from this mess.S o many other things.  **My main questions are:** 1.	Will we be held responsible and ultimately be the ones who will have to pay for this mess? 2.	Do you think there is any room to recoup loss/ sue for this mess (fees throughout the years and the likely loss of all the capital as this has not been picked up previously (apart from the communication in 1994)? 3.	If they do come back with a resolution to this (an offer to walkaway with a sum), do you think we should consider it? I‚Äôm concerned as I feel we are still the ones who have ultimately paid the price of someone else mistake. Even in the unlikely case this was presented, for all these years we have paid so many fees, and now feed for this tax/ law firm (who we have no contact with and know nothing about!) and the fact that my mother could have walked away years ago (she has been paying fees all that time!) 4.	What type of solicitor should we be seeking advice from?  Please help! This is causing us so much distress and pain. It‚Äôs been ongoing all my life and we just want out of it now.  TL;DR  Current Trust is arguing the previous trust was invalid as a retirement deed was signed by protector rather than my father who is now deceased. This makes previous addition of me and my brother (after my dad passed) invalid and the moving of the trust to a offshore trust invalid. This could have serious tax implications for us and also removes us from the trust, making all previous distributions invalid. Basically big ¬£¬£¬£ and distress over a mistake that was not ours and was overlooked for almost 20 years. Currently being made to pay all the legal costs of this by our trust (distributions being made from the trust capital). Should we sue or seek legal action?   Also half siblings were informed they could leave early and left in 2008 with capital. Despite my mother continuously asking to leave and being told no, it has recently come to light she could of in 2008 yet they didn‚Äôt tell her and she has paid fees since then!   Please, any advice is welcome :(   FYI Despite how this story sounds my father and mother came from different backgrounds ‚Äì my mother being working class. I would consider us to be working class right now so available funds are limited and all tied up in the trust."	No
How bad of legal penalties would I face if I changed the locks and didn't let my partner back in the house? We are both on the lease but he is abusive and I'm afraid of him, and I am totally fine with paying him back his half of the security deposit and all of his stuff. But I need time, at least for the money part. I'd have to find another tenant to take his room, charge them the larger portion of the rent, and contribute the difference to him as a monthly payment. I'm willing to do this but I don't know if I have any way that I can, legally.  I can't say where I am, as I don't want him to find out about this post. USA though.	No
So this is somewhat long, please bear with me:   It is my first time renting and after 18 months (last 6 in a month-to-month) I got a 90-day end of tenancy notice saying that the house is for sale.   Now, I was not sure what I was doing and this followed:   1) Unaware of the 30-day notice to vacate I had to sent I immediately started looking for new apartments and was accepted on a new one today (07/11) with move-in date on August 1st.   2) and I called the property management to notify I had found a new place and that I would be able to move on August 1st. The agent said it was OK through over the phone.   After reading about it better I found I had to send a 30-day notice, which was not compatible with move out date of 08/01.   3) I give the agent a call and tell him I have to send a 30-day notice but in order for it to be valid for 08/01 my date would have to be 07/01. He says it's OK and even tell me that simply stating via email that I was able to move 08/01 was enough. I disagree and say I'll send you a 30-day noticed like that anyway.   4) I send him a 30-day today notice to the same email he was talking to me, backdated 07/01 and ask for him to acknowledge it and confirm that he was in agreement with my moving date. He does neither of that and ignores the e-mail.   In other e-mails he is always really vague and avoid direct answers to my August 1st move-out date. He refuses to specify a prorated rent in the case I move in that date.   Now to the problem:   That 30-day notice says I recognize that failure to vacate on the date set forth may cause owner/agent to suffer actual damages.  Question:   1) Does he have to acknowledge the 30-day notice on his e-mail and answer my question in order for the notice to be valid?   2) What happens if I do it the usual way and send first class mail with another one dated 07/12 with a later move out date? Will he be able to say I already had sent one and did not vacate, therefore causing damages?   3) What is the best way to fix this mess, invalidate the unanswered, previous 30-day notice and have a valid move out date so that I don't end up paying an extra rent?   Let me know if some part of it is too convoluted so I can explain it better.  Thanks all!	No
I'm so flustered right now, and trying to type on mobile. Apologies for incoherences or confusion, I just have no idea what to do.   So, as far as I know the Bureau of Narcotics Investigation and Drug Control officers visited my home this afternoon while I was at work. My wife is a stay at home mom, 4 kids whom were all always with grandparents by some stroke of luck. They confiscated 24 plants that have been growing for a few weeks. They said they had pictures of my wife and I watering them. She took all the blame and said I had nothing to do with it, attempting to compartmentalize the damage. She also told them she was growing for someone else, so now they're pressuring her to flip on someone. Problem is, that's a lie. It was all personal because we have zero connections right now. I wish she would have just asked for a lawyer, but what's done is done. They also confiscated our paraphernalia, a couple pips, bongs, grinder, etc.   I'm worried about her going to jail. Neither of us have anything on our records, but I'm hearing PA had mandatory sentencing. I need to get her a lawyer, but I'm also barely surviving on my current income. The fines will ruin us if the lawyer fees don't first. And the fact she would be a felon means most of her career options are impossible (she got her MBA while raising kids).   I just want to leave the state for greener pastures, but I we have to deal with this. Who do I contact, what do I do? Any advice is appreciated.

"(I understand this is a very complicated subject and it would be impossible to give me any straight answers here.  I'm mostly just looking for insight.  I'm going through a very scary/stressful period and I don't know whether a consultation would even be worth the energy at this point.  Any input at all is appreciated.)  Male  30 years old  So in 2015 I was diagnosed with a severe migraine variant that involves daily episodes of head pain and neurological deficit.  No fun.  This involved a great deal of emergent investigation and consultation with several specialists.  The problem isn't life threatening but it does carry some risk-factors and it's recommended that I keep a close eye on it.  Fast forward a couple years and I move to a new town.  Migraines aren't doing so hot so I set up a new patient appointment with my current provider (a Physician's Assistant).  I bring in detailed documentation of my case and we discuss my problem at length.  I watch her (presumably) enter all of this information into her computer.  At the time she seemed pretty on top of things, referred me to a new neurologist, got some bloodwork set up.  I felt like I was in good hands.  Fast forward to the present day and things are not going very well.  I am having severe issues with my neck and the neurological component of my migraines has become frighteningly pronounced.  My neurologist is booked for the month so last week I report to her office to discuss what's happening.  We decide to order a set of MRIs.  A number of things about the visit strike me as very odd/unprofessional/concerning:  - ""Wait what neurological symptoms?""  She forgot about them.  This was essentially the entire focus of my first visit.  I had given her a printed out description of exactly how my migraine auras present and we had discussed at length how important it is to monitor these because they can mimic some very dangerous things.  She kept this printout.  I checked my records after the visit and it seems none of those things had ever been recorded.  - She insisted the weakness/numbness on the right side of my body was due to a pinched nerve in my neck.  This is despite three different neurologists previously diagnosing these symptoms as brain-related, either migrainous or epileptic in nature.  I explained this to her, which she completely disregarded when placing the MRI order explained below.  - She forgot I have blood pressure issues.  - She prescribed me a muscle relaxer which the pharmacist later told me interacts with one of my other medications.  - She said she wanted a good look at the soft tissues in my neck, but ordered a spinal MRI.  I thought this sounded wrong so I checked with the imaging center when scheduling my appointment.  Wrong indeed.  I had to call her and have the order revised.  - Upon arrival at the imaging center, a confused looking receptionist told me my provider had called at the last minute and changed the order again.  I was never contacted about this.  - When ordering an MRI, the doctor/PA notes the patient's current problem so the radiologist knows what to look for.  For my Brain MRI, the order reads ""Migraine without Aura"".  I've been diagnosed with Migraine *with* Aura for 2 years.  This was established at my first appointment.  It's rather important, because frequent migraine auras can actually leave behind lesions detectable on MRIs.  No mention of the extremely complicated, localized neurological deficits I have such a detailed history of.  - Likewise, my Neck MRI order fails to mention the severe pain I've been having in the front left side of my neck, which was presumably the entire reason we were getting it done.  Instead it only mentions the numbness/weakness in my arm which (again) already has an established brain origin.  I got the MRI on Tuesday.  The imaging center said it would take up to 48 hours for the scans to be read, and then my doctor would call me to let me know what's next.  Friday rolls around and I still haven't heard anything, so I drive over to the imaging center and pick up the reports myself.  They tell me the reports were finished on *Wednesday morning* and I must have missed the call from my doctor.  I triple checked.  I'm signed up to receive multiple forms of contact.  No emails or portal messages or anything.  There are even some abnormalities noted on the report, which I thought typically meant the patient was contacted as soon as the information had become available.  Funny thing about the MRI report, it came back noting I had ""right sided neck pain"".  My pain is on the left.  I don't know who's fault that is.  It's like they're throwing darts at a board.  So now I have these reports that I have to second-guess because my provider gave the radiologist shoddy/incomplete information about my case.  I'm taking drugs that interact with each other because it's the only solution I've been offered.  The diagnosis I spent over $10,000 resolving in 2015 is now being changed by someone who isn't even technically a doctor.  I know I haven't been physically injured by anyone, but does any of this sound like malpractice?  I don't even like the idea of suing anyone, but this illness has caused me a great deal of disability and I am now looking at a situation where I may have wasted almost two thousand dollars on scans that need to be re-done because somebody else didn't do their job.  Sorry for the length of this post I'm just very wound up about the whole thing and have no idea how much of this I should consider acceptable or how I should proceed with handling it.  Thanks in advance."	No

My friends and I love watching movies and making fun of them. It was suggested that we make a YouTube series of us doing this, and so I did some reasearch at this seems like it could be a fun hobby. I was going to have us sitting around with mics, and then show the movie as we are watching it at the bottom of the screen. It occurs to me though that the movie is under copyright, but I don't know exactly what that protects.  So what does the copyright prevent me from doing. Can I show the movie? If not, is there another way to do it that will make it legal?  Thank you in advance.	No
I've resided in California for the last year and I need a dime of advice, PLEASE! I am well aware of the power of contracts and this one was all jacked up. Now in September my lease will end, but I want to renew it, why else would I pay raised rent for 2 months (minor adjustments higher for 'rent control').   Here is where I'm stuck; Will renewing the lease lock in my rent? I'm afraid if I ride along a month to month deal, they are definitely going to raise costs, I believe unreasonably too (they have lawyers on it, I'm sure). They know the Cost of Living in CA is always climbing. Please give me your best take. Maybe somebody who specializes in contract law.   Also, the signed copy of my contract was jacked because instead of terminating 2017, it says it terminated the day I signed 2016 (I don't know how I missed it). Anyways, what can you tell me, PLEASE help me make an informed decision.	No
Hey, throwaway account here.  My neighbor and I have fences surrounding both our backyards with a shared fence between the houses. Our driveways connect as they are one big piece of cement. My driveway is longer and the shared fence runs from the back of the lots to our gates, though his gate is closer to front of the lot. The fence started a meter from the sidewalk along the property line all the way to the back of the properties.  I came home from work two weeks ago and the section of the fence between the driveways was removed up to where his gate starts.   I went over and politely asked him why he took the fence down and he was defensive. He said the fence was his and he built it before we moved in two years ago. He said he built it on his side of the property line because the previous owners used to shovel snow onto his driveway (it's a long driveway). He said he took it down because he wants more space to park his RV in the driveway (which already fit fine).  I told him that the fence was actually built on the property line and that it wasn't polite to remove it without discussing it with us first. I said that based on our survey report, the fence is shared and technically is half ours. He denied it and told me to hire a surveyor to prove that. I told him I have a survey from when I moved in two years ago that shows pictures of the fence and a map indicating the property line and the fence directly on top of it.  I asked him to put the fence back up and he agreed after making a fuss, then asked for half the money for the cost of the fence. I agreed and asked how much and he said he would let me know.  It's been two weeks since that conversation and his RV is currently parked on the property line. I have a feeling he went inside, talked to his wife, and decided he didn't have to put it up. I haven't heard from him since, nor has he shown any sign of starting.  I really liked the fence because I could shovel the snow against it. Now I don't have much room to shovel the snow and I have to see the ugly RV he parks in his driveway.  Before I go and ask him about it again, I was hoping to get some advice from you guys.   What are my rights in Alberta? If he refuses, should I contact bylaw? Should I contact a lawyer? Should I build my own fence along the property line? I tried contacting the city and they suggested having a conversation (which I did) and then contact bylaw if it got out of control (which it didn't).   Thanks for your time!	No
So my grandmother's memory is not that sharp anymore. Her memory already has a limit on what she remembers for the day. She still lives normally but there are chances that she forgets things. Like when we talk about something she can't remember it the next day. And my uncle, who's not in good terms with my mom (his sister) makes my grandmother sign papers (probably giving him authority to things). We assume that my uncle just makes her sign the papers and not explaining it properly to my grandmother because when we talked to her, she just said that my uncle is making her sign papers and she signed it. Knowing that my grandmother may have some memory issues, it makes us worry that he may take authority (instead of him and my mother) and do some things with my grandmother's possessions like properties, money and etc. without notifying us. We got alarmed by this because we just found that he gave himself authority over my grandmother's bank account just by making her sign some papers.	No
"I don't know if this is the best thread to post in but it's the closest thing I have because I don't have anywhere else to look.    Hypothetically, one my of friends is an international student from an Asian country living here as a student. He has no green card but he does have a working permit. He had previous situations with his host family that made him homeless for a while. He found a new family (I'm not sure if they're his legal guardians, but they are on his school papers and in order to continue school, they are required)    Now this is when the situation gets fucky because recently the new family has been arguing about him and essentially lost the ""trust"" in him and now is forcing him to pay back his ""debts"". Debts which include food, water, room, air, etc. All of this is done while his life savings is held under pressure. They apparently have proof that he was living under their roof for free. Along with this they are forcing him to find a job (basically means he is not allowed in the house) He is afraid that he is going to be deported if he tries anything legal and I can see why. He has had many close encounters with being deported back whether it was due to financial issues or family issues. I want to help him (tried talking to my manager about getting him a job) but I don't know how to legally help so I'm going to this subreddit for help. If possible, I would like to know if I could potentially become his host family so I would be on his school papers instead of the other people.    If this is the wrong request in the wrong subreddit, I apologize and ask that you refer me to a subreddit in which people will know I want to do. Many thanks in advance."	No
Okay, I'll try to keep this short. Last month, our AC unit leaked under our kitchen floor, and damaged the vinyl flooring. It was found to be no fault of ours, and the landlord replaced the water heater (thinking it was the cause before discovering it to be the AC unit) and then had the AC repaired. When he went to replace the kitchen floor, he said that they would just do the entire kitchen, counters sinks cabinets everything, and that it would be done within a week, and that our insurance (that we got through them, which they required) would cover a hotel stay. They told us the work would start Wednesday and be done Friday, but we got a hotel thru Sunday to be safe.(This is all around the week of July 21st) We return on that sunday to find that none of the work had been done at all, even with the 2 extra days. We get a hotel again (still out of my own pocket) for 3 more days until Wednesday. When we come back, the new floor and cabinet is in, but we have no sinks and counter. He tells me they will come put the old sink back on that Friday (the 25th) but that we will have to wait 2 weeks (until August 3rd) for them to come put in the counters. So until then my kitchen is basically unusable as a cooking area, and they also didn't put my dishwasher back in with the temporary sink.    August 3rd comes, and we go to work, expecting the work to be done when we get home as they said. We get a text around 10 asking if one of us would be home (which they did NOT ask us to be, we have the texts where they set the date of the 3rd and said nothing about us being there) and we say no but they can let them in (which they have done every time up til now with no issue, sometimes without our consent! we woke up that Wednesday the 19th to them working in the house that morning, we had no idea, they were just in our house!). We get home and we still have no counters. I call the property manager and ask, and he says he was under the impression it would be done, and we would be there to let them in so said the owner. So i call the owner and get no answer, and i text him asking for what date so i can be there if need be and its been 4 days and no answer to any of my calls or texts.   How long do I have to continue paying a full months rent for an incomplete house? I barely just got refunded for my out of pocket expenses for the hotel, and it didnt even cover how much we've had to eat out these past weeks while our kitchen was basically unusable. Do i have any options here to force them to fix the kitchen, or legally break my lease? Because I am done with these people. At one point they told me that I needed to be in touch with the contractor if i wanted information, but I didn't hire this guy, or ask for these renovations! Any advice would be great, sorry for the length of the post.	No
My roommate and I moved out of a townhouse this march at the end of our lease. We received an invoice from our previous landlord indicating we would be getting a large portion if our security deposit back and we were then sent a Chase quick pay transaction for the amount via email. Upon clicking the link and choosing the bank the website showed no transaction was available, therefore we could not access the funds. We contacted the both Chase and the bank about the issue which they were unable to resolve. We have emailed the previous landlord about the issue multiple times with no response and called multiple times, leaving voicemails, with no answer. I've thought about sending a demand letter to the landlords, however the issue isn't a lack of returned deposit so much as it was returned in a form we cannot access the funds with. Should we send a demand letter?	No
I have purchased digital currency, called Town Points, from a game called 'Town of Salem', owned by BlankMediaGames, and have never received it.   They have never replied to my emails ‚Äî their only communication.   It's been a long time so I want to take legal action. Now their terms of service are pretty tricky and it basically makes me have no way of winning against them.   Here are their terms:   https://www.blankmediagames.com/terms/   https://www.blankmediagames.com/merch-store-terms-of-use-agreement/   A friend sent me these from their terms:  &gt; A. Negotiations. Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (‚ÄúClaim‚Äù), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days.  They will not reply to the informal negotiations so I will wait until that is over ‚Äî which is soon, then take legal action.  &gt;YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS BlankMediaGames FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND COSTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS‚Äô FEES)  &gt;BlankMediaGames RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON *OR NO REASON*, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU.  This means they can just destroy my account freely even after I win a legal battle and finally receive my digital currency. Correct?  &gt;IN NO EVENT SHALL BlankMediaGames BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ANY AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO BlankMediaGames FOR GAME-RELATED TRANSACTIONS  Does this mean they cannot be liable for more than what I've spent on them in the in-game store?  &gt;NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF Town Points  This includes purchasing ‚Äî but says nothing about receiving.....  &gt;BlankMediaGames SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE *DESTRUCTION*, *DELETION*, *MODIFICATION*, IMPAIRMENT, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR *Town Points*  So they can say they added it ‚Äî but then deleted it and not be liable? They can basically delete my Town Points at their will.  &gt;If there is a dispute regarding payment of fees to BlankMediaGames, your Account may be closed without warning or notice at the sole discretion of BlankMediaGames.  I can't refund nor dispute.  &gt;BlankMediaGames has the right, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you.   Does assets confine 'Town Points'?  &gt;As BlankMediaGames feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion BlankMediaGames may limit the total Town Points that may be held in your Account.  Can they say my limit is 0?  &gt;YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR Town Points THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR Town Points OR VIRTUAL ITEMS.   &gt;You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Town Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify BlankMediaGames immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Town Points balance. BlankMediaGames will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. BlankMediaGames will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.  So... they can legally say my claim is invalid, even if valid, because of their sole and absolute discretion.   I must take legal action, but I don't know where to start or what the laws confined in digital goods are. I've emailed them and it's been a while without a reply, and I cannot wait for their 'sole and absolute discretion' to determine anything malicious as a resolution ‚Äî I want the law. I don't have a lawyer or know of an arbitrator, but I do have $25,000 ready for all the fees that this will bring.   What's my best course of action?	No
Moving to a different apartment in the same complex. The lease had the move out date for July 30th but the owner asked us to move out much earlier (I assume to move in another tenant) and only gave us about 5 days notice. He agreed to credit the days we're not staying in the old apartment into the new apartment. We were just rushing to get everything moved on time so we didn't have the time to think about compensation. But now that everything is said and done, are we allowed to ask for compensation? Is it too late?	No
I know an illegal immigrant who has been her for over 16 years. This person is one of the nicest people I know and I would really like to help them out. They care for a grandchild who is a legal citizen. They don't have custody but the father (legal) has abandoned the child and the mother (illegal) was deported years ago.   Can anyone offer advice on how this person can become a legal citizen of the US, or anything else that could help them?  Thank you!	No
A summary. A friend of mine in Dubai has been applying for his student visa to study in an Italian University for a year now.  The details here are hazy because I'm paraphrasing what my friend has told me.  Just recently (10 days ago), he was requested by the consulate to submit his bank statements, a photocopy of his flight ticket and his certificate of acceptance. When he did, someone working at the embassy told him the documents were false and to never apply for the visa again. In a threatening manner, I might add. They stamped the rejection on his visa.  I asked my friend, and he's certain every document is valid. I'm writing this here because he'd dumb af and doesn't want to seek help.   Isn't this illegal? I don't know much but I'm pretty sure falsely accusing someone is criminal.   What can one do about it?	No
"Link to the last thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6e7o4c/north_carolina_my_apartment_complex_burned_down/  Like you guys said in the last thread, our renters insurance eventually came through to help with claims. They hired ServPro to handle moving what was salvageable and cleaning various items (furniture, clothing, books, etc.). We have filed a claim with State Farm for the items that are not salvageable and they reimbursed us a couple weeks ago.  So here is where we are now:  - ServPro returned furniture that was ""cleaned"" that had dirt and soot all over it. It's obvious that no one ever touched it. - ServPro returned furniture and items that did not belong to us. When we told them about this, they seemed baffled by who it could belong to and took it back. - ServPro returned almost every piece of furniture damaged (including antiques). This isn't cheap Ikea furniture, this is high quality furniture that survived half a dozen moves across the country with no problems. One of the beds won't even assemble anymore. Parts to the bookcases are missing. Every dresser has at least one handle missing. - When we called them to let them know about the damage, they sent someone to take pictures of the dressers and take sample handles so they could have one of their people make matching pieces. It's been a month since they took those and haven't returned them.  - Two months after the fire, they finally delivered the suits and dry cleaning. There are at least two $500 jackets missing that were supposed to be included in the dry cleaning. - They still haven't delivered other missing items we have told them about, and don't seem to have an explanation of where they are.  We've tried being reasonable with ServPro, letting them know about all of the issues as they come up, but this level of incompetence isn't something that can be reasoned with apparently. I'm at the end of my rope in terms of dealing with them. They don't return phone calls, never have answers, and take weeks to get back to us. We called State Farm to see if we could claim the damaged/missing items, but they told us that was an issue we needed to take up with ServPro.  My questions are:  - What are my rights when dealing with this company? Is there any way to move this process along and make them take this issue seriously? - If renters insurance will not cover items missing/damaged via ServPro, and ServPro won't even return basic phone calls, who is responsible? They're both saying that the other has to pay for the items, not them. - It is time to hire a lawyer, and if so, what kind?"	No
Hi all,   I am a sublessor who signed a sublease (month-to-month) with a subtenant (found on Craigslist) who agreed to move in on August 1.  The sublessee signed a contract, but didn't pay and just backed out the last day.   I used the [California Sublease Agreement](https://rentallease.net/wp-content/uploads/california-sublease-agreement.jpg) as a template.   Because I held the room for the tenant, I am now eating the cost as I search for a new roommate.  I trusted this person, and obviously realize fully my mistake, and in the future will always get the money upon contract signature.   Is there nothing I can do legally to get some sort of reparation, or to file a claim for breach of formally signed contract?  The roommate is no longer completely dark, so if I could even convey some sort of realistic legal claim to him it could help my cause.	No
Hello. So I was planning on moving to Nebraska and signed a lease through the mail. Rent amount is $375 a month. (Shared house) in no longer moving to Nebraska since I found work else where. I told the landlord my intentions and they told me they will try to find someone to take over my lease. Is there any serious consequences if I don't pay the rent? I'm afraid of being stuck paying for this rent when I can't afford it.  Please serious advice will be appreciated.  Thanks! 	No
Hi everyone,  I am currently subletting a room near a college campus that I am working at for the summer. It is a room in a frat house. I didn't sign any paperwork, we did the entire thing informally where I found the listing on Facebook, negotiated rent and paid via venmo and moved in last month without signing any contract or written agreement. The room was pretty gross (hair and food stuck to the floor which resulted in tons of bugs). I bought a vacuum cleaner and cleaning supplies on my own and tried to clean to room to get rid of the bugs but I'm still having issues with them. Eventually I told the guy I paid about the issue (he isn't in PA, but called the landlord who said he'd bring in an exterminator, but that never happened.) I'm only staying for another couple of weeks and haven't been able to find a new place to live, so I'm going to stick it out, but it's fairly upsetting.  Is there any legal standard or something I could use to ask for my money back? Do I have any rights in this scenario having not signed a formal agreement?  Thanks!	No
"I was caught smoking marijuana in a park with 5 other people a few weeks ago by the police. They took our ID's and looked us up to see if we had clean records which we all did. They were nice and just told us to never return to the park because the people in the neighborhood were getting fed up of the amount of teenagers who come there to smoke weed. They said they were giving us warnings and it would appear on something called our ""drivers abstract"". Im not really sure what that is? Will it affect me when it come to employment or something?"	No
"Hi everyone.  My father passed away about 5 months ago after suffering a heart attack during surgery to remove colon cancer.  There are a few odd things that happened, however. I've been trying to ignore them, but they've really been bothering me lately.  1) We had all spoken to my father (who was brain dead at the time) and a few of us were in and out of the room. I stayed in the room the whole time, as I didn't want him to be alone. A few of my family members had come back into the room, and as I was sitting there holding his hand, they pulled the plug. It surprised me, as there was no explicit ""Are you ready to pull the plug?"" They just pulled it, and all of a sudden it got quiet. At the time, I figured maybe it just wasn't like the movies and that's how they did it. But now, I'm second-guessing myself.  2) Apparently, I'm the only one in my family who understood that, when we were finally getting to see him after he had stabilized a bit, we were going to say goodbye. The rest of my family understood that we were just going in to tell him to fight through and that we were here for him. So while the plug pulling surprised me, it REALLY surprised them.   3) This could totally be an ICU nurse trying to make my mom feel  better, but the ICU nurse said that while my mom was telling him to fight, he raised his arms and pretended to box. I highly doubt that if he was brain dead, he would've been able to do that.   My dad had leukemia for 10 years and cost his insurance a lot of damn money over the years. I hate to suggest that they were eager to get rid of him, but... I can't help but think that.  Is any of this normal? Is there something odd to this whole scenario?  Thanks so much, and sorry if I rambled or if this is the wrong sub."	No
"I recently signed a contract for a new construction home expected to close in December 2017.   The financing section of the contract states ""If buyer intends to use a lender other than designated lender, buyer shall cause said lender to execute an ""outside lender addundum"" within seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract, one the form prepared by seller, and buyer shall provide seller and escrow holder with a copy thereof within such seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract.""  Does this mean after 72 hours, I am stuck with the designated lender and can't shop around for a mortgage with different lenders?"	No
"So I recently moved into a new apartment complex two months ago. I finished medical school and started working as a doctor in a new city. The management company of the apartment building changed without notice a month ago. At that time, it seems the automatic withdrawal I had set up with the management company was cut off. When I figured that out, I emailed the new management company about how to pay them (the website required a tenant ID number that I didn't have). They set me up with the ID, I paid the amount, then went my merry way.   I check my bank account occasionally and two days ago, noticed the money hadn't been taken out yet. I logged on to the online portal, it still showed ""$0.00 due at this time"" that it's been showing saying I paid my rent. I figured I'd talk to the manager in a few days if it still hadn't been taken out to figure out what was going on. I work 80hr weeks as a medical resident so I literally can not stop by during business hours to talk about rent. I figured I'd do it this weekend when I have a day off. After all, online was still showing my rent had been paid.   I came home today to what looks like a ""Pay and Quit"" notice. Basically telling me my rent had not been received, that I have to pay the rent, a late fee, and a bounced check fee in order to not be evicted in three days. Now, my bank account has more than sufficient funds (quadruple what the rent is) so there's no way the online payment bounced because of insufficient funds. I copy/pasted my routing and account number online so I doubt a typo is the issue. And, most importantly, the online portal has been showing $0.00 due as recently as two days ago. I log on today, it now shows $1475 due.   The management company has my email address and phone number on file. They never contacted me in any way saying they hadn't received my payment. Literally no warning until I get home late after a shift in the ED and get a frickin' eviction notice. And to top it off, I'm working 7am to 7pm this entire week again so it's going to be next to impossible to actually meet anyone in person.   I wrote an extremely nasty email on Microsoft Word to the property manager venting all my feelings and then deleted it. After that, I opened up Gmail and sent a polite but forceful email outlining that I had never been told anything about my payment not going through and coming across this notice out of nowhere.   My question is, what is the likelihood that they can actually evict me? And what are my chances of getting the late fee and ""bounced check"" fee waived?"	No
They are not answering their phones.  I have the title so it's still technically my car and if they won't pay for it, then would I be able to report to the police that they have stolen it?    Or would I get in trouble for that? I mean technically if you are supposed to pay for something but then u don't it is stealing.	No
We are located in Alberta, Canada.   Over the course of the past year, my mother has suffered a debilitating illness that has kept her from working.  There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc).   My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.    We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we don‚Äôt know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage.   Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.	No
"Hi,   We are moving, and we notified our landlord that we would like to be present for the move out inspection via certified mail with the required 15 days prior notice.  According to Maryland law, the landlord has to ""upon receipt"" notify us of the date of the inspection to take place either 5 days before or 5 days after the move out.     We are moving out on the 31st, so we are in the window. I can't find anything other than ""upon receipt"" for how much notice the landlord has to give us, but I am worried that they are going to try and notify me the day before.  Do I have any defense here?   Additionally, the state AG says their response has to be via certified mail to me and I have nothing from them. They called last night, but I have asked that they email me and handle everything in writing.    Because they have waited 12 days from receiving my letter, have they violated ""upon receipt""?"	No
"My boyfriend and I decided we were ready to start house hunting; we found a place we liked and put in an offer, after some negotiation it was accepted. Initially, I was involved in all the documents with our real estate agent (a friend of the family) when drafting offers, and I met with the mortgage broker, but other than that, my boyfriend has been the one handling everything with the agent/broker/lawyer.  About a week ago, my boyfriend said that the broker advised leaving me off the ""mortgage documents"" because I was unemployed and he was the primary bacon maker.  He works in emergency response, I'm a game designer about to start my own company, but am currently unemployed until after the house is settled - one big life change at a time. Anyway, that made sense to me; I will have no active income at the time of the move (already put in notice at my current job).  What he has come to explain to me more fully is that I will not be on any of the formal documents; we renegotiated the offer one last time (for some work to be completed before the closing date, as recommended by our home inspector) to be drafted by the end of today, but my boyfriend now tells me that I will not be a part of those documents and only he will be signing them; that it was the recommendation of the mortgage broker. He explained that, if I were to be included in the documents, any of my debts would add to his and he would no longer be approved for the mortgage at all.  It is true that I have a $400 balance on my credit card, but that is my only debt in the world (his credit card balance is somewhere around $3000).  My boyfriend also said that a lawyer could draft a document stating that I was an equal owner of the property, even if my name doesn't go on the documents he is signing and sending off today.  My question is, does all of this sound legit? Is my $400 debt enough to write me out of the whole deal? Could a document like that be prepared after-the-fact? In Canada, there is a bit of a boost for home buyers tax returns (the year they purchase) - would I still be eligible for this if my name is not technically on the offer, bank documents, or deed to the property?  Thanks all - sorry if this doesn't make sense or if I don't know what I'm talking about!"	No
The police emergency detained me because they believed I was suicidal. I was in my car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazards on as I was crying and couldn't drive with blurred vision. They took it upon themselves to assume I was suicidal even though I made no indication of it, have no history of mental illness or even a police record.  I was forced into the back of a police cruiser, taken to the ER against my will, and they tried to charge me $2400. I negotiated it down to ~$650 and left. The doctor cleared me after talking to me for 5 minutes because he knew I should not have been detained for anything. I did not even have to see a psychiatrist as the police earlier said.  I'm not sure if there is anything I can do, but I was hoping to find some advice.     TLDR: Police detained me wrongfully, forced me to go to ER, and I am stuck with the bill now.	No
"We asked our landlord to end the lease early, fought back and forth and she agreed, then dropped off a dated and signed letter saying ""I have found new tenants I am letting you out of the lease early"" then wrote a bunch of other demands that she has saying we need to meet and agree and sign to these demands she wants, pay for the gardener for the rest of the year for the new tenants, pay for cleaning services that aren't in our lease, she actually went ahead and hand wrote them into her lease, without our signatures and is trying to say see its in my lease you have to do it lol. Because the 30 day notice is coming up on Tuesday shes telling us that if we don't come sign this paper tomorrow saying we agree to her demands that she is going to go cancel the new lease with the new tenants, and hold us accountable for the remainder of the years rent.

"I am in a house in MA where I paid one of the roommates directly two months worth of rent and utilities for a sublet room - some of the previous occupants of the lease have quit before it was up. Going through the lease it says anyone past 3 weeks not on the lease in the premise is considered an ""illegal subletter"" - I have given one of these people rent for two months, who have just disappeared. Their lease ends in end of August.   The roommate in question just messaged me asking to pay ""the rent"" to the other roommate despite already receiving it himself. It seems he is pocketing the money directly and I talked to the other roommate who more or less admitted to doing the same from the other subletters (there are three of us)  They seem to have no intention in making the full monthly rent in transferring the funds received to the management company. My portion of the rent is through a church's support program to combat homelessness.  What are my options here? I have been here 3 weeks. I know it's a month before you are considered a ""occupier"" I believe in MA law? I don't want to get evicted, the management company does not know I/we are here yet, but they seem to be taking advantage of everything."	No
"My landlord for my commercial business sent me an invoice regarding unpaid CAM balances for 2013-2016.  They claim that the total unpaid amount for those three years sums up to a very big amount (5 digit number). This is the first I've heard of these charges and my lease agreement says they would provide a statement of actual CAM costs for the year within 60 days ""(or as soon thereafter as possible)"" following the end of each calendar year.  I have been paying my agreed upon CAM charges every month already so this letter regarding such a large balance came as a shock to me. I have sent my landlord a request for itemized lists of all charges and if they have proof of any CAM invoices sent to me in those years.   Can I argue for the balance to be dropped since they didn't fulfil their end of the lease agreement?  Thank you in advance for your help"	No
"Please excuse the length of this post, but I'm trying to be thorough and make sure I don't leave anything out. My (37/M) friend (27/M)'s job has transferred him to my city, and since my current lease was ending, we made the decision to move in together to save money and upgrade to a nicer home. We had both been living in cramped studio apartments in order to save money and were tired of the lack of space, so we looked for homes with decent square footage that suited our needs in our price range. We fell in love with a 4 br, 3 ba, 3000+ sq ft home in a nice, quiet suburban neighborhood not far from where I was living at the time.  We paid our application fees, submitted our forms, and were told by the property managers after their review that everything looked great. We satisfied all of their requirements on paper. Our combined income is more than 3.5 times the rent (they only asked for 2.5 x), we both have good credit, no debts, no criminal history, and solid rental history with no evictions, bankruptcies, or judgements. All of our landlord and employer references are good. We are quiet non-smokers. The only potential issue was that the listing stated that the owner preferred no pets and we have two cats, but the landlord okayed them (in writing) as long as we agreed to a $500 deposit per cat. She emailed the property managers to request that she meet us in person before having us sign a lease, writing to them that she just needed 15 minutes to get a ""quick impression"", and finished the email by saying, ""if the meeting goes well, they can move in this weekend"". This email was forwarded to us by the property managers, and I set a time to meet the landlord through them.  We met at the home a few days later, and I don't think anything about my appearance should have been off-putting (I was well-groomed, wearing smart casual clothes, and my car is extremely clean). She had a negative vibe from the start and I got the impression that she didn't want to rent to us and was looking for me to prove her wrong. She made it clear that she would prefer to rent to a family, and said that she felt the only reason that two single men would want her home was to throw parties (I'm 37, and the landlord is only a year older than I am) or to move in lots of additional tenants. I tried to assuage her fears and explain why we wanted the space and told her what the rooms would be used for (a study, a workout room, a guest room, etc) and she seemed a little more relaxed when we parted ways.  After a few days of hearing nothing, I received an email from the property manager informing me that the homeowner had chosen another applicant to rent the house. I accepted this, but the following day I came across the property listing during my search for another home to rent and saw that it was still active. Out of curiosity, I checked the listing on various broker websites (Zillow, Trulia, etc) as well as the property management company's website every day for the next week, and it stayed up and remained active throughout this time. I know that these websites are sometimes slow to update, but other homes I'd considered during my search were speedily removed when they went off the market so I found this a little odd. At this point, a friend of mine contacted the property manager inquiring about the house and was told that it was still available for rent.  I wonder if some subtle discrimination has occurred here. We are a pair of professional adults, not a group of teens in their first house looking to party. As far as I am aware, it is illegal in California (where we are located) to deny housing to a qualified applicant because of their familial status, marital status, age, or any arbitrary status. I know that small/private landlords may be exempt from fair housing laws at the federal level, but I'm not sure if they are exempt from local and state laws. I am also concerned that some more sinister discrimination might be at play, as my roommate has a Hispanic name and is a legal alien from a South American country. He's lived in the US for most of his life, speaks perfect English, is gainfully employed, and is working on obtaining his citizenship - but I know this is still not enough for some people.  We were told that the home was being held for us until it suddenly wasn't. No offer was made by the property managers to show us other properties or refund our application fees, which they definitely were not obligated to do, but it might have been courteous considering the situation. We're happily in a new home now so I'm no longer interested in renting this property, but I'm still bothered by what happened. Is this a matter that I should pursue further, or do local/state/federal laws entitle a landlord to deny qualified applicants because of their family status and her personal feelings?"	No
I live in a large apartment building with a physical key for the building and another for my apartment.  There is also an RFID key fob that grants access to the building, but additionally it is the only way into the parking garage and the only way to operate the elevator.  I was provided with a spare set of physical keys, but without the fob I would have to climb thirteen flights of stairs to reach my apartment and there would be no way to park my car.  My lease says nothing about keys, physical or electronic, whatsoever.  The leasing office refuses to provide a duplicate key fob; only to deactivate and replace (for a reasonable fee) if lost.  I'm handy with technology, and I can probably clone this thing.  Is it legal to do so?  Massachusetts	No
My mother has been sexually harassed at her workplace for about a year or more. She works at a big name energy company that priorities safety for their employees in the workplace as their number one commitment (I know, I've worked with this company as a summer student many years). My mother and father live in this small company town (about 650 population) and they both work for this company at different places/roles. I live a province away and I've heard most of this through my father and sister (who still lives home).   My parents marriage has been suffering so much over the past year and it was seriously stressing out my sister and I as well. My father, sister and I could tell that my mother wasn't the same as she once was, always hiding away from us/people, getting mad with us for no particular reason, blaming my father for things that isn't his fault and just all around being distant and not being a part of the family. I don't even know how to explain this.   Now this may have been going on for more than a year but my mother only told us about her struggles within the last month. I don't know all the details. I know he has touched her body sometimes, talked about her body, and tried to convince her to have an affair. For a year, or more. She had to put up with this kind of guy. I know this guy who harassed her almost ruined her marriage (or still may) as well as part of her life. And perhaps the rest of her life will be altered by this too. My mother is very old school and didn't even want to tell us or let HR of this company know about what has been going on. She doesn't want to ruin the life of the guy who has been harassing her and his family (it's a small town everyone knows everyone) and she doesn't want people to know this has been happening in case they judge her, even if she gets moved to a different work area to get away from him. She thinks that people won't like her or be different around her because she told on him. She's insecure. My mother is on antidepressants to deal with this. She pushed her family members away to deal with this. She's done crazy things she never would have thought about doing before- driving 12 hours away from the town to get away, contemplate suicide, etc.   Today, he got called into HR to discuss what has been happening and he has denied ALL of it. HR said they need proof. We understand that. The problem is: there is no proof. No texts. No interaction over social media. No cameras. No co workers have seen (and my mother is convinced if they did, they wouldn't say anything). My mother said she knew this would happen because the guy told her that if she told ever told anyone, he would deny all of it. My mother wrote out specific scenarios that occurred with this guy who harassed her. The HR manager believes my mother but can not do anything without proof. My mother has written 15 pages of what this guy has said and done to her. These 15 pages made my father cry.   What can be done to bring justice?	No
So my girlfriend is hosting a large caliber barrel race. The slot were sold for 1000 dollars each. We had to move the race because of a natural disaster in our area, and now some people are asking for refunds. The contract they signed at the beginning said no refunds. Do they have a legal Case because it changed dates? Were really worried as she is a sole proprietor and if anything comes of this, she would have to declare bankruptcy.	No
Have put more effort into my job and have demonstrated my commitment more than other employees. (attendance, going above and beyond job description)  My boss is giving me worse shifts, less hours, etc. in preference of workers that are the ethnicity of the companies owners.   I am assuming a lawyer would not take this case without up front fees.	No
A little background about my living situation. I am located in Ontario and I have an apartment. Originally there were 3 people on the lease, over time they have moved on to other things and our lease has expired. I have been doing month to month since then.   About 6 months ago I informed my landlord that I would be letting another person move in since I have a spare bedroom and it would help with the bills. The landlord agreed and the person moved in. From there it has been nothing but an uphill battle. Our lease, which I still follow, specifies no pets, and they insist on keeping a cat in their room. It also doesn't help that I'm terribly allergic to them, but they refuse to remove it. This person also smokes marijuana frequently, which I don't particularly care what people do in their free time, but it's pretty disrespectful when they blatantly do it in their room and my entire home smells like it. Lastly, they have occasional guests, again which I'm fine with, I'm not fine when they stay for a month without any form of heads up. Plus minor damage here and there.  Anyways, I informed this person a week ago that I would no longer like to continue living together, and asked them kindly to leave within an appropriate amount of time. I wrote a letter outlining my wishes and as to why I feel they should leave, which I mentioned above, but they refused and said I had no legal ground to stand on to ask them to leave. This person has no agreement with the landlord, and nothing verbal or written with me other than I want x amount per month for rent/utilities.  Any advice on where to go from here would be appreciated.	No
Hello everyone! Recently, i have decided to take a trip to India to visit my friend and of course, i need a visa. That friend of mine sent me a link on phone but i got to the wrong site by mistake when i used my laptop; it is called etavisaonline.in Later, I had my friend paid the fee, which was ‚Ç¨99 and waited for 3 days as it said. After the third day, i received no reply and the application id they gave me turned out to be invalid as i checked it on the site of the gov. I've realised my stupidity and applied on the right web this time, got my visa for nearly half of the price.  Now i'm scared that we have paid a fraudulent source and what frightens me more is the safety of my friend's information as he used a visa debit card. I'm sincerely asking for advice since i dont know what to do now. Pls help. Thank you guys so so much	No
Seven year old credit card coming back to haunt me!  Ok, I've never posted here before and doing this on my phone, so bear with me please.  I'm in Ohio, today my brother in Oklahoma called me and said someone had called him about needing to send me some documents.  I called the number they gave him, and it's in regard to this credit card, last activity was 2010.  They say they are attempting to serve me with papers to take me court for 2,705.49 plus 1,500 in attorney fees, or I could set up pymt plan and pay them 1,664.39.  My question is, how do I keep them from calling family members?  (He said it was an outside company)  He also said statute of limitations was 12 years in 2010.  The reason this card defaulted is initially I lost my job, then became ill and am now on disability.  Any advice would be appreciated.	No
Ok, so about a year ago my grandmother passed away. No will was left behind, but she had expressed that she wished for it to be sold and split amongst the four grandchildren. She has no living children.   I have no way to contract two of us (no social media, no known number as i haven't talked to them in years and they didn't show up to the funeral) and the third has said she wants the house solely for herself as she thinks she deserves it more.   I can't afford a lawyer, but i want to see the house sold and split evenly. What steps do i take to see this happen? If it matters, this is in Illinois and I'm the oldest grandchild.	No
So I bought a condo, Massachusetts, back in 2012 (worst decision I‚Äôve made to date).  Only 2 units were built, one building townhouse style.  The second unit sold shortly after.  The developer still has not built anymore units (leaving it about 95% unfinished) and gets in trouble with the city every time he tries (ignoring wetland issues and cease and desist orders).  He periodically lists the development for sale but no one has bought it.  I, with the other unit owner, take care of plowing and general maintenance.  The developer no longer collects dues from us and just leaves us be.  I haven‚Äôt heard from him in about a year now.  Not sure what lead me to check out title of the property but it looks like a mess. There are all these quitclaim deeds to Nevada corporations this guy has set up, sometimes for $1 and sometimes for more.  Back and forth and now a deed clarification of some other corporation saying that they have the valid title.  This new corporation, while previously created by our developer, doesn‚Äôt look like it is owned by him anymore.  From what I can tell, the property has been passed around for shares in these corporations.  I spent half a day in google digging up all sorts of stuff I didn‚Äôt want to know and didn't really understand.  So not even sure if our developer is even our developer anymore.  What kind of mess is this and how do I protect myself?  I eventually want to be able to sell, but my gut says that won‚Äôt be possible.  And I feel bad about unloading this on to some other clueless buyer.  Besides not being able to sell, is there any other way this could come bite me?  Can he, the developer, even pass around the land like this?  Could my mortgage be called due?  Doesn‚Äôt he, the developer, need to let the unit owners know about these things?  I‚Äôm so in the dark.   I feel like I need a lawyer to look at all the facts and look out for my best interests ‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs such a muck I don‚Äôt even know what kind of lawyer to look for or what needs protecting.	No
I signed a lease contract that ended middle of July. The contract was signed months ago and specifically states the exact date that the lease would end on July 14th of 2017. I paid him a prorated amount that covered half of July, but he wants the full amount for the month. He says he will take me to small claims court if I don't pay him the full amount. Thank you for your help!  Some other details: -My original residence is in County A (to which I will return to when my lease ends) but rental location that I leased from him is hundreds of miles away in County B (to which he will return to after lease ends). If he does end up suing me in small claims court, will he sue me in County A or County B?	No
"So I recently moved into a new place, but my old landlord keeps dodging me. He keeps saying that he's sending my security deposit back from my old place, which I left absolutely spotless, but it's been two months and I'm still missing my entire deposit. I thought of recording him on the phone where I request either the bill for the damages or the deposit back, but don't know if this is the best idea. For the record his real estate ""company"" no longer exists and the only address is a PO box he gave me. Is this an issue of I should've been smarter to begin with or is there anyway I can still get my somewhat large deposit back? Thanks for all your help"	No
Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	No
My friend, who is in the 5th month here at her apartment was judt served a 5 day notice of termination. However she  and her two roommates believe to have paid rent (getting check stubs and money order receipts in next day]. But have been having very shady interaction with the management since moving in. They havw been tokd they didnt pay, didnt pay enough, or paid too much, on multiple occasions. But now are under pressure to show payment or make payment before 5-day to get legal shit out of the way. None of them, or myself have a lot of money so this is a big deal for her.   On one occasion sewage and garbage were paid bur not deducted from the account. The check was stopped and the payment is being sent through again.   Every time they go to the offices to pay rent they have said they hear other tenants complaining about paying ans having it not be show. Many times with the tenants showing proof of payment.   This has led me to believe that they may posssibly being trying to take advantage of low incomr individuals, claim they haven't paid, keep their deposits and get new tenants. This however is just a theory. It is not, so far as i can tell section 8, but is low income housing and the mumber of tenants is staggering, something like 14 buildings with 3 floors amd 4 apartments per floor. Or 168  apartments, with x number of tenants.  Please help! And if you happen to be a lawyer working in Kane county who is familiar with this type of issue anuthing you could do to help would be greatly appreciated.	No
My friend has rented out his basement apartment to a guy for the last 10 months. Over the winter he got behind on payments (two months behind) but promised to slowly pay it back as he was able to. He is a seasonal worker and so is my friend so he cut him some slack. The issue was he could never quite get ahead each month and now owes $3200. Finally he put his foot down and gave him until the end of July (full month notice). They then agreed that this weekend he would be out. Now the tenant is pushing it further into next week. He claims he will call the police if any of his stuff gets touched. They didn't sign a formal lease. He paid in cash for the other months. My friend has written agreements and documentation of all money owed including bank statements. What can be done here? Is my friend just stuck waiting until it is convenient for this guy to leave? 	No
Hello please help if you can! My fianc√© now 27 got into an altercation with his child's mother when he was 19 and because of that they gave him a felony and made him register as an predatory offender for 10 years. Years have gone by and all has been fine. 6 months ago he got his first dui. They put him on probation for two years. In bad luck he recently became homeless and did not have a valid address for two months. The officer called him and told him to check in yesterday because they haven't heard from him since may. So he went in today and they arrested him. Now they are charging him with a felony and his court is in 48 hours (Thursday). We can't afford a lawyer, already told the people he was homeless. I am so scared what's going to happen! We are in the state of Minnesota. Please give advice or help I am so worried!!! -Gypsy	No
TLDR:  Guy bought property with terms:  if HST, then (price ‚ÄúHST Included‚Äù), else (certificate on closing).  Expected to receive input tax credit on HST; Property wasn‚Äôt subject to HST; No HST paid. Given certificate on closing; Guy still tries to claim HST input tax credit; CRA says no; Guy argues with CRA; still no; Guy sues seller.    The facts (If you want to read more. It‚Äôs dense and I warned you).  My friend &amp; her husband (both retired) sold a piece of vacant land: a hundred acres of junk (new-growth trees, rocks, swamp), at the edge of nowhere, previously severed from farm.    Agent explained that HST might be payable, might not.  Hard to tell, because farm, severance, etc...  Friend isn‚Äôt a tax expert, agent isn‚Äôt a tax expert.  It‚Äôll all get sorted at closing.   Lists for $Y, friend wants minimum $X net.   $Y is much bigger than $X, of course.  Years pass (boonies:  location, location, location). Offer finally comes in.  Agent turns out to be agent for buyer and seller.   Price is strangely $X + agent commission + closing costs, minus a hundred bucks‚Ä¶  smells like agent telegraphed minimum but strange things are known to happen.  Friend lets it pass.    Useful bits of offer say: ‚Äúif subject to HST, then HST is included in price, if not, vendor will deliver certificate on or before closing.‚Äù  Also says property is ‚Äúvacant land‚Äù.  So far, so good.  Mutual understanding of the facts. Check.  Friend reviews offer: Maybe HST, maybe no HST‚Ä¶ if no HST, friend will get $X, but if HST is payable, then friend will $X-HST. Nope on that offer.  Offer countered at $X + small negotiating room + legal bill estimate + commission + HST + more negotiating room.   Still way less than Y.   ‚ÄúFinal offer‚Äù comes back at $Z =  $X + reduced agent commission + reduced legal bill + HST + 0.00 exactly.  Friend grumbles at strange twice in a row, but it‚Äôs the only offer in a long time, and it‚Äôs (barely) acceptable if HST.   She accepts.   Useful bits are the same, cause it was back and forth RE deal like usual and these clauses weren‚Äôt modified. Agreement also included a right of inspection of all terms by lawyers of Buyer, and cancellation by default if not waived by Date, plus return of deposit.   Lawyers for Buyer modify a few details in the title, adjust closing date.  Condition waived.   Closing is nigh: friend and husband meet with lawyers.  And the answer is: property is not subject to HST, so sign this certificate.  Certificate delivered.  Lawyers pore over details.  Two digits plus pennies of land taxes are added to the account.    Friends pocket $Z - commission - legals + two digits:  it‚Äôs bigger than $X by five digits. So they are happy.  Until this weekend.  Friend just served them a summons in small claims court, out in some county somewhere nowhere nearby.    It‚Äôs legit, so they plan to respond pronto.    Buyer claims after closing, and despite having been given certificate (which he doesn‚Äôt mention), ‚ÄúThe Plaintiff subsequently applied for an HST rebate based on his belief that he had paid the HST included in the purchase price.‚Äù   CRA denied, on the basis that no HST had been paid (no kidding, it wasn‚Äôt owed).  Buyer calls CRA &amp; appeals, asks for ruling, finally gets long letter from CRA saying ‚Äúno!‚Äù but taking several pages to do so.  Buyer is now claiming fraudulent misrepresentation: e.g. that friend fraudulently misrepresented to friend‚Äôs agent (conveniently not mentioning he is also buyer‚Äôs agent) that HST was payable, and Buyer relied on this agent who only tells truth, and Buyer‚Äôs whole deal was based on claiming input tax credit on 13% of the purchase price, which depended on Friend paying 13% HST, ‚Äúincluded‚Äù in the price‚Ä¶  TLDR2:  Buyer who is impervious to information provided in written certificates claiming he relied on friend‚Äôs agent, who screwed him, claims friend is liable for the acts of friend‚Äôs agent, who was also buyer‚Äôs agent.  Any words of wisdom?  Strategy?	No
Here's what happened:  On August 1, 2016, I moved into an apartment already occupied by C. Our names were both on the lease, which went from 8/1/16 to 8/1/17. On C's instruction (in a text message which is saved) I paid the management company my part of the first month's rent, and I paid C my part of the last month's rent and the security deposit. Twelve months later, I moved out. C is still in the apartment (not sure if he has a new roommate or if his is the only name on the new lease).  A few weeks ago, C texted me (again, this is saved) saying that the management company would return my part of the security deposit within 30 days of my lease ending on 8/1. A week ago, I contacted the management company to check that they agreed with this and to give them my new address; they responded that they would not return any security deposit while the apartment was occupied and that C is the one who owes me the money.  I'm still hoping this will be worked out in a friendly way, but I'd like to be prepared if it's necessary to resolve it legally.  **What I know:**  * I can prove (via PayPal statements) that the deposit was paid to C. * I can prove (via text messages saved by Google) that it was in fact a deposit and how much it was. * I can prove (via the lease) that there is in fact a security deposit for the apartment. * The relevant place to take this is Philadelphia Municipal Court.  **What I don't know:**  * Who actually owes me the money? That is, if I don't get it, is the defendant C or the management company (or the actual landlord)? Or both? * If it's both do I file two separate suits or one that names them both? * The Municipal Court handles both small claims and landlord-tenant disputes. Which one is this? * Am I missing any important questions or perspectives?	No
Hello guys,  My fianc√© and I live in an apartment where our walls our always cracking. The process goes: call and complain, they promise two days and come in a month, fix the walls temporarily, walls crack again, they say there's nothing they can do about it because the building is still settling, and the cycle repeats.   I understand that structurally there may be nothing they can do, however, they say it's a known issue and didn't tell us or warn us about this when we signed our lease. We also once got a response where they said it wasn't anything beyond cosmetic damage so it wasn't a big deal, but cracks in walls can cause issues with humidity and mold, so they present a possible future risk that isn't being addressed.  Legally, what is my recourse? Would it be best to contact a local board and file a complaint?	No
I got a phone call an hour ago from my son, who is 26. My son lives in the state of Texas with his mother. His mother and I have been divorced since he was two years old. I have always strived to have a connection with my son; although it has ever been easy (he suffers from Asperger's syndrome, suffers from intense anxiety, has difficulty making friends, his mother loved being passive aggressive and generally make my life a living hell, etc) I have always loved my son and supported him when I could. If the fine folks of /r/legaladvice could advise me on the following dilemma my son has moronically gotten himself into, it would be greatly appreciated.  A few things about my son: he lives with his mother. He makes about $1,400 a month (after taxes). He dropped out of college his freshmen year and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social phobia shortly afterwards, hence the low paying job and general lack of motivation he suffers from. Because my son can be sometimes be very thick and obstinate, as well as terrified of speaking to people, he neglected to get insurance for his car for a whole month. I know; I chastised him for his gross irresponsibility, but I have long ago accepted that I cannot hold myself responsible for his decisions, however misguided as they can be. I love my son. He told me on the phone that he had been in a car crash a few months ago (on a car he had just bought) without having insurance. He received a ticket for failure to yield (resulting in the accident; according to him, he had just gotten off a 12 hour shift, he hadn't slept well in days due to his anxiety caused insomnia, and he had thought he had the right of way when a car slammed into him. Afraid of the financial difficulties of paying a fine for both things, he consulted his best friend, who happens to be a cop, and his friend advised him to get insurance for the car involved in the accident that same day, so he could present proof of insurance to court in front of the judge and have the fine removed.   It appeared to have worked. He dropped the insurance for the same car after paying his failure to yield fine. However, today (months after the car crash in question) he began to receive phone calls from his car insurance company about a claim placed on behalf of the other party involved. My son's car wasn't covered by his insurance at the time.   How can I best advise my son? Should he confess to the insurance company that he did not have insurance at the time of the crash? Would that make him liable to be sued? What are some repercussions he could face? He pays for his credit card, phone bill, car, rent, and groceries, so despite his gross negligence he tries to be good. He has fucked up enormously, but he is my son.  Please. I am desperate.   -concernedfatherofmoron	No
Hey r/legaladvice,  A few weeks ago, our A/C went out, and our Landlord was very prompt in getting it fixed. Cue a couple inspections from the city, her, and the A/C company.  Anyway, I'm at work right now, and my landlord just sent an email (she inspected the house today while me and my three roommates were at work) with her reactions to our house.  Here's the weird bit: one of my roommates locked his door before he left, and she went into his room and complained about an odor and the general uncleanliness. Now, she's not demanding or threatening anything, but it does seem questionable. Aside from this, we've gotten along decently with her. But this seems like an invasion of privacy.  What do you think? Are we overreacting? Or did she breach our privacy?	No
Good afternoon! Just a quick question. I have been googling all afternoon with no luck. Someone i know discovered bed bugs in her apartment. After contacting the landlord he informed her they came from the tenant below. I was told this is a HIPAA violation, but I think that's ridiculous.  Thanks!	No
"I do not understand the legal logic in the following immigration situation in which I currently find myself in.  US Citizen with wife who is not US citizen, albeit married legally in USA over 5 years ago. We have 2 US citizen children, of very young age, currently living with wife in the foreign country. After being legally married in US, I moved to wife's country for a few years.  Wife wants to immigrate to US, so does husband (me), for the betterment of the child's education and livelihood. Husband then comes to USA to establish residence and attains a good job to prove an ability to provide for wife (as per regulations in the affidavit of support) .   Immigration services estimates 12 months before issuing a visa, while a Fiance visa will take 6 months (i.e. I go to foreign country, take a ""spouse"" and bring her back). All communications to the USCIS yield little in terms of additional information on the case. Also no way to expedite the case unless she is from an extreme situation, which she is not.   Can someone, please, explain the logic in this situation, or even better, tell me how I can see my family again."	No
"Car was purchased ""as is"" - I don't have the title yet, they are mailing it to me, so I don't know if flood damage is mentioned on title. Carfax provided by dealer shows no records of refurbishment or major repairs, although it became obvious later that sections of the vehicle have been replaced."	No
Simple question, what are my options here?  Our lease is 4 people, we kicked one out and had this new guy come in. The new guy is supposed to leave very soon (August should be his last month) but I can't get a hold of him (the three of us are outside of the city at the moment, we can't confront him) and he hasn't answered me in a week. His name is not on the lease. What are my options if he decides to try and skimp out?	No
Link to original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6sgt0b/landlord_scheduled_building_maintenance_and_did/  So, the details are in the last post, but we have gotten new information. I contacted my insurance company and was told that renter's insurance does not cover situations like this and that the contractor and landlord/management are responsible for damages. Do we have a case to bring to small claims court then?   Thanks!	No
"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	No
Good Evening,    First time here, so sorry if this is already answered. Please provide link to answer if so and I will delete this post.   **SITUATION**: Other night I tapped the bumper of a man (driver), and his pregnant wife and child (passengers). Speed at impact was no faster than walking speed. There was no damage to my bumper and a slight scuff on theirs, we exchanged insurance and contact info, and I asked to pay out of pocket if he was willing. Next day they contact me and say that they are sore and taking the wife to the dr., and that the impact dislodged the plastic wheel well in their car. However, they are still willing to let me pay out of pocket for car repairs and health insurance co-pay from the dr visit. They gave me a reasonable quote that I accepted. I don't really care if they are faking and just keeping the money, this is an inconvenience for them, and I was at fault. Additionally, the quote would be cheaper than my insurance increase in the long run.    **QUESTION**: My concern is that I will pay them, but they will still try and make a claim in the future due to injury they didn't know they had yet (or something along those lines). If I have them sign a release of liability contract in front of a notary at the time of payment, will that protect me here in Oregon? If so, is there a recommended release of liability contract template I can download for free? Or am I out of my league here? I think getting a lawyer involved would contradict any future insurance premium savings I would gain from the other party not making a claim.  Thanks for your time,  everyusernametaken2	No
"First off, I realise I most likely will not find any lawyers from my country here, but I wanted to hear some advice from people with more legal experience than me.  My fianc√©e and I have rented an apartment from our landlord since September 2016. Recently we signed a lease on a new apartment, but the same landlord. We are supposed to move into the new apartment tomorrow (Monday). I am 26 years old and my fianc√©e is 23, if that's at all relevant.  Today, we returned home to find a new TV, in its box, in our living room. We didn't buy the TV, and it's obvious he entered the apartment and put it in here while we were away for the weekend.  He did not notify us beforehand (apparently it's for the next tenants). After talking to him on the phone, he claims that he's done this (entered without notification) many times before and that he will continue to do so, because it's written in the lease agreement that he can. After the conversation, I went over the contract again.  The lease reads, roughly translated, ""The landlord will be authorised to visit the apartment during the week, at reasonable hours, in order to check on the status of the unit. This must be done with the renter's agreement beforehand. In addition, each year starting from July 1, the landlord will be authorised to enter the apartment with potential new tenants (to show them around). This can be done with no alert beforehand.""  So from what I understand from the contract, by entering and leaving the TV without notifying us first, he broke the contract. I know he wasn't showing the apartment to new tenants because he already signed a lease with new tenants about a month ago.  Am I reading the situation correctly? The dude is kind of a scumbag, but the apartments are nice so we kept on for another year with him, and the new contract is the same as the old, just a different address. This all happened less than an hour ago, and I wanted to get some advice before I do anything. I think in the next apartment I will set up a security camera. Also, our contract has no clause concerning a TV, and suddenly we have a TV in our apartment, can we keep it? (I wouldn't imagine so, but still...)  Anyways, I would appreciate any advice you guys have to give. The next lease we sign will be read through more thoroughly than this one was."	No
"A friend / tenant of the building I currently live in had his check altered by our landlord to include a 35 dollar late fee cause he was as you probably know by now a bit late on rent. By the rent box it says ""If payment is late over 1 week, a 35 dollar fee will be added to your current rent"". He paid his 950 for the rent and ended up seeing 985 from his account. He looked at the online banking picture of the check and its clearly altered with a use of white out and other methods. The contract in the lease which is appliable to all of us in the building is that there is late fees, does having the late fees somehow obligate the landlord to alter the check to receive late fees?.. he's pretty upset about it."	No
Hello Reddit, I'm a New Yorker that lives in a HOA. For the past 20 years my family is paid the association dues. The issue is out of the 54 homes that are in this community eleven homes don't pay the homeowners association dues.  After Consulting with the board of my HOA they said they've began the process of taking these homeowners to court. This is been an exhausting process that is taken a long time. I was wondering what could take so long to litigate these matters.  Now I live in New York City and I know it is definitely more homeowner, and tenant friendly, I just can't believe that there's no recourse except to put a lien on someone's house and if they ever decide to sell then the association gets their money.   Basically is there a way to expedite this process currently we have one lawyer doing these cases. Would hiring better Law Firm help?	No
"We had a nasty hail storm come through in May 2016, I made a claim for a full roof replacement and non-roof related repairs such as deck, broken window, fencing, etc.  I went through the claim and broke out the roof-related repairs costs line-by-line to come up with the total cost for the job, since the roofing company would NOT be performing any non-roof related repairs. This is what we agreed on for the cost, and what is reflected in the proposal from the roofer, not including supplements. I even sent them a copy of the claim so they could see for themselves. So, Cost ‚Äì $500 deductible credit + supplements.  Nearly 6 months later, the roofing company tells me the amount they've successfully negotiated for the supplements, and I receive an additional check from the insurance company to cover them.  The roofing company invoiced me for remaining balance, exactly what was in the proposal, base negotiated cost + supplements (which we now had a figure for). I paid it promptly and in full.  I must have been wrong in thinking that the transaction was over, because the roofing company came back AGAIN and says that ""After auditing the final amount we saw that contractor O&amp;P was not included in the first final invoice we sent. For that I do apologize on that."" and ""as soon as it was discovered we made sure to send it out. This has never happened on any of my jobs and again I do apologize for this oversight.""  First of all, it seems wrong to me that they can come back AFTER the invoice has been paid and ask for more money. If I buy a donut and walk out, you can't chase me down the street and say you messed up and undercharged me. However, I'm not trying to wriggle through get anything for free.  Secondly, the proposal mentions nothing of an additional cost TBD later in addition to base cost + supplements. I called my adjuster and he said that the supplements (that had already been paid) included overhead &amp; profit, and in fact makes up the bulk of the supplement amount.  Thirdly, the insurance company is failing to show me the math of HOW they arrived at this NEW total, and instead is only threatening to put a lien on my house. They say that I MUST give them ALL money that I've received from the insurance company or else they will be in violation of the law for helping me benefit from a claim. Surely they understand that they are not entitled to any money for repairs they did not make, but the bigger question is even IF I received more money for the roof than what we had agreed upon, why would they be entitled to that money? We agreed on a price, and that's what I've paid. If there IS extra money, shouldn't it go back to the insurance company if anything?  I'm trying to get my adjuster to answer one simple question: of the money I've received, how much of it is for roof-related repairs? My policy covers depreciation for the dwelling, but not the detached garage, so looking at these numbers for Replacement Cost, Actual Cash Value, Depreciation.. it's all a bit overwhelming and confusing. It's been difficult getting a straight answer from my adjuster since he's still slammed and is hard to get ahold of. After looking at the claim again, I/we used the Actual Cash Value of the roof-related items to come up with the original cost, now that I have more understanding of how this works, should we have used the Replacement Cost? If so, the cost WOULD be higher, but as I mentioned, I sent them the claim, they looked it over, and we agreed on the price.  This is the first time I've made a claim of this nature and this process has been different than any auto claim I've made. Is there Colorado law that states I must hand over any money I receive regardless of what was agreed upon? If so, why even bother with a proposal? Or are they trying to take advantage of me?  I can supply any real figures if that helps. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks."	No
Hello /r/legaladvice ! So this situation is still unfolding but I have a couple questions for you. I am in the process of moving across country from the east coast to Washington state. I was there last month for a few weeks and got a studio apartment and moved in, stayed there for a few weeks before headed home to grab my car and move there for good. Now I have always carried renters insurance though I forgot to get it right when I moved in, more on that later.   Now I have had a bidet on my toilets for years now and can't go back to toilet paper lol. When I moved into the new spot I quickly ordered one on amazon and installed it. amazing as usual. I was there for about a week after that and did not notice any leaks. I flew home to Boston and have bad been here about 10 days when I get a call from my property manager saying that there is a leak in my downstairs neighbors apt and they want to enter my unit the check. I immediately started thinking about what could possibly be leaking, and was worried the only thing it could be is the bidet. Anyway at this point I did not know that or anything, however my property managers call reminded me that I still had forgot to get renters insurance, I immediately purchased it.      Now here I am 2 days after the initial call and my fears are confirmed, though luckily not as bad as some of my mental images of there being a foot of water in my bathroom. So it was my bidet, I don't know what happened as I have never had a problem with leaks but I am told I am responsible for the damage and they will send me a claim.    So I am wondering about the dates of buying my renters insurance. It was activated the 6th, I don't know when I will receive a bill for damages but I imagine it will cause my insurance provider to be suspicious. My question is, since I did not know of the cause of damage or that I was liable when I purchased the policy would this constitute some kinda of fraud?    Sorry for any spelling errors I kinda just spat this all out as I am anxious about it and feel super bad and embarrassed. I will need to bake my downstairs neighbor some cookies or something.	No
Background:  Alice booked a three-month stay at an AirBnB for for herself, Bob, Charlie, Danielle and Emma. They have been there for about 40 days so far.  Bob, Charlie, Danielle and Emma give rent checks/venmo to Alice, who then writes a check to the landlord, Frank. Frank does not live in the house.  Timeline:  - Alice unexpectedly announces a few days ago that she intends to leave the house ten days early, and assumes that the rest of the house will cover her rent for the time after she leaves and before the stay is over.  - The rest of the roommates tell her that is a dick move, and that she shouldn't stiff them on rent.  - Alice retaliates by threatening to cancel the entire AirBnB today, making everybody homeless.  Would this be an illegal eviction on Alice's part?  If she goes through with it, will Bob etc. have any recourse?	No
"Now that it is the dry season, I have begun to water my yard. I noticed that the front water water spigot does not work.  I notified the landlord, who claims the repair is too costly. He claims that I signed off on the state of the house when I moved in, and because I missed the broken spigot, it is no longer his responsibility to fix it.  While I don't believe the following is relevant to the law, the property is large and I am unable to adequately water the front yard in a convenient amount of time with only one spigot. I have been served a 10 Day Comply or Vacate over some underwatered plants in the front yard. ($50 fee)  In my initial request, I texted my landlord and he admitted that the spigot was not functioning when I moved in, and he knew, as he was the one to disable it rather than fix it some years ago.  I am sending a maintenance request via certified, return request mail today. He has already told me that his response will be to remove the spigot and patch the hole, however, I do want a paper trail. I have taken pictures of the spigot + the texts.  I have been looking in to repair and deduct, but I'm not positive it is applicable.  He also says, ""I'm the landlord. I can do whatever I want to the property as long as I notify you.""  Am I SoL because I missed the damage on the walkthrough?  Can he just notify me that he's removing the spigot, and that's it?  Can he keep charging me for and underwatered lawn?  Should I just move and be done with it?"	No
"A couple of weeks ago, my best friend was a victim of domestic battery by her boyfriend of two years. I have never liked him, but I will try to be as unbiased as I can.  Basically, she is trying to get a restraining order against him, and I don't think he can contact her. Now he's contacting me and another friend about all kinds of things. One minute he's saying that he has a voicemail of my best friend drunk claiming to ""murder him"" if he is still in contact with a coworker that he had a bit of an affair with during their relationship. He's claiming that he's going to take HER to court over that, claiming to spend all his money to lock her up ""for good"", but at the same time telling me that he loves her and only wants the best for her. That he named a ""star after her"" and doesn't want to ""give up"" on their relationship.  I screenshot some of this conversation, mostly about him trying to ""lock up"" my best friend, but I have no idea how to continue. He's been blowing up my phone with texts for the past 30 minutes. Should I keep all of these texts for evidence? Would it be useful at all? Should I block him, or let him keep sending these texts?"	No
This happened during the weekend, I had less than 1 gram of cocaine in my car, it was under my car seat and sometime during the drive it rolled out from under the seat. A cop pulled me over for a tail light not working and when he came to my window he noticed it, asked me to step out and then called for backup and searched my car and found it. I got arrested for possession of CDS and charged with a 3rd degree felony. I was released immediately as it was my first offense. I have received the court date for this Friday and I am not sure what to do. I am in US on a work visa, and have recently applied for an extension. I am scared on what to do, I have no experience in any legal matter and I am not sure on what the process will be. I really need advice on what to expect and how to prepare. I looked for lawyers online and made appointments with them, I searched online about first time offenses for possession it all looks so confusing, I have read about PTI(pre-trial intervention) and conditional suspended sentences, it says that if I can get either of those, the arrest records and can be expunged. Is it something I should bring it up with a lawyer ? Is it possible to get those sentences. I never did coke before ever, and I bought it just because I was curious and wanted to try it. I have no history of any arrests or any priors for that facet. Will I be jailed? will I be deported ? Any advice is greatly appreciated.	No
Hey everyone. My boyfriend is in the process of hopefully getting a job in the USA. We have been dating for around 4 years and always said we'd get married if we relocated so we can be together. I am worried about a couple of things that might cause problems  - I am diagnosed with Anxiety, this in itself isn't the problem. I have went through a few diagnoses' to get to this one though but it's settled on that. I am considered in remission but a couple years ago I got into a fight with a girl over something stupid. I punched her in the face but the police weren't contacted. I did, however, talk to my therapist about it and worked through it with them. If this is on my medical records could it cause problems? (Btw just a note that me and the girl resolved it and were both kind of douchebags)  - This is the one I'm really worried about. My mother is currently awaiting conviction on a charge of possession with intent to supply multiple substances and one charge of conspiracy to convey drugs into a prison. I did not know about this or profit from it. Will this cause problems? If so, how do I prove myself and what are my options?  Thank you guys in advance, worried sick here.	No
Sorry about formatting, on mobile.   Was running my in unit AC when I noticed that smoke was starting to billow out of it. I touched the sides of the unit and it was scalding hot. When I opened the unit I found Styrofoam pieces inside of the unit taped on by maintenance to jam the large fan. This jamming is what lead to the fire hazard.  Upon unjamming the fan and turning it back on, the unit would shake uncontollably, becoming a further hazard.  I have photos of the inside of the unit and the Styrofoam bits that were placed inside of it.    Do I have any legal grounds here because if I was not in the apartment it surely would have escalated to a fire.  I am located in Centre county Pennsylvania.	No
There was some confusion in the last thread about the unit. Its a normal looking house, however its bisected. It has two kitchens, two bathrooms, two bedrooms, 1 backyard, 1 bisected garage with 2 doors, and it is basically one smaller home mirrored with two 1 way doors in the center. As in there is a handle on my side for my door, but no handle on my side for his door and vice versa.   So I posted [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/66r71g/landlord_blocked_psn_xbl_steam_and_various_other/) three months ago. My solution for this issue was to hide a router and set it as the primary so he thought he was in control of the internet.    He has since found the router and blew his top.   Fun part is he went into my room to find them. As a landlord in a condo, he should not have access to my area. (May be wrong on that feel free to correct me.) I accused him of going through my side of the condo and his response was that he owned the place and he was free to do as he wished.   I informed him that the rental contract I signed made anything he said about that false. He has access to my place in emergencies or if there is a need to access it for maintenance issues.   He claimed that getting the internet working is a maintenance issue and that he had every right to enter my side of the unit.   Since then he has produced several new rules that he wants me to sign and add on to the contract.   These documents look like they came from legal zoom. They have rules governing when I am allowed to play video games, all internet gaming is banned, I am not allowed to bring over women at all, and that I am to follow any rules put forth by the landlord.   Obviously bunk paper as I have a contract with the man. Also found that because I am in control over a condo unit, I can contact my ISP. They will issue me a second modem to run off of another IP address on a second account.   This is basically what I did the instant this document was handed to me.   The ISP installed the new modem yesterday and I have been enjoying my own internet line that he knows he legally can not touch.   That night I brought my girlfriend over and played video games, quietly, well into the night. I kinda wanted to rub it in his face I guess so I broke every new rule he tried to implement.   Today he told me that he was going to have me evicted. I told him that I have broken no rules and that his new paper is not binding until signed. I ripped the paper in half when he tried to get me to sign it again.   HE said that that was my last chance and that he has no choice now but to move forward with eviction process. He said the locks would be changed when I got home from work.   I pulled up the Texas eviction laws on my phone and made him read them.   He almost chunked my phone but controlled himself. He got in my face and said that he would have me out of this unit within the month and that I would be responsible for the rest of the rent as well.   I laughed at him and told him that a judge would decide that and unless he had a legally legitimate reason to enter my side of the condo again, I would call the police for trespassing.   Main questions I have are simple.   I understand I was talking big a bit there. But does he have the right to enter my side of the condo? He had to go outside, cross the driveway, and enter through my front door to do this. Backdoor has a deadbolt.   Also I am sure the lease only talks about him entering in case of emergencies or for maintenance issues. NO wording about him not being able to enter though.   Second question is that paper of his. He still wants me to sign it and claims he can hold me to those draconian rules. I am correct in assuming that only the rental contract I signed is what is important right?  Finally if he does take me to court regarding evictions, will I be needing a lawyer? Or can this be done with arbitration or whatever. There is no binding arbitration in the rental contract but  was wondering the merits on this one.	No
Im in a really bad situation right now, i was caught at my school with possession of marijuana, and the court date is coming up. My family is stressed and they think they are going to be deported because we arent citizens. They think they will be arrested when we arrive at the court, and this was my first offense (im 14) please help, do i just get probation and community service or are we getting kicked out of usa	No
The person whose trailer I hit wasn't present, but I left a note.  I'm trying to figure out whether it would be my boat insurance or Auto insurance?  I'm assuming auto, since the neither boat was present at the time.  Will my auto insurance cover damages to their trailer? (I have full coverage) and will I pay a deductible for that?  Its about $2400 in damages, and I'd rather not tell my insurance company and have my rates go up if I end up having to pay $1000 for the deductible when I can try to scrape up the money for the full amount.	No
To give a little additional background, my roommates and I moved out of a house we were renting in TN on June 30th.  We attempted to contact them regarding the deposit on July 18th but received no reply.  We followed up with them two days ago, and last night we received a word document laying out approximately 20 different damages and associated costs.  My understanding is that it has been more than 30 days since the end of our lease, and our landlord failed to notify us of an inspection, or provide advance notice of their intent to withhold the deposit.  Additionally, the list of damages and associated costs that was offered is fairly ridiculous ($10 for changing a light bulb, $250 to unclog a drain, etc.)  At this stage, I basically responded saying that they failed to meet their obligations to return the deposit or report damages in that 30 day window.  They have thus far failed to respond, but I was hoping for some additional insight into where I stand.  Any advice would be much appreciated!	No
"I have a male friend who was scheduled to move into a room at a single family home where all of the rooms are rented individually. The landlords do not live in the home and they aren't using a company to manage tenants.   His friend is the current tenant and she gave him the heads up that she was moving out so he could talk with the landlords about moving in. My friend went through the guy landlord and confirmed that the room was available and verbally confirmed that he wanted the room and the guy landlord agreed.   Today my friend gets a text from his friend (the current tenant) with an attached email stating that the girl landlord decided she wanted to make the property an ""All girls property"" and they would let my friend know. My friend later received an email from the landlord simply stating the room is no longer available for rent.   Is it legal to say you only want to rent to a specific gender? Does this go against the fair housing act? "	No
Now I will go into more detail. Two days ago I noticed a mini-tractor outside of my house, and a bunch of men with shovels and tools. I approached them and asked what they were doing. They claimed the pipe to the water main connected to their house busted, and needed to be replaced, and that they would need to dig up an area to install the pipe. I showed them my property line and asked them to go around it, which they said they would. They did not, they tore up existing concrete and left holes and patches of concrete/rocks every where.   I live in the front of an easement that has more houses in the back, I own the areas they dug in. Which from what they said and I understood, they could have gone around without damaging my property...  First of all, they started doing this without trying to contact me in any way. Which is the real reason I am pissed off. They are new Neighbors and I haven't had much contact. They are Renting the home I believe, and I don't have contact with the home owner.  What are my options... Do I call the police? Do I have to fix it myself..? It's so frustrating...	No
My deceased grandmother died in 2009 and she left me money in her will. My aunt is the executor of the will but won't pay it out, and I'm legally an adult now so what options do I have in claiming this? Also the will dictates that there is cash money in my name but my aunt says that the money was put into a 529 college plan for me.   What should I do?	No
My Grandmother is 66 years old and started cataracts surgery June 1st.  They do one eye, wait 2 weeks, than do the other eye.  With this surgery you also get to choose the type of lens you want, and what distance you'd like to see best - near, intermediate, or far. You can choose other options as well, including having a different power in each eye. But she chose to see better near for both eyes.   Both surgeries themselves went fine, no problems. The problem is that now she has one eye that sees up close and one eye that sees far.   We had many follow-ups with the eye doctor - not the surgeon - Who was surprised on the last visit the difference he saw between the eyes and said he was seeing something not the norm but he wanted to wait a few more weeks to make a definitive conclusion as this surgery can take a period of adjustment.   The problem persists, is pronounced, and we believe is past the time adjustment period and seems to have settled. We have the final follow-up appointment next week but we wanted to know beforehand that if the eye exam follow up does conclude that further correction is needed if we need to pay more for that, if we have legal recourse, and/or what we should make sure to do/get/ask.	No
What should I do, what are my options?[ Pic. ](http://imgur.com/a/TrDYK) Thanks!	No
I'm renting a house. The husband and wife landlords have been nice, though pretty hands-off and ... well I'd hesitate to use the word incompetent, but maybe lazy is a good word for it. I've had no real complaints aside from them taking forever to fix certain things (they want to get the best deal first), and it's time to renew my lease.  Technically my lease expired on July 1, but I don't think my landlords know that. All rent has always been paid on time and they like me as a tenant. I was wondering how to go about getting some amendments made to the lease.   What I want in new lease:  * Fixed chimney (power went out this winter and we couldn't stay warm since the chimney has never been cleaned and is likely a fire hazard; landlords said they'd fix in winter, still haven't done it)  * Pet amendment (we're interested in getting a small cat, maybe a medium sized dog like a golden retriever)  The advice I was given was to print off the current lease I have, staple on a page saying I'll cover a deposit for a pet to cover cleaning fees should something bad happen as well as some kind of page that details that the landlords should fix the chimney by a certain date. I'm pretty confident if I were to sign that and sent in to them they wouldn't think twice about just filing it away and never thinking about it.  Is this a reasonable course of action? Do I need anything notarized to make it official or is this seen as some kind of nefarious, subversive behavior that might be frowned upon?	No
This is not my first time posting this, but since it keeps getting worse and worse I need help.   There is a man who lives behind me who is a nuisance to everyone around him. He puts very bright lights up that always go on at sunset, off at dawn.   He put lights up pointed directly at my house, above my privacy fence, and onto my bedroom window. I'm under 18, live with my parents, and they don't know what to do or they are too lazy to help.  The lights force me to close my blinds every night and even then it still looks like its 6AM and the sun is rising in my room all night.   Above all, he has cameras.   1. Attached to his roof, pointed at my yard and it can see into my yard and on my window.   2. Attached to my fence, but pointed at his home.  3. THE WORST ONE. On an entergy pole in the corner of my yard, he used a ladder to get up there and we have photos of him doing it from my neighbor. Its pointed at his yard/ someone elses yard I believe.   What can my parents and I do to get the lights and cameras removed?	No
Hey guys I was in a motorbike crash on the 2nd July, I was going down the motorway in the fast lane and it turned into a merge lane so I merged. About 10 seconds later all I see is brake lights come on so I tried to brake aswell, couldn't slow down fast enough so i had to swerve to the right and clipped the rear right side of the car in front, now comes to my problem. I have decided not to claim and just wanted to fix my bike up myself without getting insurance involved but I have just had a claim made against me by the other party involved. My insurance ran out on the 12th so I wanted to know if I would still be covered and how to handle the claim against me. Any advice would be helpful .	No
Once I am incapacitated, can't they just jave me declared incompatent and change whatever they like? Do I need to keep my attorney on retainer til then to prevent it? Is there some kind of advocate I can hire?	No
I recently got charged with a DUI. I blew a .134 this is my first offense. This happened in San Diego. I have never been in trouble with the law except for a couple of speeding tickets from when I was a teenager. My problem is that speaking to a lawyer told me he was iffy on being able to get me down to a wet and reckless.   My problem is that hiring him will cost me seven grand that I don't have. I know the knee jerk reaction is to get a lawyer but would it be that bad if I didn't? Is it really in my best interest to just bite the bullet and pay the lawyer? 	No

"Hey everyone,   For one year I rented one bedroom in an apartment unit that was owned by my then roommate and his family in Manhattan, NY. I rented directly from them and I initially put down a security deposit of $1,400.00, which is equivalent to one months rent. While living there, I took on a small DIY project and mounted my TV to the wall in my bedroom. It was my first time doing it, and I ended up making six holes all one inch in diameter in a sheetrock wall. Before I vacated the apartment on January 7th, I repaired the wholes to the best of my ability with some spackle and drywall tape. Again, it was my first time repairing drywall holes so it could have looked a bit better.   On the move out day my roommate and I made a verbal agreement that he would use the money from the security deposit to have the holes patched up professionally if he chose to, and then return the remaining money in the security deposit to me. My father was present during this interaction, witnessed our mutual understanding of the agreement and watched us shake hands.   After eight months my former roommate won't answer any inquires on the verbal agreement. I'm not entirely sure what to do at this point, but my plan is to take him to small claims court. I've read that it verbal agreements can hold up in court, but it's hard to prove and I'm also worried about how language of the lease. It states that: ""the lessor is responsible for the cost of all repairs to the apartment except for damage to the apartment caused by lessee, the costs of which damage shall be the responsibility of the lessee. A roommate who damages the personal property of the other roommate is responsible for the cost of repairs of that property."" I'm not sure that he as the lessee is obligated to return the remaining about of the security deposit.  So far I've recently sent him a certified letter detailing our verbal agreement and asking him to fulfill it. It has a return receipt and I plan to use it in court as evidence of contacting him. I also plan to have my father testify as a witness to the verbal agreement, and subpoena the signed lease since I just can't seem to find my copy. What do y'all thing? Do I have a case in NYC small claims court. Thank you so much in advanced!"	No
"I own an SEO company and we do legit work.  We have been in this space since 2007 and have had 0 complaints and no chargebacks.  A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results.   2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.    After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.  Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.  He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..    My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.    We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.  We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.  Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.   TL;DR client hired us and did a chargeback which we won, now is threatening legal action in the form of criminal complaints if we do not refund him."	No
It states no business is to be conducted in the residence and the lease forbids any type of operating a business in the residence. Is there any California law that will help me?	No
My condo unit in Alberta had a leak that affected the unit below me while I was away for the weekend, which prompted a call to an emergency repairman.   The cost to have someone come down from a vendor (Honeywell) to enter the unit cost around $750 to turn off the water line. The invoice described having to wait 3 hours for a locksmith to open the door, and another 30 minutes to locate and close the water valve.  Another $1000 was billed to cover the damage to the ceiling of the unit below me. I'm not sure of the damage extent, but can't imagine it being that expensive to fix.  During the entire time, the condo management company did not contact me. I received the bills totaling to $1750 one year later since the accounting department 'forgot' to send the invoices. Both vendors were already paid the excessive and inflated invoices by the condo management company, without any  investigation if they were reasonably billed.  I know during an emergency, if you're not in your condo unit the condo company has a right to enter your property and try to resolve an issue. But the vendors clearly charged excessive price to do simple tasks. I would imagine or hope there is a law in place to protect condo owners from automatically accepting to pay outrageous prices that they cannot shop around or pre-approve of. Otherwise someone could potentially be billed a million dollars to clean up a very minor spill in a hallway, since that happens to be the condo-approved vendor's going rate.  What right do I have regarding these highly inflated invoices paid already by the condo company? Should I hire a lawyer and/or dispute them in court?	No
So my moma house was foreclosed on. She is being court ordered to leave by the 18th.  The company thay bought her house, let themselves in today, while she was in her room, and changed the locks and didn't leave her a key. She explained she had till the 18th of August, and they said it wasn't her house anymore.  This is in New York.   Also, they were taking picture of the inside of the house.    This cannot be legal, correct?	No
"[Colorado] Hi /r/legaladvice! This is my first time posting as I really haven't needed legal advice before. That being said, below is the jist of what is happening:  * We rented back a home we had just purchased to the sellers * We had a post-occupancy agreement stating that the sellers had to maintain the house (including landscaping and cleanliness) as it was when we closed. * The agreement stated that if anything broke (i.e. irrigation etc it was on our dime, but neglect was on them). * They claimed the sprinklers worked in the disclosure and on the inspection resolution and even had a company turn it on and write that it was operational, but 1 of the 4 valves did not work when we moved in and a large number of the sprinkler heads didn't work. They did not inform us of this during the rent-back period. We didn't check the irrigation system during the closing process as they hadn't turned it on and we said it was fine if they did it when they saw fit as the lawn was in great shape when we bought it and they said it would be operational. * They neglected the landscaping (by either lying about the sprinklers working, or not telling us they broke) killing about 1/4 of the lawn on a 1/3 acre lot.  * They did not cut back trees which had overgrown to the point you couldn't walk to the front door without ducking. * They allowed their moving truck to park on the front lawn killed a big patch * They left the interior dirty * I have pictures of what the house looked like at closing and what it looked like when we moved in and it is pretty obvious they didn't take care of the exterior. * We paid a pro to fix the sprinklers ($350) and did the rest ourselves (around 30 hours of work to restore it to how it was at closing) * We sent a letter stating we were keeping the security deposit ($1,000) and listed the reasons why (I screwed up and forgot to mention the interior being dirty) * They responded to the letter vaguely threatening us that they would take further action if we did not return the funds. They also said they had been driven by on multiple occasions because they ""have fond memories of the house"" and that we hadn't done any maintenance which is both untrue and disturbing to me.  Questions:  1. Are we in the right to keep the funds? 2. If they take me to (what I assume would be small claims court) should I get an attorney or handle it myself?"	No
"So, I have a scenario. There is a year long lease signed. In this lease is the classic ""This Lease Contract will automatically renew month-to-month unless either party gives at least 60 days (not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days) written notice of termination or intent to move-out as required by paragraph 35."" clause.   The lease then states rent goes up to 150% when the auto-renewal kicks in for the month-to-month lease.  If a tenant moves out on the lease end date, but never gives notice to anyone, is the maximum the tenant is liable for two months @ 150%? Surely the contract cannot continue in perpetuity, but anything more than 2 months rent @ 150% seems incorrect to me."	No
I'm asking on behalf of my friend, so I may have some details incorrect.    As part of my friend's divorce agreement, he co-signed on his ex-wife's lease for a new apartment.  My friend has never resided in the apartment, and in fact lives out of state.  The initial year is over, and he no longer wants to be on the hook for this, however he is being told that since he was on the original lease, he must remain on any future leases if she is to remain in the apartment.  Is this true?  Does he have any recourse to have himself removed from the lease without her moving?  Thank you!	No
Last Spring I signed a lease, with three other guys at a brand new apartment near my college. The apartment was still under construction and we were assured that it would be open by next semester. Today I received an email and phone call informing me that the apartment will be unable to open by the set date of September 2nd, but rather will be ready by December 29th. Now im given two options by the apartment:  Option 1- cancel the lease and receive the security deposit back, and have to find a different apartment to stay at 5 weeks before school starts.  Option 2- dont cancel the lease, move in on December 29th (if its even ready by then), and receive a $1500 concession for staying with them. id also need to find an apartment to stay at for 4 months.   I really don't know my options here, all around its terrible. there is no apartment up there that i can stay at for 4 months without having to terminate a lease, also the 1500 doesn't even come close to what 4 months of rent would be up there. i was thinking i could maybe try and get them to pay the cancellation fee for an apartment, but i don't think they'd do that.  p.s. if there is a better subreddit for this question please let me know, thanks	No
"Hi reddit, I'm posting on behalf of a friend of mine that can't access the Internet so sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'll try. My friend's phone was dropped into water by her manager at work. The manager asked if her phone was waterproof, she said kinda and that was it. She wasn't aware of how bad the damage was until she tried to charge it after work. This caused her house to short circuit. She had an electrician come in then he called some other guy and he said it will cost $20,000 as the whole house will need to be rewired. Now I'm not sure if that number is realistic, I'm also not sure what they should do as they have just finished paying off their mortgage. When my friend told her manager what happened he basically said ""if this is you trying to get money from me don't even try"" so yeh. Also this happened in NZ if that helps and my friend is not a legal adult yet."	No
New York STATE. So I purchased a vehicle on may 2, the temporary tags expired on the 31st. I called the dealer and notified him that the temp registration had expired and he said that he would extend the date in his computer, I spoke with him last week about not recieving any registration from the dmv still and he said that he would extend it again until we know whats going on. Well today I got pulled over and given a ticket for expired registration that expired on the original date of may 31st. I called the dealer and he said to email him the ticket and that he would get it taken care of. Not sure what I am supposed to do in this situation, is this something the dealer can take care of or am I going to be forced to go to court for this?	No
"I've had a lot of issues with neighbors on my floor. Just for some background I live in a huge 15 story apartment building with a ton of apartments. I don't know how many but probably 100-200. It's pet friendly but all pets are supposed to be leashed in the public areas including halls.   My neighobrs don't do that and their dog is out of control. I've been attacked 3 times now but when I called police and animal control they didn't care that I had to go to the hospital the first 2 times because the dog didn't bite me. When I complained to the apartment managers about the unrestrained dog I was told the first time that I need to be more careful on stairs and not blame other people if I fall and then the second time I was told that I chose to leave my apartment when injured and it's not anyone's fault but my own if I'm knocked over. It's all a bunch of bullshit really.   The third time is the only one the police and animal control are willing to take seriously because the dog did bite me and caused a lot of damage and pain. I took advantage of this to finally get the dog removed from my home while I deal with the court issues and stuff like that. But since then I've gotten an eviction notice citing some disturbance and safety clauses because people no longer want me to live here, so I'm creating a disturbance.   I found out from a neighbor that the dog owners wrote some long sob story about how I've had it out for them forever and baited their dog with poisoned meat into attacking me. It's all lies. The dog attacked me when I was returning from an outdoor meal with food in my hands. People are all up in arms about htis in the community and the office has received ""dozens of valid concerns that I'm a threat to them and their pets"" and they want me out by the 15th or they'll have me evicted. It sounded like they were going to try and get me out sooner with some sort of protective order but I can't really see what the community comments are and the neighbor who told me what was going on felt uneasy getting involved by letting me know anything. In the meantime I can't use any amenities (gym, laundry) because other residents dont feel safe that I still live here??   I'd like to sue the asses off everyone I can for this. Can I? Like the neighbors and the office staff here for letting this wild dog run around unchecked, attack me 3 times, and then try to evict me?"	No
Just like it says in the title, I'm paid $27,040 salary plus a tiered commission based on my sales. My employer claims he doesnt have to pay OT and expects me to work late to meet with clients and also has me work 8 hours overtime every other week for marketing events outside of work.   Obviously its time to find a new job but my question is, is he correct? I can't find anything concrete through google.	No
"Good Morning,  I'm writing this as a request to find out what I should do with regards to patient abuse. The patient in question is my father, and below I've copied the draft that my mother, a RN nurse of 20+ years, wrote.  Essentially my father's back was messing up and we had to go to the ER at the VA due to urinary incontinence and met Dr. A.  Dr. A was condescending, told them they should not be there because the ER is for people with real problems, (cancer, amputations, etc), and asked if my father had any bowel problems. Dr.A was told no, and then insisted on doing 2 anal exams. He never washed his hands, did not physically help my father orient himself, barked orders at him while my father was struggling to move, and threatened to send him home because sphincter tone was normal.   My mother questioned Dr.A about the urinary incontinence because our primary care physician told us to come in specifically when that occurs. Dr.A ordered a bladder scan, saw the urinary incontinence times 2, then transferred us to the Harborview ER (Seattle).   Below is the draft letter that my mother wrote to file a complaint, and i was hoping I could get some feedback/help with ensuring that it is received with the amount of urgency that it deserves.  Looking for criticisims/edits/review, as well as legal advice for proceeding forward.   We are located in Seattle, Wa.   ***Draft Letter***  	July 12‚Äô 2017 Attn:  Medical Center Director 	I am sending this complaint in regards to an ER visit for my husband, Patient, on June 18‚Äô 2017.  	My husband was being treated at the American Lake VA since late May‚Äô 2017 for a back injury.  He‚Äôd been to PT with a referral in for Neurology and Sports Medicine d/t quickly progressive symptoms.   During the course of 1 week he went from walking independently to being given a cane and then a rolling walker by PT.  We were instructed at the last MD appointment to go to ER if any difficulty with urination occurred or if pain became intolerable.   	On Sunday, June 18‚Äô2017, we ended up in the Seattle VA ER d/t 2 episodes of incontinence/retention over the past 3 days and intolerable pain.  I arrived with my husband assisting him to ambulate with the rolling walker d/t him being barely able to stand.   	Dr. A was our ER doctor.  His attitude from the moment he stepped into our room was condescending and dismissive.  He showed nothing but disregard for my husband‚Äôs condition stating that people usually come into the ER for real problems such as Cancer or Amputations.  My husband had severe progressive numbness, tingling and pain down his right leg, all of which occurred over the course of 1 week.  He asked my husband if he had any bowel incontinence and was told no.  He then decided to perform a sphincter exam x2 with obvious force with both penetrating entries and no handwashing at any time.  Afterwards he did not wipe the gel off either time but left him there on his side struggling to move in severe pain.   Of note, this is for a man who can‚Äôt lie straight d/t back pain and can barely move without assistance.  This was all after bowel incontinence had already been denied.  Dr. A was ready to send my husband home until I questioned him about the episodes of urinary incontinence.  He then decided a bladder US would be in order, which should have been done as opposed to a rectal exam for the initial complaint.    After the US showed urinary retention after multiple attempts he transferred us to the Harborview ER.  On the transfer form he noted my husband to be ambulatory as if he was independent, no note of 1 person assist or ambulatory aide needed.    The end result being my husband was admitted and MRI showed a moderate L5-S1 disc herniation with nerve impingement.  He‚Äôs since had a microdiscectomy performed and is now healing.   	I understand many people have back pain, but for Dr. A to be so dismissive of a person is poor practice and abuse of his own perceived power.  He is a bully to the point he is on the line of patient abuse.    I don‚Äôt believe this man is fit to work with patients, especially a vulnerable population such as veterans.  My biggest concern are for the patients in the VA system who have no one to speak for them.  Most veterans are not knowledgeable of how patients should be treated.  The treatment and testing from Dr. A for my husband was wrong and abusive.    									Sincerely,  									Patient Wife"	No
I apologise for the phone formatting  I recently purchased a home in mid May and was able to move in at the end of May. In the past few days we have had rather hard rains but nothing out of the norm for a summer storm. There was never any flooding problems disclosed when purchasing the home but today and Friday water is coming in from under the trim in the basement. Is there anything legally I can do about this?   Water is pooling in the front of the house on top of a brick walkpath towards the front door and it has to be draining into the soil next to the house which is draining into the basement. The carpet in the basement is getting sufficiently wet where it and the padding is completely soaked. After the storm was done half of the basement was completely soaked on the same side that the water had pooled.   Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks	No
So I posted on Craigslist looking for women or couples who will let me jerk off in their panties/thongs (yes, I'm weird).  A guy emailed me about it, but when I asked if he would ask for or if he had his girl's permission this is what he said:  She wouldn't be into it. But she won't find out either. I've cum in her panties many times and put them back in her drawer. She's never known.  I've even used her when she's passed out drunk and cum on her face. She never knew.   Is there a way to report this? If so, how do I do it and is there a way to do it anonymously?  Will I have to talk to the police myself, or can I just submit the emails?  I'm kind of freaked out right now, and would like to avoid doing this publicly because I'm kind of embarrassed about my craigslist post/fetish...  All I have is his email address and the messages.  I have not yet responded to that last email	No
So I know there are tons of gaming news websites out there and all of them use screenshots, but I'm a newbie when it comes to the legal aspect.  Am I required to ask the game developer/publisher for permission? Do I have to reference the source?   Or can I just freely publish any screenshots I took myself of the game in the context of news or updates to the game.  Any help would be appreciated.	No
I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother.   Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.  I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge.   Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three? Im just wondering if this is worth doing or if I am going to be doing the same thing wether i manage to get the weed charge off or not.  All input is appreciated, Thanks	No
I signed a lease and paid the security deposit for an apartment in a building that was under construction which they assured me would be ready by July 1st. It's now the 12th and it's still not ready. The landlord says it's the electric company that keeps delaying their end of things but when I visit the property it's obvious there have been significant delays from his end also. He says he will pro-rate the rent based on whatever date we end up moving in and the lease basically says that is all he is liable for. Is that legal? Shouldn't he be liable for more or am I screwed either way because I signed the lease?	No
I was interviewed by an older gentleman who told me that online training would be unpaid, but any orientation within the building would be compensated. Is this legal?	No
FYI, the landlord is my mother. In September, I agreed to rent one of her properties for $800 per month. No lease was ever presented to me, so there is no signed agreement.  Over the next several months, my mother (a full-blown narcissist) eventually estranges everyone she knows, including my dad, all three of her children, and all three of their spouses, by saying some truly horrible things that she cannot take back (one small example: in a group text, she told everyone in our family that my wife was only with me for the money, and was not stupid enough to ever have children with me, and that she would eventually leave me) (my wife was not amused). She has recently initiated a divorce against my father (amazing man, btw, my top role model in life).  Now, she has sent me a text message saying she wants to increase my rent from $800 to $1050 (31.25%). I have not responded. Actually, we haven't spoken in two or three months.  ------------------------  I can easily afford this rent increase, and I do think the proposed rate is fair for the unit. However, I am not feeling particularly inclined to cooperate right now, given she's been fairly horrible to everyone in the family, myself and my wife included.  So, here is my plan. And please let me know if you can see any problems with it.  1) I am going to ignore her request to increase rent. It was sent via text message, is counter to our existing agreement, there is no lease, and to the best of her knowledge I have blocked her texts and calls anyway. I will actually continue to avoid contact entirely.  2) I will continue to mail her rent checks for $800 on a monthly basis. The payment history is already very well established, as I have always paid with checks, which she has been depositing.  3) My wife and I want to move out, quickly. We are currently looking at houses, and are planning on buying within 2-4 months, and already have a number of candidates that fit what we are looking for and are in our price range.  4) We plan on giving my mother 30 days written notice that we are moving out. Once we are out, the unit will be open for either a) renting out to a new tenant, or b) my father moving in. Personally, I'm a very big fan of Option B.  As there is no lease, I feel like I am fairly well protected. I do like to plan for the worst case scenario though, which would entail my mother continuing to go nuclear against her family and possibly trying to evict my wife and I. Chances of that happening are only about 15%, I think, as long as I do not poke the bear by opening my mouth and talking to her. But I think that if she did decide to do that, we would be moved into our new home by the time anything could ever come of it anyway.  Thoughts?	No
Lets say my manager figures out who it is and they confess, is there anyway to force them to give back the money without going to court? it was only 100$ but still, what is stopping them from confessing and running out the door? Is there anyway the police can get my money back?  BC Canada	No
I bought a truck on Craigslist I tried to do my research looked up the vin and wasn't stolen or damaged. When I made the deal took a picture of the guys license and the license plate of the car he drove, I payed cash. when I went to go register the truck they told me the trucks title was fake as well as the owners license but that since the truck wasn't stolen they could make me a bonded title but would need to contact the police. The police came and told me they needed to take a truck and open an investigation that if everything was fine it would be returned in a weeks top. It has been almost a month and I haven't heard anything back. What can I do ?	No
I moved away from a apartment complex a few months ago, however the water sub-metering company is still sending me water bills for hundreds of gallons of water (dated months after I had moved). I have contacted them to notify them that I no longer live there, but they claim that the apartment complex needs to notify them who they should charge, and it's my responsibility to pay the bill until that is done.  I called up the old apartment complex, and they claim that they have already notified the company.  How should I avoid these charges going to collection?	No
Hey guys, so, currently I am in MA as a j1 student. And upon my arrival my landlord took 500$ from me. Now, 250 were for rent, and the rest were a security deposit. Now, he didn't give me a contract, and he didn't give me a receipt. I payed that money in cash. That was 7th of June. Fast forward to today, and he hasn't come to ask for money once, until a couple of days ago, and he wants 1000$ in cash. Now my question is, since I have no lease, and the money he is charging me (12000$ for a single bedroom apartment/we are 4 people so 3000 each for the whole summer) is way too much. Not only that, I am here for about 4 months, and my rent is 3000 for the summer, but I know people who are here for 2 months, and they pay 3000 as well. My question is, what can he do if I don't pay my rent?	No
About two weeks ago our landlord sent us and email to let us know some work would be done on the house today. However, she did not mention that we would wake up to find ourselves without power. I am supposed to be doing work from home but I'm dependent on my Internet connection. Do I have any right to take legal action? Compensation for lost wages?	No
I'm in California.  My city has a law that old people are allowed to have pets regardless of what it says in their lease.    If I don't want pets in my house, can I just refuse to rent to anyone who is old enough to be covered by the law?  I'm renting 2 bedrooms in my house and the tenants would be sharing the kitchen and living areas.	No
My friends mom died and did have a will, naming her as executor. Her mom was single, her parents are both deceased. I'm helping her with a checklist of what she needs to do to close her estate, I'm wondering if probate lawyers need payment up front or will they take payment once the estate is settled? She doesn't have much money but her mom does. Any advice is very helpful.	No
Hi all--in my last month living with my previous roommate he failed to pay rent and it was taken out of my security deposit. I have tons of text messages and social media messages between he and I wherein he confirms this is true and he's making excuses for when he will pay me. I sent a formal demand letter and will be taking him to small claims court if he doesn't respond. Are my text messages enough proof if I don't have a statement signed by him? Thanks. 	No
In the lease for my prospective new apartment there is a clause that allows me to terminate my lease, after 30 days notice. The clause states that I must pay liquidated damages equal to two months rent ($3160).   I do not mind agreeing to liquidated damages in the event of an early termination. Considering I must give 30 days notice and the typical turn around time for apartments like this is 60 days, I feel one months rent as damages should suffice.   How do I go about negotiating this aspect of my lease?	No
Hi all,  Me and my wife live in Virginia as tenants in an apartment building, it's a condo and our unit is managed by a management company. We have been informed that the water pipes in the build will be changed in two phases from top to bottom. Each phase is told to last 5 business days from 8am to 5:30pm. During these working hours we are not going to have water available in one bathroom in the first phase and in the other bathroom and the kitchen in the second phase. And, there will be 8-9 people coming in and out of our apartment.   On the other hand, we are expecting a baby which has due date very close to the construction dates so we will be having workers working in our home, we won't have any water in one bathroom and any access to our bedroom during day time and there will probably be a newly born baby with some family members around.  I was wondering if there's a way I can get compensated from the landlord or the management company for this. We were not told initially about this, and the construction company has been changing the start date of the project many times.   Thank you for your help in advance!	No
There was no eviction, I had given a 30 day notice on a month to month lease.  I was cleaning up small details and clock hit midnight on the 30th day and landlord stormed in and caused a scene. Called the cops and demanded I leave. I didn't and cops said this was a civil matter. I ended up wrapping up the cleaning and leaving thirty minutes after midnight.    what are my options, if any?	No
I have no contract with my subletter, and I allowed his girlfriend stay with us for a month for an extra 200 dollars. A month later, and he is now telling me he's not paying me anything extra, but she is still going to live in his room &amp; use the communal facilities and storage spaces  against my will.   What can I legally do to get her to leave? My first thought is to call the police on her for trespassing, but she now has a key to the apartment.   He's also refusing to pay last month's rent and wants me to use the security deposit instead, which is a problem because he built a bike rack on the ceiling and is refusing to take it down before he leaves. Would it be illegal eviction if I change the locks?	No
"Throwaway here.  About five months ago, we moved into a house that has five bedrooms with one bigger master bedroom/bath, and four other roughly equally sized rooms. Five people moved into this house initially, with myself and my SO living in the master bedroom.   After we signed the lease (with only four of us on it, myself, SO, and two others) we tried to come to an agreement on who would pay what on how the rent was divided, all done through a group message. Because the top two incomes on the lease weren't enough, we needed a cosigner on the lease, which my family member stepped in to be. What we eventually decided on, was that SO and I would pay 460 for the master, and each upstairs bedroom would be 410. I would also subsidize the cost of the upstairs bedroom that was going unoccupied by paying an additional 410 a month, with the explicitly defined understanding that if we ever filled that fifth bedroom with a sixth person, that person would be paying the 410 instead and no one that is staying in an upstairs bedroom for 410 has their rent changed at all.  Everyone in the group message, in writing, agreed to this. I have screenshots.   Now we've picked up a sixth roommate, and the roommates have begun talking about renegotiating the spread of the rent. I brought up the screenshotted conversation and agreement we made months earlier that everyone agreed to, and two of the roommates said that this was now ""unfair"" and we should renegotiate. The other roommate flat out rejected all of our negotiations for various reasons, and ultimately said if we couldn't come to an agreeable resolution, he would be moving out at the end of the month. In writing, I asked if he was going to move his stuff out, stop residing at the residence, and stop paying rent, even though his name was the one on the lease, and he said yes, so now I have written confirmation.  The other roommates are also unhappy with the fact that we want to stick with the original agreement we all agreed to, but they have not threatened to move out.  If he does end up moving out, I'm afraid the cosigner and I will be held responsible for paying for this guy's rent while he gets off scot free to live wherever else he chooses. If we don't pay it, then we get evicted within 3 days of the rent being due.   Currently looking, but there so far don't seem to be any prospects that are taking over his room.  What options do I have? Am I shit out of luck? If he moves out, violating the terms of the lease, can I pay his portion for the rest of the lease and go after him for it in small claims? I legitimately don't know, and it doesn't look like a compromise will be reached any time soon. Any help would be appreciated."	No
I am shocked and embarrased and upset right now. I have no idea what to do. This is my first offense ever and the only way I can expunge my record is if I wait two years. I'm 17 and a senior in high school and was planning on applying to Ivy League but now that's obviously not going to happen. I have no idea what to do to move past this. 	No
Back in March, T-Mobile had a promotion where you could add another line to your account completely for free. Naturally, I got on it along with my mom, to be added to my sister's account.   Before this, I had an iPhone 5S, and my mom had a flip phone from TracFone. When we switched to T-Mobile, I received an SE and gave my 5S to my mom. We also got new SIM cards. My mom's number changed back in almost minutes, but my number didn't change. It turned into days, weeks, and now months.   We've tried everything to get my original number back, but it seems that either TracFone or T-Mobile is just refusing. Is there any legal action I can take to demand they give me back my number?	No
The second woman that hit me made it clear she would rather pay out of pocket than have a claim on her insurance.  I realize it may not be the most ethical thing to do, but would I be breaking any laws to accept a cash payment from her, and make a claim with the other rear-enders insurance?  I realize it's a bit shady, I just need to be clear on whether or not I would be breaking any laws.	No
"I was in a minor car accident where my car reversed into another car who also reversing.  The damage to my car was much more severe, and the opposing driver had light damage. I was parked legally, while the other driver was parked in a spot that clearly stated ""no parking"".  Who is considered liable in your opinion? Do I have any defense?  Thanks!"	No
So, after a long, mentally and emotionally brutal 4 months of living with my ex, she finally moved out in mid July, however her portion of the rent was unpaid. Since I have been in charge of paying the rent using the online service provided for us to submit payments, I went ahead and used her saved account to pay the prorated amount she owed (($669/31 days)*17 days = $367). Apparently this caused her to overdraft her account and incur a $35 fee from her bank. Following this, her father has been messaging me on facebook, telling me to pay the $35 to her or he will file a police report. I'm not sure if I did something against the law, however I know next to nothing about the laws surrounding this sort of incedent. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and thank you in advance.	No
A little backstory: I bought a fixer upper in 2015 for a great price with my parents help co signing. They have paid nothing toward closing, the mortgage, or anything ever. Just had their signatures. I had a baby, went through pretty bad postpartum depression, didn't work, didn't pay my bills correctly and got behind on my mortgage for about 6 months. With some help from my boyfriends family, we got everything back on track and have paid on time since. My father was understandably stressed as we all were because paying your mortgage late isn't good, I know that. So he has been wanting us to sell it or refinance to get his name off the mortgage. I'm in no position to refinance and I agreed that we need to put it on the market-when we get most of it fixed up. We bought the house with equity and once it's sold we should be looking at a profit of anywhere between 15-30k depending on how much we put into it. He wants us to sell right now even though we're in the middle of a few big projects and when I say right now, he wants it listed ASAP. He said that he and  his lawyer are prepared to essentially 'evict' us if we don't do what he wants us to. Can this even happen? I just went through all of my paperwork from closing on the house and from what I can see if anything we are all equal owners. My mom is 100 percent behind me but obviously wants to keep the peace among everyone as well. So with all that said, does anyone have any insight to this? I'm thinking about contacting a local lawyer myself but I'm not sure how good that will do.	No
"In Dec 2006, I was in the process of making a move across several states. While driving up, I admittedly going WAY too fast, trying to make it to a job interview in my new state. (I previously had never had any traffic tickets.)  Anyways, I got pulled over in Dinwiddie VA, ticketed and cited with ""Reckless Endangerment"" for how fast I was speeding. This was also the last time I drove, as I was in a friend's car (with her egging me on, speedwise. No excuse, but I shouldn't have given in to peer pressure) as I had already sold my own to finance the move.  Because every last dime I had went to a new place to live, I couldn't afford to a.) pay a ticket or b.) even make it back to where I was ticketed to go to court.  It's been nearly 8 years, and having this outstanding ticket has been killing me. I've wanted to set it right, go to court, take my punishment and move on with my life. I've been utilizing public transportation for the last 7+ years, as I'm certain my license was revoked.  I'm still dirt-poor, but finally in a place, financially, where I'm getting close to having enough to afford a lawyer, the trip and hopefully the ticket, so I went back to the VA General District Court website for the first time in a few years, and it appears that it was dismissed last year?  Is that possible?  Under the ""Hearing Information"" it has two dates with different results:  01/28/2010- Continued  05/09/2016- Finalized  And under ""Disposition Information"" it says  Final Disposition: Dismissed  Everything else under ""Disposition Information"" is blank, or set to 0. (Like Sentence/Suspended Sentence/Probation/Operator License Suspension Time...)  I was expecting to pay something to the tune of $2500+ to settle this out. Does that mean it's gone and I don't have to go to court/pay a ticket?  Could I walk into a VA DMV (I reside in VA, just on the other side of the state) and get a new license after so many years, or am I looking at consequences for letting it go this long?"	No
So I was an idiot and signed a year's apartment lease without noticing that there was a notice that the building is being converted to condominiums at an unspecified date, and that we can be obligated to leave because of this. My roommate saw this and won't sign, and neither will her co-signer. Am I still held to this lease and responsible for covering all of the rent? The contract does not allow subletters. In the event that we can leave, are we entitled our security deposit back?  Los Angeles people, does this kind of notice to convert and remodel generally mean that demolition would occur during my lease?	No
"So, long story short, I am one day away from closing on a home when I find out the home has been designated as Affordable Housing. I do not qualify for affordable housing (income too high) and the house was being sold above the legal value.    I was notified of the ""Affordable Housing"" status a day before closing by my lawyer who finally discovered it. This is in the U.S. in Westchester County, New York.  I was under contract, invested $650 for the inspection, $400 for the mortgage appraisal, $300+ in transportation fees to get up to see the house (had to rent a car and take a train often due to lack of car due to living in Manhattan) and an unknown sum in lost wages due to the hours spent dealing with this process (I am in sales, so the unknown amount is lost sales).  Am I at fault here? I have never tried to purchase a home. But, it seems to me that someone should have been aware of this before I spent so much time (2 months from first viewing to the day before closing on the house and finding I cannot buy it due to its status). Is it my realtor's fault? The seller's fault? The lawyer's? Due I have any recourse for getting my investment back?  I would understand if I lost the inspection money and mortgage assessment money because I backed out on the house or had financial problems, but I didn't. We were under contract. I thought this was going forward.  I am sort of at a loss here. Any help is greatly appreciated!   Signed,  Renter for life!"	No
My roommate and I gave our 60 days notice July 10 that we wanted to end our lease. The landlady replied that the 60 days begins at the beginning of the next month: since the lease is month to month and not day to day, that means sixty days is a renter's sixty meaning month to month.  I can't find that logic anywhere when I search tenant laws or policies. Is she right? Is this something known but not said??  We're pretty sure she's wrong, but it'd be nice to have a legal reason to give her on why she's wrong.	No
I'm in the middle of a five year lease in the United Kingdom.  The council rates and lease payments are killing my business and I'm wondering if there is anyway out of my lease.  Any advice towards this goal would be greatly appreciated! 	No
I was hired as a full time worker, receiving benefits such as PTO, vacation, and holiday pay. When i was hired i was working 32 hours a week (which is considered full time to the corporation). about 6-7 months ago my manager cut a day of work and my hours fell under 30 hours, but i still accumulated benefits and maintained full time status. I have always been available to work 30+ hours but the former manager scheduled me less. Now there is a change in management that noticed this, we worked out a schedule where i went back to working 30+ hours (i have this conversation recorded on my phone). Corporate HR rejected the idea of me working those hours and changed my status to part time, took away my benefits and are asking me to pay back the benefits i had accumulated (holiday pay, PTO , vacation) on full time status, totaling to over $1700. I came into work when i was told to come in, and no one mentioned anything to me about loss of benefits or meeting 30 hours in the last 6 - 7 months. i get paid biweekly so thats at least 12 pay periods that this went unnoticed and was never notified to me. Now they want me to pay them back because i worked under 30 hours at the request of my former manager, even though i was available to work 30 + hours. if it means anything, the former manager has left the company and moved to the other side of the country from us.

I was sold a car from an ad on Craigslist and I was completely mislead by the owner. The car has major issues that he didn't tell us about. I took the car to the mechanic today (a day after buying it) and he said it's completely unsafe to drive. The seller said it just needs a tune up but that wasn't the case. The muffler was on its last legs,there's a hole under the passengers side seat that you can put your hand through. The car wouldn't start for our mechanic and it had to be pushed out of the garage and left in the parking lot. I have pictures as well. My mechanic said I could have a lawsuit on my hands against the seller. How can I get my money back?	No
Bought a house at the beginning of the year with my now ex-girlfriend and her parents. I am on the mortgage and the deed to the house. It was probably a very stupid thing to do but I really thought I was going to marry her, had the ring picked out and everything. Fast forward 7 months and she told me she is unhappy and thinks we should break up. So my question to you oh great lawyers of Reddit, is what do I do next.	No
"Hi all,   So I had a lapse of judgment and got caught up in a craigslist apartment rental scam. I live in NY, and was in NY when I transferred a security deposit plus 6 months rent to a 'landlords' bank account for an apartment I was going to rent in California. It wasn't until the landlord requested a $10K 'immediate refundable credit check' that required me sending him an additional $10K that he would then immediately send back, that I became suspicious. I have never met this landlord, nor seen the apartment, and in retrospect there were a lot of signs that this was a scam that I missed. Since requesting this credit check from, I have taken the following actions:  -I saved and printed out my email conversation, and all text messages, with the individuals I was in contact with.  -I researched who the real owner of the apartment is, and have been trying to get in touch with that individual to confirm he is not renting out his apartment. I want to be 100% sure this is a scam, with proof, which is why I've reached out to him.  -I called a local California police department, and they directed me to go to a NY police department since ""I was in NY at the time I made the funds transfer, therefore I am a victim in NY and should go through a NY police department"".   -I went to a NY precinct with the emails / texts / bogus lease printed out. In order to confirm this was a scam, the NY officer told me to request from the landlord a refund in the form of a bank certified check (that way I don't have to give him my bank account info). If the landlord refused to refund my cash, the police officer said I could return to the station to file a police report. He also said that I should call up the Cali PD again and push to have them work on this, since the apartment is in Cali and since I'm moving there in a week.   -Today, I am going to go to my bank of america branch and talk with someone there about possibly reversing the transfers I sent. I will also call the scammers bank and see if they can freeze his account.  -After the bank, I plan on heading to the FBI offices in NYC with all of the evidence that I have (the texts, emails, lease, bank transfers, name of real owner, the scammers bank info) and hope to convince them to look at the case. I'm going to say that this scammer could be scamming other people as well, and therefore it's worth their time.    Other than that, I'm not sure what routes I can go. Any thoughts are appreciated with regards to the best path moving forward."	No
"So a while back, my mom purchased a house in Brooklyn for my uncle and my grandparents to live in and added my uncle's name as a homeowner in addition to her own.   My uncle recently decided that he wanted to sell the house and my mom doesn't want him to because doing so will result in my grandparents becoming homeless (we don't have room in our apartment to take them in at the moment and my mom doesn't want to put them in a retirement home). I can hear my mom arguing with him on the phone, but he doesn't seem to care what she thinks or wants, and my grandparents aren't saying anything to my uncle because they don't want to upset him (even though he's always been completely unreasonable in everything he does, they've done this for years because he's a ""special"" individual).  So back to the point of my post, can my uncle legally sell the house even if my mom doesn't consent? Not sure if this is relevant information, but my mom and I live in New Jersey and she can't go to New York at the moment because of work. I'm not really sure how the process for home selling goes either and I can't find any answers from my google searches, so I wanted to see if I could get some information from here so I can help my mom. I'm willing to ask my mom for answers to any questions if that will help too.  Thanks in advance!"	No
Hi, my grandmother rented her house out through a management company to some tenants. They left saying that the house was 'unsuitable for living' citing various minor things that had broken while they were here (e.g. a sliding shower door came off the track). They sent the management company a letter saying that if we gave them the full security deposit, they would not take us to court over being forced to live in those conditions.  The house had suffered major damage due to a large pet they were not supposed to have breaking through porch screens and destroying blinds etc. We spent way more than the deposit fixing this damage.   They moved out in December 2017. We didn't think they had a case so we told our management company not to release the deposit. We moved in in January 2018 so we are no longer with the management company.  Eight months later: We asked the management company what happened and they said the tenant's lawyer never contacted them. They said they would reach out to the tenants again. The management company called us later saying that they would offer for the tenant to keep half of the deposit and for us to keep half of the deposit.   Today they called and said that the tenant refused this deal and that my grandmother is going to have to appear in court to fight it, or hire an attorney to fight for her.   My grandmother is inclined to do whatever is easiest to avoid a problem, but I worry the management company is lying to her. The company is acting a little suspicious and I think they may have already released the deposit to the tenants to avoid a problem. (For reference, it's a small company of 2 people). At no time during their tenancy (or now) did we have any contact with the tenants. We know their names but we don't have any contact information with them. We have never met them.  Sorry for the long post, I tried to keep things vague because I have 1 question:  Is the dispute really between the tenants and my grandmother, or is it between the tenants and the management company?	No
One of my roommates is moving out on August 5th. She hasn't been the most courteous person through the leaving process. A few days ago, we got the utility/internet bill and everyone was told their money was due yesterday so I can pay the bill on time. The roommate in question hasn't paid yet and hasn't answered my texts following up.   I can't cut her off from utilities, but it's not illegal in my state to cut her from from internet. If she isn't paying her share, it's stealing, and I don't want that. The internet is in my name only, so no issues cutting her off from that perspective, whether that be changing the wifi password, blacklisting her devices via MAC, etc. However, the router currently being used is hers. This is where I fear any kind of legal complications. Am I subject to any legal ramification if I change the wifi password? It's my internet, but her router.  Due to budgeting, I can't afford to buy a new router until she moves out, so buying a new one isn't an immediate option.	No
Just renegotiated my lease to a lower price for the upcoming school term. I accidentally signed a couple pages accepting a higher price, but negotiated the monthly rent to a lower price. Is this sufficient documentation in the court of law for cancellation of my old lease so that I'm not liable for two leases if I sign my newly negotiated lease? this was sent by email by the property manager.  http://imgur.com/Kq6xQhi  for obvious reasons the black markings are my only markings	No
... and I live in Naperville, IL (Will County); and live almost half a mile from the nearest man-made lake. My house was newly built 6 years ago. It first flooded around 18 months after we moved in causing around $3000 of damage. This one wasn't too bad since the water had only seeped into the unfinished parts of our basement and we did not need to replace any of the carpet or the padding. Several other houses in our neighborhood had also flooded at the time and many people were experiencing similar damages (not too extensive, no need to replace their entire carpeting or anything). This didn't really cause too much worry to us so we didn't take any additional action other than draining out the water.  2 years later, our basement was completely flooded with nearly 5 inches of water everywhere. All the carpet was soaked, some of our valuables ruined; over $10,000 in damages. At this point, we hired plumber to re-irrigate our house to ensure that all water that comes near our house would be drained into a set of pipes and pumped into the sewage system. We also had the plumber add two more sump pumps in our basement so that the total pumping capacity is enough for a house more than triple the size of ours. We replaced all of the carpet with tile so that if it ever flooded again, we would not need to replace the floor. Our home insurance company also told us we were too much of a liability and attempted to sever future ties, unless we increased our deductible to $2,500. Though it might not have been the best decision, we went through with it. However, our minds were slightly rested since we re-irrigated and added in the new sump pumps.  They say that the 3rd time is the charm. My house flooded AGAIN. After we installed 3 sump pumps, after we re-irrigated. It somehow managed to flood again. The only explanation I could think of is that my house lies on top of a waterbed. So any time it rains too much, the water level rises under the ground and starts seeping into my house too quickly. When we built this house, on this specific lot, shouldn't it have come with a warning label of some sort? Shouldn't the builders have tested to see if there's too much water in the area to build a house. Or shouldn't the lot have at least been devalued because of this?  I'm just not sure what exactly to do, if our house continues to flood every two years, we can't continue to pay for the damages each time. We have home insurance, but even after last time they threatened to leave us. New insurance companies won't come near us either due to our high risk and liability. Not entirely sure if this was the right subreddit to post on, but I just need a little advice.	No
She's got BPD and bipolar with mental trauma from being molested as a toddler by her parents, and she's recently been put on new meds which caused all sorts of psychosis and delusions until they kicked in.  Three years ago, her 8 year old nephew was staying the night with her and bugging the he'll out of her. She put half a MG of klonopin in his drink so he would go to sleep. Her new meds are making her feel guilty for all her past wrongs, but she told her therapist about this and was told it has to be reported to the hotline on Monday.   We're in Arkansas, what can we expect? She's on disability and her mental health can't handle jail. I'm freaking out, she's calm.   During a bout of mania she told her sister, the boy's mother, a few weeks ago when she went to the hospital to try to be checked into behavioural health while her meds were asjusting. The mother didn't press charges, and those doctors didn't report it. What is going to happen? It's not like there's proof, and maybe the statute is up?	No
"My fianc√© and I recently took her late grandparents summer home and are flipping it into our full time home. We needed to fully replace to floor and to try and make the story short, we inquired about laminate flooring with a local flooring ""expert"" and he insisted laminate is junk, it'll warp, be bad do to the slight unlevelness of the existing floor, and that vinyl flooring would be best. He, in-depth, went into the pluses of vinyl to me and I felt comfortable. He said it won't warp with humidity, won't be bad with unlevel floor, that the adhesive glue will grab it and it'll never come up...  First red flag, was that the floor would cost $6,200. He said he needs $4,000 at contract signing, and took almost 3-4 weeks to start the floor. After the floor started getting prepped and smoothed, he said the manufacturer didn't have our floor we picked... So why did you need $4k like a month ago? Whatever, we ended up picking a thicker vinyl flooring vs what we originally picked, which was a thin plank and went forward.   So, he also said the floor would take 4 days, it is now the end of the second week, and the floor looks like SHIT. For one, the floor is what we picked, but it is the same thin-ness of the other one we originally chose and seems way to flimsy for the glue to hold down, causing the planks to lift up. All over the floor. He also dismantles my very expensive plug in fire place and didn't put it back together, as well as saying that the reason it is coming up is that it is humid, and the floor is un level, basically everything he warned us of with laminate.   To stop hearing that its from the humidity, I left the central air on today, and let him in and told him like 5-8 times that the central air is on, should help. My fianc√© went by while he was there when he was there, went in the house and the back door was open on a humid, 95 degree day with the central air on.  I refuse to pay the remaining $2,200, and how to I go about that? Is it worth it or to just sucker it up? First time home owner, never had to hire many people to do much, let a lone ass holes who can't stand by their work. Sorry this is long, it was also more venting as well. Thanks!"	No
So to make it short, I was out late driving on the highway and was pulled over while going slightly over 30 the speed limit, resulting in an over $400 ticket.  The ticket is not the issue, however, as I will pay for it.  The thing i'm worrying about is my parents insurance.  I know what I did was stupid and a giant mistake, and i'm wondering if there is anything I can do to reduce the hit on our insurance, or get it cleared off the record.  I am very unfamiliar with all of this so any help is very appreciated.  I'm 18 for anyone wondering, thank you Reddit in advance!  I've talked to a friend who was in a similar situation, and he suggested pleading not guilty and going to court to apologize to the officer and such.  I'm not sure how much this will help but i'm willing to try anything to remedy this mistake.  There's not a class to take in the county, either so I can't do that.	No
I came back to my apartment yesterday after studying at the library to see it on fire.  The cause of the fire was determined that the back left stove was on which heated a pan which then then heated a toaster which consequently caused the outlet it was plugged into to catch on fire.  My landlord is expecting me to pay, due to negligence, for the damages to the unit, i understand im liable for my personal property damaged.  However, in the pictures i took while the fire department was there none of the knobs on my stove where on.  In addition, the outlet which was the actual cause of the fire did not have Arc Fault Circuit interrupters which would have prevented the fire in the first place.  Also my stove had broke the in early June and had maintenance done on it by that apartment complex.  I am therefore asking where do i go from here? I am a college student and do not have any money to cover the cost of the damages	No
"I recently applied for a position in a VT branch of a major insurance provider. During my application, I had to agreement to private arbitration for any legal disputes before, during, and after any potential employment.   In addition to signing away any right to pursue a class action, disputes covered by the arbitration clause include things like sexual harassment, unpaid wages, discrimination against protected classes, overtime, and other issues clearly covered by both Vermont and federal labor law.  This is unlikely to ever be relevant for me, but I just want to understand, because this seems a little nuts to me. Basically, if this employer were to, say, refuse to pay me for wages I had earned, and I couldn't work it out through negotiation on my own, we would then go to a ""neutral"" third party selected by the employer. This neutral third party, while technically supposed to make a judgement based on actual law, could really do anything. They could just say, ""lol, you ain't gettin' paid"", and then I would get no money. I would not be able to appeal this decision... Is this correct?? I guess I don't understand the point of labor laws existing at all if employers can just have people, for practical purposes, sign away their rights. This can't be how it works, right?"	No
I currently work at a small SaaS company in a client support type of role. I do general troubleshooting and account setups, nothing on the technical side of things nor do I take part in the sales process.   I've recently got an interview with another, much larger, company in the same exact field, in a different state, doing something pretty similar but not dealing with clients nearly as much.   Well, comes to find out that I have a non-compete that prevents me from working in the industry for TWO YEARS after quitting or being let go. The non-compete was signed when I first started at a super entry level call center position.   Is there any way around this? This is my field of expertise and it would be really hard to find another job that I'm as good at in this field. Am I screwed and stuck at my current company until the end of time?	No
"Hey guys, I'm kind of freaking out cause it looks like my eyes will never get to be 20/20 and I'm out $4000+ due to my current situation..  This kind of a long drawn out process, so I‚Äôll just put everything in bullet form in chronological order:  ‚Ä¢	December 2016: LASIK (using Contura laser) performed by doctor A. Result is ok, no longer have to use glasses, but not even close to 20/20.  ‚Ä¢	March 2017: Go in for a check up and doctor A suggests an ‚Äúenhancement‚Äù surgery  ‚Ä¢	March 2017: Enhancement performed  ‚Ä¢	June 2017: Go in for another check up, vision still not improving, doctor A suggests another enhancement.  ‚Ä¢	June 2017: Wary of third surgery in the span of 7 months, I ask doctor A for medical records so I can get a second opinion.  ‚Ä¢	June 2017: Get a second opinion for doctor B. He says my cornea has now become too thin for any more surgeries. He says that doctor A over corrected my astigmatism during my first surgery, then tried to correct the over-correction during my enhancements, which did not work.   ‚Ä¢	June 2017: Share with doctor A what doctor B told me and recorded the conversation with his consent. Doctor A said that doctor B doesn‚Äôt know how to read the provided medical records because doctor A is using the ‚ÄúContura‚Äù laser which doctor B is not familiar or had training with. **With ultimate confidence, he went on to say that with one more enhancement, my eyes will be 20/20 and will not require any more enhancements for the rest of my life.**  ‚Ä¢	July 2017: Get a different second opinion from doctor C. The doctor echoes the opinion of doctor B and further went on to say that my cornea could be unstable at this very moment due to the two procedures. She said that due to my cornea thinness, there cannot be any more work done on my eyes now and for the rest of my life. Off the record, she went on to say that doctor A has a reputation in the community to perform reckless procedures and that the claims that he's making about how other doctors can't read his ""Contura"" laser is all ""bullshit"" because she has part of the Contura training as well.  At this point, I have lost all trust in doctor A and don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to not share any more information that I‚Äôve gathered. I am definitely considering moving forward with legal action. Do I have a case? What do you guys suggest I do? Do you guys have any recommendations for a lawyer that can handle this kind of case in San Diego?  Thank you!"	No
"Hopefully I can find out my rights here. I moved into a house with my sister and brother-in-law. They signed the lease for me in my stead while I was in the hospital. I paid the entirety of the first last and security by transferring the money to my sister with my phone. When I left the hospital I moved in with their help to aid in my recovery. My sister passed away of an medicine overdose in the middle of the first lease and her husband split. My girlfriend at the time I'm married quickly in that time frame moved in with me and we signed a new lease about a month later. The lease was verbally carrying out all of the terms of the first lease, though a few things seemed off ""due to his understanding of English"", but he was friendly enough to make this accommodation. I asked about the last month and he said all the terms from the first lease were carrying over. I fulfilled this lease but both my wife and I got hit with support payments to our exes and we needed to move. We couldn't afford this place anymore. I cashed in a retirement fund to carry us until a family property was ready on the 1st of September. We verbally agreed that the lease would be carried out month-to-month from there on out.   Back in may he told me he would be putting the house on the market in August. I told him our property wouldn't be ready until the 31st of August allowing us to move in there after. He agreed to find sympathetic tenants to what we needed but that he wanted to sign the lease before he left the country again as he is an Afghani. He asked me permission to show the property in June to a couple of families and I hesitantly agreed feeling this would keep us on even footing. Getting a house showroom-ready with three little girls and a pregnant wife is not easy but neither here nor there. While I was out of town in early July he signed a contract with one of the tenants he had shown the house to for them to move in August 15th. He is telling me I have to be out on the 10th to facilitate their move. I am sympathetic that he needs to rent a property particularly before school start but this is a heavy military area with families coming and going constantly. We had verbally agreed that I couldn't leave until the 1st of September and asked him out of Goodwill to give me two weeks to clean and move. He agreed again that would be fine he just needed to find sympathetic tenants and all would be well.   I am still disabled from my coma and other factors from my military service. My wife is pregnant. My oldest child is 10. The only money we have is for the August rent and it would not cover the expense of hiring movers to store our stuff a hotel or even the cost of eating out for that time. Basically there is no way to move there is nowhere to go until the property opens on the 1st of September.   This is not a slum property and we have taken wonderful care of it. The three times we received repairs from him he insistently and insultingly blamed us repeatedly for an HVAC that broke during a hurricane a screen door during the same storm and afterwards most of the area Psy huge increase end bug infestations and rat infestations and he proceeded to blame us despite an inadequate sealing around the house and a garage door window that's been broken since the day we moved in with promise after promise of repair that never came in. Our rent has been on time every month except for one month when my father passed away I was still only a few days late and he said he didn't care he just wanted it.  I apologize for the excessive details that I do not know what's relevant and what's not. I hope anyone here can help. Tldr; we're being forced to move, we can't move."	No
Hi r/legaladvice, I'd appreciate any information you guys have. About a month ago I resigned my lease to continue living in the apartment I've lived in for 3 years. However, today pretty surprisingly I was offered an amazing job out of the state that I want so badly to take, but I have no idea what to do since my lease starts on 08/1 and runs until next July. I tried to scan my lease to see if there were any listed penalties for breaking the lease, but couldn't find anything. I live in Florida and neither myself or the landlord has had any issues with me living there in the time I've been, minor expected repairs is about all that's ever happened and the only real time we've interacted. Is there any standard punishment/protocol for events like this? Is there a best/worst case scenario I should be aware of? Or am I just not going to realistically accept this job, which would be devastating. I would so appreciate any help!	No
Hi Guys,   I'm not a frequent redditor but I feel totally fucked over right now. I just got a new car a week ago. I'm underhand subleasing an apartment and paid rent for the month inclusive a parking spot belonging to the property. I was explicitely told this spot was there for me to park in. I was living here alone and got 2 days notice that actually one of the new housemates was moving in earlier than expected. Not a big issue since I move out at the end of the week anyway, so when she got here I welcomed her and carried her mattress, boxspring, and other items up to her room for her. After I'd introduced myself and helped her with her move in I went to class and when I got back my car was gone from the spot because she had towed it. When I confronted her she got really nervous. I felt bad, she seemed really nice, but she also hadn't made any effort to try to contact someone to see who might be parked in the spot. She had immediately towed my car from the spot I was technically paying to park in even though the entire parking lot was free and the street had parking. I told her it was a shitty situation and I know she didn't mean it maliciously but she had to take responsibility for towing since I was also living in the house and she towed my car off the spot for our unit. At first she seemed hesitant but understood and we agreed we would figure it out. Once I picked up the car the next morning and came back with the bill of 550 she immediately said she refused to pay for it and its not her fault because I'm not on the lease officially. I told her I understood its a lot of money and eventually offered to pitch in 100 because of how shitty the situation is. At this point she blamed the girl I was subleasing from, saying she understood my side but it wasn't her fault. Now both girls obviously are saying they have no fault and I'm stuck with the bill. Since I was subleasing underhand and all I have is a verbal contract its hard to really take any legal action as far as I know. Not sure what to do.	No
Hi,  I've been scouring the internet and can't seem to find the information I'm looking for.   According to California law, if I was renting from a roommate but had no communication with the landlord and I was not on the lease, who is responsible for returning my deposit, my ex roommate or the landlord of the apartment?  My roommate says I get no return until he finds my replacement but my agreement was with him alone, not the landlord.  Thank you for your time.	No
I came here from r/assistance. I was told this would be a better place to put this:  New adult here. When I was a kiddo, my mom lost my birth certificate and social security card. All I have is an old school ID, and I don't even go to that school anymore. I also have my social security number, just not the card.  I just got a new job. I have 30 days to get my birth certificate and social security card so I can get my ID to show my employer.   I went on vitalchek but they didn't accept what I had. I emailed them and they just reiterated what I needed but don't have/can't get.   I called the county courthouse that handles vital records in the state I was born (a completely different state from where I'm at) and they said literally all I can do is have my mom apply for me... my mom walked out on me years ago so I'm not sure what they want from me...  I'm so frustrated. I don't know what to do now. I thought this whole suffering-because-of-her thing was over when I turned 18. But no, I'll be dealing with the repercussions of her mistakes as a parent forever, it seems.	No
Background: I live in a house with several housemates, and the set of people typically changes some each year before we renew our lease. Our relationship with the landlord has always been relaxed. We all sign one lease, but there is no vetting of applicants, we don't ever sign on time, rent increases have always been small, and informally communicated at the end of the year.  Current: This year our landlord wants to add some professionalism to the mix (vetting new lease applications), and increase rent substantially more than in the past. We are completely fine with these changes.  Problem. The issue we face is that our new lease begins in approximately a week, and we have been told varying accounts of the changes to the rent price after having already found new people to that have tentatively agreed move in. At first our landlord said to expect a small increase (a couple weeks ago). This is normal and we didn't think anything of it. With a week left, we found out today that the price if much higher, and we risk losing people who had agreed to an original price.  Does anyone have any advice? We've read all of the information regarding required time for notice of rent increase, but it doesn't address at all the case that a new lease is being drawn up. It feels like we have no legal leverage, but it feels so underhanded that i'm wondering if I missed something in my research.  I guess the worst case is that we don't find anyone and we all just move out without signing.	No
"I'm considering suing my doctor for medical malpractice. This doctor works out of  ""Clinic Name LLC.""  What do I need to know in regards to the LLC at the end of the clinic name? Does this mean I cannot sue him for malpractice or is he protected from lawsuits because he works at this clinic?"	No
I live in Austin, Texas and for the past month and a half, I have had a mold and humidity issue in my (nice) apartment. I have put in work orders and have talked to the leasing office in person on several occasions to address this issue, but the problem remains. I've had to throw out pairs of moldy shoes, clothes, and buy a dehumidifier for my bedroom (which hasn't really done much).  I just got an email from the leasing office a few minutes ago saying that to repair the problem, they will allow us to terminate our lease agreement and move out. They previously offered to move us to a different unit in the apartment complex but its on the top floor, and we're really fed up with the complex in general.  My question is, can I take any actions here? Can I push for them to reimburse us for our damaged clothes and the cost of the dehumidifier? What about getting them to reimburse us for any moving costs associated with moving to a different apartment complex?	No
Hey guys, so a few months ago I got a speeding ticket, I went to court and got it reduced to a small fine and traffic schools. I opted to pay the fine in monthly installments since at the time I was preparing for a newborn and didn't account for the extra expense of the ticket. So a few months go by and I thought everything has been settled and having completed traffic school but I get a letter in the mail saying I only made one monthly payment. It turns out I had to manually make the monthly payments and they weren't recurring. I called the courts offices and they said I can't do anything, I need to pay it through a collection agency now which almost tripled the ticket and if I write a letter to the courts they might allow me to retake traffic school since they couldn't accept it the first time due to not having completed payments.  Is there any other option for me?	No
"On Jan. 31, 2012 I left my abusive (now ex) husband. The next day, I got a restraining/no contact order against him. Divorce was finalized 12/12/12.  Fast forward to 5/5/15. I was pulled over by the police and I wasn't sure why (I'm careful, don't speed, etc.). I was told there was a warrant out for my arrest for the past 3 years! I asked the officer to please double-check and re-run my license.  He did and told me the warrant was for ""Failure to pay a medical bill to [name redacted] Community Hospital"". Officer's exact words.  I was taken into custody and was in a holding cell for several hours while my son and my current boyfriend paid my bail. I was held on a $5000 bond for a $1000 medical bill.   On 5/8/15, I went to my mandatory court date. I thought I was going in front of the judge, as per my release papers. I  was actually taken into a conference room with the owner of the collection agency that was holding this medical bill. I tried to explain to him that I had no knowledge of the bill and no knowledge of a debtor's exam....I didn't go  to the debtor's exam because all papers regarding this issue went to my ex's house and I had the no-contact order. I had NO way of knowing about any contempt of court charge from missing the debtors hearing.  I was told by this man that if I missed one more payment or was late even by 1 day, that he would re-instate the warrant.   I have been paying $25/month for over 2 years now and they still say I owe over $700 on this bill. None of my $500 bail went for the medical bill....and this is a medical bill that I believe is actually my ex-husband's.   I did take the owner of the collection agency to court and was only awarded damages in the amount of $1000. I was not allowed to take the 2 police departments involved in my arrest to court. Both agencies harrassed me during my arrest even though I gave them  no problems whatsoever. For instance...when I was switched between departments,  I was put in leg irons and my wrists chained around my waist and had to ride in the K9 cruiser and I was told I was the ""new chew toy"" and they threatened to sic the dog on me for no reason. I was harrassed for ""ignoring the bill"". Mind you, my ex's father is also a bailiff in that particular jurisdiction and at the time I still had their last name.  One more point of interest....when my bail was paid, the owner of the collection agency who also posed as a judge on 5/5/15 was the one who signed for my bail! (I still have the receipt).   My question is, do I have any recourse in any of this? Is there some way to make all of this go away? I honestly cannot afford this bill and I do not believe it is mine....no one has ever sent it to me to look and no one will show me. I honestly do not know if it even exists.  How can I handle this. This bothers me and since this whole incident, I refuse to  drive alone and I  get scared to even go into the jurisdiction this happened in. This is negatively affected my life and I'm fed up about that fact. Please help/advise. Thank you!"	No
My lease started on the 8th of July and my landlord has yet to install the fridge. When I asked him about it he said because I wasn't currently living there he didn't feel obligated to do it. That can't be a valid reason not to install my fridge right??? Now I AM living in the property fridgeless and my landlord has given me a very vague date for when he plans to install it. What do I do?	No
I am moving across country soon to North Carolina. My wife and I have found an apartment we like and gone through the application process. In reviewing the lease though, I noticed they require 180 days notice of termination of the lease. This seems excessively long to me. After 1 year the lease converts to month to month and still requires 180 days notice of termination. I looked up tenancy termination laws for NC and it looks like [the requirement is only 30 days, or 7 days on month to month](http://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_42/GS_42-14.html).  What I am not sure about is if a landlord can legally set a termination notice longer than that. While I would be happy to give say a 2 month notice, half a year is far too long for me to be sure I will want to remain in the apartment. Outside of this the lease seems normal and the landlord seems totally sane, so I am hesitant to go through the effort to look for another apartment just because of this. If we move out and only give 1 month notice, can they legally fine us? Can part of our deposit be withheld for not giving 180 day notice? Thanks for the advice in advance.	No
In 2003, my grandmother sold her 2 aches to a private contractor and in exchange for a house. The house was built in a subdivision and house paid in full. There was no HOA at the time. Private contractor sold the subdivision a year after to DR Horton‚Äôs. DR made a HOA and never contacted us about it. We never paid HOA fees due to not knowing. DR was bought out by WestWind  a couple years after that.  Today she received a letter stating that she is having her house auctioned off on September 5th by the HOA.  We went through the contract of the house and there is no say that we are responsible for HOA and the Private contractor that we bought it from said that HOA shouldn‚Äôt be able to do that due to the house being paid off in full before a HOA was established.  What are my options?	No
So couple days ago, someone hit and run my parked car. I called the police and filed a report. So I spend the next few days looking around my neighborhood looking for security camera. Lucky I was able to find a footage of the truck hitting my car and was also able to get the U.S. DOT number of the truck(which turn out to be a small trucking company). Unfortunately, the license plate was a blurry and couldnt make out the complete plate. Tomorrow my insurance company is coming down to take a look at my car and the footage. Should i contiune looking around to see if i can find the license plate of the truck or is the US Dot Number enough to make the case?    Many Thanks	No

Can I get in trouble for anonymously registering a domain name (let's say janesmithsucks.com if Jane Smith was my ex) and publishing true things (I could all prove in court if needed) things about my ex wife.

Basically we hired this lady 6 months ago to be our wedding caterer. We were given an outline on pricing and sent over a deposit and agreed in principle over the phone to a price for the food and labor. I don't even want to get into how we got so far along without everything being signed and settled.  Well two weeks before the wedding she sent a revised budget and basically doubled the price of everything. When we asked her to honor the original prices that she agreed to she refused. So we fired her from the wedding a week out. Only downside is that she has several thousand of our dollars.   What is the best course of action to get the money back from her? Obliviously we have asked her directly and have not been able to get a hold of her. What steps should we take to apply the most pressure on her to refund us?	No
"So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.  However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.  My question is, if Steve does not receive the TV (which is seeming incredibly likely) is there ANYTHING I can do legally? Is theft by deception even a crime in PA? I don't know if Jay and Sean are their real names even, but I have ""Sean""'s phone number and the text message where it was laid out that we were meeting up to exchange the money for the TV. And they can obviously check to see that Steve has not received the TV in the jail. It's just extra complicated bc everything between Jay and Steve and Steve and I was verbal obviously."	No
"I'm an idiot. I've been spending, on average, 3-4 hours a day out of my 7.5 hour work-day (Monday - Friday, 9 - 5) for the past... 2 years on this website, both general surfing and posting (probably 2000 posts? no idea, at least that). I'm the only person in the company who does what I do, I took over for a retiree and there was no manual/documentation of anything, I just trained with her for a month and then learned the rest on my own and I'm integral to the department (primarily finance/secondarily admin role, don't want to get more detailed).    My boss isn't a very good actor and he's been saying/doing a lot of things over the past few weeks that make me think they're trying to get me to tell them everything about how I do my job, before they fire me. I've never had a warning for the amount of internet usage or anything but there's no reason otherwise they'd consider firing me, and like I said, I can read my boss pretty well and he's not a good actor.    If they do tell me that they're firing me and it's due to the high usage, can I say ""No, that wasn't me""? Like, can I demand proof? I'm not part of a union and I'm *pretty sure* they can fire me for any reason, but would making a demand like that do anything? Is there any possibility of legal repercussions if I argue it and make them prove it? The company is undergoing very public downsizing, so if I say I got laid off I can go on unemployment benefits, but if I got fired then I wouldn't be eligible. **Side question** If I file for unemployment, would the company tell the unemployment office that I was fired as opposed to let go? I assume yes, but would like to know. I realize I'm a piece of shit, I'm looking for a new job either way so all of this is just temporary anyways."	No
Hey guys. I'm currently cofounding an app startup which revolves around the on demand gig-economy.(App in the same market as TaskRabbit,Uber, etc.) We're currently at a crossroads of what type of insurance coverage best fits our business model. There would be a wide array of services offered on the app including at home services (workers will be entering homes), deliveries (transportation involved,) miscellaneous personal requests (beauty care, massage therapy, etc.) It seems as if we would be needing a different type of commercial insurance than the average company. So if anyone on here has any insight with insurance law, your advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!	No

A company called conservice is a third party biller for our apartment complexes water.  Long story short a year ago we had a water bill that said we used 12,000 gallons in a month.  This is impossible in a two person household particularly in a small two bedroom apartment.    Naturally we called and complained and they told us it was possible and we should conserve.  The next month was 8k gallons.  We knew something was wrong.  We requested all of our previous bills and they were all insanely high.    About 5 months after the initial complaint they finally sent a tech out and with a simple bucket test discovered that our meter was reading 7x normal (a ten gallon bucket registered as 70 gallons).   Here we are 6 months after that and the meter is still broken but they are continuing to charge us on a completely fictitious number of gallons.  They've been out a second time and determined that they need to change the pipe as well as the meter and on top of that our meter is the same rfid as another in the complex so both units are being double billed.    Is this fraud at this point?  Do we have legal recourse?   We are one of 5 units with faulty meters could this be class action?    And they charge is $13 a month for the bill.	No
Good evening,  Apologies if this has been answered already or with a simple google search but I come here because my fianc√© and I are in a bit of a weird situation.   My sisters significant other wants to gift us a house for our wedding present but doesn't want to do so for a few years (he said it was until they moved for some reason ). My fianc√© and I want to make sure that within these few years prior to being gifted the house that he doesn't turn around and kick us out for any old reason.   Tl;dr : can we have a contract written up where we can live in a house rent free and upon an agreed upon date be gifted the house	No
Hi /r/legaladvice, do you like to hear about easements?  My dad has a piece of land in the middle of nowhere, Minnesota. The local power company has power lines running along the road and claims a prescriptive easement. They offered money to everyone along the road to sign something which I think makes their easement explicit, but my dad felt they didn't offer him enough and refused. This document, in addition to the power lines already there, added the ability for them to run broadband.  In response to his refusal, they sent him a letter basically stating they have a prescriptive easement and they're just going to do whatever they want. Then they sent contractors to clear about 50-60 fully grown trees, probably averaging 50 feet in height, from around the power line. I'd estimate they cleared about 40 feet away from the line.  I searched the sub and found some stuff about title insurance and filing a claim with them, although it seemed that utility easements are likely to be exempt. Do you have any other advice for courses of action he could take? Thanks in advance.	No
I'm not a lawyer, but I was looking the tenant Virginia renting laws [here: ¬ß 55-248.31.](http://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacode/title55/chapter13.2/section55-248.31/)  &gt; If a check for rent is delivered to the landlord drawn on an account with insufficient funds, or if an electronic funds transfer has been rejected because of insufficient funds or a stop-payment order has been placed in bad faith by the authorizing party, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment and of the landlord's intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid by cash, cashier's check, certified check, or a completed electronic funds transfer within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in ¬ß 55-248.35.   Does that mean that if a check is bounced or a card is declined, the landlord is required to accept cash?  I'm not a lawyer, so I don't know how that would play out in court.  Also, I'm not planning on using it (seems stupid to do it).  I am just curious.	No
Hello r/legaladvice and the Reddit community as ¬†whole. First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.  Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al‚Äôs devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.   Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?   What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?   Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?   Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.   If there's any questions I can ask or information you guys need please let me know and I'll ask Al. This is so early on he's still dealing with the emotional blow. Btw I did ask permission to ask for help on his behalf so long as it was anonymously.	No
"I have signed a residential lease in Stuart, Florida with the following clause:  "" Subject also to Management's said rights of termination, as well as all other provisions hereinafter set forth, and subject to the Tenant‚Äôs right to terminate this Lease Agreement effective upon the Expiration Date by written notice given to the Landlord not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Expiration Date (Tenant's failure to give this written notice to Landlord on a timely basis will waive this right of Tenant to terminate on the Expiration Date), this Agreement shall be automatically extended for successive periods of twelve (12) months each.

"I closed on a house yesterday at 3:00 pm Central. On June 1, we signed an initial contract stating that I would take possession of the property on the date of closing. We have not signed a single document stating otherwise. At the beginning of closing, however, my realtor (let's call her C) had this to say:  She had a phone conversation with the sellers' realtor (in the presence of the lawyer who handled the closing) in which the sellers' realtor, let's call her V, asked and begged and pleaded for her clients to have until noon Saturday (today) to move out. C made me aware of this before signing the paperwork, and I agreed verbally to this arrangement. V assured C during that conversation that she would obtain a written and signed agreement from the sellers and forward it to her to sign, but this has not happened as of writing. During the closing, the lawyer stated that he would hold onto my closing check until Monday and not release those funds to the sellers, at which point we can decide how we want to continue. It was too late in the day to send off the paperwork, anyway.  At 7:00 a.m. today, C texted V and asked if the sellers were still on track to leave at noon. At 10:00 a.m. today, V responded and said they would not be out today. Once I let the various family members who were helping me move know, they split into two camps:  * Call the police immediately and charge them with trespassing.  * Wait until Monday and ask the lawyer about charging them excruciatingly high rent, up to and even surpassing my closing costs.   And they both have very good arguments, but I am more or less paralyzed when it comes to conflict. I don't know what I can do or what I should do or anything. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.   My realtor has also let me know that the sellers are asking for my name and number to talk with me about my ""expectations for them moving out."" I refused to talk with them for fear of escalating conflict.   Extra info: They closed on their new house at 9:00 a.m. Central yesterday."	No
"So yesterday my girlfriend called me all excited because she bought a new car from a used car salesman. She told me the contract and it is absolutely horrible. She's a young girl (21) and went in and told a salesman it was her first time buying a used car and he pulled the whole ""oh it's easy I'll walk you through it"" and took advantage of her.   Her contract is absolutely awful. They have her paying about $17.5k for a car worth maybe 7k. She has a 65 month contract with 9% APR. I told her that she got screwed over and to use californias 48hr used car cooldown period to void every contract she sign. Well she just sent me a picture of her signature on a contract opting out of purchasing a cancellation for her contract. She's got amazing credit score as well if  that helps anything.   Is there anything we can do to get her out of this contract and prevent her from buying this POs car for almost 3x it's worth?"	No
Hi there, so I'm kinda at a loss here. My mom's apartment management just gave her an eviction notice last Friday and she doesn't know if she should pay rent or not. Apparently ESCROW needs a 30 day notice to put rent money in there, but she is waiting until the courts get involved before leaving. What should I do? State is Ohio by the way.	No
The title says it all. If someone could PM me with help deciphering this thing that would mean the world to me. I really don't want to go to court. I just turned 18 and it'd be really nice to get this out of the way over the weekend, so I don't need to take off work.  Thanks, P03	No
So mom and I bought roundtrip tickets from Kansas City to Fuzhou, China on JustFly.com. Outgoing flights were KC to Seattle to Shanghai to Fuzhou. Return flights were Fuzhou to Beijing to Seattle to KC.    When we arrived in Shanghai, we had to hop on a different, domestic Chinese airline (Juneyao Air) to go to Fuzhou and get another boarding pass. The agent there did not give us any boarding pass since they said that whomever purchased the ticket (JustFly.com) had sent some kind of incorrect ticket/reservation confirmation number and it didn't match any of our passport or visa numbers. We were stuck in Shanghai and were told that the only way to get to Fuzhou was to buy our own separate ticket in China to go to Fuzhou. Which is what we did.   When we were coming back to the US, at the airport in Fuzhou they said that the rest of our reservation was cancelled since we did not take the last leg from Shanghai to Fuzhou. We had to then buy tickets that day to come back to the US...which cost us double what we paid for the entire roundtrip ticket.   Just called JustFly.com now to discuss any possibility of refund (we have receipts in China of flights we bought) and they flat out refused. They said that 1) any missed leg causes rest of the roundtrip to be cancelled....and 2) that if the confirmation # was wrong then we wouldn't have been able to even start our journey.    Any potential recourse? Dispute this with my CC company(Chase?) The roundtrip ticket itself was about $2600 and the way back out of China was over $3000 (about 20,000 Chinese RMB converting to USD currency). So total out 5-6k.  Not sure if it's even worthwhile to see if we can retain legal counsel to sort this out?   Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!	No

"Last month I signed for my first apartment by myself, which I moved into on July 1, and I never received a copy of the lease. This being my first time doing everything on my own, I was so worried about making beginner mistakes that I probably made more than just what I can identify now. All correspondence with the landlord has been done through the real estate agent who showed me the place. The agent is relatively new to the city and in a new office, so his explanation of not having a scanner yet to provide me a copy of the lease made sense to me and he said the landlord company would send me a copy once they signed. Of course, it wasn't until after the fact that I realized I could have simply taken photos with my phone, but I was too nervous to think straight.  Anyway, that was last month, every week since then I've been emailing the agent for any updates on the copy and he would respond that the company hadn't gotten back to him yet. The past two weeks I received no response to my weekly requests, so I had started assuming something's gone wrong. Earlier today I emailed the agent again, this time requesting the landlord company's address so I can mail the rent (the agent mailed the first checks - me, being an idiot, didn't think to ask where to). The agent finally got back to me with the address and casually added if I can come by later to sign another copy of the lease so I can have an original.  So now I'm concerned, I ask what happened to the original lease and why they don't have a copy they can send me. The agent replies that the company ""may have misplaced it or forgot to scan it"" but that the copy he's printing is exactly the same. I asked if I could just have the copy he printed for reference and that I'm willing to wait for the company to relocate the original. So far, that's the last message in the chain; it's already 11 PM here so I don't expect this to continue until tomorrow.  So what course of action can I take from here? Did I totally screw myself by not getting a copy at my first opportunity? Right now I'm giving everyone the benefit of the doubt, but does anyone sense anything more nefarious at hand?"	No
So i have a friend that has some VISA problems and was hoping someone on here could give us some advice.  She lives in MA and her VISA is up in a month. She's been looking for a new job for a while now and now it looks like the awkward timeline between not being able to transfer the visa in time before it expires.  Any thoughts?	No

"Hi, so I'm in a bit of a sticky situation with my landlord in Brookline, MA. I signed a one year lease last year for 8/31/2016 - 9/1/2017. (says this period explicitly in the lease, which is identical to most standard Boston leases, (C) Greater Boston Real Estate Board), where I agreed to pay 17,400 in 1450 monthly installments.  A place opened up today that I really like (20 days before my lease is over), and I sent him an email stating my intention to not renew. I had already sent a check for August, so I am two months of rent ahead (until end of October) because I also paid last month.  Well, he sent back this email:  &gt;You are responsible for rent for the next year. Please continue paying rent until we notify you that we have found a new tenant  &gt;We will list the property tomorrow for September 1 occupancy and will let you know when it becomes rented. There is a one month lease termination fee. You will also be responsible for advertising and rental fees. You can be assured that it would be unlikely for you to receive any refund  I signed a small piece of paper in March that said I planned to renew, it basically just said ""If you plan to renew starting 9/1/2017, check yes, sign, and send first month's rent for next term by this date"", I was not sent back a copy of this, but that's basically all it said (definitely going to ask for a copy after gathering some more information on this situation). I did not sign a second lease with the same terms as the first, I'm pretty much wondering if somehow signing that intention paper was equivalent to signing another full year's lease? Here's the clause referring to ""extensions/renewals"" in the lease: [http://imgur.com/a/POxYC](http://imgur.com/a/POxYC)  Can someone please explain my rights in this situation and how he is claiming I owe advertising and ""rental fees"" whatever that even means? How can he legally keep TWO months of rent in this situation?"	No
"A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him.   I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers.   The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on.   Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon.   A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design.   Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success.   We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.   We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either).   Would love some advice! Thank you in advance."	No
"I happened to stumble upon an interesting situation the other day. Of course, we all know that a Representative working for a said company while speaking understand that any call they are on whether outbound on inbound is recorded and they agree to the recording through employment. While the customer understands and agrees to the recording as calling the Call Center with a message stating the recording.   Say that the customer gets the Representative; which we will place both the Call Center and the Customer within The state of Maryland. The customer then before the conversations starts he allows the representative to know that the call is being recorded for their personal use (Most likely just in case any wrong information is given, info about the account, and for their safety). Yet, the call center Representative states they do not authorize the recording from the customer and disconnects or will disconnect the call if he plans to keep recording the call ""because in the state of Maryland each person(s) has to agree to the recording for it to be valid'.  How are they able to deny a recording of a call or conversation when their job is literally always recording them and both parties agreed to the original knowledge of the call being recorded."	No
I'll put the gritty details next, but in short: Live in Ohio. At end of legal proceedings came to be declared owner of 'undivided one half interest' in the estate. Person who owns other half had medical charges put against the house for almost half the value of the house. Presently no one lives there, though the other half owner was until a couple years ago.   Onto the gritty. There was some issue with who really owned the house. My mother and her ex both shared the house - married at the time though they divorced. She was forced out of the house through threats of violence many years ago and left. According to the best of my knowledge the divorce papers said when children were 18 or my mother was gone from the house for a period of time it was to be sold.    This never happened and instead her ex and his new wife lived there. No legal action was taken as my mother was afraid of him. Eventually, he passed away some years ago and my mother made an agreement with his widow that she could live there as long as she paid bills, taxes, etc.   The property taxes came in my mother's name, she paid them, and got a check in her name from the widow. This was fine until a neighbor found evidence that the widow was being more or less forcefully housebound by a younger man who claimed to love her and was stealing her checks. My mother wanted her out of there for her safety as she was going to let him back in after he got out of jail. She got a paper to evict though I am not 100% certain it was needed or the widow left earlier to stay with her daughter.   Fast forward a bit later, my mother decided to sell the house instead of let it sit there and fall apart. But before everything could be finalized, she passed away. The idea was it would be split between my 3 siblings (not me, as I was not from her previous marriage), but with the will it instead went to me fully. So I was going to give the money from the sale to them anyway, but during trying to sell it the bank had an issue with who owned the house.   Went to a lawyer and it took months and months. Evidently what we thought was solved in 2012 was somehow erroneous. A new paper stated that a certificate of transfer would be filed in both my mother's estate and her ex-husband estate. I got one in the mail indeed saying I now owned 'half interest' instead of full.   Two issues came up. One being the earlier mentioned lien. Whatever medical care the widow was receiving (she is still alive) had put against the house. IIRC it was around 28k (house value ~60k-65k on market when we tried to sell). We talked to her about selling and she said she would sign the other half over to me but only if I paid half of her lien. This would end up meaning paying about 14k from the 30k half I would get. Splitting that three ways would be ~5k then taking away the realtor's fee and any others as well wouldn't leave much. Doesn't seem right considering.   Another thing is I can't seem to find where the other half was officially issued. Granted mine definitely says 'an undivided one half interest'. When searching through the county records the same paper showed up, but I couldn't find one for the ex or her deceased husband showing it. Not sure if that matters, but don't know why it isn't there.   So I guess in the end if it is in a stalemate is there anything I can do when all this craziness happened? Can I force her to sell and make her responsible for the lien? Or even if it is half interest in the house does that mean I also am required to pay half that medical lien?  And since no one is living there right now does it matter?   Definitely not trying to be petty. Following my mother's example she let her ex's new wife who he cheated with stay in the house as long as she paid the bills. But I also don't want to be responsible for this house I have no interest in nor do I want to screw my siblings over by giving them just a few grand each for a house two of them grew up in.   Sorry for the length but it is a crazy situation! Any leads on what to do or where to go? The last lawyer we had to handle this whole fiasco when my mother passed seemed to struggle with it.	No
Today my girlfriend got a call from her landlord saying that all of her belongings in her apartment were thrown out.  According to the landlord, they had a crew in to throw out everything left behind in another apartment and mistakenly they went into my girlfriends apartment.  &amp;nbsp;  My girlfriend is in the process of moving in with me, so fortunately the most important belongings were already moved out.  Her rent is up and she still has a couple of months left on the lease.  &amp;nbsp;   They have offered to reimburse my girlfriend for any belongings that were thrown out.  Unfortunately, my girlfriends stuff is between my house, her parents home, and what was in the apartment so we aren't entirely sure what was still in there. We will be working on coming up with a list this weekend.  Obviously she is upset because her stuff is gone and there were some sentimental items, but are those worth any more than a sticker price?  &amp;nbsp;  I guess I'm just trying to figure out if accepting their offer to reimburse for belongings is all that needs to be done.  Does a police report need to be filed? Should we ask for her damage deposit back/break the remainder of her lease?  Any and all advice is welcome.	No
My friend was/is on probation for a DWI. He had a month left and he got violated because he tested positive for alcohol twice in a row.  He is currently in county jail and they haven't given him a court date yet. He's been there almost a week. My question is how long can they make him stay and can they sentence him with a full prison sentence even if he paid his restitution and has been on probation for 5 1/2 years.   We reside in New York State. 	No
I apologize if I come frustrated but I am. My landlord threw out, I really mean disposed of, all my belongings from my apartment even though my lease does not end for a good week. I had everything packed and ready to be moved and they all disappeared. The landlord takes full responsibility. So far I have a lawyer and am making a list of inventory for all my belongings. What else should I do. How should I estimate the worth of my items. Thank you.	No
"Personally, I'm more leaning towards the mechanic (my friend) being at fault for failing to follow safety precautions.  When someone hands you a Rifle, the first thing you do is check if it is loaded, even if you literally just witnessed that person emptying the Rifle right in front of you.  In the same way I feel like a car mechanic should do the same and follow basic safety precaution, like checking if the car is indeed in park before starting.    But then, I'm not sure how stupid another human being has to be to hand someone a loaded Rifle and tell them ""Oh it's not loaded""... aka 'Let's leave my car in Drive, turn off ignition and invite a car mechanic to do repairs on your car'.  I feel like the Customer does have some liability in this case, but I'm not a lawyer.    Also, I believe it was an older car that made it possible for this stupidity to happen.  I'm not a car expert but I'm pretty sure you have to step on the brakes before ignition on modern cars?  At least that's the way I learned in Driver's Ed when I was 16.  Always step on brakes before starting.    No one got hurt, the repair amount is really small, I think about $500 bucks for minor bumper damage.    But I'm wondering ultimately who is at fault considering the possibility that someone could have actually died from this.    I should probably post this in /r/Justrolledintotheshop/ or /r/mechanics and ask them as I'm sure the mechanics on there have plenty of prior cases similar to this.  Take care out there guys, there are many idiots out there that could kill you.  Anytime, anywhere."	No
I don't know who it is yet, but I know there's a charge for Domino's pizza that isn't mine among other things. If I can find out which Domino's and trace that order to its source, I could potentially find out who stole from me. Obviously I want them in prison, but I'd like to sue the pants off them too.	No
"I need to disclaim some funds I would otherwise be inheriting so that they can go back to the Estate to settle outstanding debts. These funds are with Vanguard.   I submitted the paperwork they gave me and that is all in order but I also need to write up a document specifically disclaiming the funds by account number. The agent I've been dealing with was unable to give me a ""blueprint"" but said what I write up must include the account numbers and their reference number.   The Estate is already in the red, I don't want to pay the lawyer another $250 out of pocket to do this simple task if I can avoid it and I need to get this settled soon.    I'm in NY and another sibling in MA has to submit a similar document for their shares. Any suggestions?"	No
I was recently approached by a friend asking if my husband and I could room a 16 year old who's family is about to be evicted. How legal is this?   Background: We are in Pennsylvania. teen in question has a mother who is frivolous with money. Spent rent money on other things. They are about to be evicted. My friend knows the teen and is trying to find them a temporary home in their school area. Which is where we come in. He asked us if we could take on just the teen, not the mother. 'Worst case' they'd be staying with us a year.   We have spare room, but little money so the teen would effectively be paying 'rent'- even though we'd only be taking some money for their food and a little for the extra electricity (AC, computer, what have you).   As they are a minor and not emancipated, how legal is this? We want to help the kid but not if it'll fuck us and them over in the long run. I know some states you can get in trouble for harboring a runaway, although as far as I can tell the mother would be aware of their location.   Help?	No
So my ex-employer is a real shady POS (tax fraud, insurance fraud, etc). So the story is that for the past 2 months, he's been having big-time money problems, which caused our last four paychecks to be 7-10 days late. But then he got a loan for a couple hundred k, and now we have money again. My last paycheck was supposed to be 07/03, but I was on PTO (we don't have a written PTO policy, but other employees have taken PTO without any ramifications, and he said I could take it) until 07/05. While I was gone, he kept pressuring me to DocuSign this NDA and non-compete. He still owes me $3k for unpaid medical expenses (signed employment contract states medical coverage is part of benefits, but our insurance was retroactively cancelled in April, which caused all my doctor appointments from January to April to be rejected by insurance, so small bills became huge). He's promised to pay this back numerous times, but of course, he hasn't. I told him I'd sign the NDA/Non-compete out of goodwill, but I expected him to honor his contract and pay me for consequential damages caused by the insurance cancelling. When I return to the office, he seizes my phone and laptop (I'm guessing to get rid of my evidence I've collected against him) and locks me out of my emails. I took this as termination, even though he said it wasn't (I'm sure this was a ploy to get me to stay, so he could further insulate himself from potential damage), but since I wasn't paid, I was out of there. So I sent him a demand letter since he has 6 days to pay me my final paychecks. My question is this: I know he's going to claim that my PTO was unauthorized, but can I claim that's discriminatory because other employees literally took PTO the week before and it didn't affect their paycheck. He also told me to send the hours I was into the office, knowing that none of the employees had been to the office (yet again, none of them had to fill out time sheets) because 1. we hadn't been paid yet and 2. creditors were coming into the office threatening to blow or shoot the place up until they got their money. I was still working, and I had text messages/emails of 1. asking for him to pay server costs, so I could continue working on the website and 2. him sending me to various companies to collect bills on our company's behalf (also promising to pay my medical reimbursement if I managed to collect checks). Will he be able to deny me my last paycheck by claiming I didn't go into the office. And should I threaten what I have on him (tax fraud, insurance fraud)? I also have access to technical systems I set up (and technically own because I bought them with my own money in case something like this happened). Should I take down the systems, or will this backfire on me and allow him to sue me for damages or something. This is really complicated because this guys was SOOOO unscrupulous, sloppy, and corrupt. What do you guys propose is the best course of action? Thanks so much!	No
 Location: Los Angela's California  I was at a bar last week with some friends and some time during the night I was at the bar getting a drink and when I turned around an extremely drunk man smashed his glass into mine while he wildly gestured about something.   At first I was in shock since he basically smashed a glass in my face but when I looked down my entire right hand was a bloody mess. I shouted and one of the bartenders saw this and called the ambulance. I  was furious with the guy who gave me a fuck of comment before the manager on staff sat me down and helped me until the ambulance got there.   I'm at the hospital and during the exam it was discovered that 3 of the tendons in my hand had been cut and I need surgery to repair them.   The broken career part of the story is that I'm an graphic designer who relies on the use of my hands to do my job. And now that my hand is still recovering I can't work or do anything and I'm concerned about what to do. I don't know who I should call, if there's some way of getting my expanses covered, what I'll do if I can't use my hand well enough in the future and I can't work as a graphic artist anymore.   I'm surviving off the money I have saved and will be okay for about a month and I have medical insurance so that's all taken care of. But I just need advice of if I can get some sort of money to help pay for my expenses and what my options are.   I don't really have the money to pay for a lawyer since al of my savings are paying for everything and I don't have a salaried job since I'm freelance at the moment.   I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes as I'm writing this with my left hand on mobile and I'm kind of dog scared shitless about what to do.	No
"I'll try to keep this as simplified as possible. Basically, all HOAs are the devil, it seems, but as a renter, I've always been able to tolerate them just fine &amp; never had any problems until now.   I received a private message from the HOA dude (Lil Bitch, LB for short) via the community app, asking what's up with the white car in my driveway with no license plate. We sent a couple messages back &amp; forth about it. The gist was that I responded with, ""There is no white car in my driveway without a license plate. But regardless, we're actually selling the car and moving in August anyway."" I was annoyed by his entire approach and his shitty attitude throughout the exchange, so after he responded with (paraphrasing), ""so if I stop by, I'll see a license plate on the car? All you have to say is that you're taking care of it and it's no big deal. Any time I see a car backed into a driveway, it means it's broken down or otherwise not legal and I'm right 100% of the time"" I started asserting that his process was unfounded and baseless and that he shouldn't be approaching residents based on guesses &amp; hearsay. And that I had already answered his question once &amp; the answer isn't going to change. Also, according to his own logic, I already stated that we're selling the car, so there shouldn't be any issue here to begin with.   The next day, he shows up at my front door acting like a clown because apparently my mother never put the new registration sticker on her car bc she was selling it. So, he thought he ""had"" me, and proceeded to yell at me about it on my front porch. I felt he had overstepped at this point &amp; I was pissed. This was 100% ego driven &amp; unnecessary on his part. So, I started questioning his process AGAIN and he flipped out. He started bringing up all kinds of irrelevant, personal crap, like a post I'd made on the community app about a suspicious person walking around my neighbor's house. The only reason I even posted it was because he ASKED everyone to in the newsletter that had just come out the previous week. There was apparently a daytime break in at one of the houses around here. He bitched about my post referencing ""AAAAAAALLLL the break ins"" which I never even remotely did. I referenced the one daytime break-in that he had mentioned in the newsletter. Regardless, he had demonstrated what an idiotic man child he was at this point, and I was done.   As a result, I told him that his judgment is seriously questionable at best and that he needed to leave. He was furious that his illusion of power wasn't being acknowledged. So, I tried to call my dog over so he could leave... She was standing at the porch door wanting to be let out. Before I had a chance to get her over to me, he flung the door open and let her out.   Luckily, she's a good, trained dog, and stays right near me. She's used to me letting her out that door to ""hunt"" so that's what she thought was happening. He, however, had no idea that she wouldn't run out into the street &amp; get hit by a car or something. Scumbag...   I didn't say a word. I just went to collect the dog, and as LB was walking away, he sarcastically said, ""oops... Dog got out."" I said, ""Wow, you're a real piece of work,"" to which he responded, ""Kiss my ass.""   So, I immediately went and sent a heated &amp; strongly worded email to the HOA board telling them he'd better stay the hell away from me &amp; that at this point, this is harassment &amp; that if he makes one more threat or if I sense the slightest shred of retaliation, I will take matters into my own hands. Someone from the HOA responded &amp; said that HOA Bitch #1 (HB1) was out of town &amp; she'll address it when she returns.   He then sent another private message, stating that he was going to report the car to the HOA to start the violation/fining process. He threatened to contact my landlords. He started questioning who's name is on the lease (mine is, he was just hoping it wasn't), etc. I didn't dignify any of his questions with an answer. From the moment he showed up at my door, it was 100% personal. I told him a thousand times to stop harassing us, contacting us, threatening us, etc but he didn't give a crap, he continued doing whatever he wanted, and antagonizing us.   I tried to ignore him for a couple of days, as he continued trying to play games. Two days after the incident, I posted on the community app, asking other renters how they went about getting a copy of the bylaws. He couldn't wait to respond in a massively inappropriate, condescending, antagonistic way to the point that a bunch of other residents started saying ""whoa WTF"" and private messaging me with their own nightmare stories with this epic LB.   The kicker is that he publicized to the entire neighborhood (despite my attempts to remain civil and keep these 2 issues separate) the PRIVATE dispute we were having over the car. He also gave the neighborhood the impression that there were violation issues with regard to my lawn, which is mowed weekly and was never mentioned before this. Additionally, he had been talking to my immediate neighbors, lying to them, manipulating them and pitting them against me.   At the same time this was going on via the app, my mother sold the car and my dad had shown up to help with that and just to visit (they're divorced but still friends).   So, in one of his asinine public messages, *within an hour* of the car being sold and my dad mowing the lawn, LB sarcastically thanked me for getting rid of the ""car with no tag that doesn't run"" and for MY DAD mowing the lawn. First of all, his idiotic claims had now evolved to the car not running as if he could possibly even know that, and what's way creepier is that he doesn't have the slightest clue who my dad is. My neighbor does, though. So, I interpreted this as his way of letting me know that our every move is being watched and reported back to him. So, what, he's going to stalk us now!?   The next morning, he started a huge post listing aaaallll the things the HOA has done for the community, and within it, he again publicized my dispute with him regarding the car AND LAWN (which was never in violation). This drew FAR more attention than the original thread the day before. I was absolutely fed up.   I decided to send another email to the HOA asking wtf is being done about LB and explaining the additional BS he's pulled since the first day. Immediately thereafter, LB deleted the ENTIRE massive thread he'd posted that day, as well as all of his psychotic comments to me the day before. Luckily, I had a feeling he'd do something so cowardly and I had taken screen shots, so I posted some of them back in my original bylaws thread and specified why I did (due to him deleting everything). He also stopped following me all over the app, leaving antagonistic comments in reply to my completely unrelated posts to anything related to the HOA or the dispute. Someone had gotten him on a leash, but at this point, it was way too little too late. We were literally in fear of his potential retaliation at this point, due to his clear lack of halfway reasonable judgment &amp; his instability.   The HOA responded by stating they were having a board meeting the next night and that it would be handled/discussed then. I responded by questioning how this could possibly be justified if I couldn't be present at the meeting. They responded by asking me to trust the process. I told them they were asking me to take an epic leap of faith but hopefully they were asking me to read between the lines, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.   That's not at all what they were asking me to do. After the board meeting, they told me he'll stop harassing &amp; that they don't want to discuss it anymore. By this point, I had made them aware of the dozen different messages I'd received from other (all female, of course) residents, complaining about his ""bullying"" &amp; a wealth of other awful issues, all of which were too afraid to speak out or even attend board meetings for fear of his retaliation. I'd sent the HOA screenshots as proof, and blocked out any identifying information. They don't care. They're just as corrupt as the rest.   If there's a solid reason to pursue things legally, I would prefer to go that route. Based on the legaladvice community's feedback, I planned to contact a lawyer on Monday &amp; go from there. I'd just like to know if you think it would be a waste of time/a long shot, or if there appears to be anything solid worth pursuing, based on your expertise. I have everything in writing (like my asking him repeatedly to stop harassing us, his threats of retaliation, etc). I would think he can't publicize my private business to the whole neighborhood either... don't HOA douchebags fall within the public servant category? Do those people have an obligation with regard to privacy or confidentiality at all? Any thoughts or advice would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you, and sorry for the wall of text. I know the details tend to matter when it comes to legal issues."	No
A few months ago these complaints started, its a rough guess its a neighbor across the road who's girlfriend works nights assumingly and the vehicle may wake her up during Daytime hours.  The Vehicle in question is a Rx-8 with a slightly modified exhaust which didn't increase make it significantly louder, but the nosey person across the road made note to start the complaints after the maintenance was done.  Basically everything has been done to keep the idles low, and putt around to not offend anyone but the person keeps complaining saying its disturbing them, and we're at risk at being fined from Strata Council, due to this.  We don't know who it is exactly making the complaints so we're at a impass attempting to work it out, but will request a Council hearing regarding it so they can hear our side since the emails we've sent stating we've done everything possible to adhere and respect everyone's space.   ~~ My question is, is the Strata going to be basing this off local bylaws because those are enforcable with Sound measurements instead of just petty he said - she said statements about something annoying someone, when there are many loud noises in the complex and other vehicles and motorcycles just as loud that consistently go about and should be just as much of a offender.  It feels like we're being targetted just because of basically unknown reasons and the Strata is taking the side of the person filing complaint after complaint.  The vehicle is also only driven in daylight hours generally 12pm-6pm and never at night or early in the morning.  http://www.rdno.ca/bylaws/BL_2581.pdf  Is the information I found on local bylaws for sound enforcement, but could use some advice the best way to go about tackling this issue.

So I am in need of an Occupational Drivers License because my license got suspended until March 2018. So I'm torn between getting a lawyer and paying around $300 so they can get that for me or just going through the process myself! I've been looking up different lawyers and they all basically state it's fast and simple with them and that if i were to go about it on my own, it would cost more. Is that true? Any advice would help. Thank you!  P.S I am in San Antonio, Texas. I don't have any outstanding tickets, warrants or surcharges on my driving record and I have already gotten a notarized SR-22 applied to my current vehicle.	No
We've been renting a house for almost 8 years. At the end of the current lease (March 31, 2018) we're able to go month-to-month with a 30 day termination notice by either party. Our landlord wishes to not extended our lease beyond the month-to-month agreement when it expires so that he can move back into the house.  My question is, since he has no intent to rent the house to another party, are we liable for rent through the end of the lease if we choose to move early? And if so, does he moving back into the house effectively terminate our lease and release us from the obligation to cover rent?	No
"California. Married, no kids (and there won't be any.) I have some personal assets (stocks, etc) and a partial share of a multi unit building that we live in (a san francisco tenancy in common) Our finances are mostly separate, we contribute to a shared bank account that we use for expenses.  I'd like to make sure that if I kick the bucket she'll get my assets, particularly the TIC share, with a minimum of hassle.   Is a trust the thing I want? A will? I've talked informally with a couple of different lawyers and have heard stuff ranging from ""you to combine all your assets"" to ""you don't have to do anything, it's automatic"" So I'd like to have a few more data points...  Particularly regarding trusts, I'm worried that transferring my share of the building to a trust will allow/trigger a property tax reassessment, which would suck for me and the other owners of the building. This may be too california-specific to be easily answerable.  TL;DR how do I make it so my wife doesn't have to go through probate, pay taxes, in order to get my stuff if I die unexpectedly?"	No
Hello. A truck hit my car a few months ago and drove off. The car was parked and in the am we found the damage. We were able to find the company by pulling tapes from surrounding buildings, but the time I lost just tracking them down (I am a freelancer) took me over three days. I asked them to compensate me for the time, but they refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Small claims court? I am  in New York City if that helps. Any advice you can offer would be amazing. Thanks Terrie.	No
Location: North Carolina  I have searched everywhere trying to find a similar situation, with no luck. I am at the end of my current one-year lease this month (7/15/16-7/31/17). Back in May, I reached out to the rental agency (manages property for the owner of my condo) to see if the owner would be interested in renewing my lease for a shorter term, ideally 6 months. I have to move for school next semester, so I was hoping to end sometime between Dec-Feb, but was willing to pay an extra month or so to avoid the hassle of moving twice in the year. The rental agency went back and forth with the landlord, and they said (by email) the landlord agreed to a lease ending 4/3/18. I agreed to this at the time.  I didn't hear anything until two weeks ago (7/10), when they asked if I was still interested in renewing the lease. I said yes, and asked for confirmation that the new lease would run 8/1/17-4/3/18. This was also confirmed (by email). Two weeks later (7/25), I wrote to them asking about a new lease, since I hadn't received one. They sent one via Docusign with a lease from 8/1/17-4/30/17. I asked them to change the date of the lease to the terms we had previously agreed to (and included copies of both emails). They said that it was a typo and the owner agreed to 4/30 and have refused to send me an updated lease.   My current lease includes a clause stating that in the event that 45 days' notice is not given before the end of the current lease, the lease will be automatically renewed for three months at a 3% rent increase. At this point, I'm assuming my options are to sign the new lease or pay the increased rent and be out by the end of October (8/1-10/31). Is this correct? I intended to sign a new lease, but just can't stomach paying an extra month's rent due to their mistake. If they had sent a new lease prior to 5 days ago, I could have given notice and found a new place to live.	No
I just graduated from a one year masters program and of course, the last year was Insanely busy because of my coursework (i.e. not sleeping one or two nights a week). The neighborhood was right next to my school and fine, but the next neighborhood over is notoriously dangerous.   I rented an apartment in August and by October a sexual assault had occurred in the middle of the day. Two young men followed a girl into the building and assaulted her at 2pm in the entry way. I was the first person on the scene after they fled. There were also many mugging in the neighborhood that semester. I talked with my landlord on the phone and he refused to install a camera in front of the building or better lighting.   A few weeks later I came home from Thanksgiving break and someone had cut a perfectly smooth, circular hole out of the outer pane of my bedroom window, which goes out to a fire escape. I think they didn't break in all the way because either someone saw them or they noticed I have an alarm sticker. (which only goes off when the window is opened- but they didn't know that) The neighbors said they heard people running up and down the fire escape. Also the neighboring building had break ins off the escape. I sent pictures to two glass companies and they both said most likely someone had tried to break in. My landlord said it was bird. I knew at that point he didn't care about my safety at all and was a liar. I took pictures of the window and it wasn't fixed until a month later. (It took forever because they had to special order the glass.)   After that I couldn't sleep or even shower in my apartment. I Ubered to class and had severe anxiety. I moved an hour away to live with my boyfriend and commute to school, which took a toll on my school work.   My landlord told me I could move out and get my deposit back if I found a new tenant. I have two emails from him saying this. I found a new tenant (I did tell them the area was dangerous and that they should install an alarm). My landlord signed a new contract with them.   He then refused to give me back but 200 of my 2000 dollar deposit. My deposit was so large because I was a student. He said it was because of a placement fee that's in the lease (it is there but I thought his emails overrode what was in his contract).   I was angry but too busy with school to deal with it. That happened in February. It's now been 6 months and I'm done with school. I've never filed a lawsuit before and am feeling apprehensive. Should I pursue a lawsuit? I think I still have a copy of my lease and the deposit slip and emails. I'm not sure how much legal ground I have to stand on. I'm in the state of Maryland by the way. Thank you.	No
"I'm not at a risk of getting fired - but have been considering changing jobs if i find a better paying position.      My contract comes with a non compere clause for 12 months and NDA for 24 months limited geographically to my current country.  BUT it also comes with a line that, when translated, says:   ""The amount of monthly compensation is agreed upon at the end of the contract."".   Since sum is not specified, what stops me from asking a compensation equal to my full salary for the duration and refuse small and tiny compensations they might offer?"	No
"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	No

Hi guys, I crossposted this on r/realestate &amp; r/homeowners but this subreddit was recommended to me as well. It's a strange situation, and we can't figure out who to contact or what to do to buy this house. We've never owned a house so it's all very confusing to us!  Yesterday, we watched a video about adverse possession, and a house that is in his parents' neighborhood came to mind: the common consensus is that a couple bought it from the developer when it was built (2003), lived in it for a year, then disappeared and it's been abandoned ever since. This is in Virginia, btw, and it's never been put up for sale.  We went yesterday to go look at it and there is a key lock on the door and signs from Wells Fargo saying that it was winterized in 2011. Otherwise, the trim is rotting off, the siding is moldy, etc. We asked the neighbors about it, and they said that they moved in 2 years ago, but the house has been abandoned for 5-6 years as far as they know. They said sometimes the bank comes to mow the grass and check the windows and door, but otherwise no one goes in it. We suspect that it's not the bank that does this but the HOA. We were able to look inside in the dining room/kitchen, and there's a few things strewn everywhere - a blanket on the floor, one picture left on the fridge, and literally all the cabinets open and empty.   We got the number off the notice and it led us to Wells Fargo's real estate division. The guy said that they don't own the house and that he couldn't find any record of it. So, we went to the court house to see who owns it.   It's still listed under the original owners, whose address is listed as a PO box in a different city. We were able to find documents about the house, and this is where it gets confusing. The documents state Bank of America as the trustee, who then signs it over to Wells Fargo, who then signs it over to ReconTrust, who then signs it over to Orlan. The last two are debt collector firms. At first we thought the house was indeed foreclosed (but why never put up for sale?), and so we called Orlan to find out how to buy it. Orlan told us they sold it in 2014, and they couldn't tell us anymore. We came to realize that they had just sold the mortgage, but the house was still in possession of the original owners.   The most recent documents are from the HOA releasing a $1000+ lien on the house back in 2014, made out to the original owners, whose address listed at that time was a smaller townhouse in the same neighborhood (wtf?). We went to that house and they no longer live there, if they ever did. But if the lien was released, the owners must have paid it, right?  Soooo, then we decided to see if perhaps the property tax was back paid and if we could buy the house from the county, since obviously no one was taking ownership of the house. I called the tax collectors, who told me that the property tax was all paid up to date by a loan servicing firm. I called them, and the lady was surprised by how long the house had been abandoned for, but she couldn't tell us why the firm was paying for the property tax - she said it was perhaps escrowed into the mortgage.   She told us to check with the county and see how long houses can legally be vacant for, but we're worried that if the county goes and assesses the property and decides that it is abandoned and can be auctioned off, we won't be able to afford it at auction. It's worth $500k+ and our budget is $350k. We did as much free research as we could online to find the original owners, but they seem to be ghosts. They're in their 60's now, though, so the lack of social media presence is understandable. Adverse possession is also out of the question since the property tax is paid.   At this point, I'm going to try to reach out to the HOA today to see if they have any contact number for the owners, but it seems like reporting the house to the county is the best option to free it up. But, does reporting it risk the fact that it may go to auction and we won't get it? Or will the county perhaps allow us to make an offer first? Can the county even do anything if the taxes are paid and it has a listed owner? We're entirely unsure if we should just give up or continue looking into this.   Tl;dr 6yr+ abandoned house's ghost owners live elsewhere and may still be paying the mortgage, property taxes are paid up to date by another firm, mortgage has been sold several times, house is rotting &amp; HOA put a lien on it that has since been released. How do we buy it?  Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. If anyone knows any other subreddits where I can xpost this for more advice, it would be appreciated as well.	No
SERIOUS REPLIES ONLY PLEASE.  Hopefully I used the correct flair, I don't see one that really fit for veteran questions...  I just had one ask me today and it caught me off guard, made me feel very uncomfortable, and kinda pissed me off (no, I don't have either issue, but I can see it leading to vets with PTSD becoming homeless because they are immediately stigmatized and not given housing due to having these personal medical issues).  Any legitimate answer are appreciated.	No

Hi all,  I recently received a notice from an insurance company stating that I caused body damage to my neighbor's vehicle with fireworks.  His wife claims to have seen me lighting them too closely to her vehicle.  Though I was lighting fireworks, I was not the only person lighting them in the area.  The fireworks I had lit were small fountain style fireworks, barely capable of exceeding 10' in height.  I have a photo of myself standing between the fireworks and the neighbors vehicle, seemingly at a safe distance.  Should I dispute this? What type of proof will they need to deem me responsible?	No
Hello LA, My girlfriend has been really upset by this recent turn of events. Her sister has a criminal background and has been in prison before. Likely, to avoid showing up again for warrants, she used her sisters name (my GF) to avoid a Jay Walking Ticket. Afterwards, she has been placed back in prison for a burglery charge and is currently serving time.  The issue is my GF received the $551 ticket from the tax recovery service because penalties have been acruing since my GF hasn't been served notice of the ticket because the wrong address was used when the Jay Walking citation was issued. How can one get the charges and penalties be taken out of my GF's name and her credit ratings restored? Thank you for any help.	No
I'm currently about to purchase a vehicle off of a man who lives in NC. I live in TN. Here in TN we do not have electronic titles but in NC they do. After I purchase the car from the guy he will have the responsibility to send me the title in the mail (I live 5.5 hours away). It will take about 2 days to get the paper title from NC. What documents do I need to have him sign so I don't get scammed? I am going to have a notarized bill of sale. Is there any other documents I will need so he doesn't try to say the car is still his? I will be meeting him at his bank to pay off his lien on the car.	No
"So I'm apartment hunting in MA, specifically Boston, and I have a place almost locked down right now but I need a cosigner. The lease has joint and several liability so my cosigner (father) would be responsible for any or all of my 3 roommates should they trash the apartment or refuse to pay rent. My dad is refusing to cosign because of these provisions, but several people have told me that it's basically impossible to find a lease in Boston as a student without them. Is this a thing? I'm 21, so every level of a legal adult, but I've never had my own apartment or worked full time for longer than a summer. He's willing to cosign for my portion of the rent only, but the realty company told me that they can't get rid of the joint liability because it's ""a legal issue."" Thanks!"	No
Looking for advice. I'm currently renting my house. Tenants signed a lease at the beginning of the year. We just had an inspection done and there is a serious termite infestation. Place is about 10 years old and the level of infestation can not be treated with natural oils. The tenant is refusing to let me do the fumigation citing not wanting to be exposed to chemicals. We have offered to put them up for  3 days to a place of their choosing, but they will not agree to the fumigation. I know most laws favor the tenant.  Is there any action  we can take as landlords if the tenants refuse to leave? The termites at this point have caused some structural damage- Thanks in advance for any help, with this.	No

Last week myself and two other employees were riding from one part of our employers property to where our store is located. The drive is less than quarter of a mile. Our work truck is a regular cab Ford F350. My two other employees hopped in the cab. Seeing as though it's a bit cramped with junk in the cab + two employees I decided to hop in the uncovered bed of the truck. On our very short trip back to our store a NYS Trooper saw us and pulled a U-turn. I knew he was coming to stop us, but didn't think it was anything serious. Just a warning. I ended up hopping out of truck and headed inside as did the passenger of the truck. The driver went to park our work truck and the Trooper followed him into our parking lot. Turns out our employee was driving unlicensed(lost due to DUI) and without a seat belt. Originally we were stopped because I was in the bed of the truck. The police officer spoke with me, asked for all of my info and explain why I was stopped, but was not ticketed. He ended up speaking to our other employee for well over 20 minutes and later gave him a ticket for driving without a seat belt and without a license. Am I liable for paying half of this ticket when it has nothing to do with me? I'd understand if he was ticketed due to me being in the bed of the truck, but from what I read about our law I'm above the age where it's illegal and we were traveling less than the illegal distance.

I recently discovered that the coin-operated laundry drying machine in my apartment basement is wired up to my power meter. It's a 4-family apartment built in the 1940s.  The company my lease is with is a property management group, the property owner is an individual, they are separate entities. To get help with the issue I contacted the property management group. They sent a person to verify that the laundry machine was in fact attached to my electricity. They have since disconnected the machine.  I have recieved an email today from the property management group which says:  &gt; Please let me know how much the reimbursement to you for electric service should be.  My main question then is, **What is a fair amount to ask for?**  *Additionally*, since the initial discovery of the dryer, I also discovered that one of the ceiling lights in the common area hallway entrace is also connected to my power. I came across [this webpage](http://www.mass.gov/courts/court-info/trial-court/hc/hc-landlord-tenant-faq-gen.html#3) which goes on to say:  &gt; **The hallway lights are cross-wired to my apartment‚Äôs meter, so that I am paying for the electricity in my own apartment as well as the lighting in the common  areas of the building.  Is this allowed?  Who‚Äôs responsible for the payment of utilities in general?** &gt;  &gt; Your landlord may require that you pay for common area lighting, but 105 C.M.R. 410.254 requires that your landlord may do so only if (1) the building contains fewer than four units; (2) there is a written agreement stating that you are responsible for payment of your unit‚Äôs electric service, to which the common area lighting is wired; and (3) the landlord informs the occupants of the other units that you are paying for the lights in the common area. &gt;  &gt; Under the State Sanitary Code, 105 C.M.R. ¬ß410.180 (water), ¬ß410.190 (hot water), ¬ß410.201 (heating fuel)), and ¬ß410.354(A)-(C) (electricity and gas), the owner (or landlord) of rental housing is required to provide (and pay for) these essential utilities, unless there are separate meters for each unit and a written rental agreement that provides for payment by the occupant. &gt;  &gt; The Department of Public Utilities has established procedures, 220 C.M.R. ¬ß29.00, which allow electric and gas companies to credit tenants and bill owners of residential rental property for past utility service improperly billed to tenant customers.  Since it is a 4-unit apartment, the landlord has no right to make me pay for common lighting according to the statement *the building contains fewer than four units* so this line *allow electric and gas companies to credit tenants and bill owners of residential rental property for past utility service improperly billed to tenant customers* is interesting to me. I'd like to know more about this process if it would help me out.	No
Short Why: Apartment wants to charge me $2,000 in cleaning the apartment vs. Bedbugs, I don't believe its my responsibility, they dont care, want to take it to small claims.  Ok so, my question is...do I pay the $2,000 and now I am going to small claims to reclaim it. Or do I refuse to pay it until small claims in which they determine the party responsible? I feel like in the time it takes to go to court they are going to keep demanding money and adding late fees onto my rent...etc..etc.  Thank you!	No
I have a question about disabled parking in a residential area. I live in an apartment complex in Ohio that provides only street parking. I'm disabled from arthritis and myositis (a chronic muscle disease) so I have difficulty with standing up and with walking very far. Because of this, I do need room to open my car door all the way and to lift my legs in and out of the car. Lately I've had trouble getting a close enough space, or sometimes people will be parked too close to my door for me to safely get myself and my legs in even if I'm displaying my disabled placard. I'm afraid of falling because I am also pregnant and therefore even less steady. I'm wondering if there is a way to ask for a reserved space and who I'd have to ask because of it all being street parking - is this something I'd ask apartment management or someone else? Is there even anything that can be done?    Thank you for any advice.	No
"NC.  Me and my girlfriend had lived at this apartment complex for 1 year and handed all our rent in on time. Either the 1st of the month no later than noon or 2 days before. We made sure the apartment was kept clean and fixed anything we may have damaged (railing was loose when we moved in) causing me to slip in the shower and fall. We fixed any holes from pictures or shelves and always informed the Secretary about any questions we had. When we got to our year mark, i submitted a 45 day end lease letter to allow us to move since my grandmother had became really sick. May 25th, me and my girlfriend moved out and handed in our keys except 1. The mailbox key. We talked to the secretary and had asked her if she could gather our mail every day as we would come by and get it. Since it takes 10 business days for it to fully transfer. She allowed us to hold onto the key without issue until the 2nd or 3rd of June. We handed it in before noon when we received a conformation packet about the address change. A few weeks later we received a letter stating each month the money was a few days late ( we have at least half the year of receipts to show it was on time)  we contacted the secretary and she stated ""it was to save the companies ass incase we left the apartment in a mess"". She then said ""you will receive full last month and security deposit back in a couple weeks"". As of today, my girlfriend went into the office to talk and the previous secretary has been fired leaving no noted about the key or anything else. This is the 5 staff change in less than a year period. This new secretary is now charging use the full rent of June and will not give back any of the previous money paid (as in saying my girlfriend and I never paid last months rent).   How can we fight this. Or at least send the company an email to give us our money back. To be charged a full month plus for having the key 1 extra day is ridiculous."	No
So I own a condo that I purchased in 2009.  Due to being so far underwater, our only realistic option is to rent it out.  The association says they have already reached the maximum number of rental units for the development.  Do I have any legal action that I can take to allow me to rent it out?  Some other information that may or may not be useful:  It's a co-op, not a traditional condo development.  There are 500 units and I am a 1/500th owner.  There is no builder or administrative ownership stake.  This rule (maximum number of rentals) is relatively new.  It seemed to have passed very easily, however any time a resident brings up something that they want to change, they tell us that the vote has to be affirmative for 60% of the owners in the development.  We have never had more than 200 total votes cast.  Apparently, they can change the bylaws when they want to, but not when we want to.  The association is just, in general, a nightmare.  There are currently unoccupied rental units in the development.  However because they have 'approved' the maximum number of units, I can't list mine.	No
"We purchased a new build home under a year ago. We have water damage and mold caused by an AC unit leak. The installer has admitted fault and restoration efforts have begun. I have two questions regarding the matter: 1.	We are concerned about future mold issues. Can we obligate the builder to warranty against mold?  2.	We have lost use of a bedroom, a bathroom, and occasionally lose use of our living room. We are also taking extensive time off for numerous restoration and electrical appointments. Are we able to seek damages for inconvenience/pain/suffering as this is resulting from builder negligence?"	No
Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	No
I'm wondering if any employment attorneys can help me identify the basic criteria for a successful hostile work environment claim. Specifically, suppose an employer has acted negligently, but perhaps not intentionally so, in a fashion that adversely impacts an employees career or mental health, is that sufficient for a hostile workplace claim?   As an example, say you work for a company where you need special licensure and that company screws up the process, keeping you from working. Is there a claim there?   What if your company prevents you from working for an extended period, which results in problems for you elsewhere? Say for example an 18 wheeler driver has a bunch of cocaine discovered in his trailer shipment. He has nothing to do with the coke smuggling but gets suspended for 6 months by his company anyway. Is this a hostile work environment?  What if an employee is excessively drug tested or scrutinized at work?   What if an employee is pressured to accept unfavorable workplace evaluations as a condition of returning to work?	No
"I need some advice as I'm not sure that what my landlord is doing, is actually legal  and junk.   Ok. Been at my apartment for well over a year now, and their is a parking lot right outside the building. I was told that there was 1 parking spot available for each apartment. Not assigned spots, but just a ""park anywhere"" kind of gig. I've never had any issues before.   This spring I got a job closer to my apartment so I stopped using it as much. Eventually, because everything I need is within walking distance, I stopped using it all together. I didn't think much of it until my landlord told me I need to move it.   Now they are stating that their insurance doesn't allow car's to be stored there and the insurance company is saying I have to move my car.   I explained I wasn't storing it, just haven't been using it and plan to start using it again in the future. But that's not good enough, they want it gone because ""The insurance company says it has to move"". If I don't move it they are going to tow it at my expense.   I'm getting a weird feeling like they're lying to me or what they are doing isn't legal. But I could also be dead wrong.  I'm just looking for some advice on how to navigate this. Thanks."	No
I don't want to give any serious details out, but my direct boss has falsely claimed that I have asked him out/ asked for his number and made advances towards him at work. None of these things are true.  Nothing serious has come of it, but is there any action I should take? This is just a shitty part time job but I don't want to get fucked over.   I only heard this from a co worker. It happened when my boss, another manager, and a few co workers went out for drinks, and I don't think anyone believed him.   Do I file with HR w/o proof? I don't even have an actual HR department, just a phone number. I just don't want to get into trouble for something I didn't do.	No
To make a long story short, suing the previous owner of my house for failure to disclose. We need roughly 15-20k worth of work in the bathrooms because all 3 shower/tub walls leak. We are suing in small claims court. While putting together the case it has become clear the seller lied about a lot on the sellers disclosure. The biggest is did not disclose that he updated or added to the plumbing. When he actually replaced all the plumbing (house was vandalized while empty), added a shower, moved the toliet and sink in master. He also stated that to his knowledge there were never and plumbing leaks or roof leaks. Both of these are easy to prove. Proving he knew about the leaking shower walls might be harder - but he knew. So my question is do I even need to prove he knew about that to get the $15k Im suing for, or is the fact he lied about multiple things on the disclosure enough to be awarded to $15k.   Thanks	No
A roommate has moved into my property without a lease agreement signed(His BF signed the lease, but he has not).    Do I need to give a 3 day notice to vacate?  Can I just give him a notice of eviction?  How can I ban him from coming to the property if need be?	No
I have orders to ship out with the marines late February for boot camp. I'm currently in a lease until December, ending right as my college semester does. I've saved up a good amount of money and want to rent in an apartment in Utah before I go in, before my ship date. I'm having trouble finding any month to month leasing options. Would I be able to get on a 6-month lease, give my 30 day notice and copy of orders to break the lease without repercussions? I would basically be renting from January 1st-March 1st.	No
To provide some backstory, I moved up to Colorado a few years ago and when I did, my best friend's mother allowed me to stay at her house. I ate their food, and received some gifts from them. I did some chores, as well as assisted with a renovation of the house I leased with her son (again, my best friend). Fast forward to today, I've decided to move out and separate from my best friend for personal reasons. My move out date is August 4th and our landlord has been generous to allow us to stay past the end of lease date while we sort a few things out, presuming we pay another months rent. (no contract has been signed for this month's rent. The landlord could kick us out on the 31st and there is nothing preventing them from doing so.)   Their mother is now threatening to sue me if I do not pay my full half of the August rent, when I feel it's reasonable to leave with paying 1/3 instead. Based on what I've told you folks, does she have any reasonable course of action in a court of law?	No
"My friend (friend A) lived in a 3 bedroom house with 2 other roommates. Me and friend B were offered the opportunity to move in once the school year ended and take over the lease for friend A's roommates (Lease ends in July but we planned on renewing and the landlord gave us the OK). Great location near our college we both agreed and in June once the other two roommates moved out, we moved in. However upon signing up on the online website to pay rent we found out that the 2 previous roommates didn't pay rent for the previous month (May) which ended up totaling at $800. We contacted our property management to try and solve the issue with zero response. This week we received a 3 day notice to ""Pay rent or quit""  to which we immediately called the property management company in which the only response they would really give us was ""We don't care who pays it, it just needs to be paid or else there is zero chance you can renew your lease"" Today me and friend A went into the property management company to discuss this situation to which they told us the same thing but also said we should email the head of the property management company because he may possibly find us a way to fix this. Before I email him I wanted to get some advice moving forward because a mistake in these moments I know could be very crucial.  I know the obvious situation would be to just GTFO but after only two months we just got settled into this place and have been great tenants since we came here and I would hate to be forced out of here.  We have been responsible tenants since June 1st and have been trying to work through this situation with them. Any advice/questions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!  *We haven't signed any documents because we took over the lease somewhat under the table but the landlord knew this and didn't mind"	No
Hello guys! I have a good one for you today.   So my friends and I were driving M's golf cart around the neighborhood. We're all 16-17 and there's 3 of us total. So I drive into his driveway and drop them off because they wanted to get a ball from the house. T and M hop out and then I pull out of the driveway and a decent speed (5-10mph) and then as I was pulling out I realized that I should straighten out the wheel and BOOM! I hit my friend's uncle's truck.   I'm not asking for pity or anything I was stupid and by my own stupidity I hit the truck. I called him outside and we discussed the damage. He said he wanted to make it easy on me. At first he said it was fine but I kept insisting to pay him a lot of money. So as we were outside observing the damages he said that an estimate would be around $500-$750. My heart sank but I knew I had to pay it. I gave him my number, address, and email. He said he'd contact me after he went back to his home state (he was visiting from across the country)  The next morning I get a follow up from him (IRL) and he tells me the new estimate is $2700. I thought 500-750 was bad you could imagine how I felt about this. I held it all in and with a terrified voice I said alright.   I took some pictures of the damages and I don't see how on earth it could be $2700. The pictures included show the only damage caused to the truck. The reason why I'm here is to ask you guys on your opinion/estimate/what I should do. I'm fine with paying him but the new price tag makes me a little hesitant. I think what I'm going to do is let him go back to his home state, and get a couple of estimates on the car and send them back to me. I'm not sure what the car is.

I've an ongoing dispute with my employer for over a year now. We've been going back and forth through the state Labor Commission over wages and unpaid overtime. Thus far we haven't reached a resolution.  Recently, my boss handed me a memo that detailed a bunch of new policies about when to clock in, clock out, overtime, etc and asked that I sign the memo. I declined considering that a lot of what was in the memo didn't make sense and my boss wasn't able to clarify.  Payday has come and gone without my paycheck being deposited. Obviously this is a problem but what do I actually *do* about it? I have bills that need to be paid and I don't have the money to do that because my wages haven't been deposited.	No
I rent a condo in Chicago. It is a private owner, but I have never met him. He hired a leasing/management company to manage my unit. They're pretty bad. I notify them, they wait a month to come out. This led to a huge water leak that went un-treated for a month.  I know who the owner is because I sometimes get his old mail.   The management company is trying to come after me for the damages and is saying he is really unhappy. I have a feeling they are claiming I never notified them.   Is is a breach of anything for me to reach out to the landlord?	No
I have told them this happened, they seem to be skirting around the issue. I want to know specifically if I have grounds to deduct this from my next rent check?	No
I was driving home from the gym and there was a car parked in the narrow street right outside the gym. I thought he stopped for the red light but he was parked the entire time. As I was waiting there thinking he would move a car hit me from behind going slowly. I was driving at pathfinder whereas he had something along the lines of an accord ? And his license plate was dent whereas nothing really happened to my car. When i went home however I noticed that my rear bumper had a crack on it not really noticeable. Unfortunately I'm an idiot and didn't bother exchanging information with him. Can I still ask him to fix it ?  	No
Up until last year I was a graduate student with federal student loans (no private loans) at a public university in Virginia. I had to take a leave for medical reasons, but finished all my classes and only have my thesis defense left. My last class was in Spring 2016 and I have not been registered since, but due to lack of enrollment began paying on my student debts in December 2016 after a 6 month grace period.  A few days ago I received a letter from a debt collector saying a debt has been placed with their office for collections. It states the original creditor is the university for $148.94, and there are about $150 in additional fees listed from them. It's dated June 26, 2017 and says I have 30 days to dispute in writing and gives a PO box address and phone number.   I have no idea what the debt is from and there's been no attempt to collect before now. I did move 2 months ago but have a change of address filed. I logged on to my old university account to check if a fee was added later that I may have missed but it shows my history of payments and it's all balanced at $0. I'm totally willing to pay the $148.94 if it's a real debt I owe, but I have no idea what's it's for. I would rather not pay the extra $150 in collection fees and especially don't want a hit on my credit.   Is there a way to check if it's real, and if so, what it's charged for? My university financial aid office is notoriously terrible over the phone and I'm no longer in that city to stop by in person. I want to dispute it but I don't know how to prove I send a letter in to the debt collector by writing to their PO box. I'm assuming a phone call would not be enough proof of dispute in time.	No
Hey! If your reading I thank you so much because I need to clear something up in my mind. So I basically shoplifted a few months ago, at sears (ik it's dumb) in April. The police were called as there're policy states. Anyways the police interviewed me and decided not to charge me. They took my info down (DOB,Adress,name) my concern is whether if it would show up any check for any type of employment in the future for event if they didnt charge me (police encounter)! Am I good?	No
"The apartment complex I live in has a fairly unique policy stating that all vehicles in the parking lot must be in good condition (no visible rust, no scratches, etc.) I will edit this post to include a PDF of this policy later this week.  I had a guest over for one day, and they towed that person's car with no prior notice to me. I am aware that technically it is private property, but the guest never agreed to this policy. I also feel that this policy is discriminatory to lower income individuals. Do I have any sort of case here? Like I said, the vehicle was towed with no prior notice.  Here is a snippet off of their website: ""One of our unique policies is the Vehicle Condition Agreement that is part of our Rental Criteria and an Addendum to the Lease Agreement. Amazingly it came from our applicants consistently telling us that the first thing they looked at were the cars in the parking lot.  If there were rusted, heavily dented, disabled or unsightly cars, they assumed the property was poorly operated and they would have neighbors that were unacceptable. We understand that your automobile is a personal item; however, we believe that a car that is not well maintained detracts from the overall appearance of the customer‚Äôs home."""	No
"Hello guys. My friend just came over to my house almost in hysterics - about to cry. 300'pound guy who doesn't shotput for NCAA...not exactly somebody who gets like this very often. I asked him what was wrong, and he explained the situation, which I will detail below.  He said that he was on Seeking Arrangement, which is a type of dating site. He was using a picture of and pretending to be a female that we both know - we went to HS with her. While he was doing this, he struck up a conversation with a guy and they exchanged numbers, he texted him for ""shits and giggles"" supposedly. Well, that guy eventually found out that it wasn't actually the girl and instead it was him. my buddy said that he didn't admit to it or anything over text, despite the guy urging him to admit what he did. What are the repercussions for this? I'm sure it's illegal to some point, but what action could this guy take against him? Thank you everyone. I very much appreciate any help offered here and I'm sure as hell that he will too...lol. You can save the ""what is he, gay?"" Comments, I've already given them to him twenty times over. Here are the messages that the guy sent to my friend:  ""Can we FaceTime? If that's okay"" ""Are you hiding something?"" ""Okay, I'll ask you the last time before I take action against you"" You have fifteen minutes to confess what you've done"" ""Bro, why. Like you know you would've been caught.""  My buddy didn't reply to any of these and has declined calls from this man, which I believe is the right move but I could be wrong. Thanks again for any help."	No
"So I met this guy when I was 17 (a couple months away form 18). He essentially groomed me and offered me xanax and alcohol and a place to stay when I was homeless. We got very intoxicated and passed out and when I regained consciousness is when the video takes place. I didn't know that I had this video in my possession and uncovered it when I was trying to clear space off my laptop. The video depicts the following:  &gt; Both of us are naked. We're playing around with my new camera phone and seeing how long it will take video. I am acting like a drunk 17 year old. Both of us are clearly identifiable in the video. There isn't any sexual intercourse in the video however I do reference sex with him and at one point in the video I say ""I am 17 and you are 27. I did not consent to this and you are making child porn."" From the video it looks like I was holding the phone most of the time excepting the couple times he tries to grab it and film me naked. It also appears as though he might be taking pictures or recording simultaneously on his phone.   Later on in our relationship I found a hard drive with a BUNCH of pornographic pictures and highly sexual conversations with people that he had never had relationships with. It was very clear he was suffering from a sexual addiction. Our initial contact led to a two-ish year ""relationship"" that ended in him abandoning me the day before my birthday. During this time he was highly abusive about my appearance and weight. We moved to the outer banks and lived there, away from my family, friends, or any acquaintances. When he abandoned me he managed to pack up all of our valuable possessions while he sent me a couple hours away to get my nails done for my birthday and then moved cross-country to California with his business partner without notice. This included walking out on our recently co-signed car which he purchased using the entirety of my savings. I was left with a large number of animals to care for including reptiles, fish, dogs, and cats. Immediately and with precision he  1. cancelled all our joint accounts 2. blocked me on all social media 3. set up a forwarding address 4. blocked my phone number 5. gave notice to the landlord that *both* of us would be moving out immediately  It was obviously premeditated.  Even after he left he started talking to me again a few months later. He initiated sexual exchanges over skype and email pictures (because he refused to text me). He played games and led me along emotionally and then ask for a bunch of nudes. He would even mention the idea of coming back and ""visiting."" He later went on to get caught masturbating at work (by no intent of mine) while sending it to me and ceased communication after he was fired.  To this day I haven't really been in a position to take any action against him and for years I've been too emotional traumatized to see the situation clearly. When I found the video and watched it I was disgusted by how childish and intoxicated I was and am moved to take action. I feel violated, lied to, and really this event has turned my life upside down. My credit is still destroyed by the repossession and have daily anxiety.  I'm ready to take action against him. I feel like I was a minor who was very intentionally groomed. Where do I start? I currently reside in Oregon and he is located in California (I have a last known address and I can track him down). Can I report him to the police where the video was taken and will they likely take any action? I was 17 and underage (although within a couple months of 18) but clearly was groomed, given substances, and taken advantage of by a much older individual. We are both married now, this isn't a revenge thing. I don't want anything except for him to accept some kind of consequence for his wrongdoings. Thank you."	No
I received a speeding ticket today driving 57 in a 35. I received the ticketed driving from Kentucky to Knoxville Tennessee. I was pulled over in Oneida Tennessee where the speed limit dropped from 55 to 35. The sign can not be seen until crossing over a hill, which gives you roughly 50 yards to slow down. Naturally, I did not see the sign and was pulled over immediately. I know that this was obviously a speed trap, characteristic of small towns on states borders, but I am extremely about this. Do I have any means of getting the case thrown out, and if so, what approach should I take?  I am 22, work a low paying job in a town 3 hours away.	No
This is probably a waste of time, but I wanted to ask.  My mom and my brother traveled with Greyhound last week Thursday. They had never taken a bus before and tried to maneuver it the best they could. The person working the front desk refused to put a label on two of her items -- two plain cardboard boxes that contained medical records, a bag, school supplies, and toiletries. They swore up and down the luggage would arrive in our city. Well, shocked, it did not arrive.  The real issue here is the customer service is outrageously awful. We've been hung up on, laughed at, and we were given a claim number that doesn't work. It's a 30 minute wait to reach a person and then they transfer you again.  Their compensation policy only offers $250. These items are worth more than that, and were almost certainly lost by the employees who checked them in. It was either never placed on the bus or removed.   Is there anything we can do at this point? Can we sue them? Is there anyway to get in touch with someone at the very top of the hierarchy?	No
Specifically it was a vampire novel, the main character and plot were fairly distinctive: I do still possess copies of the original work, and I also have friends who still have copies. Will this protect me in the event of the work being published by the thief? What can I do otherwise to secure authorship of my work, considering that it was never published?	No
"Ok so I have been dealing with this for a week now, and things have gone nowhere. I took my car to get it air wrapped by a gentleman who had advertised on Facebook. I picked the color, dropped off the car, and waited to see how awesome my new look would be. Things started going wrong when he sent a picture and I noticed a slight discoloration. He didn't say anything about it, so I said something, and sure enough, he messed up. So thugs aren't great because we had agreed to pick up the car that Tuesday and now it is taking longer. So I pick out the new color (since he said the original was too hard) and he got to work. Well so I thought. He didn't change out the masking, and ended up ordering the wrong color without telling me (he later told me when I asked that he had tried it and it didn't work, then told me the truth that they just didn't have it in stock). So I didn't say anything other than asking why it was different. So I go to pick it up and I first see some errors. Nothing big, and stuff he said he could fix. He was in a rush, so I paid him contingent on him fixing it. Well when I get home and have a good hour to look at it, I start noticing how poorly it was done. He also had bent trim pieces, damaged the interior door handle, and got overspray all throughout the car. I approached him and asked him to explain. He said it was normal so I asked several installers who were out of state. I have over 4 people telling me it was not done right. He said he messed up on the phone, but couldn't give a refund. So I offered a payment plan. Well now he says he spoke with a lawyer and the lawyer said since the paper didn't say it was a contract it technically isn't one. I'll attach some pictures, but I'm curious if I have a case with this or if I should cut my losses.   Forgot to add, he also removed the first covering with a large ring on (posted a video after I got the car). And I'm worried I'll find scratches underneath. Would he be liable since it was negligent to have a ring so close to car paint? Thanks!'   Edit: added pictures with picture of ""paper"" I signed.   Edit two. Didn't post the cropped picture. Will reupload"	No
I stayed in Montreal last month and found bed bugs there. I took every heat treating precaution the intent recommended on my stuff (in retrospect why didn't I just throw everything away? It was probably just $400 worth of items) but I just found a baby bed bug in my sheets at home today and I have bites.   I've contacted an exterminator to get an inspection and treatment plan, but I made the mistake of putting in the notes on their Web form that I think I brought them back from a trip.   Is there a chance this could somehow be used by my landlord to hold me liable if bugs start turning up in the other 7 units in my building? Am I required to report it to my landlord/property management company if I'm having my apartment treated for bed bugs? Even if I THINK I brought the bugs home from a trip and made a statement to that effect, is that proof? What can I do to protect myself here?    (And no, of course I don't have Renter's insurance, I'm a dumb poor millennial.)	No
As the title suggests, the gas meter stopped working a couple of years ago and my dad never reported it and no one from the gas company ever checked or inquired. I told my dad that he could get into trouble sooner or later but he is too stubborn about this. He believes that it is their duty to check it and correct the issue. So i guess this is how it will go on. What could be the legal consequences of this if they find out later? Will my dad be held accountable?	No
Me and my roommate rent a room in out landlord's 3 bedroom house, and the landlord lives with us in the hose. My roommate has been late on rent the past 6 months due to chronic mental illness. And now the landlord is taking steps to evict us.  He's written notes, and is following the eviction process steps prior to filling the official eviction notice with the courts.  The landlord is *NOT* paying taxes on the rent money we give him. And he clearly knows he's in the wrong because he always insists on us paying cash only and also doesn't allow us to correct return money for being renters on our taxes.  We had agreed on a payment plan in order to get my roommate caught up on rent. Then out of nowhere he posts these notes to our door.  He's threatening to shut off utilities and change the locks soon if he doesn't receive payment.  How illegal is this? Can someone give me useful links to California laws for renters which are relevant to the above? I have also caught him discussing the late payments with people on the phone and with out roommate. Does that violate our right to quiet enjoyment?  need help asap. I just want to let him know I know my rights!	No
Texas - I am representing my self in a small claims lawsuit brought by a former landlord who is suing me for damages in excess of my security deposit. I also have a counter claim against him for failing to act in a timely manner (No contact for close to 90 days after vacating the property). Last week I was notified that he has requested a Jury Trial which means our next court appearance will be a pre-trial hearing. The landlord does have an attorney representing him in court but for the amount we are being sued for, I'd likely spend more on an attorney if I went that route than I'd avoid paying if I lose the lawsuit, so I am sticking to representing myself. What should I expect to happen and what can I do to be prepared?  Thanks in advance for all of your help.	No
Keep in mind, he told me when I first moved in that I could leave whenever. Now I didn't give him a months notice before I left but that was because the place was an absolute shithole filled with roaches, bedbugs, and stuff that needed repairs. He let me stay for two weeks at the apartment for half a months rent, but never mentioned anything about being paid a *full* months until I started hounding him for my money back. I have the lease we signed and there's no mention of that at all. I lost the receipt to my transaction for my two weeks rent tho. I have pictures of how crappy the apartment was when I lived there as well. What should I do? Am I screwed out of 250$?	No
"My sister's roommate gave us her old washer and dryer to replace our older washer and dryer. Sunday afternoon, the moving company that the roommate hired brought them to us and installed them both, but it felt like they were rushing things to get out of there. They left and forgot to turn the water back on, which I realized when I tried to give the washer a test run.  Today (Tuesday), I discovered that the floor in the laundry room had water under it. In addition, the wall of my bathroom was wet, and a puddle has formed behind the toilet (laundry room and bathroom are back-to-back). I turn off the washer's water valve and my sister called a plumber for me. He found out that the washer's connection to the house's water valve wasn't tightened and was leaking water when turned on, and he was able to turn it a good 5 or so times to tighten it. My sister also had to call a carpet cleaner company to come dry the affected floors and walls, which they're doing now.  My sister called the movers and told them the situation and asked for reimbursement. They refused, saying that it wasn't their fault since they weren't the ones that turned on the valve. They also said that if they really didn't tighten it, then it would've leaked while they were there (it didn't leak while they were there because they forgot to turn on the water though). My sister decides that she'll have to take them to small claims court.  So I'm not exactly familiar with how these proceedings work, so what exactly should we do here? I feel like we have somewhat of a solid case, but I don't want anything to go wrong. Do they have a case for anything with the point of ""we didn't turn on that valve, we can't be responsible?"" I want to say it sounds stupid, but I could be wrong. Any advice?"	No
So I am wanted for a pretty serious crime, like probably the first or second biggest one. There is a international warrant for my arrest. I want to look at my options with a lawyer and see what the best way to approach this is. Say I meet up with one, and tell him my situation, can he tell the police.. Lets say I dont pick him, can he call the police and say hes in this state.. etc.	No
I have a opportunity to work outside of my country for two years. Anyways I would still apply each year for DV lottery while I'm outside of Croatia.

I am a Wyoming resident and have been on a month to month lease with the owner for 2 years. While away on vacation, the owner entered the home and took pictures of the residence claiming it was too messy. There are a few things that are wrong with the house but nothing other than normal wear or tear. She drafted a document with things that she wanted cleaned or they would evict us. We are not sure if she could legally enter the premesis without notice. Furthermore, on the document they claim we are responsible for taking care of electrical issues. Any advice about this would be very appreciated.	No
I've lived in my current apartment for about 6-7 years now, and management has changed hands a number of times. Over the last year a new company came in, and set up security cameras in all the common areas, including the building entrances and exits.  I never really had any issue with this, but now I've been handed a lease renewal to sign, and I see that there's a photography release clause in there. I can't copy &amp; paste from the source, so I'm summarizing, but if necessary I can transcribe it.  Basically it says they can use any image from any of the cameras in the building for any reason, and they don't have to notify you or compensate you.  Now, I'm sure they're not going to take a top-down photo of my fat ass staggering back through the lobby from the pub and use it in their next publicity campaign or anything, but it just seems absurdly invasive to me all the same.   Are they allowed to do this? It would be ok-(ish) if I could avoid the camera areas, but residents literally can't, they're in all the building entrances.	No
My property has a city storm drain, which looks obviously broken. The exit of the drain hole is far below the ground level, and all the dirt from my property is sliding into it, and there's no retaining wall to prevent it from happening. The hole of the drain pipe looks like it was snapped, it's uneven. I think the original pipe was longer. The water out of the storm drain gets dumped straight on my property, there's no waterbed, it erodes my hillside  I requested city to repair, they sent a guy and he said it operates as designed, they won;t do anything  To compound the problem, the old owner of the house built a deck close to the drain pipe exit, and there's an easement. The city guy is now threatening that he'll have us remove deck, and that's the only way to get to the basement.  That leaves me in a limbo, as I can't fix city drain (I assume, since they own it, they'll come after me if I do, right?), and not only they won't fix, but if I asking them would make them come and remove the deck. And while that happens, my property takes damage every time it rains  Questions:  1. What are my legal options here? 2. Is there a good attorney in Portland or south of Portland here on Reddit, who could take case, and what will it cost me?	No
My fiance is now getting her wages garnished due to $8000 being owed to an apartment complex she moved out of in San Diego 2 years ago. The other roommates were kicked out and the complex sued them all. She called the apartments and told them she moved out when she first got the law suit. If the other roommates will agree she moved out and the agree to have the garnishment only on their wages can anything be done? We are filing for a exemption in California for Head of Household. She has main custody of her child. But we need to get all of the garnishment removed to pay rent/ car payments/ and food.	No

Hi guys, so here is the scenario. I took my car to get a free code scan to an autoshop (Goodyear). They gave a sheet with the codes and gave me the car keys back. When I went to my car, I found the car smashed in. I went inside and asked them what happened. The manager and the employee who drove my car denied the car crash. They said they didn't do anything and it was there already. I called the cops and then the manager made a claim through their company corporate. The manager told me that the company doesn't have its own insurance but it has a third party insurance. The manager told me that the car will be inspected and an estimate of the damage will be calculated. Afterwards the company will either have a body shop fix it or pay the amount for the damage depending who is seen to be at fault. He said that their insurance will be contacting my car insurance. He only said that my car's front bumper is damaged, when in fact i disagreed. The car's bumper is dented in; the grill came off; a part of the undercarriage frame is bent; car takes longer to crank up now. UPDATE: Goodyear's insurance denied the car crash and they denied the claim that was requested by the manager. The Goodyear insurance person said that the damage was not caused by the employees but it might have been one of their customers since they claim to have a footage from a nearby store. Here are the problems that I have with this: 1. This cannot go through my insurance, there are way too many claims (all no fault) on there already. I won't be able to afford a further increase for the car insurance. What can I do if they refuse to reimburse me from their insurance company? Would the next step be to go to small claims court?  2. If I take it to small claims court, how does the process work? and how would i get the amount for the damage the manager said there is and also the damage he said there is not?   3. Should I use these estimates as proof to claim there is more damage than the company agree to?   4. This is what i prefer: I want the company to pay for the damage and I want to fix it myself. Is this possible? What do I do to get them to pay me instead of fixing it through their body shop?  5. What should i do if they claim it through my insurance company? I don't want this  I know this is a long post, I am frustrated and confused. I don't know where to start, please give any information you think is helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read my whole post.	No
At school, I was given detention. During this detention my teacher asked me to pour this 4.01 orion ph buffer. If you check the MSDS it says safety goggles and gloves should be worn. I wasn't instructed to wear this. It's been a year and my eye is still inflammated. This is causing me pain and depression. Is it possible to sue the school for this ? When I told the teacher what had happened and asked if I should see a doctor she said she thought it was an allergic reaction and didn't tell me to go to the doctor. This was at the end of the year. Maybe a week or 2 before finals. I came back after the summer and she said she had no memory of me and didn't even know my name. She also said there was no evidence and it ends right there- I was polite and only asking if I could know what the chemical was and why it did that to my eye. Is it impossible to sue ?	No
This post is for my friend,  She lives in New Orleans, Louisiana and has a legal lease agreement. Her landlord sent her a letter stating that if she wasn't out in 5 days she would be evicted because she didn't pay her rent yet this month.  Is her landlord in the right? Can she get her deposit back?	No
I'm in a huge pickle. My roommate and I regretfully signed a 3 year lease. Upon moving in, we have noticed that there were many fixes needed to be made. Some the LL did do, and some they deemed our responsibility. But because of these many requests, it seems that they are getting more angered, and this is reflected very clearly in their emails to us. Now, they want to fine us for things that we did not do, nor do they have proof that we did it. IE, we informed them on a mosquito infestation on our lot, which they stated was our responsibility. So we sweeped the place of all the feces, piled up leaves, misc dirt etc. And now he is claiming we cut and destroyed their plants across the wall. We do not have proof of the plants before. But they are now wanting to charge us for professional services to replant it, with gross exaggeration of how bountiful it was. Is he legally able to make us pay for the replanting fees if he does not have proof that we destroyed his plants?  So in addition to this, a lot of other things had happened that made us feel unsafe in our home.   From our attorney friends and peers reading our lease, they have told us that the lease seems illegal with how much liability they are putting on the tenants and that it is ununconcionable and won't be  upheld in court. We want to be able to terminate the lease and are willing to pay the standard MD fee of paying rent until the unit is rented out. However, since that lease does not state a termination requirement, are we able to do so?   Thank you so much. This problem has given me so much distress :(	No
I wanted to get some quick advice on an issue I have regarding my landlord and property company. I signed a lease in Feb 2015 for a year and went month to month. I signed with a property management company but the landlord's name is still on the lease. Fast forward to last month during move out. I paid the full months rent but moved out June 16. I relinquished keys to the owner but still kept a key since I was still responsible for the property up until June 30. The property management company conducted the walk through and the owner was there also. I cleaned the house very thoroughly but there were still some wear and tear (nothing major) that needed to be handled. I asked the owner that since 1. I found her a renter, 2. I cleaned the house extremely well and 3. I paid the full months rent, if she would cut me a break on the deposit or at least pay me back the half month rent I would be out. She said she would get back to me but never did. I followed up a few days before June 30 and she responded with a laundry list of items that were previously discussed (carpet cleaning etc.) that she just went ahead and completed and would charge my deposit. Since my contract with the property management company was not due until June 30, I called them and they said since I relinquished the keys to the owner, they could not help me. I am still in contract with the property management company so everything she completed up until June 30 should go under my contract, correct? Since I believed I was getting screwed, I asked for another inspection but they denied it. I wanted to show them all the issues that were fixed. Since I was responsible for any damages up until June 30, why am I not responsible for any touch ups and improvements? Just received a check in the mail for $50 for my deposit fee ($1,150). I do not believe this to be fair since I paid a full months rent. If I relinquished control to the owner on June 16 then she would owe me 1/2 month rent that I paid, correct? If not, then those improvements that she conducted were still under my contract and I should get the entirety of my deposit back.  Long story short, I want to know if I have a case here regarding my deposit or 1/2 month rent. Both landlord and property management company have become extremely hostile towards me regarding this and I wanted to reach out and see if there is anything I can do to move forward with a legal case/small claims court (possibly). I am not sure. As previously stated, this in Las Vegas, Nevada.	No
Hi all,   My mom and dad share joint ownership over a piece of property in the town of Pascagoula, Mississippi. My dad wants to transfer his ownership to me, so he suggested using a Quit Claim Deed to sign over his portion of ownership to me.   Could anyone advise whether this would work?   I understand a Quit Claim Deed transfers ownership with no warranty, but I'm unsure of whether it would apply in this case due to the nature of split ownership.   Thank you all	No
"Sorry this is going to be a long post. I'm not sure if this is actionable at all but I thought I'd post here and see what people think. I'm a 30 year old male that lives in British Columbia, Canada.  I have been very sick for the past seven years and have officially been diagnosed with an insulinoma. It is a rare pancreatic tumor on the pancreas. This is my story.  In 2010 I started becoming quite ill and went to my family doctor multiple times for a year.  He misdiagnosed me with celiac disease and then after that was ruled out by a specialist, my GP gave up on me.  I decided to take matters into my own hands and in less than an hour of researching online I discovered that I most likely was having multiple hypoglycemic attacks a day.  I went back to him and got several requisitions for blood work checking my glucose levels, and sure enough I was right.  My blood sugars were ranging from 2.7-4.1 mmol/L after meals and throughout the day, which is dangerously low. The most common form of hypoglycemia is reactive hypoglycemia.  The treatment for this is eating healthy and exercising, which I was already doing.  At the time I was a personal trainer studying kinesiology and extremely fit with about 8% body fat.  Because of this my GP ruled out reactive hypoglycemia and his diagnosis was insulinoma, an insulin secreting tumor on my pancreas which made perfect sense to me.  I was then referred to an endocrinologist for further help.  The endo did standard tests to check my liver and kidney function and to make sure I didn't have cancer, and then diagnosed me with reactive hypoglycemia without doing a single blood glucose test.  I had gone to a dietitian at my local hospital who said my diet was perfect.  I even wrote out my diet for the endo but all he said was to eat better. He said there was no way it could be insulinoma but never really gave a reason why. I then took his advice and ate even healthier by almost eliminating all carbs from my diet except for some veggies, and I got immensely worse and my blood glucose was even lower than before.    I tried to go back to the endo but he refused to see me.  I then went to endo #2 for a second opinion.  Endo #2 saw me for 5 minutes and said it was reactive hypoglycemia, but on the off chance it was an insulinoma he told me to do a 12 hour fasting blood glucose test. The test turned out negative. He told me this would rule out insulinoma, but now that i know more about the condition a 12 hour fast has never been given to diagnose insulinoma. Even when it was first discovered in the early 1900's.  There was always a 48hr supervised fast test in a hospital with strict protocols, which turned into a 72hr fast test, and today basically any blood tests with blood glucose under 3.0 and high insulin, c-peptide or pro insulin is enough to diagnose insulinoma.   Shortly after that I tried every healthy diet i could find, and the only thing I found was that the healthier i ate the worse i got. So I preformed an experiment where I only ate junk food.  The diet was less than 30g of protein a day and over 600 grams of fast acting carbs like pizza, mcdonalds, apple pie, soft drinks, candy, pasta and garlic bread.  For the first time in almost 3 years my blood glucose was normal and i felt relief of all my symptoms for two weeks.  However this was not a reasonable diet, I gained over 10 lbs in a short amount of time and still become hypoglycemic when i exercised.  I demanded endo #1 see me again with this new information and he agreed.  I saw him and told him the healthier i ate the worse i got, but the worse i ate the better my blood sugars were, which is consistent with insulinoma.  He admitted that it made absolutely no sense.  I asked him what do we do now, and he said ""i don't know"".  I asked if he could refer me to someone who could help and he said, no. If i wanted another referral for another opinion i would have to go to my GP and ask him.   Upset and confused by this endo, I returned to my GP and asked for another referral to someone new.  He did so, but endo #3 refused to see me saying that he agreed with endo #1 and there was nothing out of the ordinary about my case. I then luckily got referred to a wonderful internist who saw me right away and told me there was no way this is reactive hypoglycemia. He forced endo #3 to see me.  I then saw endo #3 and he explained to me what reactive hypoglycemia was and how i have it.  He said it couldn't be insulinoma because when my blood sugars were 2.7, my insulin levels weren't high enough.  He was wrong on multiple accounts here.  My insulin level was in fact high enough, and even if it weren't he should have tested my c-peptide during a hypoglycemic event to rule out insulinoma.  C-peptide actually gives a more accurate indicator of how much insulin is being released in the body and is crucial in diagnosing insulinomas. So i asked to go to the diabetes clinic to see if they can help me with my diet, since he was so sure it was reactive hypoglycemia.  I went to the clinic and they immediately said this is not reactive hypoglycemia.  They sent a letter to endo #3 telling him that he has to help me figure out what's going on.  So i go back to my internist who spoke with endo #3 and apparently he reluctantly said there may be something else going on here.  So then I was referred to endo #4 in a different city.  Endo #4 saw me and immediately said that there is no way this is reactive hypoglycemia.  She suspected and confirmed insulinoma after having me induce a hypoglycemic attack and having glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels taken. I saw her in 2015, and the test only took one day.   She then sent me to endo #5 in my own city to do the appropriate image testing to locate the tumor.  Endo #5 decided to do a 72hr fast to confirm that i in fact have insulinoma.  I spoke to endo #4 who said this was unnecessary, but if she wanted to have it done then i had to do it. It took 8 months for her to do the test and get the results and she sent me a letter saying i passed the test and nothing was wrong with me.  So either i'm the first person in recorded history with an insulinoma to pass this test, or she did it incorrectly.     So i go back to endo #4 and she tells me, if she doesn't think i have an insulinoma then she thinks im drugging myself.  She told me that's the only way I could be lowering my blood glucose so low.  So I induced a hypo with high insulin and high c-peptide with a negative drug screen.  After that endo #4 and endo #3 agreed i had an insulinoma.  The interesting thing is that for this test, my insulin was actually lower than the test endo #3 used as evidence to say my insulin wasn't high enough.  This makes no sense to me how he says this confirms insulinoma when previously he said that my insulin levels weren't high enough.   So then after all that I have been undergoing imaging studies and other fun tests for the past several months and they have 100% found the tumor in the tail of my pancreas.  I'm currently waiting for a surgery date to have it removed.    I feel very outraged and angry that it has taken 7 years to figure this out, when my GP and I have told them this is what it was 6 years ago.  Over the past 7 years i've barely been able to work.  I had to quit school and stopped being a personal trainer.  In fact when I saw my internist 2 years ago, he told me my blood sugar levels were way too low to function as a normal human being let alone work, and put me on disability for the past 2 years while we figured this out.  I also ended up having blood sugar readings of less than 2.2 mmol/L, which is considered life threatening.  I don't know if this is worth pursuing legally but I've got time to kill until my surgery so i might as well look into it, thanks!"	No
Hello, My mom had a bill from her dentist which was sent to collections. The dentist told her she would have to pay both the bill and the collections fee. So my mom pay the fee through the collections, but has not received a bill for the fee the dentist hired for collections. Will she receive a notice about this or is everything set? She no longer goes to this dentist.	No
Im designing a prototype for a friend who will be producing a larger unit (using my prototype as a controller) and selling it on the open market. I will be paid for this, but I'm getting cold feet. I want to make sure that I'm protected should anything occur with the end unit and the user of said unit would want to sue. Is there any documentation or processes I should do to ensure that I'm not at fault and this whole thing come crashing down on me should anything happen?	No
"So i live in a development built in the late 60's. It's all septic tanks. Some of those tanks are failing, causing human fecal coliform to appear in local streams occasionally.  Development is 250 houses, by the Twp's data there's about 50 failing septic systems. The rest are fine and not polluting. Twp is now saying we MUST get public sewer, and that cost must be paid by ONLY the 250 house affected (even though Twp retains the right to add newer developments to the system at a later date). ESTIMATED cost is $32k per house, mandatory. On top of that, estimates to actually hook to the system are another $14k.  The Twp has secured funding to allow residents to finance the $32k, but it's through the state. State requires up-front collateral, meaning they will place a lien on your house for the $32k from the start, negatively affecting your credit score.  These are fairly large land plots (2-5 acres), and due to how the house were designed some people are looking at insane bills to hook to the system. Over $50k, on top of the $32k.  The Twp is not REQUIRING you to hook up unless your system is failing. BUT, the house cannot be sold unless it's hooked up. Dept of Health has said once the sewer is in, they will no longer issue permits for septic tank repairs.  My septic is fine, it's inspected every two years (and was just inspected two weeks ago). My well is fine. I have zero need for this. Can a Twp force JUST certain homeowners to pay for what is essentially a public work? Twp's response to that is, ""well the other developments have already purchased their sewer system, so we cannot make them pay for yours."" To that I say FU, I've been paying $10k a year to send your goddamn kids to school when I don't have any.  Thoughts? TIA"	No
"This is my first time posting anything like this, so please forgive me if I don't follow all of the rules.   I'll start with some background information. My dad has been working as a maintenance technician for a certain apartment managing company at one of their properties in southern Nevada since April 2016. We have been living at this property since March 2017. He has always been a loyal and hard worker, not only in my opinion, but the opinion of his previous coworkers and supervisor. (The manager, supervisor, and other maintenance technician have all quit in the last 2 weeks) He always goes beyond what his job asks of him and makes sure the apartment grounds are clean and presentable. He would never steal from the company and prays daily for its success.   Just for reference, my dad was born and raised in the Philippines. He speaks English fluently and has lived in America for almost 30 years, but he has an accent and never went to college. All of the managers and employees in the office are white.   As of today, he has been terminated from the company for stealing money. As far as I know, they have no direct evidence at all to support this claim. This calls for legal action right? I really don't know what I can do, though, since I'm only 17 and have never studied law. I know for a fact that my dad has been treated and terminated unfairly by the management, but I have no ""direct evidence"" against them either.  The only thing that they could deem suspicious is that they are currently renovating the property and my dad is selling the old appliances to a family friend, whose business is buying and selling appliances. The money goes directly from the family friend, to my dad, to the regional manager. In fact, most of the time it goes directly from the family friend to the regional manager. He has done this since they started renovating the property around February. A lady, that I will call Kim, has recently (in the last 2 weeks) been promoted to assistant or acting manager or some higher position, and witnessed this happening (on her 1st day). Immediately, she requested the money be given to her, because ""it is not [my dad's] money, but the company's"". My dad refused to give it to her and told her that he will give it to the regional manager, which he did as soon as the manager got back from vacation.   As a sidenote, on the other properties that this certain company owns, the maintenance technicians get to keep the money earned from selling the appliances. For some reason, this particular property does not do that and all the money goes directly to the managers, but I digress. I apologize for getting sidetracked.   More on why my dad has been treated unfairly: After that incident, Kim has been keeping a hawk eye on my dad and tracks his actions by the minute. They all communicate through those walkie-talkie radios, and every 15 minutes she asks him what he is doing or demands that he come to the office right away to fix something or clean something, even when he is in the middle of a work order. Also, because they keep the old appliances in the unused garages and they have a list of those garages in the office, she asked him to take her around to EVERY unused garage (there are likely around 30 or 40 on the grounds because a lot of tenants are moving out) and open them so that she can check them personally and make sure there are no missing appliances. As far as I know, she did not find any, or else my dad would have been given a warning or terminated that week, right? (this is on her 2nd or 3rd day of being assistant manager)  Maybe that is just that standard that they should be following, or maybe she is just doing what she thinks is best for the company, but there is another maintenance technician on the grounds too, who does nothing but ride around on his golf cart and sneak into his own apartment (I always see him and his cart at his own apartment building) and she definitely does not check on him as often as she does my dad, or else he wouldn't be spending hours at home. A more concrete example of his laziness is that he spent 4 hours painting one patio that should take 20 minutes and he always tells my dad to take it easy and work less. He is a nice guy overall, though. Sorry, I know I should be keeping it objective but I can't help but think that this is absolutely unfair.   My dad commented on this to the regional manager, who said that he would ""talk to her about it."" She did not change at all, and said, ""at least you have a job,"" when he told her directly that he did not like the way she treated him and that it was unfair.  Later in the week, my dad asked Kim if he could work overtime during the weekend since he knew that there were a lot of work orders to do and we needed the money. Kim hired temporary workers over the weekend, who did almost no work orders, as evidenced by the amount of work orders left for my dad to do the following week. He talked to Kim about it and she claimed that she called him. My dad received no phone calls that weekend.  Lastly, my dad was terminated today. We paid the rent for this month (August + 1st week of September) on Friday. We have 3 days as of yesterday (August 7th) to evacuate from the property. When management fired him, they said they have been planning it for quite a while. If they were planning it, why didn't they tell us earlier? I understand that it is the right of the company to fire employees at their discretion, but why don't they have the consideration to tell us last week, before we paid the rent for this month? My dad said they will talk about reimbursing the rent, but he doesn't think they will. I'm sorry, maybe I am not educated or mature enough to understand, but can anyone explain to me why we have to pay the rent for the entire month when we have to move out by Wednesday?  Sorry that this post is too long and that it might have some errors. It's midnight and I've had a rollercoaster of a day. Just please tell me if there's anything I can or should do, legally, because I'm really at a loss and I just can't accept that the company did nothing wrong. My dad has been apologizing to me the whole day, saying that it's his fault for messing everything up and he shouldn't have complained to the management at all and just did everything they say. I even saw him crying for the first time in years. We still haven't found a place to stay, but I will worry about that in the morning.   Thank you all in advance for your time and advice."	No
I live in PA, my house is on a corner lot. My deed states that a ten foot wide roadway must be accessible for my two neighbors next to me to access their property located at the back of my property. It is my land on the deed. One can I remove this from my deed so I can build a garage or shed? Two, the person next to me is not providing access to their next door neighbor which it states in my deed could this help? There is a gate to my neighbor‚Äôs yard but I have never seen anyone use the gate. Please help if you can, and thanks in advance.	No
Hello all and thank you in advance for any advice you can give me,   Young professional in Houston, wanted to move in to my first studio apartment and found what I thought was a good deal. I asked for an additional discount and they allowed me to move in August 31st, as stated on the lease which would give me a $700 discount for my first month. Retrieving my e-signed lease shows that a highrise representative signed off on all parts of the lease. Part of the lease agreement was that I had to arrange an Renter's Insurance policy with a $100,000 personal liability coverage. After receiving acceptance of the lease I went ahead and secured this for $200.   Now I'm being told that because the current tenant is moving out on August 31st that I must move in on September 7th, losing my $700 discount for summer and on top of that I must get Renters' Insurance from a different company with a $300,000 personal liability coverage.   My Questions:   Since they have electronically signed the lease agreement:   Can they force me to move in later and lose my discount?  Must I get new Renter's Insurance on their demand even though I did as stated on the agreed upon lease agreement?  If I do get new Renter's Insurance will the $200 I already paid be refunded from my old company?  Do I have any legal standing in this matter?  Can I cancel my lease as a breach of contract without any repercussions?   I plan to go in soon and talk to them, the move-in date won't matter so much but the main thing I wanted was the summer discount and losing it is really bad for me. I want to persuade them to let me keep this discount, could I use the lease agreement as ammunition? Should I pursue keeping the same Renter's Insurance?   Thank you all again - I feel like I'm being taken advantage of but am unsure.	No
Columbus, OH  My SO and I have been dating for ~5 years and want to move into an apartment together along with a third roommate.  They have both signed the lease and have cosigners.  I will not require a cosigner and not yet had an opportunity to sign.  Recently, her parents have made clear that they do not approve of us cohabiting.  My question is whose consent do I need to be on this lease?  Do her parents need to find out?	No
"I am on the lease with my partner, who has loved on this property for 5 years now. In the past 5 years, ownership of the property has shifted from a private couple to a development company. And the development company obviously wants us out so they can do their job and develop the property.   Original owners were great. When something would break down I am handy. New toilet handle, garbage disposal, drain clogged, lock needed to be changed, I was on it. We also paint the interior of the house yearly. When we do something like this we would contact the landlord and let them know, send the receipt and all would be well.   New owners come in and buy up the place. Simply copy and paste the original leases and put their names at the top with the condition that ""we will build in a year.""  That's fine, because in West Hollywood, where we live, we get a nice payout from them once they kick us out. So we are okay with that. One day, the lock on the front door gets jammed up and needs to be fixed. I email the landlords and ask if its cool that I fix it, send them a copy of the key if need be. They send over some unlicensed guy the next day to fix it.   Outlets, a new sink, clogged drains, all worked on by guys who clearly had very little experience working with this stuff, just handymen. Code enforcement was called by me several times to inspect the handiwork and make sure a pipe would not burst or a wire would not burn the house down. I documented every incident and presented it to code enforcement for the city, asking that they back me up and fine the development company.   I was told by a city official that no fines would be brought against the development company as the properties were slotted for development. I was told by my landlord that any change I made to the property I would break the lease, even if it took 3 days for them to fix a water leak after we turned the water off. I have a copy of the original lease, none of this is present on there. I do not think the landlord even has a copy.  I have emails from city officials detailing a maintenance moratorium (nothing in the city's standards and practices mentions a procedure for designating a property to be under a maintenance moratorium) for the properties. One of the developers is on the board of planning for the city, has not recused himself for this project, I have documentations of numerous violations of the city code and timelines which show fines should have been levied by code enforcement but have not, I have a city council member's ear, documentations of unlicensed workers doing work which has left my home in a substandard condition, and plenty more.   I am this close to hiring an attorney and filing suit, the only reason I have not is I do not want the city officials to circle the wagons and try to shut me out. What are my options at this point? All I want is the home to be kept up to the standard laid out by code enforcement."	No
"Happened in Utah, USA.  To begin, yes I learned my lesson. Won't be happening again.   Basically what happened is, at night my SO and I decided to drive out to a seemingly secluded place. We found a parking lot for a hiking trail that was empty. We did the deed, and then as we were putting clothes back on an officer approached the car.   We decided the best plan of action was to come clean. And so we did.   He asked us both basic questions (""Are you here on your own free will, did you consent to the activities taken place"") and looked at both of our IDs.  Then he just came back and said ""yeah, just find a better place to do this next time, go home tonight."" He didn't say ""you're under arrest"" either.   No alcohol was involved. We are both adults.   Am I off the hook? Was I unknowingly charged with anything? He didn't mention anything like an arrest or a citation or anything like that. Did he jus need our IDs to confirm our birthdays or are we going to get citations?  I feel like I'm kinda off the hook but I can never be too sure.   Thanks in advance."	No
I'll start at the beginning. My boyfriend &amp; I moved out of a crappy apartment in North Dakota. We moved into a nicer apartment with the same company, different offices. So my boyfriend drops off the check for rent ($700) at new apartment. A few days later, we get a call we owe late fees and rent. We show them we gave them the check for rent. They say they'll figure it out. That was almost 2 months ago. So now they called and said they messed up and gave the rent check to the old apartment. On our move out check, we got back $644. (They took over $800 for cleaning, replacing blinds, etc.) So now they're saying it's their fault for losing the check but we still owe them the $700 for first month rent. We barely scrape by as is so finding another 700 is beyond me. Is there any legal binding for me to pay the rent that they used and misplaced? They did use the money, they just accidentally gave it back a portion.	No
Massachusetts renter here.   I recently had to vacate long time apartment due to sale of the home. Had lived in apartment for 8 years, and was in a month to month agreement with landlord. Received 30 notice to vacate on July 6th, found new apartment and moved out on July 28th.  Prior to moving landlord made some comments about his eagerness to retain my security deposit, which came out of left field, as I've been a model tenant for the entirety of my time renting (rent paid in full/on time every WEEK for 8 years)   When I left the apartment I left 5 larger pieces of furniture (bed/frame , bureau, hutch, love seat, and computer desk) that I had no room and/or use for in my new apartment.   Landlord had previously reached out to me and told me he would be away from August 5th (date I needed to be out of apartment) until some time this week.   He called me yesterday to confirm that I was out of the apartment, I told him I was/had been since the 28th, and also explained about the larger pieces of furniture, and suggested that he used the security deposit to pay someone to remove them.   He had since called me multiple times (I have not answered) and left 2 aggressive messages, threatening to file eviction proceedings if I do not remove my property.   I am not living in the home from which he is threatening to evict, I have up to date rent receipt  for the past 8 years showing I do not owe him $$, and I believe I am well within my rights to leave the property and abandon my deposit. I have spent well over $3000 on moving expenses over the past month, and frankly cannot afford to spend several hundred dollars to dispose of my old property, especially without knowing whether I will recoup my security deposit or not.   Am I within my rights, or could I possibly lose an eviction case, despite not living in the property?	No
Signed a 12 month lease for a larger two bedroom apartment floor plan with a move in date of August 12. Was wrongfully (she admitted it) given handicap accessible apartment, which is a HUGE difference in counter height, door frame size and more. She has no more apartments available until October, but is not willing to move anyone who was promised an apartment after me. My lease is up now on August 18, and I don't know what to do? It's not specified on the lease that it was a handicap accessible apartment, and that was not the one I was promised and given a tour for.	No
So like the title says, I'm moving from WA to NC and need to sign a lease before I get there.  The area I'm moving to doesn't have many rental companies, so I will be most likely renting from a private individual.  What's the best way for me to do this without getting scammed (or making the potential landlord think I'm scamming him)?	No
"Got in an accident a while back.  Sought legal assistance.  The lawyer I found dropped my case after a month and I felt they wasted my time.  I left them a single negative review online containing hard facts, all of which were true. I can back up any of my claims with evidence from multiple sources.  I settled with the driver on my own and figured it was time to move on.  The lawyer felt otherwise.  Since our ""falling out,"" the lawyer has taken the following actions:  * Called me to threaten legal action against me if I do not take down my factual review * Called my employer to try to convince them to fire me, saying he knows their business partners etc. * Called various family members of mine and made them feel harassed. * Has emailed me countless times threatening multiple lawsuits. * Has emailed me threatening to employ a private investigator for the situation. * Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false. * Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer) * Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident * Is threatening me with lawsuits, again  I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.  what do you think?  1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment? 2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since. 3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?"	No
I live in Vancouver, BC. I think I know the person who may be ordering pizza online for me from abroad. I fired him and he was quite upset. He moved to another country a few months later. That's my evidence against him. I heard from another person that he plans to move back to Vancouver, BC next year. Once he comes back, can I have the police arrest him for harassment?	No
"To preface this with a little bit of background, I have chronic migraines where I frequently get to deal with going temporarily blind, followed by several hours of excruciating pain worsened by light or sound. It sucks, but it's the hand I was dealt. Migraines, while often seemingly random, are triggered by several things for me, most notably by strobing or flickering lights and by cinnamon.   I moved recently into a new apartment close to my college campus, where the lease guarantees me the use of three assigned parking spots in a garage underneath the apartment complex. When I moved in I noticed that there were 5-6 flickering lights inside the apartment complex's garage, and I quickly called the property management company to ask if they could please fix the lights, even just by removing the ones that flickered if replacement was too costly. I called the property management company on August 3rd, and received a text from them that same day indicating that the lights would be fixed by this last Monday (August 7th). While this was slower than I would've hoped for such a simple fix, it wasn't entirely unexpected and I resigned myself to wait.   Monday the 7th came and went with no update from the property manager and no fix for the strobing lights. I asked for an update and received none. I had experienced two migraines that can be directly attributed to the lights (aura started immediately after being in the garage), but they were in the evening and I just dealt with them while I waited. On Tuesday evening the lights in the garage triggered another migraine, and I called to try and get an update on the light situation and got nothing but a voicemail. This morning I woke up to drive to work and hadn't even gotten my car out of the garage before the aura began, meaning I couldn't go to work for at least half a day (I'm preparing to leave for work when I finish writing this). This problem is costing me time and money, because each time I have a migraine I have to take two pills that cost cost over $100 each (Treximet, average price of $927 for 9 tablets) and I have currently lost $89.40 in wages for today (4 hours at $22.35 an hour). I cannot have this problem continue, for the sake of my financials and my sanity, but the landlord texted  me this morning with a real gem.  ""I do not have an exact day or time for the lights in the garage at this time.""  Understandably I was pretty upset by that and texted her to say it would be unacceptable and that a more rapid remedy was necessary. It's been almost an entire week (this is the 5th business day since my complaint) and they still can't even remove 6 light bulbs?  Her response:  ""No, I will not meet that demand. You do not have control over the building or the HOA. You are free to park street side.""  She suggests that I park street side, where there is only very rarely available parking (college town, right next to a college campus) and where my car and its contents are sitting out in plain view rather than sitting protected in a garage. I cannot park outside because, having gone for a short walk, there are no spots available on the entire street while my lease guarantees me a spot in the garage.   According to hud.gov, it would appear as though the property management company has to make reasonable accommodations for a person with a disability (chronic migraines count, and I am registered with my college's office of disability services): [link here](https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/disabilities/inhousing). I think that asking that flickering light bulbs be at least removed, even if not replaced, is more than reasonable.   At this point I'm at my wits end. I'm considering contacting the office of disability services for my college to see if they can provide me with any help to try and get this problem fixed any faster. I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable with all this, and if anyone has any advice that might help me more than trying to get someone else to step up to bat for me since the property management company refuses to listen to me. I'd also like to know if I have any grounds for a civil suit to reclaim my lost wages and the (so far) $400+ cost of medication that has been incurred just past the date they said it would be fixed."	No
"I am having hell with my landlord, and have some questions about repair and deduct. They are using an excuse that they are away and have bad internet for the next couple weeks, and we can ""discuss"" when they are back. To me that's unacceptable, and I want to repair and deduct, but not sure what is legal to deduct.  I have the following issues.  Roaches - Told the landlord, they don't seem to care, told me they will pay for a $35 exterminator on craigslist. I told them that's not acceptable and am hiring a licensed exterminator.  Garbage Disposal in Sink - It's completely rusted up and leaking from the bottom which makes half of the sink unusable. This leaking can potentially cause mold as well (plan on replacing that).  Air conditioner - This is a tricky one, I had it looked at and the HVAC is completely dirty, apparently hasn't been cleaned in 10 years, the filters are messy. The guy says he has to take it apart to clean it up. However, I'm not sure if air conditioner counts as habitability.  Unusable Toilet - In the master bathroom the toilet runs. I know it's plumbing, I'm not getting what I paid for, but it's not the only toilet in the house so I question the habitability for that one.  Thanks"	No
Need some basic legal advice.   Two friends and I found a house for August 1 move-in. Prior to signing the lease, the agent we were working with told us there might be a chance we could move in early and to speak with the owner about sorting that out. This all occurred in late June. We spoke w the owner and agreed that 7/30 move-in date would work. We were asked to pay security deposit to secure house + first month's rent on July 1. We paid security deposit as promised. Then paid rent (plus pro-rated rent for early move-in) on 6/29.   This week we called landlord to check about getting keys. At this time he told us that one of the tenants (there were three) was still at the house and is not able to move out by 7/30. We reiterated that we'd already paid a month in advance for early move-in and that informed him that it's not possible for the three of us to rearrange uhaul, movers etc. for later move-in.  This is where things got weird. We've been back and forth with both the landlord and the tenant. They seem to be wanting us to change our move-in date. It's absolutely not possible. We have three people moving from three different places and we've already informed our current landlords we're leaving on the 30th.   We told landlord/tenant that we're able to move-in later on the day to give the dude time to get his stuff out. We also asked about cleaning... If someone is still residing there has the house had a walk-through? Has there been any cleaning done? When we signed the lease we asked that 'made ready' be placed as an agreement for cleaning terms (i.e. basic cleaning, paint if needed, holes patched if needed).  So turns out the landlord hadn't visited the house until today and who knows how long it's been since the house has been visited by him. He's agreed to get cleaning people out there tomorrow, but he can't get them in to clean the dude's room cuz all his stuff is in there. He just told the dude to make sure all his stuff is in his room and they'll clean everything else. Apparently the other two tenants and talked w the landlord and agree to move out by the 30th but no one spoke with dude that's left behind we had to get in early.  The person taking over the dude's room that's left behind is pretty pissed that her room won't be clean prior to move-in. So she called landlord to talk about it, see if he'd be willing to compensate in anyway. Well landlord gets pissed and says he's doing what he can and drops the bomb that apparently that dude might not even be out by the 30th... Insinuating that he might have to stay the night there w us.   It's all super weird and we're trying to figure out how to handle it. We can't terminate the lease as we have nowhere to go. We just want the place to be cleaned and for this dude left behind to jet by the 30th. We are not sure how to approach asking for compensation (i.e. 1 days rent for the 30th).  Any advice? Sorry if this is confusing/poorly written. Please let me know if any clarification is needed.	No
"State: CA / City: Los Angeles   Hi, I am a tenant of this apartment in LA area which was recently purchased by a new owner/management. For the past 7 years living in this apartment, I've had some great experience with the management and never had any issues with them. But this time, I am frustrated with this new apartment manager who is not willing to give us what we've initially deserved when we first moved into this apartment.   For the past few months, I've asked the manager on duty to provide us an additional parking space to park our newly purchased car. But, before I go ahead and proceed with anything, here is a little bit of a background story. As a tenant who lives in a 2 bed/bathroom unit, we were initially given 2 parking spaces when we first moved into this apartment. However, since we only had one car, the apartment manager, at the time, has asked us if they can spare one of our parking spaces to our neighbors who were in need of an additional space which we gladly let them use it without any compensation. (My parents and the manager, at the time, got along pretty well.) The manager has promised us (verbally) that we would get the space back whenever we would purchase an additional car and now with this new owner/management, they are not willing to give us another space which was something that we've originally had been granted.   I've spoken with the current apartment manager numerous times in regards to this matter and all I get from her is ""That was something that you have dealt with the previous management. There are no more spaces available and I can't give you additional parking lot for whatever reason."" I have friends and neighbors who live in a unit with 2 bed/bathrooms with 2 parking spaces (same apartment) and when I inquired about them having 2 spaces, the current manager said ""It all depends on how many cars you have."" The manager did not even care to say they would try or would get us a space when something becomes available and our family is very frustrated with this parking situation now. My little brother has been finding parking spaces on the street late at night after his work, walking great deal of a distance, after finding a space blocks away.   From the contract of ours with the apartment, the only section that mentions parking states: ***""Subject to the provisions of this Lease, the Tenant is entitled to the use of parking (the 'Parking') on or about the Premises. Only properly insured motor vehicles may be parked in the Tenant's space.""*** (As it doesn't specify how many parking spaces can be used, I don't know if I can use this statement to back up our request.)   I am about to write a formal request letter to the HQ of the management and try to explain the frustration of the current situation.   Are there anything that I can do to get our initially given space back?   Add: The previous manager who we dealt with has fled back to his country and is no longer available."	No
Let's say I write a book about a now pretty unknown legend. The word has had various different meanings over the years. And if I ever make a movie I don't want the studio to be a dick. And take down other works people might make. What's the best way to make sure I can legally do that, before any studio  gets their hands on the script?	No
"I have never been arrested or charged with anything in my life, my attacker was my brother who is 70lbs heavier then me and convicted of armed robbery quite a few years ago, was assaulted in my residence.  also, state is NJ  basic gist:  -I live in residence with my mother   -discover ~800$ worth of xbox stuff is missing with the ottoman i stored the items in.   -99% sure my brother who no longer lives at the residence stole them   -Text him to return my objects or i am calling police (have this text still)   -my mom was on the phone with him and he says he is coming to beat me up essentially. -I go to leave but his house is very nearby, he parks behind my car.   - i go back inside with 911 dialed for when he strikes me which i knew was inevitable, but i was hoping to deter him and just tell him to leave.   -tell him to leave, he grabs me by throat, slams my head into a wall which cracks, slams me into opposite side wall twice and tries to throw me down stairs.   - i call 911 just as he grabs me, sometime during the altercation i say ""i am calling 911 you idiot, get off me"" -he lets go after that immediately and paces in front of the front door so he can speak to police first. (i recorded this)   -I'm adopted and not white, my brother is white 70lbs heavier then me, and was once convicted of armed robbery. cops who showed up are white, one had a vendetta against me since i put a couple holes in the wall last year and my mom called the police but decided not to press charges.   -I had scrapes all over my shoulder and back, along with bruising. -he had a cut on his lip, i admitted to probably causing it trying to get him off of me during the altercation by pushing against his face, cops wrote down i punched him. -was in pain in holding cell at the town holding cell, waved to camera for assistance, asked for medical attention and they threatened me. - where do i go from here? I've never been arrested in my life, i can't exactly afford a lawyer, i feel like a lawyer will only help me if they believe there is a lawsuit involved. Which sure, I wouldn't complain, but I'm really mostly worried about my record and future being ruined for calling for help while being attacked in my own home...  do you think the text and him showing up to assault me in the house i live in, he doesn't, literally 10 minutes later would be able to prove anything? or even the fact i was the one who called 911 and had way worse injuries? I even have pictures of bruising on my throat from being strangled. all the way on both sides and underneath."	No

Like the title states a friend and I have come up with a fun little idea and we want to build it and try market it. It would be named after a video-game character.  Any advice on whether or not this would be legal? Or any good resources on where to see if the name is still trademarked?  Thank you in advance!	No
"My family and I recently relocated to Houston from Shreveport for a better job opportunity. We have a 14 month old daughter and a 9 year old big fluffy dog. I'm the sole provider for my family and we're still pretty new to the whole parenting thing. I don't have very much extra income in the first place so potential legal costs and this unreasonable landlord are very daunting.   We had family members check the house with a realtor multiple times and it was under construction at the time. It looked like a great house from all that we could tell while it was being worked on. We were promised that it would be deep cleaned and completely move in ready by July 26th. We moved in on July 28th only to find that it hadn't been cleaned or exterminated in a very long time. After we loaded all of our furniture and belongings into the house the AC completely shut off. It's summer in Texas and those days were well into the high 90's. My wife and daughter began to feel sick from the heat and left to stay with family members while I continued to unpack and wait for an AC repair person. We were told a repair guy was on his way, but then found out it would probably be a few days.  The AC attic unit was not only so poorly maintained that it had nearly flooded the attic, but the repair guys told me a secondary line was never run. Which is not up to code and would definitely end up flooding the house after not being able to drain properly.   When the centerpoint energy tech came to the house to turn on the gas he showed us that the water heater wouldn't possibly heat enough for a warm bath. Sure enough we had to boil 6 pitchers of water, to compensate for the inability of the water heater, in order for our daughter to have a lukewarm bath. The landlord denies that it's an issue and said it feels fine to him.   The centerpoint technician also informed us that the roof isn't up to code and had many holes in the wood. You can see tarpaper, shingles and nails just looking up at the attic access. There is old braided wiring that's exposed throughout the attic and many place where the wood has broken away and would allow for leaks.   There weren't interior locks on two of the doors so we had to replace them and add a lock at our own expense. Just to feel safe at night and also to meet the standard of Texas tenants rights.   The landlord told me that ""renting a house is a lot like owning a house. You're going to have to do a lot of work"" he also said that he'd ""prefer to tear up the lease and let us walk because he doesn't want to change anything with the house and we're getting a great deal"".   Not long after that conversation we discovered that the house was suddenly over run with what looked to be some type of ants. We found them in our bedroom, the babies bedroom, all over the living room and dining room. This is also after we cleaned the entire house ourselves. So there wasn't food or anything out to attract insects. This happened on a Friday and we asked the landlord to hire a professional exterminator. He said he would right away and then waiting until the following Monday. We didn't feel even remotely safe with that level of infestation so once again we had to leave to stay with relatives. We have now been in houston a total of 12 days and have only been able to safely stay in the house 3 non consecutive days. He is claiming that we are luck if we get our deposit back and he also wants to keep the first month's rent or prorate for 12 days.   I don't think this is ethical seeing as we haven't even been able to fully unpack or stay in the house due to his inability to provide a safe living space.   I brought this to his attention and he claimed that we rushed the construction and that it's our fault. He said the house would be move in ready on July 26th and we moved in July 28th. So we in fact showed up two days later than the offered move in date. I'm not sure how we rushed the construction or how they planned to fix any of these issues and supposedly decided not to do so since we moved in already. The landlord brought a person over that he claimed was the broker on the house. This man claimed that we were in the wrong and the house is perfectly fine to live in and that we're losing money for our landlord, even though he's trying to keep the majority of what we paid him. I called our realtor and she said that is not the broker of the house and that he's just a guy that works in their office. He's not attached to any paperwork that we signed and has no legal right to be telling us what we can and can't do since he's just a friend of the landlord.   I have also found out that the previous family who lived in the house were not all legal citizens and had to go back to Mexico City unexpectedly. The neighbor was friends with some of them and told me when he noticed we had t been staying at the house. The previous tenants left a lot of their belongings in the garage and back shed as if they didn't have time to take it all. It seems as though the landlord is accustomed to dealing with people that may not be able to fight back when he isn't being fair.   Seeing as the house didn't match up to Texas tenant rights standards. Does anyone know if he has the right to act this way and why should we pay for days we couldn't safely inhabit the house. Also, why would he claim that it wasn't going to be ready to live in and he made an exception for us and his supposed broker said that we have no reason not to be in the house? Seems like they aren't on the same page about anything except for wanting to keep most of our money.   Without him returning the majority of the money we definitely will not be able to afford a new place and will be stranded either without a home or staying with family members in rotation for an unforeseeable amount of time.   Can anyone help?"	No
I recently picked up the deposit for an apartment I had with a friend from work. We've since become not very friendly, and have barely spoken since we've moved apart. He's demanding I provide the full half of the safety deposit to him. The deposit came out to around 350 dollars. The problem is in a month he will be getting our electric deposit which comes out to around 250 dollars. He's refusing to take 50 dollars to make it even so he can just keep the deposit. And is now threatening legal action against us. So my question is does he have a leg to stand on in this?	No
Okay so I've lived at this house for 15+ years, can the co owner evict me in court if the owner and I have a lease agreement stating I can stay? Please help I have court next week. :-/	No
In early May, I got a speeding ticket in Magnolia, Texas. According to the ticket, I'm entitled to the evidence against me. I also could not make my assigned court date due to work conflicts. I sent the Municipal court a letter requesting evidence and a court date conflict. Never heard back. Court says letter never arrived, and now my ticket is in 'default' cause I didn't showed up for my date.      I sent a second letter, certified, via USPS. Tracking number says it made it the Magnolia post office, but after being 'out for delivery' for ten days, the post office opens an investigation. They tell me that because of the huge volume of mail going to the court, not all of it gets scanned.  A clerk at the court cannot locate the letter. They tell me to get a DVD of my ticketing incident, I have to submit a written claim in order for them to send me the form to request the evidence. They cannot accept the request over the phone.       I call a lawyer for help at the end of June. He tells me I may have a warrant out for my arrest now, and that my fines may have gone up. Offers to call the court on my behalf to see what's going on, and to see if they'll accept a fax instead. Is unable to get a hold of them for three days. Oh, and he keeps forgetting to call me back.  I've given up on him.      I sent a third letter via UPS earlier in July, which *was* filed as delivered. I've been calling the Court three-four times a day for four days now, and I cannot get anyone on the phone to confirm they actually have it.       It's now been two months since my ticket. I'm going insane, and I don't know what to do. I haven't received any mail from the Court. I feel the ticket was predatory, and I don't want to spend $250 for allegedly going 51 miles per hour from a stopped position in less than one mile of travel time. I don't live in Texas, which makes my options limited.      Can I file a complaint against the court? Because this is a fairly rural area, ticket lawyers are really hard to find.	No
"At the end of this 3rd year, I was told I had to give termination notice before January. Otherwise I am not actually terminated and my lease renews for a year.  Disappointing, but ok my bad. Months go by and I find a leasetakeover.   But NOW they're telling me I'm actually terminated and can't do a leasetakeover.  They said it was, ""Due to a bug in the system""  Can I be terminated without even signing anything?   If not, am I on grounds to deny being terminated or recieve compensation for this ring around yes/no hassle they've given me?"	No
So, I rented an expensive apartment with a Craigslist roommate that had bad credit, and wouldn't qualify to be on a lease but claimed to be able to pay rent.  I believed this individual and signed up for an apartment with this person. We split the deposit, and for the first month after moving in the roommate paid their share of the rent. We moved in during the month of April, and in May I received a late check for rent only, no utilities. As of now, I have been paying for everything in terms of utilities: gas, electricity, water/sewer/garbage/amenities fees, internet/cable, even though we were supposed to be splitting these expenses.  I have also paid all of the rent for June and July.  I have purchased a home and moved into it, and I no longer want to live in this apartment or have my credit associated with it or my roommate, who has as of yet been unable to work for money.  What are my options to get clear of this situation?  Since I haven't received any money from this person since May, can I just evict the roommate?  Do I need to provide written notice to a roommate that isn't on the lease and hasn't paid in months?  The terms of my lease are that I can transfer my lease for 1000 dollars if I find someone that qualifies for the lease, or sever my lease for 3600 dollars if I just want to be free of it completely.  Unfortunately, most potential roommates find my current roommate unpleasant due to the roommate's service animals, as do I, and do not enjoy the fact that the roommate has occupied the master suite in the apartment.  Please, I'll take all suggestions seriously.	No
"I'm currently employed in GA and my boss is trying to force me to resign... My boss mislead me to believe I could work remotely and relocate to another state (not in writing unfortunately) and then changed her mind weeks later. She has been trying to get me to submit a resignation letter since I plan on moving (even though I work remotely now in GA). I told her I wasn't ready to submit the letter (as I don't have another job) and she decided to find a replacement for me anyways. She hired the person under the guise as ""help"" for me but has made announcements in meetings (in front of me) that I will be leaving.   She also requested for me to be present in the interview process for my replacement and told the applicants I was leaving the company. She is going to continue pressuring me to submit a resignation letter and I'm ultimately afraid she will fire me for misconduct. She has said in the past that no one will get unemployment on her watch, etc. I'm afraid that she will create a reason to fire me for misconduct... How can I protect myself in this situation?"	No
First of all, we live in New York State. I'm gonna keep it vague because of privacy reasons but we are on Long Island.  Back in May, my parents and I decided it was time to buy a house. We had been renting for years and decided to purchase.   As a sidenote, I'm only 18, and am beginning college in 3 weeks. This is all my parents doing the legal stuff.  So we found a condo that was in construction and fast forward 2 weeks, we bought a unit that would be delivered by mid-June.   We put down $20,000 for various upgrades and just as a down-payment. Keep in mind, since we were renting a house before this and had to be moved out by July 1st. So, we thought that this was perfect. It would be delivered two weeks before we had to move, and we could move all our stuff with ease.  Boy were we wrong.  We were told there were delays with construction, and that it would be delivered within July 7th.  Then the date moved to the 15th. Then the 20th. It kept moving.  This wasn't a major issue because we would all be in Italy from July 6th to August 6th.  Our attorney here in NY was taking care of things, in her own way. Basically, she did a really shitty job. We asked her to call and be more forceful with the deadlines and she wouldn't call, she'd just say that she trusted the builders.  Well, now we're all back from Italy and without a home. Turns out, the construction workers lied to us. On July 24th, they said the house was completed and they were just waiting for the permits to live in it from the town. My dad went to the Town office and that wasn't true, the request for the permits was made days after the house was supposedly completed.  Now, we have all the permits and are waiting for the last piece of paperwork from the bank. We have no idea what we can do, or what's going to happen. We're lost.  AND we have no idea what our mortgage is gonna be. Apparently, we don't find out until we close and sign the contract.  TLDR: Bought a house in May, gave them $20,000 and various delays and lies from the company has delayed the house 2 months. We also don't know how much we're gonna pay and when we can move in. Currently homeless.	No
"So it's basically as the title says. My apartment had two light bulbs go out. It's apartment policy that the apartment handles light bulbs so I asked them to repair it. This past weekend, I went away, and when I returned today, the light bulbs were fixed, but there were glass shards all over the floor, seemingly from a broken lightbulb. I received no notification or update, or anything that cautioned against stepping in it, not even a note ""hey, broken glass, will return tomorrow with shop vac"". I am lucky I didn't step in anything and slice my foot open. Is there anything I can do?"	No
"Yesterday I received 3 notices of traffic tickets from Florence (Originally perpetrated in March) where I ""was driving within the limited traffic area without authorization"". Two infractions were within 40 minutes, and the other was 2 days later. I don't recall seeing signs, or being on a road that seemed like I shouldn't, but I don't speak Italian either!   I am an American citizen living in the US that was using a rental car. It's important to note that these notices seem to be from the city police directly, and not through the rental company. All 3 notices are for 81 + 37 Euros for procedures.   It ends up being $403 USD. What are my options and what would you recommend? Can I just not pay? Will I not be allowed to go back to Italy?"	No
I purchased a website about 6 months ago, however the website was not as described, and does not have the capabilities that were promised (such as a fully functional shopping cart with integrated payment processing). I've tried to work with the original owner to get these items done, but she is very slow to respond and always has excuses about her health, her child's health, and how she is traveling.   I'm in Northern California. The woman that I bought the website from lives in San Diego, but the LLC that she does business through is in Pennsylvania.  Can I file small claims court in my local court, or would I have to go all the way to San Diego or Pennsylvania?  Thanks for your help.	No
Today my SO recieved an email from our previous appartment company stating that we owe $1000 for stains on the carpet. We moved out before May 1st and did not recieve this invoice till today. It said we have till August 30 to pay or it will be going to collections.  Over the past year or so my health and my SO had been failing. After many docters visits we still could not figure out what was wrong with us. So in march we had a mould test done and it tested possitive for an elevated levels of mould in the appartement. We informed our property managers about this and they came in and cut up the walls looking for mould. They were unable to identity were it was coming from. We requested to move out asap. They told us that was not enough notice but since health was an issue they would allow us to move out before may 1st and they would use our last months rent for april. We moved out the weekend before the first. When I returned the keys there was no mention of a move out inspection and they had previously told us not to worry about steam cleaning the carpets since there were several holes in wall (made by them looking for mould) and they would need to be drywalled. The carpets were not stained beyond the normal wear and tear and after getting some quotes from steaming companies the average cost to have a 2 bedroom apartment cleaned in my area is between $200-350.   $1000 seems insane to me and this feels like extortion. Is there anyway to fight this?   Both my SO and my health have improved since moving out of the appartment.	No
"I recieved a felony DUI in Oregon last year. I served two months earlier this year and am out. I have a decent job now, however a couple ""dream jobs"" have opened up lately. Here is where I run into an issue. I do not know what to answer on the ""Have you been convicted of a felony (sometimes it asks for lower level crimes too, misdemeanor, etc) box. Now before you say to tell the truth, Oregon law EXPLICITLY does not allow that question. Oregon law HB 3025 states: This legislation prohibits an employer from requiring an applicant: to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction; to disclose, prior to an initial interview, a criminal conviction; or if no interview is conducted, to disclose, prior to a conditional offer of employment, a criminal conviction. Portland (where I live) then takes it a step farther, basically stating that they must offer conditional employment before asking about a conviction. They are not even allowed to ask DURING the interview. They must first offer me a conditional offer of employment (cuz ya know, Oregon). After that, if they learn that I have a felony, they can only rescind if the felony directly applies to the line of work I would be in. So this leaves me in a weird spot. When filling out job applications, local companies and national companies (even ones with large legal divisions, think Amazon, various national mortgage agencies) ask that question. It is yes, or no, and you cannot proceed without selecting an answer. Do I tell the truth and have a 0% chance at getting the job, or do I lie since they are breaking a law by even asking that question? It gets even more complicated when looking at tax breaks for hiring felons. They get $2400 for hiring a felon within 1 year of his release date, and are protected by a federal bonding program where they can receive $5,000 fidelity bonds, free of charge, as an incentive to hire job seekers that do not qualify for commercial fidelity bonds. Some applications afterwards have you fill out a WOTC where it asks you questions about foodstamps, government assitance, and being a felon. If we decide that lying is the best course of action, do I then tell the truth on the WOTC part of the application to then not be considered a felon on the part of the application where I am being illegally discriminated against, but be considered a felon on the tax credit part where being a felon works to the companies advantage?  If anyone has any in depth knowledge of this law, or my best course of action, please advise."	No
My gf works in hospitality, she closed out her drawer and made her drop into the safe at work which then got stuck and did not make it into the safe. After she had left her coworker came and stole the envelope out of the safe. They have cameras and caught him on camera doing this. He is denying it and will be taking a lie detector test. The owner of the business told her that if he doesn't fess up she will be responsible for paying him back. Im trying to figure out what we need to do. Apparently this is a problem with the safe and she has always made sure to check to make sure her drops made it into the safe, apparently this time is got stuck on the side and she did not notice it when checking and thought it made into the safe. I'm just worried that if he does not fess up etc that they will try to hold her paycheck, it was around one thousand dollars stolen and she does not have the money to pay them back.	No
Hi so my mom has an interview with TD bank Wednesday regarding a $600 fee on her line of credit because it was increased without her knowing. I'm wondering what she should say for them to remove the fee from her account. I believe this happened a while ago and she has just noticed now. She states TD told her line of credit has been increased to $200000 and she has to pay $600 for having this. She said she never made the increase. Any help is obviously appreciated as we gave until Wednesday for clarification as TD isn't helping her worth shit. Hoping I can get something here :) thx	No
My parents and I were recently involved into an armed robbery (two young thugs followed us from the casino after they saw my dad winning some money. They did not shoot us, but one of them threatened us with an actual handgun) and got a notification from the county detective that they got arrested few days ago. I am glad that these stupid thugs, as they committed armed robbery few more times before they got arrested, are caught and will serve their sentences. However, I am concerned whether my family would be able to get the money back or not. They stole approximately 4,000-5,000 dollars in total and threw away all of our wallets and my mom's backpack right after they robbed us.   PS. How much jail time would they have to serve if they were arrested for multiple cases of an armed robbery? I have been hearing a lot of different stories, from 5 years to even 20 years. I am pretty sure they cannot afford to have a lawyer.	No
"I'm sorry if this is mostly a rant as I am sweating my face off and extremely frustrated.   Background: I have lived in this duplex since May of 2013. I enjoy living here, the rent is cheap and the landlord has generally been good about getting things done if needed. In my time here we have had the attic water heater rust through and leak through the walls, resulting in the carpet being ripped out and replaced with wood-look laminate, the breaker box has blown (I'm not sure if I'm correct on the specifically but something to the effect) where we did not have any type of power for less than 24 hours, and a few other things which have always been fixed in a very reasonable amount of time.   The situation: I have been trying to get my air conditioner fixed since July 5th. I originally called my landlord to tell her about the issue, which is that during the day the unit cannot keep my tiny 800 square foot place below 84 degrees. It is Texas and it is hot but I have not had this issue in the years previous.   The landlord sent a repairman out quickly, he basically just blew out the area where the filter is inserted and left. It worked fine as far as I can tell for about a couple of days but was back to hot very quickly after.   I emailed my landlord on July 18th when I had time for a repairman to come in and get it done again, and they sent someone out again the next day. He arrived in the morning before it was hot, did the same thing as the previous guy and said it was working fine. This time there was no result and the temperature was back up to 80+ by 3pm.   I emailed my landlord again same day and specifically requested that someone come out later so that they could observe that the temperature was high. One week ago the man came at about 9pm and observed the heat, climbed up into my attic and said it was pretty cold up there (meaning the duct work likely needed to be replaced) and left within 15 minutes saying that everything was operating fine and he didn't know why there was no cool air in the apartment other than that the insulation was insufficient but they would ""get it fixed.""   I never heard anything further. I emailed my landlord yesterday evening to check on the status and she said she has a call in to the owner and she will let me know the results. It is currently 84 degrees at 5:30pm and will likely continue to be until at least 10pm. I am at my wits end, my air conditioner is running constantly and my bill is $250+ a month to heat this tiny stupid place. I don't want to move and I don't want to sue, but I also don't have the money to get it fixed myself. What in the world am I supposed to do?  Does e-mail count as a method of notification if I have to move forward with a lawsuit or do i need to send a certified letter?  TL;DR my air conditioner doesn't work and it's been 22 days. What now?"	No
I am posting this for someone, and I am unsure if the details provided or 100% accurate as well. They are how ever close to the truth.    Around this time last year a young man (I will call him person A) was killed in a hit run by another (I will call him person b) young man in my hometown while person a was walking home from work late at night. Person b then removed person A's body from underneath his car, moved his body away from the side of the road and sped off.   As the days followed he had help from his dad with cleaning his car, and then hid his vehicle at his uncles business. Person A is now out on a $50,000 personal bond, and has court dates coming up  Is there anything I can do to help her?    https://imgur.com/gallery/yz5b0	No
Bottom Line:  I bought a used diesel truck from a Volkswagen dealer, and my local mechanic told me that it is fully deleted (catalytic converter, diesel particulate filter, and EGR have all been removed/bypassed).   When I was originally talking to this dealership I made it clear that I need a diesel truck to tow my 5th wheel, but it needs to pass a smog test. I asked the salesman if the truck had stock exhaust, and he said yes. At the time, I hardly knew anything about emissions or tuning modifications so I believed what the dealer told me. I settled on a Ram 3500, and drove it home.  Now, I find out the truck can't pass emissions. The state in which I am registering the truck does not have smog tests, so there won't be an issue getting the vehicle registered. However, I think it is a federal offense to not have a DPF or Catayltic Converter on the truck. Getting a misdemeanor or a felony charge, if I were to get pulled over, could jeapordize my career.  The parts alone are going to cost me over $4k to get the truck within EPA guidelines.  Basically I have two questions:  1. What can I do about the dealer? They told me it was OEM exhaust, but it's not. Now I'm expected to pay several thousand dollars for something that shouldn't have been an issue if the dealer told me the truth (I wouldn't have purchased this truck)  2. When I look up federal EPA guidelines, it talks about being a federal offense to modify or tamper with a vehicle's emission system. I did not tamper or modify them, it came this way from the dealer. Am I still liable in this scenario?	No

Hi there! I'm seeking advice. My husband, sister, and I are applying together to rent a condo. All three of us have great credit history, and our combined income is well over 3x the rent. My husband and I have good rental history. However, my sister is currently in her first living arrangement not with my parents. She's living with my friend-- whose original roommate picked up and moved to Germany a few months into their lease-- as a subtenant. However, I just found out that my sister and friend never made her subtenancy official. Their lease explicitly forbids subletters without written permission from the landlord.  Wtf am I supposed to put on our current condo application? What kind of legal trouble could she and my friend get in? How do I represent my sister's situation on our condo application without falsifying information? Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for any advice. :)	No
So in 2011 I signed a lease to own option at the home im currently staying at and recently through mutual acquaintances found out the current owner of the house had called the county on me and reported the house I'm staying in now. The land inspection officer (I don't know his official title) came and saw some logs from trees the original owner chopped down and left in the backyard and some painting that needs to be done around the edges of the house. When I spoke to the officer he informed me that if I don't own the home I'm not responsible even if I have the option to purchase later so he informed the owner of the situation and the owner went to the county office and showed paperwork and convinced them that I am responsible. My question is do I have and responsibility here? Do I have to make these repairs to the land that I technically don't own? 	No
State: Arkansas  I work as a pizza delivery driver, and I work the late shift, which consists of me being at work 5pm to 12-2am. When I'm finished I go through the clock out process with the night manager which is one of two people, and I sign the sheet that has my miles, tips, and hours for the day on it. The past two days I've noticed is been clocked out significantly early, how do I approach this legally? One of the closing drivers told the same thing is happening for him.	No
On March 26, 2017, my girlfriend's sister moved out of an apartment in Manassas, VA. She had many issues with the apartment and was relieved to move out after two years. She checked her mail on the 26th, the day that she was supposed to give them back the keys, and found that a walkthrough she was never told about in any other capacity was scheduled for later that week. If she hadn't checked the mail,  she would have had no idea they needed or scheduled a walkthrough. Based on all the problems she had while living there, it seems the apartment complex had a habit of sending items after the fact. Unfortunately, the day the walkthrough was scheduled something came up at work and she decided to just rely on the pictures and videos she took after cleaning the apartment before she turned the keys in.   When she moved in two years prior, she had originally paid $1175.00 for the security deposit. The complex decided to keep $93.96 for rent and $135.00 for the carpet cleaning. She was fine with these charges because she knew about them both ahead of time. They also charged her for cleaning the oven and microwave, which she admitted she forgot to clean when moving out. However, they also charged for things she disagreed with, $3.71 for an ice tray her refrigerator never had and $9.78 for a ceiling cover being gone; she distinctly remembers having no issues with any ceiling panels. It was also part of her lease that she patch the holes before she moved out, which she did, and even sanded them down for the apartment. They ended up charging her $26.10 for the walls finish sanding. Finally, she was charged $197.20 for her bedroom and bathroom smelling like smoke. They claimed the $197.20 was for the sealer paint on the walls. Her boyfriend had smoked, but not in the apartment, and it was in the designated areas that the apartment provided. She had planned to fight some of these items but she had to travel for work and lost track of time. She ended up just depositing the remaining $641.05 of the security deposit check they mailed her. Really she was so relieved to finally cut ties with the apartment complex after having so many problems with them during the couple years she lived there. She estimates she received the security deposit check around April 8.  When she got her mail last week, she was surprised to find a letter from the corporation who owned the complex, requesting even more money back from the security deposit. As far as we're aware, we don't think she needs to cover these additional security deposit requests, since they returned the security deposit and the request exceeded the 45 day period. The letter they sent is dated for June 27th, but somehow, even though she didn't move very far from her old place, she received it at the end of July. This time the apartment was asking for $1846.20 by Friday, July, 28th or otherwise they threatened to turn information over to their attorney. They said they needed the money because they still haven't rented the apartment out to new tenants. They said that potential renters are saying that the apartment smells like smoke so no one wants to live there. From their request for money, it looks like they are just recharging her for the items she already paid for. Based on what we could find in Virginia law, it seems like it's too late for them to be requesting additional money. She also tells me no one ever smoked anything inside the apartment, just outside. Also, she's afraid if she pays them anything now, they're just going to keep coming back for more money in a couple months. Does the apartment complex have any rights to ask for this money after they've mailed the security deposit back and months after she's moved out? Although it appears they're asking for  payments to items she's already paid for, is it possible they could get a collection agency to go after her and/or ding her credit? We appreciate any advice you have for this situation.  Also, when trying to research her rights, she read a few times that she should have gained interest on her security deposit since she lived there more than 13 months. Is this true? Although we both don't think it's worth hiring a lawyer for this amount of money, it'd be nice to counter their letter with something they've done wrong.	No
Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	No
"I live in an apartment complex that's specifically for students. these are the cheapest, shittiest apartments in town, but they have gotten a lot better over the 2 years i've lived here. I've renewed my lease, but I CANNOT get in contact with mangement. I've sent a million emails and can never talk to them on the phone. Will be going in person today and I'm not leaving until I speak with someone.  THe problem is, this apartment is classified as ""upgraded,"" and it is not. they started to upgrade it, there was a flood, and the rest of the work that needed to be done was forgotten while they did a shitty patch  job on the rest of my apartment. They've now raised my rent beginning in August, and I'm not sure i want to live here if they dont finish upgrading soon, but i cant afford a place thats more than $50-100 more than this place.  My question is do i even have any legal rights? I've even tried to contact their corporate HQ, where once again I was not able to speak with anyone but a low level worker who was rude and unhelpful. At the very least, I would like to be able to get out of my lease agreement since they have not held up their end of the deal."	No
I'm a 36 year old man.  I live in Massachusetts.    A video went viral recently in a town adjacent mine that showed a group of minors assaulting another group of minors (all about 15).  The aggressors were larger and threw the smaller group to the ground and hit / kicked them while down.  The group being attacked offered no resistance.    As an adult, can I intervene?  Can I pull the aggressors off?  If I'm shoved / hit / kicked, can I fight back?    If I do fight, will I be charged?  If so, would it be child abuse?  If so, could I lose my children (5 y/o twins)?  I know this is a very situation dependent question, but in general, where do you all stand?    Can you intervene?    Would you intervene?  Should you intervene?	No
"In May 2016 I signed a one year lease for a place. In late-February/early-March of 2017 my landlord asked me if I'd be renewing my lease, I respond with ""as of right now yes"". Come May 2017, there was no signing of a new lease for May 2017-2018. I was informed (or misinformed) that when a written year lease is up and a new lease for the next year isn't signed it goes to a month-to-month lease. On May 25, 2017, I informed my landlord via text message  that I will be moving out July 1 (i told her i needed to speak with her later via phone but she insisted i told her what was up now over text to i did). She said ""well i thought you said you wanted it for another year"". I explain the situation, she response with ""make sure the house is clean so i can show it to prospects ASAP"".  It's now mid-July so by the end of the month of was expecting my security deposit back (i left the house exactly how i got it, cleaned, vacuumed, mopped, etc). Today she told me ""Verbal agreement is binding. You verbally agreed to extend the contract for another year but you changed your mind and left. After you gave me your notice I went into action immediately: advertise and show to prospects. I finally got a tenant effective August 1, 2017 but I was able to make him pay for half of July. So, I have [half the amount of security deposit] for you.""  I have a record of our text conversations.   Did my lease go to month-to-month or stay good for another full 1yr term? Am I entitled to my full security deposit back or does she have legal right to keep half for the half month rent of July?  thank you"	No
So here's my deal: I live in Los Angeles. About last November I was looking for a new place to move into. A friend told me about two friends of hers who were looking for a roommate. Rent's $350/mo. Cool, right? I move in, no lease, mo-mo, no contract, but I pay a $210 deposit. (If I got a receipt at the time it's gone now.) Well this place was alright (except for the cockroach infestation) and these two fellas seemed ok at first.. but they're both actors and one has a hot head because he looks like Thor. If Thor was a total tool. As the weather started to get warmer (I'm talking like low 70s here) I open the windows to let a nice, cool breeze in. Apparently my roommates were allergic to fresh air and wanted the windows to be closed at all times and have the a/c running 24/7. We didn't pay any utilities so they could care less about what it cost to run it. The bathroom smelled like mildew and there was black mold on the windows when I moved in (I took care of that, as well as a large part of the cockroach infestation.(Endorsement: Check out Advion Bait syringesüëå)) So I keep the bathroom window open to air it out. By and by these guys kick me out because I won't keep the windows shut (I think I bruised Thor's ego because he's used to getting his way.) Anyway, I'm told I'll get my deposit back when someone else moves in (smells like BS). I say screw it and go on my merry way. A month later (a few days ago now) I text Thor telling him that I need my deposit. He says tough luck, claiming there are damages (a lie. I did nothing but improve that place.) By CA state law, any deductions from the deposit must be taken out within 21 days of a tenant having moved out, and an itemized list of said damages along with the (reasonable) costs. I never heard anything from my old roommate until I texted him and he refused to return my deposit. In that sense, I have the upper hand..however, I have no contract. No receipt of a deposit (only a PayPal transaction for an amount greater than the deposit), no hard evidence except my recent texts and the check images and deductions from my bank account over the course of my having lived at that apartment. So I sent Thor a request for Deposit Return letter and my next step would be to take this to small claims court..but is it worth it? Do I have a leg to stand on or would it be a waste of time and money?  I only have texts and my check images and PayPal statements directed to him. I don't have a written contract or receipt of deposit, etc.  Should I just accept that there are unscrupulous douches out there and I'm a victim of theft, or is there a way I can fight this? Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice!	No
Hello all.  As the title says, my grandmother as of this morning is unable to use her shower (bath/shower) because she can't lift her leg over the tub to get in.   Her building manager says there's nothing they can do.  She's lived there for about 10 years now.    I realize that it's a bad situation for everyone involved, but are they required by law to accommodate her at all?  This is in Metro Detroit.   Thank you.	No
I'm trying to buy a house in South Carolina and found out there is a problem with the deed, our closing attorney said that a title claim can only be completed when the property is being sold is this accurate? Also once the title claim is completed if there's a discrepancy in the taxes would it become our responsibility?	No
I'm in desperate need of some help.  I am a 19 year old male who lives in Australia and I'm in a really bad situation and I don't know what to do.  2 weeks ago my girlfriend came over to my place to hang out for the night. Everything started off ok and I became pretty drunk after a few hours and I remember she helped me into the bedroom. Then all I really remember is waking up to find her on top of me with my arms tied to the headboard. I shoved her off and asked her what the fuck she was doing. That's when she told me if I tell anyone she will report me for raping her.  I don't know what to do, I feel disgusting I feel ashamed I have become so severely depressed I don't want to live anymore.  I want to report, I badly want to report her. But I know she will say I did it.  What do I do?	No
I'm currently moving into a new apartment and have an 80lb, 9 month old German Shepherd that is not fixed. The apartment I am moving into states that dogs cannot be more than 50lbs, German Shepherds are a banned breed, and that the dog has to be fixed.  I have been told my numerous people that if I claim him as an emotional support dog due to my diagnosed depression (Actually diagnosed.. Not self diagnosed) than they are required to allow him to live with me.  Any advice would be appreciated. He's my only family where I live, and I would hate to have to let him go.	No
I was driving on I95 at about 40-45mph in a 65mph zone. This was due to the weather and road conditions at the time. As I continued to drive in the express lane, I hit a long puddle which pulled the nose of my car towards the middle barrier. I immediately let my foot off the gas and corrected the steering towards the lane. My car corrected and when the rear of the car hit another puddle, it pulled the car the opposite direction. My vehicle then started to hit the plastic pole barriers which no matter how much I tried to correct, pulled the car facing the outside of the highway. My car came to a stop. My front passenger bumper was then clipped by a vehicle in the lane next to me, and spun my car facing the middle barrier. We both pulled off the road, there were no injuries. I was already on the phone with the police, after the officer investigated, he wrote me a citation for careless driving.  All that being said, the officer didn't witness the accident. And I was able to maintain control of the vehicle within my lane up to a complete stop. I was also driving in a safe manner due to road conditions.  I understand that law is black and white. However with extenuating circumstances, I don't feel like I was driving carelessly. That being said, how valid is the citation? With extenuating circumstances is it something I should fight?  Also, my vehicles lease expires on Thursday and I have an $8,000 damage waiver. If I turn the vehicle in, and the insurance company doesn't pay a claim. In addition, if I choose to fight it and the citation gets dismissed will my rates go up in a no-fault state?  TL;DR: Spun out in the rain. Maintained vehicle within lane as much as humanly possible. Got clipped by another vehicle after mine came to a complete stop and received citation for careless driving. Fight or pay it?	No
"Hi all,  I'm a freshman at Penn State, and I was just cited for underage drinking yesterday. I went to a party off campus, and had a bit too much to drink. I got back to my dorm room fine, and I wasn't being disorderly/causing any problems with anyone. I basically just stumbled back to my dorm and was ready to go to sleep.  However, I wasn't handling the alcohol very well and began to puke into my dorm's trash can. My roommate walks in on me puking and is panicking because he has never dealt with an intoxicated person before. He calls the RA because he was concerned for my health, and the RA calls 911.  A cop arrives at my dorm and starts asking me questions. He asks me how much I had to drink, and I told him I had a few beers. He then asks me questions like ""What's the month/date"", ""Who's the President of the United States"", and what state I was in. I answered all of the questions correctly, and I was being pretty compliant the entire time. I tell him my home phone number and he calls my parents.  He tells my parents that I was drinking underage and that he was going to send a citation to their address (not my dorm). He didn't leave me with a citation or any other documents at my dorm. I'm 17, so legally not an adult yet.  The EMS later arrive and take my blood pressure, heart rate, all that stuff. Everything was fine and they left. No one ever breathalyzed me.   Basically, I'm really worried about what happens next. I have to meet with a university administrator about my underage now and complete an alcohol program run by the university. But I'm more worried about what shows up on my record now. Is there anything I can do to get it off my record? I'm supposed to be starting ROTC in the fall, and something like this on my record can apparently be really bad for that. I've wanted to serve in the military for so long and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity before I even start."	No
My landlord just gave back my security deposit with a note. They said they had to repaint the walls which is something I accounted for. But for the first time ever I see they took out money for time. 320 dollar for 8 hours. Is this allowed? If so, 40 dollars a hour? I live in Virginia. If anyone can point me in the right direction with information I would greatly appreciate it.	No
I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.	No
Had a bad interaction with an employee. Attempted to 1 star review the company saying that some staff are not very welcoming to new community members. It was replied to by the owner who explained I have been trying to contact most of his employees outside of work hours for things not related to work(turns out this part was true, but he left out the part that I had no idea they worked there, and they it was through either dating apps or fetlife). I replied to defend myself from the accusation and the review was deleted. I bough a bunch of dislikes because im petty and it was cheap, how much if any trouble can I get in	No
So, I live in an apartment complex which has a rule that you can't have loud music or parties because it disturbs other apartments, which is very fair. Unfortunately, not everyone follows this. There's an apartment which is very close to mine (across the hall) and it is occupied by a bunch of idiot teenagers that have parties every fucking week.  I personally don't give a shit what they do but it started to catch my attention when I opened my door a few days ago. I had a letter from my HOA saying that I have violated the noise/disturbance clause in my lease and it may lead to eviction. I called the HOA to see what's up and they claimed that they received several complaints from other residents that I was playing loud music and having a party.   Here's the thing: ***I was not playing any music. I was watching a movie with my girlfriend quietly in my room.***  I obviously don't want to get in trouble for this. I called him up and explained the situation and he said alright. I think, okay cool. Then this morning he calls me again. He claims he received more complaints that I was having a large party last night and running around drunk in the hallway and that the cops came to my apartment. WTF? There were NO cops in my apartment nor did I have a party. The other apartments DID. I came home around 2 am from an errand with my girlfriend and there were two college girls making out against the wall in the hallway. When we were walking to my apartment, they invited us to play beer pong. We politely declined and went inside my apartment. Then we went to bed. That's it.   The HOA Manager says he is going to verify this information and thanks me for my side of the story but I'm now worried that tomorrow I'll get another one of those violation papers and I am nervous they might try to pursue eviction. This is my first apartment and I don't know what to do. There are no cameras in the hallway so I have no idea how he's going to verify my story. What if he doesn't believe me? Obviously the other apartment won't claim fault since they don't wanna get in trouble.   Can anyone educate me on my next steps to correct this situation? Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. I'll be happy to answer any questions you have to help you better understand the situation.	No
"There are two separate parts of my lease that have to do with paying for carpet cleaning:   ""Upon surrender, tenant shall vacate the premises end return or account for any of Landlord's property held by tenant, such as keys, to mailbox and entry doors. $50.00 per key will be deducted from security deposit if not returned to owner. $60.00 will be deducted from security deposit if appliances are not left in clean conditions, $150. will be deducted from security deposit for carpet cleaning.""  ""I acknowledge that the carpet was cleaned prior to my tenancy. Upon providing Landlord with notice to vacate, I agree to send a check for carpet cleaning in the amount of $150.00""  Any punctuation, spelling, or grammatical errors in those quotes are my landlord's.   [ATCP 134.06(3)(c)](https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/code/admin_code/atcp/090/134/06/3/c) states that a landlord cannot withhold a portion of the security deposit to pay for normal wear and tear, with a note specifically using carpet cleaning as an example. There is also a note saying a landlord may require a tenant to pay for routine carpet cleaning, however, ""the cost for routine carpet cleaning may not be collected by the landlord in advance because all prepayments in excess of one month's rent must be treated as ‚Äúsecurity deposit."" Even if the lease includes the permitted provision, a landlord may not deduct the cost of routine carpet cleaning from the security deposit, which cannot be withheld for normal wear and tear.""  The carpet also has some stains and burn marks from the previous tenant, which I made note of and took photos of when I moved in. So it should probably be replaced anyway.  When I gave my notice to vacate I didn't send the $150 for cleaning since my landlord isn't allowed to do that. Afterwards, I received a notice from my landlord stating that I must provide receipt from the cleaning company my landlord specified in the notice and that I must purchase and replace new burner pans for the stove.   Can my landlord add these additional requirements if they aren't in the lease? The only thing I could find in the lease that could maybe be related to this is: ""Landlord may make additional reasonable rules governing the use and occupancy of the premises and the building in which they are located, tenant acknowledges the rules stated above and acknowledges receipt of any additional rules prior to signing of this agreement. Any failure buy tenant to comply with the rules is a breach of this agreement.""  Does it look like I will have to pay for either of these items? Thank you."	No
Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	No
One of my friends is a stoner and keeps his stash and paraphernalia in his car (not the wisest decision, I know). Sometimes I ride in his car. If, while I am in the car, he were to get pulled over and searched and his stash was found, what would happen to me, even though none of the items are mine?  I'm completely unfamiliar with marijuana laws in Maryland as I never have and never will use it, and this situation came to mind. Wondering if I'm making a mistake by riding with him.	No
Last Friday all tenants received a notice on the door that the only payment option (aside from checks which they take a week to process) was removed. Now I either directly pay with my bank (Takes 3 business days to process. $2.95 fee. If system fails to recognize the 0s in front of account number, you're charged extra $40), pay with debit/credit card (which is $2.95 fee on top of 3.5% of rent),  pay with cash at PayLease locations ($4 fee), pay with money order (varies but averages around $2), or pay with check (no fee but takes a week to process. Check can be lost).  I would just swallow the cost and do bank payments except for the following issues:             1. It takes 3 business days or longer to show it went through correctly             2. The first time I paid with my bank, they rejected the payment because I put numbers in wrong. I put the 0s in front of the account number (my bank documents and the ID card both show the 0s and the websites guide on finding account numbers on checks showed 0s), and the payment was rejected and I had to pay a $40 payment rejection fee. I'm nervous putting my account info down and getting that fee again              3. It used to be a $250 non refundable pet fee and then they changed it where it's a $250 non refundable pet fee and a $50 pet rent. In our are pet rent is max $30 and it's either non refundable pet fee OR pet rent OR pet rent + refundable pet fee. It doesn't feel right giving them more money.  When I signed the lease, I had a safe option to pay without incurring fees that guaranteed it applied to the account immediately. Now I don't. What options do I have? Are there laws against this or anything that can help me here?     Tenants had a week notice before rent is due again.   I live in Arkansas.	No
Quick background: Grandpa passed away yesterday, landlord says 2 months rent is still owed because he 'did not give notice' (actual words). I found the specific statute pertaining to this situation, but I simply do not understand it:  &gt;**504B.265 TERMINATION OF LEASE UPON DEATH OF TENANT.** &gt;Subdivision 1. **Termination of lease.** &gt;Any party to a lease of residential premises other than a lease at will may terminate the lease prior to its expiration date in the manner provided in subdivision 2 upon the death of the tenant or, if there is more than one tenant, upon the death of all tenants.  &gt;Subd. 2. **Notice.** &gt;Either the landlord or the personal representative of the tenant's estate may terminate the lease upon at least two months' written notice, to be effective on the last day of a calendar month, and hand delivered or mailed by postage prepaid, first class United States mail, to the address of the other party. The landlord may comply with the notice requirement of this subdivision by delivering or mailing the notice to the premises formerly occupied by the tenant. The termination of a lease under this section shall not relieve the tenant's estate from liability either for the payment of rent or other sums owed prior to or during the notice period, or for the payment of amounts necessary to restore the premises to their condition at the commencement of the tenancy, ordinary wear and tear excepted.  &gt;Subd. 3. **Waiver prohibited.** &gt;Any attempted waiver by a landlord and tenant or tenant's personal representative, by contract or otherwise, of the right of termination provided by this section, and any lease provision or agreement requiring a longer notice period than that provided by this section, shall be void and unenforceable; provided, however, that the landlord and tenant or tenant's personal representative may agree to otherwise modify the specific provisions of this section.  &gt;Subd. 4. **Applicability.** &gt;The provisions of this section apply to leases entered into or renewed after May 12, 1981.   So, which way is it going here? Is rent for the last two months still owed, or can he be told to shove it?	No
I live in Salt Lake City, UT. I found a room in a shared duplex house on Craigslist at the beginning of July and after meeting the current tenant and taking a look I decided I liked it enough to move in. I sent her a deposit for $500 along with first month's rent for another $500. We got along just fine for the first two weeks or so, I thought she was really nice and funny but then some issues started to come up. She repeatedly caused drama with the neighbors, fought loudly with her friends, and was generally disrespectful to the house and the neighborhood.   We had a meeting with the neighbors directly next door, the people we share the duplex with, and it came to light that they had no idea who I was or why I was living there - they thought that I was a third person who illegally moved in on a 2-person lease because my roommate never got permission or even informed the landlord that the last girl was moving out and I was taking her place. I assumed originally that my deposit and rent were going straight to the landlord but they did not. My roommate took a deposit from me without any authority to do so, and now that she is in the process of being evicted for violating her lease in multiple ways, she refuses to give me back my $500.   She has been extremely difficult and has caused a ton of stress for me, the landlord, and all the neighbors. She made up fake email addresses and phone numbers for the girl who lived here before me and was impersonating her to the landlord. She has been evicted but has threatened the landlord with court so she is forced to let her stay an additional two weeks.   I filed a report with the police and he left her a message letting her know that unless she pays it back she'll be charged with theft. Since then, she's been extremely rude to me and has only played the victim, it looks like she thinks she can get away without paying me back my money. I'd really like to receive it back asap so I can use it towards a deposit on my next house as I'm being forced to move out of here at the end of August due to her wrongdoings.  What is the best action to take now? Please help me figure out the best and most efficient way to go about this. I am ready to sue or press charges for theft if need be.  Thank you!!	No
So, my car was stolen earlier this week and was found in a parking lot last night (completely trashed, very likely totaled). In it was a sentimental item (wristwatch from a deceased relative) and some important paperwork containing sensitive personal information (SSN, bank and investment account info, etc.). Both are gone... the watch isn't really replaceable given the sentimental aspect, and the aftermath of the loss of that paperwork has/will cost me thousands of dollars between money being frozen and unable to move and so forth.   Speaking with the detective handling the investigation this morning, I asked about pressing charges if they find a suspect and he explained that DNA and/or prints don't stand on their own... if (*if*) he finds a suspect he'll basically need to get a confession out of them to pursue anything, at which point the state will press charges automatically regardless of my feelings on the matter.   So my question is, considering the items that were in the vehicle and... you know, them stealing the car in the first place... if a suspect is found by DNA or print matches, is that enough to build a civil suit on even if it isn't enough for a criminal case?	No
Without giving away too much personal information, my parents and I sold a condo in California and bought a house in Ohio and planned to use BofA for the mortgage. My mother left her job in California and at the time was in the process of being hired (interviews, but not a done deal). Since the loan uses the current financial situation as bases for the loan, the loan officer wanted my mother to ask her new job (again, not a done deal) for proof of employment. She says she can't since she doesn't have the job yet but since we just sold our house we can use depletion of assets as our way to receive a mortgage. He agrees and they begin moving across country.   They make it over, meet the real estate agent, and begin the paperwork for the new house. They get in contact with the loan officer and he asks again for a proof of employment to apply for the loan, ignoring our previous request to use depletion of assets. At this point they are at risk of losing the house they wanted. They decide to pay it in full in order to secure the house.  Now, with a house sized chunk missing from their savings, we are losing about $10000 a year on interest that would have accrued if we had the liquidity of the extra money in the account. Money that would have been there if the loan officer didn't try and push through his plan that would have put my mother's job in jeopardy as well.  To add on top of this, the same loan officer that put my mother through the ringer emotionally wanted us to apply for a second mortgage that would have been way more than the original mortgage plan.  So my question is, beside possible unethical behavior, is there any civil case that can be brought about from the decrease in returns? $10000 would just be for the first year so it's a substatial amount of money we are losing because this guy wanted to scratch his own back with second mortgage.  I am listed on the deed but I have a 0% claim so this would be handled by them. All of this happened while I was across the country completing my studies.	No
"(PH) So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I was in a relationship with this person. So yeah this is your typical, revenge porn or non-consensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.  I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	No
"My landlady told me I had 2 hours to move out with no prior notice. When I refused, she grabbed my head and tried to drag me out of the house and told her husband she was going to kill me. I bit her arm in self defence and she beat my head with the tv remote that was in her hand at the time then dropped the remote on my floor. I called the police as I feared for my life and when she heard me calling the cops she too called them. When the cops arrived she said that I initiated the attack by going for her arm with my teeth and she was grabbing my hair to get me off. The cops said the mark isn't in a self defence position for a headlock and helped her evict me that night. When I wrote to her asking for my deposit back a few days later she then made allegations of assault against me to the police and I had to go for a voluntary interview at the police station. After hearing my version of events the police decided to take no further action and told me that next time I should insist on signing a tenancy agreement (I was a lodger and had none). When I received no reply to my letter for my deposit back I then wrote a formal letter before action. She responded by saying that I couldn't have my deposit and outstanding rent returned because I hadn't given a months notice and I assaulted her (even though I couldn't give notice because she kicked me out with less than a days notice and she assaulted me first) and demanded ¬£1000 for damages (time taken off work for blood tests etc). I went to the citizens advice bureau and they said that I am owed my deposit back and she has no case as the police has decided to take no further action but I'd like a second opinion from the good people of Reddit pls...  My landlady has told me in the past of how she used to get into fights in school and came home from her honeymoon with a black eye because she got into a fight in a nightclub. She used to be a size 20 but lost about 10 stone just before her wedding but she is still a large lady. Her husband is also very large. On the other hand, I am a small skinny Asian with no spine who would rather cry in my room than attack somebody. Her words to the police were something along the lines of ""she latched onto my arm with her teeth and bit down"" which sounds pretty far fetched imo. I just think you've got to be a special type of crazy to attack somebody twice your size by biting them while their husband is downstairs...  Is there any chance at all that she could get money out of me for ""damages"" or wages lost? We both drew blood so I count us even and I don't want to take her to court or anything either. I don't want her money, I just want my deposit back and then move on and forget her."	No
    I have a lease with my landlord where she asks for 60 days notice (doesn't' say writing just notice) before moving out.  I had a conversation with the woman 2 1/2 months ago where I told her we were planning on moving out because we wanted to obtain a dog.  Told her very clearly that not being able to have a dog was a serious issue for my wife and I and that we would be ending our lease and moving out upon its end.       I originally thought our lease was up in the end of July, in fact it was June and we are currently month to month.  Did not receive a notice about this.  On June 27th I gave her an email in writing explaining we would be moving out.     She is refusing to cooperate and insists that I did not give her the 60 days notice, but I did.   We are applying to new places and when they called her about references she complained about us being lease breakers and gave us a bad reference.  Also she made some claims about my cat damaging the apartment.  The damage is minimal to the carpet in a section that is very very fixable.   She was sapose to come view the apartment and discuss our options moving forward with these damages and we took time off work to meet her and she never showed up, nor called.    We are excellent tenants who have never missed a months payment in the 3 1/2 years we have resided there.    I just got off the phone with her where she pretended not to say the things she very clearly said to the new landlord and when she started complaining about not giving her enough notice, I reminded her of our conversation where I told her my intentions of moving out.  She suddenly remembered the conversation I had with her, started studdering her speech and then hung up on me and is refusing to take my calls now.   I have no idea how to deal with this.  My wife and I need to move to get out of a terrible situation and I was under the impression I was being very professional about this.	No
From April 2016 to July 2017 I was living in student housing using student loans in Colorado. From August 2016 until I moved out they were not notifying me that I owed rent (you pay rent online). So I just simply left it alone and assumed that maybe my student loan money was sent directly to them and they had been paid. I lived in student housing prior to this and that is how it worked at the previous location.   Now I am moved out and they are claiming I owe them over $7,500 in default rent. Can they do this? There is nothing in my lease about default rent. They chalked it up to a glitch in their system, but can they ask them for that much in rent when there was never any notice that I was not paying in general?  HELP!	No
"TLDR; Can I recover a portion of my ""lease termination fee"" (equivalent to 2 months rent) through small claims court, if my landlord fills my apartment within those two months?   Background: My wife and I purchased a new home with 4 months remaining on our apartment lease. We asked for leniency, offered a fair deal (full month of rent + security deposit), etc. but were ultimately shot down by our apartment manager.  The two options presented were:  1) Pay a two month lease termination fee.  2) Prepay the remaining lease (4 months), then be reimbursed any amount once a new tenant was found.   We put in a 30 day notice in mid June and received our monthly rent bill for July 1 through our move out date. Moved out of the apartment in mid July without issue. Today received a final bill, which included regular cleaning fees and the lease termination fee. We weren't ever given the chance to select option 1 or 2, I think he just went with the cheapest out of pocket route. I'm wondering if we should just tell them to bill us for the 4 months instead of the two month ""fee""? It's more out of pocket, but we would be reimbursed later.   The apartment is in a very desirable location (&lt;1 mile from the beach) and is a relatively good deal in terms of other options in the area. Our now vacant apartment is the only one available in the 70 unit complex. I don't think there will be issues renting the place and the manager is telling people it'd be available as soon as 7/24 (seems like he's trying to get someone in ASAP).   I know in California that the lessor can't collect double rent. I'm worried that since it is stated as ""Termination Fee"" that we wouldn't be able to collect anything in small claims court if they were to have someone move in on say Aug 1.  Any help is greatly appreciated."	No
She left them with him because she was moving and couldnt bring all her things right away. Now after moving back to the same area he ducked her text and calls for months about retrieving her things. Then we came to find out that him and his wife had had a divorce and he said that she was now in possession of the unit. We got her number from him and upon texting her found out that he had stopped payment on the unit and all the items were removed or taken by the company. What do we do to get her things back or monetary compensation for the thousands of dollars worth of things that were in the storage. She is inconsolable over the loss of her things. Any help is much appreciated, if more information is needed Im happy to provide it.	No
   I live in an extremely small town, and apparently I've pissed off the wrong people. Now I can't leave my house without a bunch of people following me and even trying to beat me up and possibly kill or disfigure me permanently.

"A friend of mine is a dog breeder and has come under fire from the locals who are angry with her because dog breeders are Literally Evil and she breeds 3 litters per year (different mothers) which apparently makes her a ""puppy mill."" She takes good care of her dogs, but has a few elderly dogs who, well, are not in excellent shape because they're old as the planet itself. She still brings them in every few months for nail clippings, general wellness exams and so on.   Well, one of the vet techs who has decided she is Evil Incarnate for breeding dogs has taken pictures of her cloudy-eyed, skinny decrepit old dogs, one of whom had an infected eye (that's why he went to the vet!) so he looks practically undead, and is posting them on social media because she is anti-breeder and wants her to be ""shut down."" Animal control went out to her house and said everything looks totally normal; so did a health inspector, but this woman is still on the warpath.   The problem is, the vet tech was fired, so it's not like contacting her boss is an option. What are my friend's options here as far as getting her to stop go? Does not seem legal at all to share patient information like this."	No
"My wife and I are working on getting a mortgage for our first home, and our credit union we're working with on financing gave us an initial Loan Estimate yesterday that was 0.25% lower than what we were discussing with them. Obviously my wife and I were very surprised by this turn of events, but found out that later that day that they revised the Loan Estimate on their site to reflect the rate we had been discussing, which was 0.25% higher than what they had originally provided us with (with the same up-front and monthly fees).  We've been doing some research, and it's not clear to my wife and I whether they are allowed to revise our Loan Estimate due to a mistake. We wanted an updated Loan Estimate from a different bank that is competing for our business after they agreed to reduce our upfront fees, but they said they couldn't legally provide one and we weren't sure whether they were telling us the truth or not. So we looked up the law to figure out whether the competing bank was telling us the truth or not and found that the law says that, [""Creditors may only use revised or corrected Loan Estimates when specific requirements are met. Creditors generally may not issue revisions to Loan Estimates because they later discover technical errors, miscalculations, or underestimations of charges. Creditors are permitted to issue revised Loan Estimates only in certain situations such as when changed circumstances result in increased charges.

"tldr; my girlfriend received a lease violation and potentially one more based on complaints that are not true  Approximately one month ago my girlfriend received a lease violation regarding a noise complaint.  We called the apartment manager, and he said it appeared to be noise from sexual activity.  So we toned it down dramatically and moved all activity to a different room that doesn't share a wall with any neighbors.    Three weeks ago, a note was slipped under my girlfriend's door from one of her neighbors claiming there was still a ton of ""banging"" noises against the shared wall.  My girlfriend and I were appalled.  All she has for a bed is just a mattress on the floor, and we had not been having sex in the room at all.  I decided it would be best if we write an extremely polite and pleasant note back to the neighbor explaining that we will be extremely conscious of any noise.  So we did.  Yesterday, my girlfriend received a voicemail from her apartment manager stating he had received another noise complaint about similar noises.  However, he said he would hold off on sending a lease violation again in hopes we could rectify the situation over the weekend.  My girlfriend is going to talk to the apartment manager in person on Monday to try and explain our side of the story.  Has anyone else dealt with false complaints in an apartment before?  I'd greatly appreciate any advice."	No
I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?  I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.  I asked this earlier, but it got no response and was buried.

My neighbors contractor flooded their unit, which in turn caused damage to my units kitchen and carpet. I called his insurance company about their procedures and my reimbursement for moving expenses and he says they're a liability company who reimburses the owner after they submit an estimate. I take this to my landlord, and now his representative wants us to either continue paying rent while we stay in the unrepaired unit, or move all our belongings out while they do repairs without reimbursing us for moving fees or hotel charges. I had told her if they wanted to break the lease 7 months early, they'd have to give us our deposit and last months rent back (which was paid at the beginning of the lease), and allow us to stay for the month of August rent free while we searched for another home. She countered with a hard no, and said we can continue to pay rent on the damaged unit until we leave, at which point they'll refund our deposit and last month if required, or she will call the state to have the unit condemned then lock the doors and have us escorted to gather our belongings and exit the property...sans our deposit of course.  My question is, what are my options here? I'm dumb and don't have renters insurance, and believe me I'll never make that mistake again. My realtor who is a family friend recommended I go to small claims court and make my case, and they'll side with me considering the situation. I tried to be cordial with my landlords rep, but she devolved into insults and that was quite frankly the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't want to get taken advantage of here, especially for doing nothing except having the misfortune of living in the unit next to the one where the problem originated.   The unit isn't unlivable, but the condition of the kitchen cabinets and carpet is beyond repairs; should I be paying rent during a time when the apartment isn't in a state that was agreed upon during the lease? Do i have recourse in seeking reimbursement or even straight payment for my moving expenses? And what abkut the lease...can my landlord just decide to condemn the place even if it truly isnt condemned and unlivable just to have a reason to break the lease? Can I get some advice? Thank you so much reddit, it's very much appreciated.	No
For starters my girlfriend and I signed a year lease four months ago that the only wording for smoking was ‚ÄúSmoking is not allowed.‚Äù We both took this as no smoking on the premises. So we smoke across the street and up a couple of houses.  Our landlord recently contacted us stating that there have been complaints from other residents of the property of my girlfriend and I smoking.  He claims this is breaching our lease, and will evict us if we do not comply.  Can he really regulate our smoking off the property? Can he move forward with eviction even though she and I both smoke off the property?  Really don‚Äôt want to get evicted here, obviously I know quitting smoking is the easiest way to solve the problem. Any advice other than that?	No
I'm renting a house, and we just discovered a relatively small water leak when the shower is running (maybe a couple drips per second). We didn't notice it until now, and we moved in at the beginning of the year. It looks like it's been going on for a while now, and there's water damage on the basement ceiling where the pipe comes out from the shower. I reported it as soon as we noticed it to the landlord, with pictures and a video, but I haven't heard back from them on the repair status. We only have one bathroom, if we warned them about it and we keep using the shower, can they deduct further damage from our security deposit after we leave? Wouldn't this fall into the domain of the implied warranty of habitability that MN has?	No
OK so to start, I'm subletting an apartment in NYC, so my name is not on the lease. (I actually never saw the original lease because my previous roommate left and it's been hard to contact her..) Anyway, the lease is over at the end of this month and I will be moving out, so the landlord / brokers have been scheduling showing. Fine with me. However, it has happened more than once now that the super has opened up my apartment and let people in without ANY notice. When I brought this up to the broker, he said that the original lease stated that even if I don't have any notice at all, the landlord and super can just enter whenever they want even if they don't let me know. Is this legal??? My feeling is that even if it was on the lease (which I doubt) it's probably still illegal and would be considered trespassing. Can anyone point me to official NYC law or wording about this? I'm feeling really disturbed by this...	No

Hello all, I did something terrible and I hit and run a parked car. What happened was I made a slight dent on someone's bumper while parking. I left a note, parked somewhere else and left. Someone saw me and watched me place the note but didn't make any moves to write my information down or call the police. The next morning, I saw my note on the ground near the car and I made an impulsed decision and decided to trash it. I know what I did was wrong but I'm a poor college student who couldn't afford to fix it right now. The parking area doesn't have any cameras and I believe no one documented the incident at all. Am I okay? If the police somehow found out, how would they contact me?  Location: CA	No

In our rental unit, the tenants just now (back in April) renewed the lease, but then in May they decided they wanted to move and break the lease because of the rent, even though my parents didn't increase the rent. According to our lease, we require a 60 day notice, but they insisted on moving out by July 1st, so they gave us a 30 day signed notice that stated that they will pay the month of June's rent, and we can keep the security deposit because they are breaking the lease with such short notice. My parents didn't agree to the terms because of the short notice, so they then threatened us by stating they already took legal action against us for lying. My parents decided to avoid problems and just let them break the lease with a 30 day notice, so they sent us a new written notice that states we can keep the security deposit and no further additional charges or actions will be taken. They did not state explicitly whether or not they will be paying June's rent in this notice like they did in the first notice, and my parents signed off. They stayed the entire month of June, giving us the key July 1st, without paying rent for the month of June. My parents sent the fact that they didn't pay June's rent into collection through a third party debt collectors. Once they got the notice, they are stating that we agreed on keeping the security deposit as June's rent (no where did we agree on that in writing or orally), and now they are suing us 3x the rent for slander (apparently our reference to their new landlords cause them a loss of 1000$), not making repairs (our lease states we need a written form for repairs and they never sent us one), and overall stress accumulated through the process. They are also claiming that they have written statements from our neighbors that we did the same thing to our last tenant (we didn't and we have proof), and they keep stating that they will see us in court with their attorney. Do they have any chance of winning with what they claim? My parents are very stressed and scared, because this is their first time in this kind of situation.	No
"Jane (fake name) is an international student renting an attic in New Jersey (real state). There is a door at the base of the stairs. When you go up the stairs to the attic, there is the living space and a bare closet. The closet is not a regular closet, I guess the best way to describe it is if the attic is an upside down V, half of it has been carpeted for living space, and there's a wall with a door seperating the other half of the attic that contains the closet.  Jane was not informed not to use the closet. There is no sign. There is no lock on the closet. She stored some luggage and other items in the closet space. Today, while at work, Jane received a text from the landlord, claiming that Jane broke the Central AC by storing things in the attic. 2 of the landlord's text messages:  ""The electrician and owner was at the house.  I took out luggage and stuff from the closet yesterday where unit is and he found two more suitcases and hangers.  This caused the air unit to break.  He fixed it but charged me $150.  Please include this charge with your rent check this Friday July 14 and please do not ever store anything else in there.  You can use the garage.""  ""I am sorry Jane but I am not going to pay for it. I did not create it.  It was super dangerous to have stuff next to those cables too""  I feel like the landlord is completely in the wrong here. I think it is reasonable for Jane to assume she could use the closet as she was paying to rent the attic. Even the landlord called the space a closet in the text. What if a fire had broken out while Jane was sleeping?  Jane is willing to move out, but the landlord has the deposit. The repair bill is $150 so it's really not worth consulting an attorney. If the landlord is in the wrong, how can we approach this situation?"	No
About a month ago, the apartment next to mine and the one below it were shot at while I was sitting outside. The shots came from another building in my complex. Apparently someone had a couple people over, there was a conflict, and someone started firing at random. The tenants were evicted but I'm still scared for my safety. It's made me afraid to take my dog out at night. I jump every time someone makes a noise outside. I've stayed with friends and family because I don't want to be in the apartment alone.   Is this grounds for breaking my lease early? I can't afford a lawyer and I'd rather not lose my security deposit but I want to move. Please help!	No
Without giving too much information to reddit, I need transcript from a hearing that happened 7/24/17 in Broomfield, CO. I went to the website, filled out, signed, scanned and emailed the document they said I needed to in order to get an expedited transcript (it said I could have it two hours after the hearing and it had been 3) and I have not heard back. I went in and the clerk said I had to either email or fax it and I wouldn't be able to hand my hard copy to her and get my transcript.  I called a lawyer and he said I have 45 days to appeal and that is a pretty hard deadline so I need to get organized quickly. My question is what can I do to speed this process up? Should I email this person again or wait until Monday? Why would I be given the option to get the transcript within two hours if it would not be available to me at that time?	No
A couple days ago, I found that my social security card was missing. The last time I used it was a about 2 weeks ago when I applied for a job and my employer asked for a photocopy (that i printed at home) for records. I searched the entire house and called mall security (where I work), but to no avail. I think I might have accidentally brought it with me to my job interview and dropped it at the mall. This whole situation has put me and my parents under a lot of stress and I have so many concerns about the safety of my identity. I'm not entirely sure that this is the right subreddit, but I need all the help I can get. I've done some googling on child identity theft, but I still have so many questions. For example, I read about how some thiefs will use false birthdays with my SSN to take advantage of my untouched credit and I should call one of the three big credit unions to place a fraud alert on my account. How do fraud alerts work? Can I place a fraud alert or get a report for credit that I'm not even sure that exists yet? I start college this september so how will this affect my financial aid and loans? Its also recommended that I get a new social security card, but can I get a new SSN? What are the pros and cons of getting a new number and what happens with my old number? Also, how do I prevent someone from applying for jobs using my SSN? What else can someone do with my SSN? Am I too overly-stressed about this? I'm panicking so hard and I really need some guidance.	No
Working part-time and get paid bi-weekly. Just over a month ago, one of my days was not registered and wasn't paid. I emailed management, they said I'd get it the next pay period. That didn't happen either.   The week in question, I managed to get a lot of extra hours and ended up with 50 total (including the 8 that weren't paid). I finally got back in and spoke face-to-face with a manager and they sorted it out. With all the fuckups, I made it clear that those were OT and that I had 42 hours that week and those 8 would have made it 50. (With the understanding that anything over 40 in a week is OT.)  I was told that the only way I, as a part-timer, could get OT was while working more than 8hrs in a day. The whole OT after 8hrs is foreign to me, but I know I've seen it as part of the union contract.   What I would like to know before I escalate this is... is the manager right? I never received a copy of the union contract, so I'm not sure what my rights are from that side. I just thought federal law required payment of OT for anything over 40.  Right now, I'm just kind of pissed at the fact that it's been over a month and I still haven't gotten paid for that day and nobody seems to give a shit.	No
A few months back, I had to quickly leave my apartment due to unsafe living conditions, and asked a friend of mine if I could stay with her for a bit. She agreed, and after a few days we had talked and come up with the idea that she would probably just sign the lease over to us and find another place to stay since her sister had moved out. After a week of me staying with her, she accused us of hiding dog shit under her covers and kicked us out with a night's notice. So, we had to pack up and leave in a rush. After that we were homeless for a few weeks until we were able to find an apartment, and have been living quite happily since. A month ago, our former friend texted me saying that she wanted me to pay for subletting fees that she was charged and damages to the room and carpetting of the apartment saying that she had been charged by her landlord for subletting fees and having 4 cats and a dog in her apartment.  Now, it has been a few months since we lived there, but on our way out I don't remember anything being stained or damaged. I don't even know if she has a case against us since we didn't pay her any money or anything like that and I'm unfamiliar with how civil court works in regards to this? Any info on what I could do or if she even has a case against us would be greatly appreciated	No
"I work as a server at a restaurant in Alabama. I am not sure if there are any special rules that apply to my state, but the general idea that I have come to is that the practice of the employer taking our tips is illegal. However, I am not certain if my specific case qualifies as being illegal.  Originally servers were paid $6.00 an hour in addition to tips(we had a tip share), however this was eventually changed to $7.25 an hour with the tips being collected and ""put back into the restaurant""(whatever that means). However, this is only for the lunch/dinner shift. The original rule($6.00 plus tips) still applies to the breakfast shift.  Is this legal for employers to do? I am given many of my tips in person by the customers I serve who thank me for my excellent service quite frequently, and I feel quite cheated to be forced to put this money that is by all rights *mine* potentially into the owners' hands.  I have thought of saying something about it, but am fearful of losing my job. I have also considered simply keeping my tips, but am afraid of legal trouble that could be taken against me. Any advice/knowledge would be welcome."	No
Hey everyone.  There is a great internship opportunity for me in San Francisco that I'm applying for. It's only for the spring and it's a paid internship. I live around 2 hours from it but I want to somehow get a place to stay for the duration of the job. Is this legal at all? And if so, how would I go about doing this?  Also, my grandparents live about 20 minutes from SF, so I can live with them if this doesn't work out, but I would rather not inconvenience them if I don't have to.  Thanks!	No
Received a refund for my security deposit and received another mail with a new revision with extra charges. How do I approach this?  Some of the charges that I received from management were arguable, but was too much of a hassle to consider so I let them go.  For example: The apartment keys were returned in the security box that they have in their office and apparently they don't have all the keys even though I specifically returned all four keys that they gave us. They charged that into our security deposit.  Other one was reglazing our kitchen sink. We lived in the premise for 2 years and the sink was never glazed in the beginning. I figured that this was also a lost cause because we never mentioned it in the beginning when we first moved in because we weren't too concern.  We received a check from them and have not cashed it out. We now received a revision from the mail and the new invoice charged us with more damages as well charged us for the refund.  We plan on calling them tomorrow, but they literally ignore our requests and claim that this and this happened and there really isn't much to argue against because they'll completely deny it.  The fee isn't much, but I feel that the property management is trying to take advantage of us.  TL;DR- Received security deposit refund- weeks later received revision with extra charge along with a charge for the security deposit that they refunded me	No
Hey everyone, I was hired on to work for an afterschool program at a local school. When I was originally hired on, I was going to be a coordinator that would be paid $12.00 an hour and start in the summer.   However, before I actually started, we found out the Assistant Manager was going to be gone for the summer. I was then told that I would be promoted to Assistant Manager for the summer. With this job, the base pay is usually $14.00, but with my experience I could expect around $14.50-15.00.   So, we started on 6/15, and I've been working full time as Assistant Manager. The entire time my supervisor has been emailing/calling/texting her boss to get her to update my pay to Assistant Manager. She didn't for the last paycheck, and I was under the assumption I would be getting retroactive pay for this paycheck. Today I found out that my pay had still not been updated, so I talked to my supervisor again, and she gave me her supervisor's (the person in charge of updating my pay) phone number and told me that I should text her myself to get her going.   Well, I did. But she didn't text me back, instead she emailed my supervisor and told her that since the original Assistant Manager would be coming back after the summer, they couldn't give me the position, and that I would have to be paid the original $12.00 that I was originally offered.   So, do I have any options? Is there any way I can get compensated for the pay I was expecting? Being the assistant manager is much more difficult than being a coordinator, so I would like higher compensation. My job role is completely different as well. I've pretty much taken on a massive amount more of responsibility and job difficulty on the expectation that I would be paid more for it, but after a month of working with that expectation I've found out that I'm not.

Hey guys so recently i signed a lease with an apartment complex near my university. prior to signing my lease i made sure to ask about my special circumstances that may have disqualified me of being able to sign a lease with the apartment complex. My special circumstances being that I am a completely independent student who has no guarantors, but receives certain financial aid that if counted as income, would qualify me to be able to sign by myself. Due to me explicitly telling the property manager of this, I was told by the property manager to make up information for the guarantor section of the online application (largely in part because it was a required part of the online application to be able to fill out the entire application) and ensured that he would edit the information later. Fast forward a couple days later and I sign my lease for the apartment complex. Fast forward a couple days more and I receive an email from the property manager reminding me that my 'guarantor' needs to sign his part of the agreement. Just reviewed my lease and it seems he has bamboozled me or maybe he forgot that I talked to him about this? my lease states that financial aid does not qualify as income and i must prove that my income is 3x the amount of the rent for me to qualify without a guarantor and any misrepresentation of information may result in a default. I can currently prove a monthly income of 2x the monthly rent based solely off of my job and my financial aid for the fiscal year would put me over the qualification for income if counted. So my question is did he bamboozle me or is there something that I should do to fix this?	No
"I rented a house on the 5th of July, just myself and my 4 year old son. Prior to me moving in, the landlord informed me of a ""bunker"" that is in the middle of the backyard. She locked the door of the bunker with with a pad lock and told me she did that so nobody gets hurt. I never opened the door of the bunker till 3 days later, when my buddy was helping me move in, the other side of the door was broken and he opened it. I seen stairs that go down about 10 feet, and was led to a very creepy room. I was never told about there being a room down there, she (landlord) made it sound like there is just a ""hole"" down there. Apparently they used these things during the war? I don't‚Äã know much about them, and I don't care to learn. My question is, the rental agreement does not state anything about the room in the ground, or the bunker itself. What are my loopholes to getting out of this lease and getting my money back? I paid first months rent and security deposit. I left the house on the 9th of July, cause I was very worried about my son going down there when I'm sleeping or at work. The landlord told me to leave, but she will charge me $55 per day till she rents it out to someone else, then she will give me some money back, and if she don't rent the house out by the first of August, I have to pay another rent, even though I'm not living there. Sorry for the long post. Need help! Thanks."	No
Long story short.  Twice in approximately 3 months, the appartment above my own has had leaks that have caused damages into my place.  My place is rented through a private landlord, the room above mine is rented through a letting agency.  I have the name of the agency and I'm about to form an e-mail including evidence of the damages from these 2 instances.  I would assume them being an agency, they'll have insurance for such things, but I'm not sure what to be saying to them to let them know this is a serious matter.  Originally my landlord was going to be handling this matter, but he said he got passed around numerous times when he made some calls after the first occurence, and then told me to chase it to see if I could do better (my landlord is a bit too laid back about everything).  I want to handle this all through e-mail so I have a paper trail of all this.  The first time this happened (April) it was the upstairs water boiler that had burst.  It flooded the hallway of my place, damaged numerous boxes for classic video game consoles I had, amongst other electricals.  It also nearly caused an electrical fire from a hissing plug socket.  It has damaged the roof paint, caused a wall light to nearly catch fire, and it has water damaged the flooring and my boiler room door.  I had to combat the flooding through constant mopping for about 6 hours the first night until their water was temporarily turned off.  The 2nd time this happened (this past Friday) it caused floor damage, more roof damage, and a leak has full a bag and a box of my stuff full of water water damaging a bunch of video game systems, controllers, and the boxes of numerous others.  Ideally, I'd want this agency to pay for the property damage this has called, damage for replacing my possessions, and ideally some sort of compensation for the work/ stress involved with having to clear up all this mess.  Many thanks in advance for any guidance on how to go about this matter.	No
Lease expired June 30th. In Florida landlords have 15 days to return the deposit if there are no claims and 30 days to send an itemized list of claims if there are any.  On July 10th I sent LL a text with my new address which was acknowledged by him. By this time I had also set up mail forwarding with the post office from the address of the old house.  On July 31st (31 days after the lease ended) I sent him a text asking him if the deposit was in the mail and headed to the new address. He replied thanks for the reminder, he'll send it tomorrow.  Today, he texted me that cleaning cost $350 for the whole house, and that was some minor wear and tear but that he wouldn't charge me for it, and that he'd put a check in the mail today for $1800. The problem with this math is that the security deposit was $2250, not $2150. He is likely confused because that was the security deposit and rent from the year previous.  My thoughts on the cleaning itself: he was having the house cleaned ON the 30th. We handed over the keys on the 29th. He was also talking about getting cleaning people to the house weeks before the end of the lease. He was asking us to leave us the keys early if possible to facilitate him having them there before the lease ended. I believe that the house was not dirty beyond the level of 'normal wear and tear.' It needed routine dusting and mopping, but nothing beyond that. However, I made the mistake of not taking pictures on my way out, so I'm not sure if I have a leg to stand on there. I did take pictures when we moved in, and there was trash in the backyard and drywall dust and paint inside. $350 is also a lot to clean an 1800 sqft house.  Another thing he did that I'm not sure is relevant or not: he failed to give me a receipt for the security deposit per the FL statute, which should have disclaimed the bank it was being held at and whether it was accruing interest or not.   My plan is this:  1) Stop texting him. Start communicating via certified mail (which is actually also how he was supposed to notify me of claims in the first place according to the statute)  2) After I get the check, DONT cash it, and send a certified letter with the following information (summarized):  * Say that I was your tenant at address X until June 30th, and paid my rent regularly. I cooperated with handing the keys over a few days early to accomodate your request, stated over a week in advance, for cleaning.  * State the timeline of the texts that went back and forth, and that I have received his check (I actually haven't yet, but I want to prepare the letter so I can send it out on the same day I get the check)  * State that the refund is not accepted, and while I do object to the claim itself, more importantly, he's forfeited his right to claim the security deposit per florida statute  83.49(3). Statute attached.  * Even if the claim were legitimate, the $1800 is not correct because the total deposit was $2250.   * For the reasons above, I request that you mail the full security deposit in the amount of $2250 to my address below. A failure on your part to do so within 15 days will result in court action on my part. Please note that the prevailing party in court actions of this nature are also entitled to their court costs and attorney fees.  **My questions are the following:**  **Is there anything wrong with the content of  my letter or my plan? I thought it would be best to not go into the detail of the cleaning objection and stick to the deadline thing.**  **Am I leaving myself open to him simply returning the deposit and then him suing me for the cleaning? The statute says he may file an action for damages after return of the deposit. That would suck because if my case for that is bad I'd be out HIS attorney fees and court costs in that separate action.**   Statute: http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0000-0099/0083/Sections/0083.49.html  &gt;(3)‚ÄÉThe landlord or the landlord‚Äôs agent may disburse advance rents from the deposit account to the landlord‚Äôs benefit when the advance rental period commences and without notice to the tenant. For all other deposits:  &gt;(a)‚ÄÉUpon the vacating of the premises for termination of the lease, if the landlord does not intend to impose a claim on the security deposit, the landlord shall have 15 days to return the security deposit together with interest if otherwise required, or the landlord shall have 30 days to give the tenant written notice by certified mail to the tenant‚Äôs last known mailing address of his or her intention to impose a claim on the deposit and the reason for imposing the claim. The notice shall contain a statement in substantially the following form:  &gt;This is a notice of my intention to impose a claim for damages in the amount of __________ upon your security deposit, due to _________ . It is sent to you as required by s. 83.49(3), Florida Statutes. You are hereby notified that you must object in writing to this deduction from your security deposit within 15 days from the time you receive this notice or I will be authorized to deduct my claim from your security deposit. Your objection must be sent to (landlord‚Äôs address) .  &gt;If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the 30-day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit and may not seek a setoff against the deposit but may file an action for damages after return of the deposit.  &gt;(b)‚ÄÉUnless the tenant objects to the imposition of the landlord‚Äôs claim or the amount thereof within 15 days after receipt of the landlord‚Äôs notice of intention to impose a claim, the landlord may then deduct the amount of his or her claim and shall remit the balance of the deposit to the tenant within 30 days after the date of the notice of intention to impose a claim for damages. The failure of the tenant to make a timely objection does not waive any rights of the tenant to seek damages in a separate action.  &gt;(c)‚ÄÉIf either party institutes an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate the party‚Äôs right to the security deposit, the prevailing party is entitled to receive his or her court costs plus a reasonable fee for his or her attorney.

I was paid in cash for rent and deposit on a room in a house I am subleasing. The person who paid spent one day in the house moving in and decided they didn't want to stay in the house and now are demanding that I give the money back. They hired a private investigator and found out the number for my landlord and are threatening them and me with a lawsuit if I don't give back the money. The landlord told me to just give it to them. But I don't feel they have any grounds to ask me for the deposit and rent that they agreed to pay especially since it's five days into the month and I will now have to find a replacement. 	No
Hi!  I work for a company in Philadelphia. I'm salaried and paid every two weeks. Last pay period the checks were delayed a week and when I received my check I noticed NO taxes were taken out. The amount of the check was for my take home pay. I complained and a few days later the proper check was issued with my salary and taxes taken out to give me the take home pay amount. At the same time, other employees paychecks have bounced. Now, again, my paycheck is delayed.  I want to quit this job and get my owed paycheck, plus the paycheck for the last week I worked.  I plan on quitting today or tomorrow because as of now I've worked three weeks for free and my boss doesn't seem like he's going to pay me.   How can I go about attempting to legally collect my owed pay?	No
We received a termination notice without cause on our month to month apartment telling us we had 60 days to find a new place to live. We have lived in our apartment complex for 11 years and have never been late with the rent. We haven't violated any of the terms we agreed to when we rented our apartment. About, 3 years ago we moved to the apartment across the hall from our original apartment in the same complex. We have one cat we paid a large pet deposit for. They were supposed to take out the rugs that are a good twenty years old. We told them about it including the flea problem we were having, but they did not want to do anything about it. We've been flea bombing regularly, washing everything frequently, and putting flea stuff on our cat.      This week we received a call about having requiring us to call the owner back about a flea problem in our apartment complex. When we called them back they started to yell at us claiming that we were the source of the flea problem and that we would need to allow them to come into the apartment to spray for fleas. For reference, the lady in the apartment above who just moved out had three cats that they did not know about, did not spray for fleas, and did not flea bomb.  We asked if we could work with them on the time so that we would be available to take the cat out of the apartment for the required time for the flea spraying. The manager then went on to threaten us by telling us we would have to leave if we didn't comply. They eventually calmed down and we scheduled an appointment when someone would come to spray for flea's. We thought that this was dealt with, but today we received a termination without cause notice from our landlord.    The termination without cause notice is actually dated for two days ago and we did not receive it until today. Moving will not only cost us time and money, but we may not be able to find a place that will take our cat before the 60 days are up. Would the behavior of the landlord in this case fall under the protections for tenants against landlord retaliation ?	No
I just found out that my piece of garbage uncle stole my grandpa's home equity.   My grandpa's house is worth $550,000, and he had paid off almost $400,000 with 6 years of payments left before. I'm 22 so I don't really understand the real estate terminology, but he refinanced the house and took out a HELOC. Now the mortgage has basically been reset to 30 years and the new price of the house. On top of that, the payments on the house have risen by almost $600 per month because of the appraisal. My grandpa is almost 96 and doesn't understand these kinds of documents, he just signs where he's told. My uncle took the money and made a downpayment on a $1 million house.  What recourse do we have?	No

New to r/Legaladvice  just wanted to ask what rights do I have as a parent vs my child's doctor? Recently I had a lovely baby girl, she's healthy and beautiful what else can a parent ask for. But our pediatrician has been messing with us for the past 4 months. First problem came from when the mother took my baby for a check up and the mother filled out a mental health survey. The doctor told her she needs to see a therapist, if a referral is fine for the same day, the doctor calls me while I'm at work to come pick up the baby, I was confused I thought the mother was with her, apparently when I got there they needed me to take my baby home so the mother can be transferred in an ambulance with cops without our consent. We told them if it's a referral we can do another day. They insisted and took her to another hospital. I find out later that they admitted her to a psych ward. They needed to see her for a few days for evaluation. She was scared all over a misunderstanding, At the time the mother was having a problem at where she used to live(now lives with me). It was a heated fight with her mom and some piece of shit bf that came out of jail. That whole event was putting her down and the doctors were quick to say it's mommy blues. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, go in for another check up they misread her height and weight again. We tell them to check again because event the doctor knew that was silly that she suddenly lost some height. Come yesterday it happened again. They misread her weight saying she's 10.6 lbs now, the doctor calls her friends in another hospital to transfer her. The emt gets here, they see we don't she a car seat , so they take seat out of the baby stroller and strap her on to the stretcher. The emt didn't want to do it. They said its against procedure they knew something was up, in the ride they tell the mother to be carful with what you say to them, they have been known to prescribe unnecessary tests and try to charge us. When they get to other hospital, they check again for her weight 3 more times. Until they came to the consensus that she was 11.1 lbs now. They kept insisting that the mother had baby blues if she had any plans of hurting herself or the baby, they didn't want o hear anything we had to say, im with the mother 24/7 we love our daughter make sure she's happy and being fed every 3 hours. So we try to take her home they refuse to let us leave. We have to admit the baby and if we refused more they threaten with acs . Our baby was in no danger, except for the dangers of healthcare. What can we do?	No
Throwaway for obvious reasons.   TLDR at end.   Was arrested late may 2017 in Santa Barbara County , CA for 2 misdemeanor drug possession charges. One read 'Possession of controlled substance' and the other 'Possession of controlled substance without prescription'.   Got Court tomorrow and wondering what I should expect for an outcome. Private lawyer.   The two substances were (1) SINGLE LSD TAB and ~15 KLONOPIN 2MG PILLS (prescription benzo).   The way I was arrested tells as follows -   Sitting in car looking up food store location with my buddy. Im in driver he is passenger. We have a single tall open beer can in the center front cup holder. I have my LSD, KLONOPIN and a bag of MAGIC MUSHROOMS in the side compartment of the front driver door. We are apparently illegally parked / pulled off to the side of the road in a residential area. Keys are in ignition, engine running. It is late, between 12-1am at this point.    A cop knocks on the window and asks what we are doing, we proceed to tell him we are looking for a directions. He then sees the open beer can in the car and tells us to step out of the car. Asks to search and I say yes. Finds all drugs and asks who they are. Tell him my buddy left them there. He arrests me on the spot for having them in the car on drivers side. Spend night in jail (~14 hours), and get out and move on.   What should I expect as a reasonable outcome w my private lawyer? This is my first time offense , I've never previously been arrested. Is there any specific way I should handle myself in court? Also, why didnt the officer charge me for the magic mushrooms/ open beer? I was being very nice and cooperative during the entire time, maybe that helped?  TL;DR  I got arrested in SB, CA for possession of controlled sub and possession of controlled sub no prescrip. First time offense with a private lawyer. What can I expect at my court date tomorrow?	No
I work at an undisclosed company where they pay us $8/hour plus tips (Arizona has $10 minimum wage). When clocking out you have to report your tips, and the general manager requires you to put at least $2 per every hour worked, even if we didn't make that much. If we put in less, and what we made instead, the manager will go in to the payroll and change the tips reported (and often lower clocked hours).  What do I do? I have found employment elsewhere but I don't want my friends there to continually be screwed	No
"First off, I know that placing a ""No Trespassing"" sign directly facing someone's yard (it's visible from our living room windows) is very passive-aggressive and screams that we've had some sort of neighborly feud. However, we have not. We do not even know who owns the land behind our yard and thus placed the sign.  To give a better picture, the wooded area behind our back yard goes on for about two acres. In winter, when there are no leaves, you can barely see a small house at the top of a hill, if you know where to look. From that house, I imagine, our back yard is pretty clear to see (only in winter; in summer, it's impossible to see 10 feet ahead of you). It seems reasonable that a new neighbor moved into that area beyond the woods and walked through to our backyard to post the sign. However, I know that is not the case.  The woods used to belong to a farmer that I worked for in middle school/high school. He was very kind and as he did not use the land for anything, he did not mind if the neighborhood kids played on it. Anyway, we know he sold the wooded land behind our backyard to someone, (he divided his land into much smaller parcels and sold them to people who wanted to build their own homes) but we do not know who bought the woods that touch our land.  I know that this new neighbor trespassed to place the eyesore of a sign because there is an impossibly deep ravine/creek that divides the woods. It is impossible to cross, both because it is wide and the water is deep. I'm not sure where it begins or ends, but there is nowhere to cross near our backyard or our neighbors' backyards. The person had to have driven to our house, walked through our back yard, and posted the sign. Once again, I'm not sure why they picked our house. There are other yards adjacent to the woods, and we never go in the woods (I stopped going into the woods maybe 5 or 6 years ago), but I suppose they think that we do.  I hate to mention this, but the only possibility I can think of is that it is racially motivated. There are only two black families in my small town, and we are one of them. None of my other neighbors touching the woods got signs in their yards.  My questions are as follows:  1) How do I find out who owns the property now? The farmer moved away and I don't have his contact info, so I can't find out that way. 2) If I cannot find this neighbor and ask them to take the sign down, is there anything else we can do legally?  Thank you in advance."	No
I'm currently finishing up a part time position and a large bank/financial institution and I was thinking of doing as I described in the title. However, I know that the finance and investment advice field can be heavy in regulatory and legal burdens.   One of the main focuses at my part time job was researching and presenting on cryptocurrencies (i.e. Ethereum and Bitcoin) and blockchain/distributed ledger technology. I have participated in briefings for high up executives, including presidents. In my spare time, I have given advice/feedback on the cryptocurrency investment sphere for friends of friends (making sure to state that I don't know for sure the price will rise, they are taking their own risk, yada yada...) so I have a few references, as well as a letter of recommendation from a high level executive at my bank/institution.   My plan was to use these references and experiences to start a small consulting company to help advise people on investments in cryptocurrency, best practices for keeping your currency safe, provide weekly newsletter/debriefings on the markets, etc. Any idea of how I need to go about making sure I'm following regulations?	No
"Hi all,   Here's the situation: *In Nov of 2016, I go apartment hunting. My husband really wants a pool and we find a building downtown with one. I'm meh on it, but he is really keen on it. The rent is $2400. It's a 15 year old building. *Our second choice was was a place for $1900 in a nearby neighborhood. New construction. *In the immediate neighborhood, around our building rent ranges from $2000 up. Another contender nearby was $2800 for the same size, but amazing views and brand new.  *The pool was the thing that influenced the decision. *Moved in in December 2016. *The pool was closed for remodel at the end of January 2017, along with the rest of the building - lobby, all amenities, etc. *It's August and it's still closed. :) The last note that went up was stating that it would be done by end of July. We've spent 6 of 8 months living without the one thing we wanted here. *ZERO was said about the impending remodel. *Yesterday, when having a ""lively"" discussion, one of the leasing agents stated that ""[Management] didn't want us telling about the remodel..."" *Yes, the rental agreement has a note that management can close amenities, but the common sense reading is that this is for a temporary and limited duration - not a half year!  Naturally, we're pissed. We are moving out, but it's been something that sticks in our side like a thorn. If we had known, we would not have moved into an impending construction zone. These types of projects don't happen overnight, so it seems unreasonable they they wouldn't have known this was coming. Their failure to inform us of this seems like there's some culpability here.   What are my options? Ideally, I would like to drag them into small claims and go for a small sum of money from them. That said, I'm not sure if this is small claims eligible. Thoughts?   Located in Washington State."	No
There is a 7.5 ft utility easement located in my backyard that is shared by myself and the neighbor behind me (per survey). There is a utility pole that sits right by our fence (within the easement), however the guy wires are located outside of the utility easement ([MS Paint Drawing](http://i.imgur.com/iiXNyUL.jpg?1)).  I am not really bothered by the utility pole, as it's out of the way, but the guy wires are inconveniently located right in the middle of my backyard. Do I have a case to make the utility company relocate the guy wires? Or are the guy wires allowed to be outside the easement?   Any insight would be much appreciated!	No
"I worked for an IT company and put in my two weeks notice. When I put in my two weeks notice (Resignation) I was told that I would be paid out two weeks and I would go home that day.

"My house has been in foreclosure. Knowing that we would be forced to move out at some point, my family and I moved in with relatives a few blocks away.    Knowing that we would have to be notified and given some time before we were evicted, we kept a lot of stuff at the house. Some of it was large stuff like furniture that we didn't have room for and didn't want to pay storage for, and some of it was antiques, books, or other stuff that I had accumulated that I would sell from time-to-time.   I go to the house once a week to collect the mail and occasionally go inside to grab some stuff. I showed up today and there was a dumpster filled with my stuff and a crew working inside. The locks had been changed.    I was definitely not served with any notice to vacate or anything like that. I called the police to file a report. They came to the house and told me there was nothing they could do, that I should have known this would happen since I knew I was in foreclosure, that it was my word against theirs (though there was no one claiming that they were right to evict me, and I showed them mail with my name and the address of the house in question), and that I should call an attorney or the Sheriff's office.   The construction crew put me in touch with the ""new owner"" (quotations because I only have his word, as I haven't been served with anything), who said that he thought the property had been vacated because he had been inside a bunch of times and hadn't seen beds, though it was full of other stuff, and because I wasn't taking good care of the lawn and the inside needed a bunch of repairs. He admitted that he hadn't made any attempt to reach me, by phone or mail, even though the neighbors on either side and across the street all know me, have my number, and know where I'm living. He definitely didn't use the sheriff's office.  This all happened in the last few hours. I haven't had any luck getting an attorney yet. I took some pictures of the full dumpster, but I have no way of making a full inventory. Is there something else I should be doing? Is it true that I shouldn't be filing a police report?   Thank you for any help."	No
My boyfriend started renting a house in June. He inquired about signing a lease multiple times but the landlord never had him sign a lease. He has been paying all his rent and utilities on time. The house has multiple issues, including a leaking/sinking in roof, walls, clogged pipes, possibly black mold in the bathroom, and overall needs to be deep cleaned. Not a great place, I know. As my bf did his walk through he noted all these issues and since has messaged the landlord multiple times about fixing everything. The landlord response was to do nothing. He's already looked into moving out into a new apartment in August.   Now, my bf and I were supposed to take a road trip out to my home state in June, so I came out to the house so we could get ready to go. After some unexpected expenses, we couldn't go on the trip until the following month. I have been staying with him since.  Today, the other tenet who holds the primary lease (who he has had many issues with, including the landlord telling bf she tried to take money from his overpaying the rent) started yelling at my bf that he needed to pay back rent for me staying here. The landlord never said that I had to leave or that I had to pay anything while I have been here, and when we called to talk to my bf's dad he said that he has never heard of such a thing and he would ask his attorney.  Any advice would be helpful, neither of us have had to deal with all these issues before.	No
Dunno what's really pertinent here but I have a record in two states living in a third. I'm a pretty stable schizo with two jobs and a BA. I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb. I received ~$200 pair of tickets for operating w/o insurance and driving on a suspended registration. I paid the tickets well ahead of deadline but came home to find info staying that a bench warrant was put out on me but apparently according to the clerk's website I'm good. So what's the deal with this type of situation. I'm not even clear on if these are simple tickets misdemeanors or whatever (WI). 	No
My brother is afraid of being evicted. Essentially what happened was, my brother heard fighting downstairs where his landlords live. The whole house start shaking and he heard the wife gasping for air. Then she'd yell for him to stop that he was killing her. My brother opened the door and yelled downstairs to stop, she's a woman, etc.   The landlord then threatened my brother that he'd kill him instead. My brother yelled back to come try it, etc. my brother realized his temper got the better of him and closed the door and called 911. The police, ambulance, fire trucks, etc came. Strangely, they didn't question my brother.   Of course, now my brother is scared of being evicted as backlash for calling the police on the woman beating landlord.  Does he have anything to protect himself from eviction? Can he somehow extend the time needed to get a place if it comes to that? What happens now if the landlord decides to evict him?	No
"I paid half of the deposit on a room in Colorado before moving in, which looking back on it I know was dumb but I didn't want him to give the room away to someone else. Me and my girlfriend broke up and now aren't moving into the house. I don't have any written receipt of said deposit, but I have a bunch of texts from my girlfriend and myself back and forth with him and his girlfriend talking about this $650 deposit and how it was ""earnest money"" to hold the room, and how he passed up on another renter because of it and that now he doesn't have to pay it back. But it wasn't a holding fee, it was half of the discussed security deposit. He just offered my $300 of it back but that was a large majority of the cash I had saved and I really need the full $650 even if it will take a while to pan out in court, do I have any legal recourse? Can I use those texts in court to sue for my deposit back?"	No
Basically we all had a student flat over the year. Towards the second half of a year one of our flatmates were starting to struggle towards rent and fell behind about ¬£600+. In response to this our landlord has taken our deposits (held with a 3rd party) until it's paid however from speaking to him over facebook, it seems clear that paying off his debt is not a priority for him and that we will most likely not be seeing our deposit money.  I was wondering if there is any grounds for a small claims court over our deposit (if we don't get our deposit back)back because of this person (our landlord has confirmed this to us) refusing to pay off his remaining debt.	No
All names have been changed.  My boyfriend Abe and I live in a house with 7 people total right now. The house is owned by the K family, whom Abe knows personally. Abe acts as landlord by finding people to rent the rooms, collecting rent to send to the K family, repairing whatever necessary in the house, etc. This agreement is not in writing. We moved in about a year ago, before that a friend of ours who also knew the K family took care of the house but he moved out about 6 months ago. If Abe were to leave, the K family would sell the house.  The other roommates live here with no lease, no security deposits, nothing in writing and pay rent on a monthly basis.  One of our roommates, Kevin, has been living here a little longer than Abe and me. The entire time he has been here every single person has had complaints about him. He is very messy when it comes to the kitchen/bathrooms, never pays bills on time, and steals food. We talked to him about it many times and warned him that if he didn't improve we would ask him to move out, but tried to be patient with him as he is an old friend of Abe's.  A few months ago, Kevin's girlfriend Britney, who was living elsewhere, got into a fight with her roommate, who took out a restraining order against her. So Kevin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. After a week or so she asked if she could continue staying there until August, to which we said yes and asked her to start pitching in for utilities but no additional rent.  Since Britney moved in she has made a few efforts to clean but on the whole the place has been a lot messier and they continue to steal food. We have asked them many times to clean their bathroom, as they share it with two of the other roommates, but they are adamant they shouldn't have to do it.  Since they refused to clean up after themselves, and it is now August and Britney has not made any effort to look for other housing, we asked Kevin and Britney both to move out. We haven't given them written notice yet as we are able to be pretty flexible about the room and want to give them a reasonable amount of time to find somewhere else, but we told them 30 days roughly. However both Kevin and Britney have issues managing money which is the main problem with moving out. Britney in particular has lawyer fees since she assaulted her roommate, but she also hasn't been contributing to Kevin's rent at all even though she shares his room (and takes up a large portion of the common areas with her stuff since their room isn't big enough).  So basically we want to give them written notice to leave in 30 days but are concerned that even though they have agreed to move out, they won't find a place in time or be able to pay for it. I'd like to find out what exactly I need to include in the notice so that if they are still here by the end of that period we will be able to take some kind of legal action (and if it comes to that, what's the best approach?).  I'm wondering if we need to involve the K family as well or if we can give them notice by ourselves. Abe has already talked to the K family and they are fully supportive of our decision but I don't know if we need them to sign the notice as well. Here is what we are planning on giving them so far:  ¬† (Date)  (Kevin's full name and Britney's full name)  (Address)  ¬† Kevin and Britney,  Please take notice that I am ending your rental of the property located at (Address).  You have received this notice letter because you have a month-to-month tenancy and I would like to end the tenancy. You must move out within 30 days after receiving this notice.  Signed  (Abe's full name. Or K family?)  ¬†  We are planning on printing this out and giving it to them in person. A few other questions I have:  Do I need to write separate notices for Kevin and Britney or can they both be on the same one?  Who needs to sign it? (Britney claims that in addition to giving them 90 days, we need every roommate in the house to sign but I don't think this is true)  To what extent does the K family need to be involved?  Do I need to provide a reason for ending their tenancy, or reference any specific laws? We live in Virginia.  Thanks so much if you've read all this and I appreciate any advice you could give!	No
Basically what the title says. I just got hired in California by a restaurant chain. I'm sitting in the employee orientation and the HR lady says employees aren't eligible for health insurance until 1 year. I was under the impression that the ACA chAnged this to a 90 day minimum waiting period, and my cursory googling confirms that. There are some exceptions but none that should extend it to a full year. I haven't even started yet and don't want to jeopardize this employment opportunity, because I need a job, but I want to make sure I am getting what's rightfully mine. I plan on asking Hr once I've completed training, but is there any other course of action I should take? With the current political situation my confidence in government actually helping me is at an all time low, but what should I do?	No
"Okay, long story short.  Dad and the girlfriend split some months ago. They were together 8 years. No marriage. A couple years into the relationship, she stated that she feared my dad would die, and she would have no where to live (we're pretty sure it was just a ploy to get her name on the house). So he puts her name on the house to shut her up. She owns a house, he bought his house before they got together. His name is not listed on her house, but he has put major renovations into it. Ceiling was falling in, load bearing wall cracked, etc. He fixed all of it, over several weekends, using his money. After he redid her house, he started on his own, and paid for roughly 80% of it on his own.   There are other things that we are not sure if he can use in court, such as; Him supporting her lazy ass son, she went to his therapist and tried to pull his medical records, she's contacting our family blaming them for not telling her ""how messed up he is"" (slander?), the amount of time and money he put into her house, is her house touchable (meaning because he put time and money into it, can he pull equity there?). At one point in time, she was thinking about selling her house, and he told her not to. Reason? ""If we were to split for some reason, you need to have a place to go that's yours.""    It's an incredibly shitty situation, he feels defeated, and has given up. Is there anything to help him? He doesn't have an attorney (money), and court is in a damn week."	No
Roommate gave key to boyfriend w/o discussing it with me. I came home one day after being away and heard someone enter the apartment. Expecting it to be my roommate, it was her boyfriend and she was nowhere to be found. She refuses to return the key and I'm forced to live with the couple until I can find a replacement. He spends every night here. What are my options, please?   Lease has no duplicate key clause.   Thank you.	No
I'm applying to take intermittent FMLA to care for a family member with Parkinson's, who needs mainly to have me keep an eye on him to make sure he's eating and in case he falls and hurts himself. I requested to work from home but my employer refused and said FMLA was suitable for my needs. It's much less useful to me than WFH would be because I'll have to miss work and because, since I don't know when or if he'll need help back onto his feet or in case he hurts himself, I'll probably end up taking a few days off every week 'just in case' and play the odds.  We bid for shifts periodically based on performance, and if I miss much work I'm not going to be as able to compete for my current, desired shift. I'm worried I'll get pushed into a shift that's not what I want and that, for days I'm in the office, will actually make me even less able to care for him on those days.   Can they do that? What would be my recourse if they did?	No
Colorado  We notified them months ahead of time of our intention to leave, in accordance with the lease.  The original lease was up earlier last month and I had moved out before that date.  My roommate, however, didn't plan ahead so he extended it by a month then packed up and left a few weeks ago.  He's no longer in the state.  The rental company left me a voicemail claiming I never officially moved out and need to pay his bill.  I never signed anything to extended the lease nor spoke with the company since I notified them I was moving out 4 months ago.  I cleaned my half of the apartment before leaving and haven't been back since. There's a good chance his half is trashed.  How fucked am I?	No
I was smoking a cigarette on my patio and I got this notice. Does this mean I have to leave, or if seen smoking again THEN I have to leave?	No
* There were (2) periods of time where he was unresponsive * One instance was being unresponsive for (4) weeks where I was asking for an update multiple times via email/phone * The second time was when I was asking for a financial statement for the services, he took (3) weeks to respond.  After he sent the statement, I terminated his counsel and then he made another statement and used up the retainer. * Are these complaints worthy of getting the bar involved?	No
My landlord is in the process of selling the building.  My girlfriend broke the bathroom door and my landlord just handed me a bill for $130 and told me to pay it by Monday.  I had no idea that I would be responsible for paying for it let alone in a couple of days.  He has my security deposit from when we moved in.  How do I handle this situation?	No
My girlfriends son is almost 2 years old. A few weeks ago he hurt his leg, and she took him the very next day to an urgent care facility. They did X-rays and stated a sprain. A week later he was still showing pain and swelling so she took him to another imaging facility who also stated sprain after additional X-ray. Today she is at Vanderbuilt with him and the doctora there are saying a fracture.  Is there any action that can be taken against the first two facilities?	No
"Hello guys, I'm sure this question has been asked a lot, but I need some advice. I recently moved out of an apartment in Denton TX, and they are charging me around $850 in cleaning charges. All they sent me was a ""bulk invoice"" with lots of vagueness, such as the oven needing to be cleaned costing $50, my tub needing to be cleaned costing $30, etc. The part that gets is that they are charging $450 dollars to repair my tub! My tub was in complete working order when I left. Also, many of the things they listed, I cleaned. I will admit, the oven was not clean, and I forgot to clean the blinds and ceiling fan. They are charging me $30 apiece for those.  I called after I received the bill asking for a itemized invoice about materials used, work costs, etc. They said they couldn't provide one because the company they use does bulk cleaning... My biggest question is, are they still required to send a itemized invoice when I didn't pay a security deposit? I am familiar with some Texas Property laws and Landlord-Tenant laws, but cannot find an answer for this. I am sure that there was no need to clean anything in my bathroom, because I cleaned it and I have photos. Also, there is no way the bathtub needed repairs, much less $450 dollars worth of them.   Before moving out, they provided use with a Resident Notice of  Charges and Damage Prices, outlining some pretty ridiculous fees. Will this cover their back in lieu of providing a legit invoice? I will attach it in the body. I feel I am being scammed. What are my options?"	No
I have been out of the country for a few years. I'm one owner of five of a commercial yard. We are legally tenants in common. Two of the owners have been operating their business on the property and have covered the entire area with their inventory and refuse to move it. They often prevent access to the property to myself or my agents. In the past they have accused another owner of theft had him arrested.  What is the best way to deal with this? Is there any way we can force a sale? Alternatively, can we force them to demarcate the property into 5 equal shares?	No

"I'm in Urbana Illinois, USA.  ""I've been searching around and can't find anything on this. In January I signed a lease for August. At that point, I had two jobs, was on track, ready to move in RIGHT THEN. At that time, I didn't notice how fishy it was two of the six people weren't on the lease, my rent amount wasn't specified in the lease, and the utilities part was hazy. In June, I lost my job when my boss relocated and have only found a 4-8hr a week position. Above minimum wage but it doesn't matter if you don't have hours. I thought by August I would have another job, maybe even two other jobs, but no such luck. So I have decided to sublease, as another person in the group has as well. I have 8 days before the rent is due. My housemates are pressuring me not to make flyers or post on craigslist (it's a great deal and in a college town, this just feels like sabotage) as they want someone in their friend group to rent (but don't have anyone who can). We have agreed that I shouldn't move in, and I haven't moved my stuff in the building like they have. However, I don't want to pay rent for a place I'm not living! I'm in a position where my own room with a bed, a washer and dryer, would be much appreciated. What I'm asking is can I refuse to pay rent, when I don't live there?"" What has changed since then:  I'm starting a minimum wage position with a lot more hours next week (2 jobs now but money is still tight). The landlord wants one person to collect all the money and write one check. The 'leader' of the group asked everyone to get it to them by the 12th (3 days before rent is due) because the landlord is out of town on the 15th. I've sent six interested people to the landlord via email. They want to rent to a friend.  I have not set foot on the property since we viewed it before signing the lease in January. If I don't pay, he evicts me (I've had a 30 days before while squatting) what's the worst that can happen? The landlord and the house mates have been unwilling to work with me, saying they'll find someone from their friend group to fill the vacancy. Haven't yet."	No
The title says it all really. There's a bunch of scary looking language on the notice saying I have to vacate the premises by midnight tonight or they'll take action with the Justice of the Peace.   Best as I can tell, this all happened because there was a mixup in the auto-payment system of the apartment and so no payment was posted this month. I was out of town on my rent's due date on the 5th and they posted this notice on the 7th. I didn't see an email or a voicemail or any other notice other than this one.  As soon as I found out about this, I went online and paid my balance. The office is closed today so there's no one I can talk to from management until tomorrow.   Basically, I just want to know, what's going to happen at midnight? I obviously don't want to move out tonight, not that I have any way to do so. Also, what's going to happen tomorrow? I'd like to work something out with management and just pay my rent and all, but legally speaking, could they evict me anyway if they wanted to?  Just wondering what the worst case scenario is here and how worried I should be about it.	No
I lived in a multi-unit complex owned by my landlord for 2 years. We dealt with numerous issues over the course of our tenancy:  Knowing that we're students with loans to pay rent, she asked us for rent 1-2 weeks early as a favor to her on multiple occasions, and we complied.   Last summer, the plumbing in the complex went out, and we were without running water for 5 days. The only compensation she offered us was a large garbage can of rain water she collected.   Further, she left a large pile of brush on our porch for weeks that we believe attracted rats into our apartment. We had to buy expensive electronic traps out of our own pockets to remedy this issue.   Finally, she told us (three mid-20s medical students with long-term GFs) that we were not allowed to have overnight guests unless we paid her $20/night for each guest. Had this been in the lease, I'd kind of get it; but she declared this rule probably 6 months into our lease after she saw an unknown car in our parking spot.  While there's not much to do about these issues now, I wanted to frame what we've been dealing with.  Now to the point of my story: Roommate A sent her a move out notice 30-days before and explicitly listed his new address (we were all going our separate ways) as the address to forward our deposit. I also called her and stated please send the required statement of deductions to my address too, and provided her with my address. 21 days comes and passes and neither I nor Roommate A have gotten anything in the mail. I write a letter to her explaining that per civil code 1950.5, her 21 day period to mail us a copy of the statement of damages has lapsed and that she has forfeited her right to any part of our deposit. I also stated that if she didn't provide us with the full deposit, or if there were any deductions from said deposit, we'd sue her for the deposit, interest, and any punitive damages allowed under the law up to $10,000.  I take this letter and send a certified copy and also place another copy directly in the mailbox. I call her the next day to inform her that we have left a letter in her mailbox and she interrupts me and says that she is out-of-town right now, but earlier she mailed the statement to Person B and it got sent back to her return-to-sender. She then stated that she would be sending the statement again shortly.   Person B did not ever give her his address. Person A gave her his forwarding address in the move-out letter, and I gave her my address over phone.   My roommates and I have concluded that either a) she's lying or b) she somehow person's B old address on file (Person B found this apartment and did all the work to obtain the lease, as Person A and I were both coming out of state). Even so, it makes no sense why it would be return-to-sender.    Does anyone have any advice as to how to proceed? I want her to provide the postmarked envelope to see if it actually exists. If we were to take this to small claims, do we have a pretty open-and-shut case, or am I misinterpreting the law?	No
Hi, Here's a quick timeline of what went down: June: House is listed for sale- we make a cash offer within 3 days. The seller accepts our offer. We go through with various inspections to get through all the contingencies set forth in our contract.   After a few weeks we find out that there's an issue with the title- the seller's husband had died a year ago and they were both still on the title. Apparently they never got his assets taken care of/divided? They go to probate court in CT, and it's listed in the court's case-lookup as about 3 weeks after the initial listing and about 2 weeks after the accepted offer.   According to the seller's attorney, they expected the probate court process to take 4-6 weeks. I don't believe it because I haven't seen a single instance of anyone's probate court matter being that expedited. Moreover, since the probate court has the case listed at the end of June, and it's already almost mid-August, that timeframe isn't correct.  Our contract has it outlined that if by November they don't have the matter resolved, we can walk away from the purchase.   My question is whether or not there's anything legally wrong with what either the seller, or the seller's listing agent did in this matter. It seems a little strange to me that a listing agent would accept selling a house without proper proof of ownership. I understand that sellers can being a sale during probate, but have found nothing regarding what happens if they put it up for sale before going to probate. It seems excessively misleading to do this- as we expected to have a standard closing timeframe, well within weeks and not within 12 to 18 months.  At this point, we'd be lucky to have the probate court ready by next July.  Any ideas/input? Thanks	No

Hello,  I have been renting an apartment through a property management company since April 2016. When I signed my lease I was told I needed renter's insurance and had the option to secure it through a third party or be billed by the property management company monthly for it. I elected to pay the company for the renter's insurance to simplify my bills.  Two days ago I experienced a fire at my apartment caused by an electric barbeque. Whether this barbeque was allowed or not is the matter of another post but I have evidence to support it being allowed. I discovered later, after speaking with the insurance and property management companies, that I do not have a policy with them and that they don't even provide renter's insurance, just liability insurance.  So I feel as if I was extremely misled and was given the impression of paying for a renter‚Äôs insurance policy but was not provided with such. The evidence I have for being misled is the strange wording of the renter‚Äôs liability addendum to my lease and a monthly utility bill with an itemized charge of $15 for ‚ÄúRent Ins‚Äù.   So my question is this: do I have any legal grounds to go after the property management company for the loss of my property due to the fire if it is determined that none of it is covered? I am sorry if I did not provide enough detail but wanted to be concise and avoid rambling. Please let me know what you need from me and I appreciate your help and use of your time. Thank You	No
I first submitted the issue nearly 3 weeks ago. They scheduled someone for repairs within 5 days. I called off work to be home, and no one showed for the first appointment. I called the repair company, and it turns out they told my landlord they don't service my area.  My landlord have me a different company to call and schedule repairs with; they did not call back for another week. When the repair company did contact us, they gave us an hour's notice to call into work and wait for the for 6 hours or the option to wait another week. We couldn't leave work on such short notice, so scheduled it for their next earliest appointment (a week later).  I contacted the landlord and asked for an alternative vendor we could get out earlier. I offered to do the work of contacting and scheduling the appointment if they would provide a list of authorized vendors, and they did not respond. In the meantime, our food has rotted completely, we cannot use the freezer, and our electrical bill has gone up.  Is the landlord liable for anything? It seems like their attempts to repair the deficiency were/are severely delayed by their preference for one repair company.	No
Roommate unexpectedly moved to a new city. Owes 2 months worth of rent.  Hey there! Hopefully this is the right place for this post.   I'm 25 and own a house in Charleston, SC. I live there and always have 2 roommates, whether they are friends or people I've come across on Craigslist. I've been living with one roommate for about 7 months now. I have a signed lease with him. It's basic but it has all the important points covered.   About the beginning of June he mentioned he may have gotten a new job in Miami. He mentioned it's still up in the air and nothing was official yet. I just told him to let me know what happens as soon as he knows and what his options are according to our rental agreement. He had still owed me rent from a previous month because he had a medical emergency so we agreed he would pay me back when he had the money.   Well, then came the middle of July. I was away on a trip when my girlfriend messaged me saying he was taking the job and planned on moving out by the 26th of July. I brought it to his attention what he owed me, including full rent for the month of July, the remaining rent from a previous month and the prorated rent for August or what he owed until I got a new roommate. He agreed and I have texts confirming he knows what he owes me.   Well, he moved out even sooner than he told me. He packed all his stuff while I was gone and moved out without saying anything. He won't respond to any calls, texts, or emails. I have tried having his friends get him to get In touch with me but no luck. He currently owes me a little over $1000.  What are my best options? I can't get in touch or find him and my best lead is he might be in Miami. I really know nothing about taking him to court. I still have my signed contract and texts pretty much proving he agreed to pay me what is owed according to the contract. But how do I bring him to court? Who is responsible for finding him? How do I ensure I get what he rightfully owes me?	No
First off, thank you to anyone who can give us some solid advice here. I've been looking into a lot about our situation, and am having some difficulty finding anything too related about it. I also have not been able to seek low-income legal aid in my city due to my landlady having already been a client of the organization at one point.   My daughter and I rent a room and a RV space from a late sixty years old woman in an old house on a large property. I am mid-thirties and my daughter is almost 6. It‚Äôs been a very hard situation to be living with the landlady to put it mildly, and I really just wanted to last until the end of the growing season for our garden‚Äôs sake. We must obviously now do something, and I don‚Äôt feel comfortable here and I would like to move. But I‚Äôm owed $750 in deposit and last month‚Äôs rent. I‚Äôd like to be brief here, and these are the details, and I‚Äôll include [images of the notes I‚Äôve received from the landlady](http://imgur.com/a/4DEyZ).   Landlady rents the house from another person, but sublets to me and we don‚Äôt have a written lease.  Landlady was paid first, last, and a deposit in cash and I retained an accurate receipt. I have not missed one month‚Äôs payment by check, and I have all receipts.  Landlady has decided she doesn‚Äôt like me, and is now enacting policies to kick us out early, while our rent is already paid for the remainder of this month, and the entirety of next month. She wants to raise rent to $150 a day per her notes, and also charge us $50/day for the RV.  She has denied us the use of electricity and access to the kitchen, which I cover in my Notice and Demand letter.  Currently, she enters my room without permission to turn off fans and electronics in a very hot room (93 degrees) when I‚Äôm not home.  I think I can stop here for now. I am going to include images she‚Äôs posted for me for you to review, and also my Notice and Demand letter which explains things a little more thoroughly. What I really need to know here is can I move out before the month to month agreement was naturally set to expire, and recover my last month rent and deposit from her? After all she‚Äôs demanding we leave, but she‚Äôs obviously not refunding my money either and I unfortunately think I will need to sue her in small claims.	No
Pretty much the title. We tend from a slumlord. The roof is so bad the ceiling leaks in both bedrooms. We've told them about this for about 5 months. There's now mold in our silverware drawer and closet, actual mold on my clothes. I have developed a deep sinus infection, probably because I'm allergic to mold.   We are living here because the house is actually charming despite this and cheap. We are planning on buying a home in a couple months but I don't want this guy to continue treating people this way. He owns many properties and refuses to do almost any maintenance even though he could easily afford to. When we moved in the house was a literal biohazard, we had to pull up 20 year old carpet covered in rat droppings and animal urine, and he still charged a deposit. He simply preys on people and I would like to do something about this.	No
I'm working with a company on an eCommerce site as general help (customer service, manufacturer communication, photos, etc.).   It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out.   Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor.   The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily.   I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.  Any resources or thoughts are greatly helpful!   States involved include CO and DC.	No
"Hi, our business entered into a 3 year, $35/month bottleless water cooler contract with a local provider. Due to dissatisfaction with the service (the machine has needed service several times and not enough water is cooled at any given time), we would like to cancel.

"* Answered an ad on social media that offered paint correction on vehicles.

"Hello from Arkansas!  So back story:  I have warned my neighbors to keep their trash from getting in my yard. Candy wrappers, mostly-eaten corn cobs, and bags. One of those times their bag blew into my yard, and I tried to give it back.  They were belligerent and said ""So? Go throw it in the trash!"" So I dropped the back in their back yard. They called the cops on me, I explained to the officer my situation, that I wanted to handle this like actual property-owning adults. Officer said I was fine, and he went to talk to them and left.  Since then, I still get random wrappers and, today, a corn on the cob (nearly in my pool).  Where would you suggest I go from here? And yes, I am 100% certain it comes from them.

She told us 'we'll prorate the cost to replace the carpet in your old place'   I've spent plenty of time here in legaladvice, so I'm pretty sure they can't make us pay to replace it after such a short period of time. It's not in bad condition, it just needs a good professional cleaning. We're transferring units inside the complex in the next couple weeks and I think it's pretty shitty and wasteful of them to make us pay for perfectly good carpet.	No
All of the following events took place within the last week. I live in a gated student living apartment complex for university kids. From the end of July to August is move out and in. I was moving out of one house to another in the same gated complex. I got permission to move into my new house one day early (Thursday) from one of the ladies who works in our front office (I'm not quite sure her official position but she basically deals with the kids and obviously has some authority, I will call her Sam just to help keep track. Sam gave me permission but said I'd be working around cleaners, I was fine with that. So I move some of my stuff in early, approximately one fourth, not seeing anybody at all. I left a note saying this was my stuff and I had permission to move in early. The next day, Friday, I return and all of my things have been moved into the bathroom and new carpets put in. I didn't end up moving much more stuff Friday because I thought they might've wanted the stuff left there to finish cleaning. Early Saturday, I drove by and saw Mexican cleaning ladies going in and out, I decided to wait to move my stuff so I wouldn't be in their way. When I finally returned Saturday, all of my things had been moved downstairs by the door and several valuables were missing (unopened basketball shoes, gear vr, old phone, my girlfriend's dog bet etc.. basically just things that were obvious you would take to make money on or keep for yourself). I contacted Sam immediately and she came over, apologized and promised to get a hold of the cleaning company. Sunday morning I emailed Sam and told her I was going to file a police report. She showed up at my old house with one of the people that would be moving in (there are several per house, I was the only one in my new house so far though). She told me that basically she had been trying to get a hold of the cleaning company all that time (Saturday-Approximately Noon Sunday) and that they didn't want me to file a report because the cleaning ladies were illegals. I was understanding and she said the guy who they worked for would move some money around and have it to me by Wednesday (today). Come today I email and ask about my money, instead of Sam replying, it is another lady in the office and she tells me to come in to talk to her. I go in and they basically blind side, me tell me to file a report, tell me they won't give me names of employees who were in my apartment that day (I'll have to get them from the company, who they hired independantly), and take me on a legal roundabout basically just trying to cover their butt. I got a bit upset and obviously when I brought up the fact that they knowing hired illegals she ignored it. I'm not sure if I can make an insurance claim because I hadn't switched the address yet, but frankly I don't want to. What is my legal recourse against the apartment complex. I have a friend who was in the room when Sam said they were illegals and he is willing to testify. Getting my money back for my things would be nice, but I would much prefer revenge for how they handled the whole situation and lied to me.	No
Hi folks, basically what the title says: our city (North Carolina in USA) is widening the road behind our neighborhood and claiming eminent domain over several properties, including the majority of my Mom's small back yard. Should she get a lawyer in order to maximize the settlement? Is it worth it? We are getting all these letters from law firms in the mail and not sure what is the truth.  tldr; should my mom get a lawyer to handle the city's eminent domain claim on our back yard?	No
Basically, some guys put trays under my rear wheels and I did 2 donuts in an abandoned parking lot with no cars. Some employees of a nearby store watched and apparently called the cops. I got charged with a disorderly, should I plead guilty or not guilty? It was a car meet with a LOT of other cars, who says the employees could pick out my car in particular? There was only 2-3 witnesses from the store.	No
If you are married and if the wife (not working) has higher income (passive) and the other has very low income (working very hard at a tough job) and a severe medical issue, can the husband claim SSI, or is he dependent on his wife's income and won't qualify because she makes too much money?	No
"So this is all happening right now and I'm looking for advice. My cat was lethargic and seemed pale so I took her to the vet. She needs a blood transfusion and they think she got into rat poison. My landlord came on July 21st to ""spray for insects"" but that's all the note said. I'm currently trying to get ahold of him to see what they sprayed. Would they be liable if it is what harmed my cat. The bill will be 1200+ and as a college student that will definitely hurt my current financial status. Any advice is appreciated thanks."	No
"So I'm not sure what to do as I have never experienced something like this before.  I waited for the walk sign to turn on and went when it said to.  This girl was taking a left turn and ran right into me.  She stopped and asked if I was okay which I replied, ""I think so."" Because I was in shock, I probably didn't do everything right.  She gave me her business card and left.  A couple of witnesses called 911 and stayed with me.  The cop said she did everything right and that it was an accident, although she was at fault.  She said the sun was in her eyes.  My question is, do I have any grounds to get compensation for the anxiety this accident has caused me?  I already have bad anxiety issues and this has exacerbated it.  Also, I had to spend 6 hours in the ER, I am assuming her car insurance is going to foot the bill?  Any suggestions for next steps are greatly appreciated."	No
Husband had been ill for a few weeks and went to see Dr. Did chest X-ray and confirmed pneumonia-prescribed one week round of antibiotics. Husband went back in 2 weeks later for follow up, not any better. Dr did not repeat X-ray, blood work was abnormal so he was sent for ultrasounds of thyroid and kidneys. Doc never followed up on anything - actually he has never called ever. Husband called and made another appt - still feeling ill and coughing up horrible stuff and wanted to go over ultrasound and repeat blood work results. Came into office coughing up foul smelling phlegm. Repeated chest X-ray and was sent to hospital. Received antibiotics in hospital and was told he would have surgery. Was in hospital for 36 hours-no surgery. Dr came in and husband confronted him about his care and how he felt that he had been ignored. Dr admitted husband was patient profiled as a drug user by appearance. (Husband had lost 15 lbs before he saw dr and told him of weight loss, then lost an additional 10 before last appt. He had also lost a tooth in his 20s due to trauma.) Husband was transferred to another hospital on request. Underwent 4 hour surgery for empyema and then sent to icu. We are still in the hospital.  This all happened in Texas.	No
" In the state of New Jersey, is it required to give your tenants 30 days notice if you intend for them to vacate the property? My current lease is up on the 15th of this month but my landlords offered a month extension as long as we were ""flexible"" for showings (which we have been). I haven't signed the one month extension yet because they have now last minute added on additional terms requiring a specific amount of days per week for showings (that I can not promise I can accommodate each week because I have an extremely busy schedule and a sick dog at home) or they are saying we must be out by July 15. Is this illegal? Even if my current lease is up this month and I have yet to sign the 1 month renewal, aren't landlorda required to give a full 30 days notice if they no longer intend to rent to you? I do not want to be forced to sign something that I can not accommodate, but I cannot be homeless either."	No
"Rental tenancy dispute over flood damages caused by faulty toilet that clogged and overflowed.  A close friend of mine was renting a downtown vancouver high rise apartment. She lost her job 6 months ago and had to move out since she couldn't make rent.   The landlord - a property development company that owns the entire building - told her that she could not break the lease. She looked for subtenants and found one. Subtenant was approved by the landlord.  The subtenant didn't know if she wanted to stay longer than a month.  But after the month, she really liked the place and decided to stay till the end of my friend's lease - which was the end of last month. My friend didn't have this extension approved by the landlord. They thought she was only staying for a month. (More on this later)  Two weeks before the lease came to a close, the toilet had clogged and flooded. Apparently, the subtenant had flushed the toilet and went to bed. But the toilet tank flapper valve was stuck open and by perfect fucking coincidence, managed to also to be clogged on the drain end.  Water flowing in. Water not draining out. The toilet bowl floods all night. Subtenant wakes up next morning and discovers the water under her feet. She starts putting down towels and attempts to unclog the toilet drain.   Neighbors notify the landlord at this point. They walk in with their emergency repair crews and start ripping out the flooring.  The property manger takes down a statement from the subtenant. The subtenant apparently told her that toilet was always faulty. That it had overflowed and flooded twice prior to this incident. But in those cases, she was able to plunge the toilet out and fix the issue herself. So she didn't think it was necessary to notify my friend or the actual landlord. She fixed the issues herself.  My friend and I were on a business trip far away at the time. Unfortunately, we couldn't get a hold of the subtenant. She was notoriously hard to get a hold of even before. She's an international student with some difficulty with English. At this point, she saw the condition of the suite with the floors ripped out and went and stayed in a hotel. That weekend she went back home to Taiwan.  Landlord is now claiming that my friend is reponsible for the entire damage since the flood was caused by the negligence of the subtenant. Since the toilet had clogged twice before, she should have notified either my friend or the landlord directly and made sure that there was nothing wrong with it. The damages are some $60k since the water went 4 stories down. I find this extremely hard to believe since the pictures the landlord showed us as proof very clearly shows the water didn't even go 6 feet outside the bathroom door.  My friend does not have any form of rental insurance. She is not in a great financial position to pay for this claim. She's a wreck at the moment. She has been living at home the last 6 months with her parents. Her dad is the guarantor on her lease. And now she's terrified that the landlord would go after her dad and force a sale on their house. They're not financially well off either, with major credit lines already racked up. So she's not in a productive state of mind at the moment. I am helping her out by scheduling meetings with lawyers etc.  So far, we've met 3 lawyers. Each have their own position on this.   Lawyer #1: The least sharp professional I've come across. I genuinely thought she was hungover when she met us. She kept insisting that 11:57 AM - which is when the emergency repair crews went into the apartment was in the middle of the night and not almost noon. Even after I pointed this out, she kept saying that no reasonable person would expect the subtenant to be awake ""so late in the night."" She said we had a 50-50 chance nevertheless. She wasn't clear on what is expected from a reasonable person in this situation. Buying a plunger and fixing the clogs herself is not enough to be not negligent? Or was her responsibility very clearly to notify the landlord about this issue that she already fixed herself?  Lawyer #2: He was super-optimistic. We walked out of there and my friend actually was happy enough to respond to a high-5 I gave her. He said we're going to delegate responsibility for this damage on to the subtenant. Since she is in Taiwan now, the landlord will have a hard time going after her. What we needed to prove was that the landlord understood and knew very well that the subtenant was executing the remainder of the lease and not my friend. Unfortuntely, the landlord explicitly stated in an email that when the walked in to do emergency repairs, they had no idea who the person living there was. Later, she responded by saying that she was the subtenant they had approved 6 months ago. But they had only approved her sublease for 1 month as part of her original plan. True. My friend failed to inform the landlord that the subtenant wanted to extend.  What would it take to delegate responsibility towards the subtenant? How can my friend walk away from this and point the finger at this subtenant? I am not sure if it's that feasible. Moreover, I think this lawyer was trying to make a quick sale and lock in the retainer (We paid him at the end of the consult for the retainer). He was super confident that we were going to win. He later emails us asking for basic things like the tenancy agreement. So not inspiring confidence here.  Lawyer #3: This was probably the only person we met who was telling us the full truth as it is. He straight up said we were going to lose on the negligence part. It will be found that the subtenant was indeed negligent. He suggested we ask the landlord for proof that the damages were actually the amounts they claim they are. I suggested the idea of offloading responsibility on the subtenant. He said that wouldn't go so well simply because the plaintiffs already know she's gone home to Taiwan and it would be very hard to get a hold of her, especially not worth it for this sum of money. Makes perfect sense. Why would they not fight with all they have to make sure the cross-hairs are on my friend and her dad.  This happened today. Confused on who to go with. Never hired lawyers before. L3 is expensive. I felt he was too professional and that he would only stick to the absolute proper and morally correct ways of doing things. L2 seemed like he was a conman trying to convince us that we would win easily. Could it be he can play his charm trick on the judge as well and it would work? He is talking about filing a harassement suit against the landlord's lawyer who is calling my friends dad pretty much every day now. If we are going to be found responsible for this if it goes to trial - maybe the strategy we need to apply would be to roadblock them on every single step of the way and make their lives as hard as possible so they won't even go through the effort?   L1 was garbage.   L2 is super sharp and honestly an extremely effective salesman. He is incredibly effective at producing convincing arguments. And not without supporting evidence and case citations, etc. L2 is young, inexperienced (2 years) and works for a no-name law firm in the middle of nowhere.  L3 is very straightforward and honest. I don't know if he is going to exhaust every possible loophole and sink to the level of doing whatever it takes (as long as it is legal, I dont care about morality or appearing to be an asshole). I didn't get the feeling that he is ready to do this. But he's more experienced in litigation cases. He is also part of a prestigious law firm in the region.  Any obvious things I am missing here? Any obvious choice?  There is a 3rd option. The landlord's lawyer spoke to me over the phone. He wanted to get a hold of my friend's dad. But I picked up and blocked it. He did mention that he wanted to see if there was a way to resolve this issue ""in good faith"" instead of resorting to measures that are irreversible. While I am not on the lease or related to my friend, I do have a substantial savings accumulated up over the years. Maybe just calling this lawyer who wants to talk and having a conversation with him directly would help resolve this quickly? My friend, her mom and her dad are all terrified and simply unable to be productive in any capacity since there is the real threat that their house is going away on top of their already exising problem of criping debt.   They want ~$60k for all sort of damage to the suite and to 10 other suites across 4 stories. Most of that is inflated bullshit, I am convinced. They've never provided an invoice or any sort of evidence of substantial damage in the emails. Would there be a reason why they would have all this evidence and not show it up front when they make their claims? My gut feel tells me if I personally write them a cheque for $15k, I can tell them to fuck off forever. Plausible or am I on crack?  Need some advice. Apologies if this is a giant wall of text."	No
I'm not too sure on the details but someone close to me was raped around 4 years ago with the person that they lived with. From my understanding the rape was never violent, but the attacker was repeatedly told no and to stop during the attack. Also the attacker would regularly use alcohol to the extent where my friend would be drunk to the point of passing out (so unable to consent) repeatedly. Attacker has also been slightly violent during arguments (old scars to prove it). Is there anything that can be done?   Also my friend had filed a police report years ago but nothing came of it, my friend believes the police were too lazy to investigate and she never tried again.	No
I was the victim of a discrimination suit several years ago in the US. Due to the organization being so high profile they were able to shut down the case in summary judgement and spread misinformation (the judges admitted that they didn't understand the nuances of the case, and had very strong ties to organization in question).  I don't understand it 100% but I was told that I would be responsible for some legal fees if I lost. They tried to cut a deal with me by asking me not to appeal the case and then they wouldn't charge it but I appealed anyway. From what I understand the fees are capped to bare basics like filing fees etc so I wouldn't be responsible for something like 200k+ but more like 700-800 dollars. This is a drop in the bucket for them but very costly for me.  I understand that I am legally responsible for these fees, however as a direct result of this case and the emotional trauma I suffered at the hands of this organization, I lost that job, became almost unemployable due to Googling my name shows this failed court case, had to move in with family because I was desperate to have somewhere to live, had to flee that situation because of domestic abuse at the hands of my family, and have been homeless since the beginning of the year. For some reason they are deciding to try to contact me regarding those fees now of all times when I am literally homeless.  This has really reopened my trauma and I think it's deeply inappropriate for them to try to do this at this time especially when they had a part in creating this situation. I understand that legally I promised to pay those fees. I wanted to ask a) can I appeal to a judge about my situation or did I already promise all that time ago? and b) can I tell them that I will go public with this story and create negative PR for them if they decide to move forward?  This whole time I went the legal route instead of the press route because I didn't want to be in the spotlight but I wonder if things would have turned out differently because there would have been pressure for them to be held accountable. If they are choosing to really push to get those fees after all this time when I have hit rock bottom I don't see why I shouldn't reveal what they are doing to the press.  Also please be kind with this post and don't put down and disrespect my situation or my trauma. I understand this is just one side of the story but please take it at face value without judging or victim blaming. I have been through a lot with this and I will report and flag comments that are cruel and unhelpful. Please just answer the question as asked, I do understand that I agreed to this, but is there any leverage I can use with the judge or with the organization itself to pressure them to drop it?	No
N.CA   So I was involved in a collision like two weeks ago and my dumbass admitted fault because it was my first accident.  Talked to my adjuster (I have full coverage) and I told her how it happened and she told me that it was not completely my fault. My insurance already gave me a check for the damage of my car &amp; everything. Yesterday the other driver called me twice but I didn't answer because I was working, and today his insurance called wanting to talk about it and I told them they can talk to my adjuster if they have any questions. I'm freaking of maybe being sued, like the other guy was an Uber so he can claim lost wages, and everything I google leads me to law websites so I'm stressing.	No
Per the lease agreement I am required to cover the costs of all utilities including water/sewage. The way it works is that I get a bill in the mail (optionally an e-statement, opted out), but the payments get sent to the property manager to be deposited in my apartment's account along with rent. The bill is supposed to come from the third party that manages the place.   My first bill supposedly takes a few months, 2-3 months and not a day more according to the property manager, well it never came at all. After the 3rd month I walked into the office and talked to the property manager about why my bill hasn't showed up. She wasn't sure, so I asked if there's even a balance at all, there was. I paid what was due and was assured that this wouldn't happen again. Again after about a month I got no bill, told her still no bill, but she assured me it would come any day.   So 5 months into my lease I get a notice on my door, soaking wet, stating my account will go into collections if I don't pay the balance. Not a single bill telling me this is an issue, despite countless times being reassured that I'd get one. Now I can pay the bill and I'll probably drop the check off tomorrow as it's not due for a few more days. This, along with a few minor issues, have become very annoying.   Is there anything I can do aside from telling them to have my bills sent to me? Clearly that's not working.	No
"Just got a call (well and I ignored about 8 calls over the last couple of days) from some sort of ""processing unit"" saying someone had filed a civil case against me and I should call their lawyers office at 1-844-###-#### to get more information. Is this legit? Should I call them or is this some kind of scam?"	No
If my co-tenant (both on lease) bullied me into agreeing to leave the apartment and I later learned my rights and changed my mind, do I still have to leave?  At first I did not know a tenant could not evict their cotenant. I agreed to leave via text. After new info, I decided not to leave.   My roommate said she already has our agreement in writing (the text messages) so it's too late and I have to leave.  I'm sitting outside the apartment right now. She has changed the locks (all of my stuff is still there). I am waiting for the police. Do not know where to go from here.	No
We purchased a large farm a few months ago.  On this farm is a spring that feeds my house as well as two other homes.  The spring is fully on my property.    I made a mistake and let the spring run dry while I let the hose run overnight watering my garden.  The undereducated neighbors were upset (I don't blame them).  I take blame for running it dry,  and the spring was full again in twelve hours.  However, they are threatening to sue (?) to make sure this doesn't happen again.  I looked up the the courthouse deeds for any easements or other agreements on all three properties, and there is nothing in place.  My question is, in Pennsylvania, what legal rights do they have to this water?  I don't intend to shut off their supplies, but want to know where I stand legally.    Any advice would be very much appreciated!	No
"Background: Was doing an annual EOY budget review when I checked my chase ""emergency fund account"" and saw way less money than expected. Approx. 40 ACH transactions over 7 months time frame(Yes, I know). I call Chase and explain situation. They advise the fraud area is closed and call when they open and to close account at Branch. I do so.  The next day when I speak with Paypal, they confirm that it looks like a scammer / ID thief used my bank info to link to his Paypal account. They explain they don't have a way to send me the funds directly and that the bank just needs to do a ACH reversal and I will get funds back.  Chase stands behind the 60 day Reg E ruling that they say the customer is liable for any unauthorized funds after 60 days. However, they never contacted Paypal, nor will they listen to the situation. Look, I get that I am fortunate enough to have a emergency fund and that I haphazardly didn't review the account for 'a while' but shit I don't go and count my piggy bank every month either, I never use this account it is only a storage of funds. I wouldn't think that someone (with a completely odd name) can willy nillly start a bunch of ACH transactions to Chinese websites out of an quiet account without someone noticing at Chase.   TLDR- Had lots of money missing from Paypal ACH transactions. Bank don't care, and Paypal says they can't do shit."	No
I understand I cannot change his locks, deny him access to bathroom and such.  But do I have to continue providing him other amenities?  1. Cable TV  2. Internet Access (wifi)  3. Access to community pool/gym.  These are things we told him he could have when he moved in and was paying, of course.	No
"Location: Pennsylvania    I accidentally hit and broke one blade of a ceiling fan in my rental apartment months ago.   Now that I'm moving out, I'd like to replace the fan myself rather than pay the exorbitant replacement and labor costs for the landlord to have someone repair/replace the fan.  I've installed ceiling fans before so I'm confident I will be able to do it properly and safely.    However I am wondering about my liability if, hypothetically, the fan were to fall on a future tenant and cause damage or injury.   1. Could I be held personally liable?     2. Would obtaining written consent from the landlord (as per the lease) have an effect on my liability at all?    3. Would my current rental insurance be in any way helpful?   4. If the existing fan setup includes a faulty support beam that I don't alter, and that is found to be the cause of a fall, would I be liable?    5. If I hired someone else to actually perform the install, would that impact my liability? (Assuming no formal contract defining liabilities)     I'm assuming the worst here and may just play it safe by paying the landlord, but it would be helpful to hear some insight. Thank you!     My lease includes the following relevant language:     *Tenant promises: ""Make no major change to the property, such as painting, rebuilding, removing or repairing without the landlords, prior written consent...Alterations become the property of the Landlord, unless the Landlord gives written permission to remove them.""   Landlord remedies: ""These are not the only remedies the Landlord has if the Tenant violates its obligations in the lease. Besides ending this lease and evicting the tenant, the Landlord can sue the Tenant for unpaid rent, for all rents due for the balance of the term of this lease, other damages (including attorneys‚Äô fees, collections costs and other costs, losses or injuries). The Tenant gives up or waives its right to a trial by jury in any lawsuit filed by landlord or Tenant against the other for any reason related to this lease.*"	No
I'm currently on a J1 Grad visa from Ireland and trying to figure out what other options I have for extending my stay other than the H1-B?   Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.	No
I've lived at my rental unit for 3 years, and I am renewing my lease soon. I was wondering if the landlord is required to deep clean our carpets after a certain number of years in the same building? Or is the tenant to have the carpets professionally cleaned at their discretion?   I am curious because our lease states that part of our deposit is to be used for professional carpet cleaning when we leave, but nothing if our off-white carpets get dingy (which they are starting to).   Sorry if this is a stupid question. Thanks!	No
So I was just served with a 72 hour eviction notice today for nonpayment of rent at the apartment that I live at.  The rent most definitely was paid but the management company asserts that it wasn't, even though the bank account that the rent is paid through clearly shows the debit to the account.  The landlord wants me out, but if I'm kicked out I'm not sure what I'm going to do about a place to live (since I paid rent recently I have little money to spare right now) or my personal belongings that apparently need to be removed as well.  What do I do?	No
"I recently moved to Cleveland for 6 months for a training stint with my company. Since my company was paying for my apartment, I had to find a furnished place that included all utilities, cable and internet.   I found a place that had everything I needed and had my company sign the lease. When I moved in I noticed the wifi was very slow. When I brought it up with the landlord, he said it goes up and down because my wifi comes through a booster that relays the wifi from the main house (I'm in an apartment above the garage). A couple weeks later I contacted him again because the internet was still always slow. He then said it was an issue with the ISP's infrastructure and they were paying for best package available so there's nothing they can do.  ""High speed internet"" is specifically listed as something to be provided by the landlord in my lease. The FCC defines high speed internet as 25Mbps and above. When I run speed tests I average 2-3Mbps, never higher than 5Mbps and often below 1Mbps. I don't need 25Mbps but what I'm getting is nowhere near what's expected.  I know this is a ""first world problem"" which is why I'm hesitant to escalate it with him, but it's frustrating not being able to watch netflix, FaceTime my family or watch YouTube without waiting forever for it to load. Even normal webpages takes  much longer than usual to load. It may not be water, heat or electricity, but I think reliable fast internet is fair expectation nowadays, especially when it's agreed upon in the lease.  What are my options?"	No
I live in San Francisco, a city notorious for overreaching tenant rights. Both me and the tenant have signed and agreed to a Stipulation of Judgment whereby I will pay her $20,000 in set payments in exchange she has to leave by 8/1/17. The time is now fast approaching, and I'm thinking she isn't going to leave. She is having difficulty finding a place and frankly, many landlords will likely not accept her. Do I have anything to worry about? Will I be able to evict her should she not leave by the agreed upon date? The signed document states she waives her rights to trial TIA	No
Throwaway to protect privacy. I live in the US.  My roommate and I made a joint account to pay rent and bills. (Please spare me the reminder of how dumb this was). I understand that when it's a joint account, both people have equal and legal rights to take 100% of the money. She has done that.   Now 5 months worth of rent is gone (because landlord wasn't cashing the checks, but of course the money needs to be there for the day that the landlord randomly does).  I have only one more shred of hope in getting that money back -- my roommate used a fake identity to sign up for the account with me. Will the fact that she used a fake identity help me get the funds back through the bank OR do you think it's a heavy enough thing to threaten reporting her for in order to get the money?    I just want the rent. Don't like to play dirty, but I will if it comes to fucking with my livelihood and possible eviction.	No
Purchased a car from a dealership about 4 months ago.  Upon driving it home after parking it, it was leaking fluid (Oil and Windshield fluid). I took pictures and asked them about it, they said it was fine and that ''it heats up and causes it to overflow sometimes''  Today I brought the car to a different dealership to get an oil change, they said that its also leaking powersteering fluid is leaking. Also upon parking it home, the electrical system is cutting out. Headleads / foglights / dashboard / radio+speaker system no longer turn on.   Not sure what to do in this case.	No
Myself and a partner just invested into a home(Rental Property). We have renters coming in next month. We need to start an LLC to assure both of us are covered. We asked our lawyer and his price was $1500. We are thinking that is too high. After buying a home we still are financially stable, but we want to be financially smart. Is there any other options here? should we ask other lawyers? Any suggestions could help!	No
I lived in and worked as an RA in a very old building when I was at university. There's one very uneven staircase and one day I fell from the top of it, hit my head, and fell down the rest of the staircase. I had all of the normal concussions symptoms and was diagnosed with one.   I haven't really been the same since then. I've always had bad headaches on a daily basis but I starts sleeping poorly and had more really bad headaches after this. About a year after this happened I basically had a migraine for three months, had to stop school, and developed an eye droop.   No one could figure out what was the matter, I had scans, blood work, etc. They still couldn't figure it out so said it was likely complications from severe headaches for too long. I was put on pills and Botox injections.   A few months after that I began having neurological problems, confusion, memory problems, my handwriting got really small, and I had to stop university for the second time. Once again nothing could be figured out. I had more MRIs and even a spinal tap and nothing was found. Thy said it may have partially been a complication from one of the headache drugs.   I live in pain everyday. I take pills at breakfast, supper and night, I'm just now attempting to finish the degree o should have over a year ago. My life has changed completely. Even though I'm in Canada the medication still costs a lot. I don't get to be young anymore.  A disability lawyer said I might have a case and I'm not sure if it's something I should pursue.	No
This is in Boston, MA.  I signed a one-year lease at my current apartment on September 1, 2012.  At the end of the year, I asked my landlord how he wanted to renew my lease, and he informed me that unless I specified that I wasn't renewing with two months notice, that he auto-renewed the lease for another year, and that he didn't need me to sign another lease.  Every year since in June I have let him know in writing that I was renewing my lease for another year, and asked if there were any changes to the lease he needed me to sign for.  He'd never respond, and wait until mid-August to let me know that my rent was going up.  So basically the only singed paperwork I have from him expired in 2013, and we had verbal agreements to one year extensions up until now.  He is also notorious for skimming emails and his low reading comprehension skills have led to some interesting confusion in the past.  This year, my girlfriend and I decided to move in together.  Because her lease ended earlier than mine, we singed a lease on a new apartment starting July 1.  However, we decided that I should move in in August to make things a little less hectic.  When I asked my landlord for a reference, I clearly stated that despite my new lease starting a month early, I was planning on staying through the end of my current lease at the end of August, but that I was willing to move a little out earlier if he wanted me to.  I scheduled movers to come on August 5, and emailed my landlord that that was my move-out date, and told him in person when I saw him the next day.  A week later in early June, my landlord listed my apartment on Craigslist as available on August 1.  I sent my landlord two e-mails reminding him that we had agreed I would not be moving out of my apartment until August 5.  He replied saying that he had a tenant lined up for an August 15 move-in.  I confirmed this with him verbally the next day.   I heard nothing else about my move for a month, until today when he emailed me to schedule the move-out inspection because he needed the apartment ready by 7/14.  I haven't even started packing yet as I assumed I had another month and I was helping my girlfriend pack her stuff.  There is no way I can have my stuff out of here in four days.  My question is, if my landlord did in fact sign a lease with a new tenant starting July 15, where does that leave me? I only have a verbal agreement for my current lease.  My landlord has stated that he treats them as one-year extensions, but legally I wouldn't be surprised if it was considered month-to-month. I notified my landlord five times that I was moving out in the beginning of August, three times in writing.  I also have his written agreement that he was leasing the apartment for August 15, and well as a verbal agreement.  I double checked his email, and he spelled out the date as August 15 instead of 8/15.  Can he really give me four days notice that his last communication with me was a typo?	No
"Location: Portland, OR  I'll try to keep this as short as possible.  I moved into an apartment last October which was bought by a new company in February, with, as far as I know, no change to our lease or any of the conditions on the apartment. The first month they came to us asking for $200 or so to resolve a charge -- but they don't know what it's for (I guess the last place kept shitty books?) We talked to them about it and they seemed ready to let it go.  Last month we got a letter from the building saying that we needed to resolve the same charge, which has now ballooned to $400 (?!). We explained AGAIN that we had no idea what it was for but this time they were insistent that we need to pay it. It was left kinda open-ended, with us insisting that they find out what the charge was for before we pay it.  This month they're doing the same thing, but they won't even accept my rent check for the regular amount! They say that we have to pay the full amount of our rend plus the $400 charge that we don't (and they don't) know what is for. Again, we spoke to them and told them they needed to tell us what it was for before we pay, and that we were willing to pay it in full if they could. They even told us they were willing to give us a ""concession"" and we'd only have to pay half. We refused, because it was obvious at that time that they couldn't figure out what the charge is for. We have video of us attempting to give them our rent check, and them refusing it saying that it wasn't for the ""correct amount.""   Is that legal? They don't even know what the charge is for! Am I crazy to feel like I'm being strongarmed into paying for this charge (which is from NOVEMBER and a previous management company)? Is there any thing I can do about this? They won't accept our August rent, and we're worried about late fees accumulating on a ""late payment.""  Thanks in advance."	No
"I handed over a letter to my landlord in October stating that I require and Emotional Support Animal, and I handed them another one in late July. Since then, I have gotten myself a little kitten who lives in my apartment with me.  However, I received an email about two weeks later stating that I have to pay my landlord a $300 fee (a lease change fee, not a pet fee), more documentation stating I need an ESA, a list of shots, and registration BEFORE I get a pet.  I'm stuck because I already got a pet, and they didn't state anything on the lease about a $300 lease change.   tl;dr Can I be evicted for having a pet although I already handed them proper documentation stating I need an ESA? Do I have to pay a ""lease change fee"" if my lease never said anything about that?"	No
I rent an ensuite in the attic of a student house In the UK. It was discovered the shower was leaking, the landlords 'fixed it', however forgot to reattach any of the pipes. This meant that evening when I used it water went through the floor and the carpet soaked up a lot.  A few days ago I was vacuuming the room (I usually use a car vacuum as its smaller and easier to carry up the stairs) with a Dyson and where it's more powerful, the part of carpet that got soaked (I did tell them about the damage) has unraveled in about a 2 cm by 10 cm patch. As it was damaged through vacuuming will I be liable for the damage? Thank you!	No
Hello, I am seeking some legal advice.    Yesterday, I signed a lease with an apartment complex in Huntsville. It is a student apartment that requires you to have a guarantor. When they called me hours later saying they ran out of spots, the guy told me he'd have me put on the first wait list. However, school starts in one month so I went ahead and signed a lease with another apartment and told my guarantor not to sign with the first apartment. They signed with the second one instead, since it had spots available. I called the first apartment today and told them I wanted to cancel my application because there were no spots, gave them my name, and they told me they could cancel it.      Now, however, the first apartment complex sent me an email saying my rent is due on the first. I was confused and called them, asking why because I called to have someone cancel the lease and they said they would. The girl told me that I signed the lease and would have to pay. I told her my guarantor did not sign the lease and I was put on the waitlist, so why would I have to pay the unit? The girl also told me I was not assigned a unit either (probably because I was told there were no female spots available so there probably isn't any left).    So now I'm asking if I'm totally screwed and now have to somehow pay $1200 a month for two leases, with no way how. I'm employed but make nowhere near that amount to cover both rent. Is there anything I can do? The girl told me to call the managers tomorrow and see what I can do. If they tell me I have to pay, is there any way out for me?	No
Hey everyone. I recently got laid off and am seeking full time work. I just received an offer from a local guy to buy cars for him and his business . They said they need vehicles for their business and will supply bank drafts if I negotiate the deal and I receive a commission based on what I negotiate. I just wonder what a dealership and bank will think when I walk in with a lot of cash available and buy high end vehicles.  Is this legal? do dealerships even care?  Thanks you guys!	No
My mother is a 66 year old disabled manic depressant who survives on welfare. She currently lives in a trailer on a trailer park which she pays rent. She's been here for about 15 years and the landlord has refused to fix things in the park for years. However, this newest refusal I consider to be out of line. My mom recently fainted and broke her foot (about 5 days ago) and this has basically immobilized her. A few days prior to her accident she called me telling me that the toilet and bathtub were broken. Basically when she flushes the toilet it backs up somewhere and in the piping and what she flushed begins to come out of the bathtubs drain. The bathtub itself doesn't want to properly drain. Her and her neighbor discovered a piece of land outside of her home that seemed to be leaking and spewing up sewer waste. They both called the landlord on multiple occasions leaving voicemails that he never returned. She finally got through to the landlord yesterday and told him what was happening. He told her that he'll get to it and she described her injury. Once she told him this he replied by telling her to go to the bathrooms at supermarkets. She replied by telling him again about her broken foot, how she's been using a portable toilet in her living room, and that there was nowhere for her to dispose of the waste. His follow up to her response was to take the portable toilet outside and throw the waste into the vacant lot next to her trailer. My mother hasn't been able to use her toilet in over a week and has resorted to going to the bathroom in bags/pots. She hasn't taken a proper shower or bath in over a week.  She is currently refusing to drink water and eat too much food because it makes her have to go to the bathroom. Is there anything that can be done here?	No

I live in NYS.  My car was stolen while I was at work an involved in an accident before I could report it stolen. The their hit another car and fled on foot.   My question is, am I liable even though I wasn't driving? The insurance company is telling me that I'd have to prove that I didn't give my keys to someone. It's a keyless ignition car, so there was no physical evidence of theft when we recovered it (there wouldn't be, they essentially hacked a computer).  But this doesn't sound right to me, if I'm the defendant in a civil suit, can't I use he negative defense of superseding cause, since I wasn't driving the car? How can you prove a negative? (That I didn't give my keys to someone)  Thanks for taking the time to read and respond!	No
I've lived in 3 different apartments with the same 3 roommates (4 of us total) over our last few years of college. Since we are students, each of our parents cosign and supply the money for rent and the initial security deposit. The last two places did not have deposits, only move-in fees. We all put in for the security deposit equal to one month's rent.  One roommate, we'll call him Dan, is the one who writes all the checks because his parents have the most capacity to pay the sum of money on a monthly basis. On top of that, none of us own personal banking checks besides him. He's also kind of a neat-freak and by far does the most chores to improve the state of the house because the rest of us are pretty messy and careless about it.  Our lease ended and we all moved out recently, and yesterday I asked Dan if he had received the deposit money, and he wrote back to me saying that I'm not getting my portion of the deposit because I didn't put any effort into keeping the apartment clean while we lived there or before the time we moved out. Dan says he's the only one out of all of us who tried to keep and leave the apartment in a clean state, therefore is withholding my portion and a majority of the other two roommates' security deposits. While he's kinda right, I still feel like because our name is on the lease papers then we should at least get some of our deposit back, right? Is there any action I can take to get my money back?	No
"I ordered a product online about three weeks ago, with an estimated delivery date of 5 business days. That date came and went, but what was really weird is that the tracking information never updated past ""label created"". So I called the company and asked what was going on, and eventually had myself escalated. They tell me that an internal investigation, typically taking 2-3 business days, will be needed. Well, we're at 9 business days now, with no developments.  The specialist has been sending me an email every other day, but they've just been saying that there have been no updates or new developments. Since the product was never delivered, and I asked to cancel my order outright. They said that no cancellations or attempts at a second shipment can be made until this investigation is complete.  Now, I know that I'm not there yet, but I would like to know how long the company can continue to stall without delivering the product? I mean, there has to eventually be a line where it crosses into theft territory, as I have given them money for goods that have not been delivered.   If it's at all relevant, the product is a laptop, the value is $1600, and my biggest frustration is that I'm a student, without the funds to find a replacement for something that is beginning to impact my studies.   Any input is appreciated."	No
"So my apartment complex is power washing all the buildings. They left a note saying they would start on July 1st and that everyone needed to move their cars because the spray could damage them (it smells like they use bleach). Well, we're almost at the end of the month and they just did my building. The note said once they start our building we are not allowed to leave until they are finished since they do the stairs as well.   The key point of this note was that they said that they will not be accountable for any damage they cause by powerwashing the building. There is no rhyme or reason to the order they do the buildings in (the one after mine got done a few days ago) and like I said, I can't go out to move my car since they already started. If they had gone in order and done one a day, they would have done mine on the 12th.   Since bleach damages cars, I was wondering if they could be held responsible for damaging my car since they didn't let anyone know when they would do each building? Most of the buildings are far away enough I don't have to worry about it reaching my car, just my building. I just didn't know if a note stating ""We won't be held liable"" has any actual legal power or if they're just saying that to scare off college students from going after them?  I don't know if my car will have any damage, it's just a question about if the landlord can state that."	No
Is this illegal if it's ongoing? For example, I'll be up after the quiet hours so maybe 2 am getting a glass of water and I'll accidentally drop something on the floor. Then my neighbour from upstairs will come down and start knocking.  I'm in Vancouver, BC	No
Hello all. My girlfriend and I recently rented an apartment in Atlanta, GA and have been living in it for the last 8 days. The apartment has gone from great to terrible in that short amount of time. I will list out the issues we have faced since our move in and will provide more detail if needed.  1. Potential gas leak. I informed the customer service manager of a potential gas leak in my apartment as both my gf and I smelt a strange gas-ish odor when using both the gas stove and gas-heated water. I reported this issue to them around noon of yesterday, but no maintenance personnel were sent out to investigate despite this being a potential serious issue. Concerned for our safety, I contacted the local fire department who sent out a fire unit to investigate my apartment. They found no gas leaks, but did uncover some other serious issues that I will list below.  2. Indoor AC/Water heating unit. When the fire department came to investigate the potential leak, they removed a locked maintenance door inside of my apartment. The maintenance room was locked and only the maintenance staff has the ability to look inside. After removing the door, the fire lieutenant informed me that the unit was incredibly old and that it has several code violations such as exposed wiring, no cover over the wiring, and cut wires which are just hanging out. Not to mention, the unit looks to be at least 20 years old and has never been maintained- it is truly disgusting with trash, dirt, and bugs everywhere and leads me into some of my next concerns. When the fire unit was here, they cut power to the unit and also turned the gas off to the stove and hot water as it seems they deemed it a large enough safety risk.   3. BUGS. Since we have moved in, we have seen 5 nymph cockroaches in our apartment. I say nymph because these roaches are small as if there is a nest in the area. We also photographed one of them and have identified it as a nymph German cockroach, which, from what I've read on the internet regarding infestations, basically means this complex is overrun and there is very little that can be done to eliminate the issue. I have no doubt that many of the bugs come from the maintenance room as it is truly dirty in every sense of the word. There are also cracks in the wall behind the stove which could also be an easy entrance for bugs.  4. Black mold. When the fire department came, they moved the stove to test for gas leaks. No gas leaks were found, but there appears to be black mold on the wall.   5. Bathroom faucet leak. The bathroom faucet is leaking from the wall where the faucet is attached. I have no doubt there is water damage behind the tub.  On move-in day, none of these issues were identified. We tested the stove and water and did not smell gas, we did not look in the maintenance door as it was locked and seems to always be locked unless a maintenance personnel comes to open it, we saw no bugs as they likely had no reason to come out as the apartment was vacant with no major food sources, we could not look behind the stove because it was nearly impossible to move (3 firemen were needed to move it from the wall), and the bathroom faucet did not seem to leak (at least not noticeably).  At this point, I believe the apartment is beyond repair. Management is very unresponsive here. There is always a line at the customer service office with people complaining (yesterday it seemed everyone was going on about their AC not working), so it's no doubt maintenance staff are overwhelmed, but that doesn't excuse the lack of concern for issues as serious as these.  Maintenance staff did finally get around to our unit this morning around 9 AM and told me that they will try to have the entire indoor AC/water heating unit replace, but that it will take at least a week for it to arrive. In the mean time, he flipped the power and gas back on to the stove and water heater and told me that it was safe to use- this completely contradicts the fire department as they obviously deemed it serious enough to turn off. He also told me that he will try to address the mold, however, I don't understand how he could address it without tearing the entire kitchen apart.  My girlfriend and I think it's best that we terminate the lease early and get out before anything else major happens. We have submitted a written termination request, but the management is trying to charge us outrageous fees for early termination. In the lease it seems there is no grace period if we are unsatisfied with the unit, and it seems there is a 60 day notice needed for the early termination which we will have to pay rent for the entire 60 days and then also pay another months rent as liquidated damages for early termination. The customer service manager yesterday quoted me around $2600 in total for the early termination which is absolutely insane.  I understand that we signed the lease and I did read through it before hand of course, but we had no idea that the apartment was in this condition and I don't believe some of our issues could have been identified without living in the complex. At this point, we are willing to write it off as a learning experience, but what I need to know is if there are any additional steps we can take to possibly get some of the early termination cost waved as many of these issues seem serious?   Is there anyone I can contact to help with a situation like this? I've contacted the fire department and am going to go get a copy of the report today and I've also contacted the local inspectors and am trying to get someone out here to confirm the code violations found by the fire department.  At this point my girlfriend and I are miserable and only want this nightmare to be over. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.	No
Hi there,  I'm going to be moving in with my SO, into a house that he owns, and I will be paying him rent. We live in Ontario. What are the laws like regarding cohabitation and how would things work if we get married? Does the money I put in for rent give me some sort of equity in the house? Also is there any kind of standard document that we could use for a rental agreement? Do we need to have a lawyer look over anything? Thanks in advance :)     Apologies if this has been posted before (please link if so) but searching on mobile is a nightmare!	No
Hi All,  We just moved and have a new landlord. Everything has been great so far - apartment is well kept and landlord is very responsive.  The lease was a general lease (Boston) and had only 1 stipulation, the fireplace isn't to be used.  Now he is emailing me asking me not to mount any TVs to the wall.  My issue is that I am a home theater buff, and have a TV and speakers I plan to mount. Had I known this, we would not have rented the unit.  I e-mailed him back saying The previous tenants had two TVs mounted, and that I hope to be able to do the same and would even hire professional, bonded installers to come if needed.  No reply yet, but I am wondering if I can just do it. I would rather not, and have a good relationship with my landlord. He is in CA and never visits. I am just wondering so I know my options.   I want to stay on good terms but I was planning to mention that this isn't stated in the lease if he replies saying no again.  Thanks	No
"Hey, everyone. I'm in Spain but I'm happy to accept general legal advice that doesn't necessarily pertain to Spain because there was never a contract or any legal documents so...  Okay so in February I moved into a shared flat and told them I'd stay until the end of May. The head roommate who had the apartment in his name, let's call him Juan, told me I'd owe 120 euros a month plus bills which would ""be about 20 euros a month."" That was it. There were no contracts, documents, or anything at all. I just handed him cash each month when he told me how much bills were.  *Incidentally I ended up moving in with my boyfriend at his place like 3 weeks after renting my flat, so I was literally never there. I spent a total of maybe 10 nights there in the 3 months I rented, and they even had some other person renting my room by the end of May before I officially moved out. That doesn't really change anything, but it's relevant I guess.*   So, on May 31st when I went to pay my last rent payment, Juan told me ""there will be some bills coming in a few weeks for the electricity and whatnot. I will let you know""  I was a bit confused and thrown off because previously, I'd always paid the bills at the end of each month. Well, I didn't think much of it, paid him my money, and left.  I didn't hear anything from him, not a word, until July 10th, a month and a half later.  Out of the blue he texts me and says ""the water bill arrived for May  - June 1. You owe 10.50. Can you deposit it in my bank account? There will also be another bill coming for the electricity, but I don't have it yet. There could be another one after that, too. I will let you know.""  I told him ""can I just pay you in cash like we always did?"" and he said ""sure but can you do it today? I'm leaving tomorrow""  I'm angry now: you give me a 1-day limit on a random bill over a month later? So I tell him ""fine, I'll deposit it in your account"" and he says okay.   Well, I'm busy. I have two jobs. I didn't have time to run to the bank. I got another text from him yesterday ""hello, can you please deposit the money today or tomorrow"" and I told him I'd go as soon as I could. Then today I got ANOTHER text message, ""Hello, can you deposit that money today?""  I'm kind of raging at this point. I'm beyond annoyed. PLUS, this is only the first of potentially 2 more bills that will arrive at random dates. So he's potentially going to be harassing me all summer.  I'm angry because:  1. he's charging me bills nearly two months after moving out for water that I didn't even use *(I DO understand that technically I agreed to split the water bill with the other roommates and technically I owe this money, I'm just pointing out how petty it is to actually charge me the 10 bucks)* AND there was someone else renting my room for at least the last week of May.  2. Instead of waiting until he has all of the bills and charging me once, he's charging me 3 times at random intervals  3. He's constantly harassing me to drop what I'm doing and pay the money right now, even though he's randomly texting me a month and a half after moving out, and during the work week.    On top of all that, I haven't even SEEN any of these bills. No pictures or proof. He's just randomly texting ""hey btw u totes owe 10 bucks k pls pay rite now""  So what are my rights? What do I do? I don't want to be annoyed by this clown all summer."	No
"So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit. So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help.."	No
We were hoping to ask anyone with good knowledge on US immigration law on how we should proceed as a couple? I [20F] was born in the USA [MO] and have a passport, birth certificate and a SSN but moved when I was just a baby. I do not have family in the USA and don't have established residency in any state.   My partner [23M] was born in the UK and we now want to eventually move to the USA. However, I feel like I'm currently too young to get married and will probably be aiming to get married in 2-4 years.  I will be moving home to Hong Kong this year whilst he will be staying in the UK to finish the final year in his degree.    1) My partner wants to know how he can live and work in the USA legally without a marriage green card/visa. We are looking into him getting a masters in the USA as we know some masters courses allow their graduates to stay in the country to find work for the next 3 years but we know that chances of scholarships are slim.    2) I have read about how it is easier to get the marriage green card if he was already in the states at the time. Would him not being in the USA when applying for the green card/visa be a detriment?   3) Is it possible to get a marriage visa/green card if we got married outside of the USA and **both** parties are not present in the USA at the time of the application and will this affect his ability to enter the country?    4) My partner also wants to know if it's possible for him to eventually get a dual citizenship between UK/USA?   We have several other options ranging from him getting a masters in the USA, getting a masters in Hong Kong where grants and scholarships are much easier to get (and he can live with me), or him working in the UK for a few years whilst we get our act together. We are just very confused as to how the whole process of immigration works and the requirements for it.   TLDR - Boy and girl want to move to America to live the American dream. Girl is American by birth but doesn't live there and boy is from UK. How this work?	No
I am in Montana. A rental car driven by a 19yo pulled out in front of me while I had the right of way and I collided with the vehicle.  The 19yo did not have personal car insurance. The vehicle was rented by (I'm assuming relation based on name and the fact that the 19yo couldn't rent the vehicle without full coverage insurance) the father who opted out of the rental company's insurance.  I do not know if the father has personal insurance. I heard from a reputable source that in Montana the rental agency is still required to carry liability insurance on their vehicles.  Should that insurance cover the accident even though the vehicle wasn't being driven by the renter?  Also, if the father has personal insurance will that cover the vehicle he rented even though it was driven by the son?	No
Our original move in date was August 4. We signed a lease for this. The lease was then voided and we resigned the most current lease to move in on August 1. We went in this morning to get our keys and discussed the money that was due. We wrote them a check for the money due and started moving in. Now they are emailing us and saying that what they accidentally charged us was the prorated rate as if we moved in on August 4, and that we owe them a little over $100 to cover August 1 to August 4. Are we responsible for their accounting error? Thanks!	No
I cut my finger good enough with a workplace appliance to have to go to an urgent Care facility. Got a tetanus shot and some stitches. Workers comp seems to be the way to go, but I am fairly confident I will test positive for marijuana if drug tested. Does this have potential to impact my workers comp? Seems completely unrelated...	No
I help run the treasury of a small club in Michigan. Someone is sending fraudulent emails, claiming to be the club president, and using the presidents name and current vacation location. I've already talked to the president, and we need to get this taken care of. Who exactly do we call about this? Aside from ignoring it, what can we do? They appear to be using our clubs own email.	No
So I was driving home from my weekly UA and classes as required after last DUI (wouldnt have even been in that town if not for these obligations). Sober all day, and days prior to that.  For some reason I seizured, passed out, etc behind the wheel not 10 minutes after meeting my PO.  Single vehicle accident, hit a curb.  Eneded up goin to the hospital to get checked since I was frightened I may have had a seizure or something Consented that I'd do the state test via blood and UE.  Nothing to hide.  All came back clean for everything.  I wasnt worried, just thought I'd get driving under suspension...Well this cop finds an empty package of Kratom which was not consumed anytime prior to the accident. He writes me a DUi (which I've had a few guilties of but learned my leason)...With this additional charge I could face substantial jail time even though I was not in anyway intoxicated.  I was never given sobriety tests, read rights etc.  This cop may have just ruined my life right as was rebuilding it, so pissed!  Any advice?	No
"So I moved into this apartment complex in Anaheim, CA in September and have been parking my car inside since then. This morning, my car was towed because the permit I received from the office was deemed ""invalid"". When I went to speak to the property manager he looked in his system and couldn't find anything about my car being registered to park there (or my roommates for that matter) and refused to believe that I've been parking there since I moved in. He even accused me of falsifying a parking permit. He then refused to have my car released from the towing company and told me there was nothing he could do. The very same day I moved in one of the other property managers made copies of my registration and drivers license and gave us the permits himself. But now since they can't find any proof about it, I get screwed over. What can I do to have them repay me for the tow? It's not fair for me to have to pay for their incompetence."	No
I recently moved and turns out my new upstairs neighbors are running a daycare out of their apartment.  Not only is the noise unbearable, but there are days my apartment leaks like a sieve due to the stopped up/overworked plumbing.  Complaining to the manager is useless since her child attends this daycare, which is extra annoying since if my upstairs neighbor's lease is anything like mine she's definitely in violation of it by running a daycare.  Do I have any grounds to break my lease without penalty or at least be transferred to a different unit it the complex at their cost?  If not, what other legal options are available?	No
Not sure if this is the right thread, off sick due to a very personal issue because of stress (no I'm not bluffing it's real), I originally wanted to go back to work however my GP advised me not to. Now I am undertaking therapy and don't think I am ready for work but knowing the nature of my company they will do everything to get me back. What rights do I have? Can a OH Nurse overturn the sick note?	No
I've been seeing several doctors lately and for privacy reasons, I'd rather my employer didn't know about every time I see a doctor.  Can my employer see the times or dates i saw a doctor? What information would they have access to regarding my health or doctor's visits?    Is the simple fact that I visited a doctor considered private under HIPPA? Thanks!	No
Hi,  I have an issue, in Alberta, I believe we have two acts that govern living spaces.   The space that I am asking question about was intended to be leased under the In-Keepers Act, but I believe that the lease was written in error and may be covered under the Residential Tenancy Act.  My mom's english isn't good, and she bought a property in Alberta that was intended to be rented by room to students and/or working professionals in that area.  The basement is rented by suite, but main floor is rented by room.   The issue is that the tenant filled out the standard lease template and filled out the entire address rather than filling it out with the address plus indicating the room it is renting.   This tenant keeps on referring to the residential tenancy act stating we do not have right to enter the property without 24 hour notice, etc. hence, it is quite difficult for the landlord to do its job and rent out other rooms, or look at the common shared areas.   So the application for rent stated it intends to rent one room, but the lease template states that it is renting the entire address. That's the mistake is my mom signed the lease agreement with the entire address rather than stating room #1.   In my opinion, the lease is defective, because the price paid for the entire house doesn't make any sense. This tenant is paying $600 for the entire house, but on rentfaster or kijiji, etc, renting the entire house is at least $2,400, etc.  And all other leases  signed in that property shows address + room 1, 2, etc.   My mom had verbal conversation with this tenant and it is my understanding everything was agreed for one room. But this tenant is treating it like she's renting the entire house, and uses everything.   We are currently having a family member moving in there, as we have a spare room for them to use.   Everytime we try to show the empty room for rent, she would complain about us not giving her a 24 hr notice, and she's picky she wants it to be a paper taped on back door notice, she won't accept emails, text messages, etc.   She also blames everytime we show the property, there are things missing, or she lost $, or something breaks, and she also claimed my dad kicked her dog, discriminate against women, harassed her, etc. Also complaining that she isn't getting her peace and enjoyment due to these things, and asked for free rent or reduced rent.   If we can goto court and correct the lease and help it fall under inkeepers act, i believe we can kick her out without any notice.   Finally, this lady is running for an office space, which is rediculous, as I thought these people should maintain a certain level of reputation.  Sorry, lastly, she knows we messed up on the lease, and said she would correct it once she cools down. But afterwards, she will not correct the lease indicating she's only renting 1 room there.  What are the best steps to prove to the court that she's only renting one room?   Thank you!	No
We left the apartment for our landlord to do a showing, but we have a camera facing inwards that we use to monitor our pets. When we checked the camera, we were greeted with quite a surprise.  Our landlord (seemingly out of nowhere) began making out with the showee.  This lasted for a couple minutes before they continued to tour and talk about the apartment. From their conversation, it appears as if they knew eachother and that perhaps this was prearranged. We went well out of our way to have our animals out of the apartment and accommodate the showing, and this feels like a violation of our trust.  Prior to this we have agreed to an early move out date, and are paying a fee of one months' rent to do so. We have tried to be accommodating with this and other showing requests because we know that this could be an inconvenience.  What sort of laws apply around this sort of behavior? We feel violated by this, and are wondering what, if any, our options are. We also have noted from his social media profiles that he is married to someone else with children.  We're not looking to be vindictive or be homewreckers or anything, we just would like to know if we have any recourse here.	No
"There's a lot of craziness going on in regards to housing in Portland right now. Particularly with building companies offering large cash sums to home owners with large lots, demolishing the existing home, subdividing the lot, and then building smaller houses on them.   My parents' neighborhood wanted to prevent this from happening (most of the homes sit on large lots and the neighborhood has a very distinctive look they want to ""preserve"" by preventing these new construction projects). So one woman spear headed a campaign to get the area designated as a historic neighborhood (I don't know how or why this prevents the whole subdividing thing so I can't provide much more info than this). My parent's and their next-door neighbors were both strongly against this idea and refused to sign some sort of petition that was going to be presented to whoever makes the decision about historic neighborhoods.  The designation attempt failed, and the woman who spearheaded the campaign places a lot of blame on my parents and their refusal to sign the petition. There is now a lot of bad blood between them.  My parents and the next-door neighbors were actually approached a few years back by the historical society about possibly placing their homes on the registry. They turned the opportunity down because being placed on the historic registry creates a lot of red tape should you ever want to remodel, or even just plant trees in your front yard, down the line. This is the main reason why they were against asking for a historic neighbourhood designation.  This same woman is now trying to create an HOA in order to try and prevent the whole subdividing issue.   Again, my parents and their next-door neighbors want no part of it. They've both lived in their homes for decades, are about to retire, and don't have any complaints about the types of things HOA's usually seek to fix. They don't want to have to deal with the headache of an HOA. The rest of the neighborhood supports the idea, though.  They recently received an email from the woman spearheading the idea that according to the lawyer the attempted HOA has hired, should the HOA actually be created, my parents will be forced to participate in it. They're obviously upset by this.  This doesn't seem right to all of us. I would think that their ability to not join would be ""grandfathered in"" for lack of a better word since they purchased their home long before the HOA was created.   They've been warned that should they try and get around the HOA situation by not following the rules they create or by not paying dues, a lien will be placed on their home.  Long story short- would they legally have to pay dues and follow all the rules the HOA creates or is this woman so full of shit that her eyes might as well be brown?"	No
I recently was signed power of attorney to sell a house that my grandmother left to her remaining children in her will. The arrangement was for the house to be sold immediately and the money divided between the three remaining sisters. After what has been almost a year, my aunt who was left with power of attorney has done nothing to settle the issue by carrying out my grandmothers will. After pleading with my aunt she agreed to sign over power of attorney so i can sell the house. Of the three remaining children who are entitled to a piece of what the house sells for one does not want the house to be sold. This being the case she has gone to the property broken the locks on the house and her daughter moved in to claim the house for her own. A week before power of attorney was signed over to me i went to the house with a officer and requested that she leave. The officers told me there was nothing that i could do unless i had power over the decisions to be made in selling the house. I was told to leave and escorted off premises. Now that i have power of attorney and spoken to a lawyer. I have been told that i would need to give two weeks notice of eviction and bring along the proper paper work. I have the deed, will, and Power of attorney over all decisions made from this point forward. I dont know what my next steps should be? I Live in San Antonio Texas and am 21 years old and not well versed on these issues. My main concern is that they destroy the house in the time they have to evict. The main reasoned iam worried about it is because they are known to pour quick cement down the drains and ruin the utilities before they move out. I need to write a eviction notice but dont know were to start. If anyone could give me some advice i would greatly appreciate it.	No
"I live in Ohio and last year used a vacation rental site to book a few days at a house in Mexico. A few days before my trip, the property owner called to say there may be some work happening at the home I rented and that he'd need to put me up at a much larger home nearby. The house was larger but most of the amenities were non-existent or non-functional - including locks on the exterior doors.  When I arrived back, I spoke with the vacation rental site and they said to file a dispute through my credit card as I had been subject to a ""bait and switch"". I did so and the credit card company quickly refunded my money.  Today I was served with a summons to appear in a small claims court in San Francisco - apparently where the owner of the property lives. I've never been to San Francisco and the rental was in Mexico. The claim says that I falsified receipts with the credit card company in order to win my dispute.  A little bit of sleuthing leads me to believe that I can write a letter to the court explaining that because I don't live in the county (or the state for that matter) that they'll be able to just drop the case. **Should I write a letter explaining why the venue is wrong?**   I didn't provide any receipts at all to the credit card company. I simply explained what I experienced and they said I was right to dispute and that the merchant didn't respond to their inquiry with him so they took the money back. **Is there anything else I should be doing?**  Thanks!"	No
Hi Everyone,  I'm looking for some advice because I am a first time home buyer and don't fully understand if I have any chance getting some help from the seller. We purchased a home six months ago and have made many repairs and upgrades based on the feedback from the home inspection. However, the home inspection did not uncover a few major issues.   Pool- large in ground pool in the back yard. We were unable to get the pool inspected before closing because it was covered for winter. We found out that the pool was not properly winterized when we attempted to open it and had to pay about $1500 for a new motor and pump. We were able to use the pool for a month before we started leaking water. Cost of new liner and new inground stairs lowest quote we received was $6250.   Roof- leaking from around a sewer gas outlet pipe caused wood rot in a section of the roof. From the inside of the attic we can see shingles in the area. This wasn't caught on the home inspection because the damage was behind a plastic sheet vent stapled to the inside of the roof. The skylight is also leaking due to flashing issues. Quoted estimate for repair $2600.   As I mentioned, these were not caught during the home inspection and the seller did not mention them on the seller disclosure. The seller had not been living in the house for the past 8 years; rented it to a family member.   Is there any possibility that we can work with the seller to help with these repairs or are we on our own? I was thinking about sending them an email explaining this but I am hesitant that I could say something that could ruin our chances in court (if that's even an option).  Thank you in advance!	No
Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if any more information is needed.  Thanks in advance!	No
Hi all,   I turned 26 this year and got booted from my family's health insurance plan, was making almost no money as a contractor, so I went on Pennsylvania's public health benefits. Two months ago, I got a job offer and I needed to both start right away and move to where the job was, and in the personal tornado of making that happen, I just remembered that I never cancelled my public benefits.   The moment I took the job, I left the income bracket in which I'd been eligible to receive benefits. My health insurance with this new job didn't kick in until one month into it, so I've technically only had 'double health insurance' for one month. The only costs that my benefits have been covering in this overlap period are the monthly rental payments on a medical device I need - it's a cost that I could hypothetically reimburse the state for out of pocket.   What kind of trouble am I in? Obviously, I'd like to take action first thing Monday morning when their phone lines open up and report my mistake, but am I looking at any potential legal issues here?	No
More specifically, does a law enforcement officer have the authority to judge a lighter to be drug paraphernalia in and of itself?	No
Looking for legal advice on the below situation. My neighbor had a tree (about 50 ft tall) in their property that was adjacent to my garden and separated by a fence. Today they hired a landscape who cut all the branches of the tree while i was at work. A large number of the branches fell into my garden, destroying a good part of my garden and leaving a large amount of debris in my garden.  What recourse do i have available?  Am i entitled to compensation? Who would be responsible for this, my neighbor or the landscaper?  Thanks.	No
Asking for a friend who was contracted to work until September, and was just given a week's notice they no longer have the money to keep her position. What is the minimum notice required? I only know the state/city just passed the nation's first protections for freelancers, but no idea what is now legal. Can they cancel on such a short notice?	No
"Howdy /r/legaladvice.   My wife and I recently bought a house and are looking to end our 2 year lease early. It's scheduled to be up April of next year and we anticipate being fully ""moved over"" by November.   The problem? Our landlord has no desire to work with us. I'm fully prepared to pay out the remainder if needed, but I'm really trying to find a middle ground. Our lease doesn't have any verbiage regarding terminating early.   He's stated the only way he'll let us out is if he's able to sell the house. No timeline. So if he lists it high we could end up in April 2018 anyway. He said he has no desire to re-rent the house after I offered to help find another tenant and might even leave it vacant for a bit after we leave.   From my basic understanding: That's malarkey. He has to at least ""try"".   What are my options here? What's the best way to approach it?  The situation has my wife furious because he originally tried to sell the place one month in to the 2 year lease (it fell through) and was only going to give us 2 times our security deposit for the ""inconvenience""."	No
In early July, I established a subletter for my room in the apartment I was living in before moving to a different state. He applied through the leasing agency and was put on the lease, which ends in September.   Just yesterday, I received pictures from him showing a burn hole in the carpet in my room about the size of a fist. He claimed that he forgot to tell me about the burn, but that it was there before he moved in. I know that the burn was not there before leaving the apartment. My roommates who I have contacted about it agree that it was not there when I moved out. I also have a picture taken before moving out that doesn't show the burn mark.   My question is about what options I have if I confront the subletter about his lie and he refuses to pay for the damages. The security deposit was paid by me at the start of the lease. When I contacted my rental company, they said this was likely a situation that I would have to work out with my subletter. The only sort of leverage I can think of is threatening to take him to small claims court with the evidence I have. Are there any other routes I should consider?  Thanks for reading!	No
I am a college student living in Pittsburgh for the summer.  My lease for the school year starts on August 1st, but I have been here for two months on a short lease, working for the summer.  When I found the place, I signed the lease (the landlord had told the current tenant that he could feel free to find other people to sign the lease to make the cost cheaper if he wanted), and then a week or so later, the landlord contacted me asking for me to fill out a rental application, as well as submit $25 for a background check.  I was confused as to why this was necessary, and asked him why I needed to pay more money if I'd already signed the lease.  He responded a little while later, in an email I didn't even see until just now, telling me this:   &gt;Having a rental application on file is a matter of protocol for anyone living in our apartments, and it is mandatory that i raun [sic] a background and credit check in case you are wanted in any of the fifty states or on some kind of terrorr [sic] watch list or something.  You have signed Manuael's [sic] lease, but as owner I hold the primary lease to the place, and if you have anything in your background untoward or a potential threat, I am obliged to know that.  &gt;As for a complaint about the processing cost, you are summer subletting a semi-furnished place for about $350-400 that this fall will rent for $750, so I would hope you would appreciate that rather than making such a strident complaint about a VERY minor sum.  We do our best to provide quality housing, but at the same time there are rules Ihave [sic] to follow.  The guy is, as you might have been able to tell, a bit of a condescending asshole.  Earlier in the month, we had our ceiling falling apart due to rain, and he couldn't be bothered to care about the fact that plaster was falling down in our living room, and wouldn't get it fixed for the longest time, but that's a whole separate matter entirely.  **Ultimately, my question is:**  Am I under any sort of legal obligation to fill out a rental application and pay for a background check if I have already signed the lease and will be moving out in nine days? $25 is not a lot of money at all, but at this point, with how our landlord has treated us during the past month and a half, I'd really prefer not to pay anything extra if I don't have to.  This was a bit of a long-winded post for such a simple question, but if anyone knows the PA laws about this, I'd appreciate an answer. Thanks!	No
I'm moving from GA to CA in August, and recently applied for a townhouse with my partner with a rental company in CA. I received a phone call from the rental agency today saying that I had a large balance in collections owed to an apartment complex I formerly lived at from November 1st, 2014 to January 1st, 2016 and that they wouldn't rent to me because of the outstanding balance reported on my credit report.  This came as a surprise to me considering I had not received any form of contact (phone call, email, physical mail) from the complex or the collection agency in the 18 months since my lease ended. I also noticed that the claim is only shown on two of my three credit reports.  A bit of backstory about my history with the complex: the complex filed for an eviction on me due to delinquent payment approximately two months prior to the end of my lease. I went through all the normal channels without contesting the eviction, but the end of my lease came and went without the eviction officially being enforced or myself being physically removed from the premises. I moved out on January 1st, 2016 normally, returned my keys, and the office said they would notify me if anything else was needed. This was the last bit of contact I had with the complex.  According to my credit report, the claim was placed for collection on 3/22/2016, but I signed a new lease on an apartment with new roommates in early May without any issue or notification that this claim was on my credit report. I now realize that the one credit report that didn't reflect this claim was the one that complex inquired when running my credit, so I guess I dodged a bullet on that one, even though I had no knowledge of a bullet being present to dodge.  I just got off the phone with one of the credit agencies showing this claim on its report after filing a dispute, even though I have not documentation to show that I never received contact from them, and I'm going to file a similar dispute with the other credit agency showing the claim on its report.  My question is this: Is my dispute valid if I never received contact from the former complex or collection agency regarding the claim filed against me? I'm completely new to this as it is the first time I've ever had to file a dispute against something on my credit report and am operating fairly blind presently. My partner and I want to rent with both our names on the lease as a way to help improve my credit, but I don't know where to turn to for advice on this matter.  I'm cross-posting this on /r/persoanlfinance as well. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.	No
"So about half a year ago I noticed a $200 ish charge on my credit card that I had not made. Looked up the company in question and found many complaints about continued charges after cancelling the service this company provides (online dating). I then called my bank and got them to mark the charge as fraud and they sent me a new card. Yesterday I received a letter from a credit services company. The letter begins by saying this is a 72 hour demand. It goes on tell me it has been sent in accordance with provincial legislation and that the credit service has attempted to find a solution with me, though this is the first time I have heard anything from this company since a had to get a new credit card. Then it says the debt is past due and IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION may be the only way to resolve the matter. It tells me after obtaining a provincial court order they may garnish my wages, attach real estate or property I own, seize money in my accounts, seize and sell assets and have my finances examined in court. ""There is still time to deal with the matter"" it goes on to say but if no reply is received in 72 hours they will make a referral back to the client for IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION with no further notice to me. What should I do?"	No
"My girlfriend has been asked by her apartment complex to vacate the apartment while renovations are being done.   She got an E-mail in May stating that ""From May 15, 2017 to August 10, 2017 we will have several contractors and team members in your unit to address maintenance needs, painting, and flooring""  They then requested that all residents ""Move your personal belongings from the common area and place them in your bathtub for or check out a bin to put your personal belongings in""  If they did not let these contractors in or refused to move their things then the residents would be charged for ""Labor but also any other fees associated with moving your belongings""   They asked these residents, in a very populated apartment complex close to Baylor University to move ALL of their belongings and remove all items from their kitchen cabinets for THREE ENTIRE months while renovations were to be done.    How is this fair? Is there anything that can be done about this? She has tried to contact the apartment building multiple times but they will not respond or let her know anything. She got a automated text saying they would begin her building and within 12 hours she had to clear everything and has not been able to return to her building for a couple days now.   Is there anything that can be done about this?"	No
Hello! I am a landlord in NJ.   We have a rental property and our renter wants to kick out her ex-boyfriend. He is not on the lease, but she did get our permission to have him live there. He has been paying us the rent for the two of them - she has been paying him cash and he cuts us the check. My questions:  -- Can she remove him from the property?  -- Do we need to officially evict him, even though he not on the lease, or is this an agreement between the two of them with him subletting from her?   Essentially, they've broken up and she wants our help getting him out of the home she is renting from us.   Thanks for your help!	No
10 years ago parents house added an extension on their deck. Entire room is elevated 8 inches with wood. The room extends past the cemented deck so a portion of it is just overhanging over dirt. Overtime water sipped in a bit and recently we noticed termites on the floor of the overhung area towards the house wall. Wall and a portion of the room needs to be replaced. Is there any legal action we can take or will it all have to be out of pocket? Thanks in advance.	No
"This is my first time posting to this subreddit and I'm incredibly nervous writing this, so I apologize if I missed any rules or etiquette.  I'm in a situation currently with a girl I hooked up with a few times 2-3 months back threatening me with possible legal action over a false claim of sexual assault. This is the important part, so I'll get it out of the way first:   This first came about at a party at my apartment with a couple friends, my roommates, myself, and her (we'll call her Sally, not her real name). At the beginning of the party, Sally and I made a few suggestive remarks to each other back and forth, which made it clear to me that she was interested. Later on, after everyone had a few drinks, we met outside and talked about getting in the shower together later. We ended up kissing at this point, but nothing else, and went back inside. Afterwards, I messaged her from the bathroom asking her to come join me as planned, which she did. At this point, we are in the bathroom, still fully dressed, discussing whether or not we should hook up that night. There was some uncertainty since she is good friends with one of my roommates (we'll call her Anna) and neither of us wanted it to end poorly and affect our relationship with Anna. Sally and I are talking this over in between making out and lightly touching over clothes (not genitals, since the law seems to make a distinction there, from what I can understand). After a few minutes of this, she mentions that she thinks she drank too much. I agreed and suggested we talk about it the next day when we're both sober and decide if we wanted to hook up later on. She agreed with this and left the bathroom, then I took a shower by myself. That was the end of any physical interaction between us that day.  After that, Sally messaged me a couple days later saying (and this is a direct quote) ""By the way, thanks for not taking advantage of how intoxicated I was the other day. You're a good guy."" I now have this and many other texts saved and backed up so I can't lose them. After discussing it further over text, we mutually agreed to hook up the next time we met, and ended up having consensual sex a few times over the next couple weeks and she didn't say anything that would leave me to believe she was anything but interested in continuing.  I ended up breaking things off about a month ago because I felt she was getting emotionally invested after we had agreed that it was explicitly a friends with benefits arrangement. She took this perfectly fine at first, said she was disappointed, but understood and respected my decision. However, just this week, I came home and Sally was waiting for me inside of my apartment (she's good friends with Anna, so she was waiting inside). She asked to speak with me outside to go over some paperwork. Confused on what paperwork she could've been referring to, I agreed to follow her since as far as I knew, things were just a little rocky between us since I broke things off, but we were still friends.  To my surprise, she pulled out a printout she claims came from a local police station highlighting the changes to the law made by A.B. 2888 and A.B. 701 (the amendments to California's definition of rape to include additional sex acts and mandate a minimum prison sentence of 3 years for any such cases, which was brought on by the Brock Turner case, to my understanding). She explained that I had hurt her so badly that she saw a therapist, and that therapist urged her to go to the police since she thought I had sexually assaulted her based on Sally's description of the events. She went on to say that she did end up going to the police station with a guy who is now her boyfriend and that the police wanted to go out and arrest me that day, but she refused to give them my name because she ""doesn't want to ruin my life and thinks I'm a good person"". She also mentioned more than once that she's had to stop her now-boyfriend from coming over to physically attack me at my apartment or work, but that if I were anyone else, she would've given both the police and her boyfriend my information. I don't have any of these threats in writing since they were verbal, but it was bad enough that Anna went as far as to tell me that I should have my security guard at work escort me for a while since she keeps mentioning that he wants to hurt or kill me (I'm honestly not sure which).  I spent some time explaining to her why I was confused that there is even any question of everything between us being consensual, she agreed that she did consent at all times, but that during our first interaction her consent was not valid because she was under the influence of alcohol. Mind you, I also had a few drinks that day and we never did anything beyond make out and lightly grope. I wish I could say there was more to her claim, but the only thing that differs between our stories is that she is now saying she tried pushing away four times, but that never actually happened. I tend to be pretty timid about making moves, so any sign like that would deter me immediately. She also told me that she wanted me to agree to take counseling so so that I don't hurt other women and suggested that if I didn't do so, she was going to go the legal route. After all of this, she asked if we could still be friends, which I reluctantly agreed to, simply to avoid escalating the issue any further. I immediately went to sleep in my room and that was the last I saw of her. I later found out that she had spent the night with Anna, as I saw her car still there as I was leaving for work.  As confident as I am the claim is invalid, I'm obviously not a lawyer, so I don't know what I need to do to protect myself. I made an appointment to speak with a criminal defense lawyer in case she does decide to proceed with her threat to pursue legal action, but I'm still scared in the meantime, both of being falsely charged and of being physically harmed. I'm not a big guy and don't think I could defend myself against most people, which is especially concerning because I don't know what her boyfriend looks like. I'm currently staying at various friends' houses that she doesn't know for the time being for my safety. I also asked that Anna not allow her over for the time-being, as I'm concerned about her going through my things.  Any help or suggestions would be immensely appreciated. I don't know where else I can reach out in the meantime. If there's anything I can clarify, let me know and I'll do my best to clear it up. Thank you."	No
My roommate moved out in June and found a new girl to take over her room so I wouldn't be stuck with the whole rent. The problem is that my roommate was at first going to sublease the room (even though our 1 year lease was up) instead of getting her to sign a new lease with the landlord. New girl doesn't question this much for whatever reason and then moves in. New girl then says she wants to talk to the landlord and sign a lease after she moves in. Landlord is upset that new girl moved in without the landlord's knowledge. The landlord does a credit and background check on the new girl and finds that the new girl has bad credit.   The landlord doesn't want the new girl to stay in the condo. The landlord then issues a 60 day termination of tenancy in mine and my old roommate's name. She says that in order for our contract to be terminated, everyone has to vacate the condo (me, my old roommate, and the new girl). My old roommate left anyway, and I'm moving out as well. The new girl however refuses to move out, despite all of us talking to her and telling her she cannot stay.    The landlord was willing to sign with the new girl if she found an adequate cosigner, but she has not. New girl's mom has been throwing a fit saying she'll cosign but doesn't want her credit checked. I did at one point convince the new girl to move out, but her mom butted in and said she will not move out.   New girl has also not been paying rent. She gave a check to my roommate the first month she stayed here cuz my roommate had already paid the rent. The second month, however, she sent the check to the landlord, who refused to accept it from her since she is not her tenant.   My roommate was foolish to move this girl in without notifying the landlord, but at the same time the new girl acted cool about it first and then wanted to talk to the landlord. Why didn't she talk to the landlord first? I am only involved because my name is on the lease, but other than that I was not involved in the initial discussions between the new girl and my old roommate. The landlord comes after me to get rid of this girl however, because I am still here (for 2 more days). So my question is how do I make sure I get out of the contract and how do I make sure I am not liable for anymore rent?   This is an individually owned condo in California, where I was on a 1 year lease and then transitioned into a month to month lease.	No
I need to remove two adults from my rental agreement. I am the primary renter. I do have them named on the rental agreement as tenants. They are living with us on a verbal agreement of $500 per month that covers all bills except for food. They get free use of the house, and the master suite because of the attached private bathroom. Tenants are my wife's parents.  I'm not sure if it's legal to order them out if they haven't broken any aspect of the rental agreement that I'm aware of. The relationship has simply deteriorated the the point that every day is either silence or yelling between my wife and her parents. We have three children, and I'm concerned about how this will affect them, and frankly I don't trust the in-laws to not mistreat my children or damage my property out of spite.  Can I remove them from my home? If so: Do I evict, serve a notice to quit, or something else?  Thanks	No
All vehicles our parked at owners risk. No liability is assumed by management for loss or damage by fire, theft, or any other cause to, or by the vehicle while in custody of management. All claims must be presented before vehicle is taken from facility. Any person driving becomes the agent of the owner solely. We are. It responsible for articles left in vehicle or mechanical problems.   Background: left car with hotel valet to park for a few days. I came back and car was stolen and then impounded. I'd like to not pay the $275+ obviously. Do I have any recourse or am I SOL?	No
Okay, so I live in the US (Colorado) and the boiler in our building broke last week. We haven't had hot water in 6 days, and every day they swear they were working on it, calling different contractors, etc. Management has been screening everyone's calls and emails. End of day 6, the water is back on and they say it's fixed. Day 7 at 2pm they email everyone saying it's permanently fixed. 4 hours later we have no hot water and they say it's still getting fixed. Their only offer to compensate us was ordering pizza for the building.  TLDR: Is it legal to make me pay a month's worth of rent when we didn't have hot water for 1/4 of it?   I have no way of proving it was 7 days ago since I didn't document it, but I did submit a work order about not having any hot water on day 2 of this fiasco. I'm concerned they may claim it was fewer days than it really was.   (For context, I commute 2 hours every morning and get home late due to traffic, so the errand of showering at the YMCA across town is an extra hour on my day and has been a huge hassle.)	No
Location: Onatrio, Canada  So we bought a house and noticed the day before closing that the garage door had been damaged and needs replacement. This wasn't present at time of the purchase agreement. I took pictures and saved pictures from the time of listing from the real estate agents website to show that the damage wasn't present when we first saw the house and what it loos like now. I sent this evidence to my lawyer. And asked that we be compensated or the damage be repaired by the seller.  She contacted the other party, they refused to compensate and stated the codition of the property hasn't changed since purchase agreement.  My lawyer said that we HAD to do the closing and transfer the funds to them otherwise risk loosing our deposit since we would be in breach of contract. To which I replied wouldn't they be in breach of the purchase agreement for having wilfully caused damage?  Lawyer said we had no recourse on such short time and pretty much pressured us to go through with the closing.  I feel like my lawyer was crap and am not convinced that we had no recourse. She said only option is small claims court.  Is there anything that she could have or should have done? And do we any options?	No
So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
we just had a very close call at my house:  An overhead power line broke and fell on the ground in a patch of grass (on state property in the middle of nowhere) where I keep some jet ski's, boats, and cars.  the fuse failed at the pole and the line shorted to the ground for about an hour before a fire started.  fortunately the local VFD was able to put it out before the fire spread to the cars and boats, but the live wire laid across one of the jet ski trailers, basically incinerating the tires and steel wheels.  another trailers' tires are now flat (I'm assuming from fire damage).  I'll have to check in the morning if there's damage to the ski's but I don't think there is.  Since it was the failure of the lines' fuse that cause the fire and damage, is the power company responsible for replacing my 2 wheels and 4 tires?	No
Can someone help me find a warrant? I have called the jails. The only thing I have is the Warrant or Case Number. 	No
My landlord told me to leave the apartment by the end of the month because new renters have to move in. She has been bugging me for this month's rent since the very first week. She has came to my house unannounced on numerous occasions and even climbed over the backyard fence and opened the screen door to the dining room to see if I was home. I have been very polite to her but I am getting tired of the harassment. I told her today I did not appreciate the things she was doing.   She told me she was going to have the cops take me out of the house on the 31st. Is any of this legal? Can she tell me to get out by the end of this month without a court order? I have just started a new job and I can't afford a new place at the moment but I'll live on the streets if there is absolutely nothing I can do. I just want to know if any of this is illegal so I can do something about it and hopefully get at least 30 days from a judge.   Also, she told me at first she was personally living in the house but she keeps switching up the story and now she's saying renters will be moving in. I don't know if this is helpful.	No
Our landscaper did mention the neighbor asked them a lot of questions and that the landscaper felt the need to explain that our house had 15 security cameras. I thought my landscaper was just being weird, although I've known him for 16+ years. However, since Nov 2016 one of the neighbors got the idea I was responsible for his issues with our HOA. (I'm not, he's been breaking rules and getting cited, not related to me at all)   Unfortunately, since then he has become focused on my wife, repeatedly trying to ask her why we are reporting him, looking over the fence and insisting on speaking to her about his tickets when she's outside with our kids, driving by and giving dirty looks (this to me, her, the children) but then when she told him she did not want to speak with him, he (I suspect) posted ads on CL that got her over 100 respondents directly to her email/phone number (luckily it was only a burner /number and not her main email). We notified the HOA.   He approached her again to try to 'talk like adults about his tickets' and she said do not talk to me. He  came to our front door and attempted to speak with her about his tickets.  (We have footage). That night she was signed up for a pornhub account to that same email that is just for neighbors. At this point we made a police report. We were advised by the police to record all convos and to ignore him, completely. He never brings these concerns up to me, but did go on a rant on a neighborhood website. (Mods took it down) The police did mention they'd had complaints about him previously.  Did the previous owners have some kind of duty to disclose this problem neighbor? I've put a call in to my agent. I travel for work so am gonna lot during the week, and this guy is triggering my protective instinct.	No
Bear with me here, this is a long and complicated story. My girlfriend has been trying to sell her house for over a year, which she purchased with her ex husband a few years ago. We are under contract for the third time, having had two previous buyers back out of the contract. After signing the third contract, the two of us agreed that if it didn't work out, we would take the house off of the market and move back in. The house has been vacant during this time, and we've been renting an apartment since going under contract the first time. This has put a significant financial strain on us.  The contract we signed with this buyer in June was contingent on her qualifying for low-income grant and having her mortgage application submitted by mid July. We also offered to let her rent the house starting August 1st if her financing was approved. However, as that date came and went, she was twice declined for financing and did not qualify for the grant. On August 1st, we contacted our lawyer and asked him to begin the process of terminating the contract. He never received a letter of declination from those two attempts, so he contacted the buyer's attorney for a copy of them to proceed.  Jump forward to Friday evening (3 days after instructing our lawyer to terminate the contract) we receive a letter from our realtor (who is representing both parties) that the buyer was approved for financing. However she would need to extend the closing date from August 18 until late October. Furthermore, she still wants to rent the house in the interim.  This has become problematic for us, as we have given our landlord notice that we would be moving out, and my girlfriend's son needs to be enrolled in kindergarten (house is in a different district than our apartment). I think we could request another month from our landlord, but we really don't want to be in limbo as this situation is legally resolved. We are also no longer comfortable entering a landlord/tenant relationship with this person. It seems certain that this buyer would sue us for breaking the contract if it was not done properly, so we want to make sure our bases are covered.  I've read through the contract and didn't find any language on reasonable time allowed for obtaining financing, but the contract amendment states that the grant should be determined by July 12. We will be getting in touch with our attorney tomorrow, but have a very small window for either renting another month or moving back to the house and getting her son registered for school. Given that the original closing date will not be met, are we under any obligation to extend?	No
Hi i just moved out of an apartment called Avalom Place Apartments that with one quick look at their reviews on google you'll see im not the only one.   I currently have a receipt in my hands that charged me a 565 dollar deposit on april first of 2016. I now am holding a receipt of final walkthrough that says I only paid them 199 dollars. I have a video walkthrough showing no damage to the apartment at all. they also charge me for the walls being excessively soiled. The problem is the paint is so cheap that it comes off with water so you cannot clean them.     So I wanted to be there for the final walkthrough. i went into the office on friday. They made me sit and wait for an hour then told me that the guy isnt there. They did this again on saturday. again on monday then when I came in tuesday told me they did the walkthrough on monday a little after I left. they are charging me with loads of soilage and damage but if you see this video you'll see theres no damage at all. They're charging me 20 dollars to clean drip pans. I dont know what those are.And im under the impression they must replace the carpet between tenants. but they are charging me 64.50 for repairs and cleaning. I had it shampooed before I left there were 0 stains. I dont know what to do in this situation.    They also dinged me for mold damage that I told them to fix because it was there when I got there. It was a very little amount but might be a massive problem under the paint. I told them 3 times about it and no once came to check it out.	No
"Bought a used car in Harris county, Houston, Texas, from a small car dealer at his residence.  Before purchasing the car, I did have a call out mechanic inspect the vehicle. After I had thoroughly inspected and driven the car.  Hours after purchasing the car, the IMA (Honda Civic Hybrid battery) and the catalytic converter are showing errors.  We have already paid $3,700 for the car cash in hand and owe him $400 for the cost of registration which was in the paperwork we signed. Also stating we would not sue and buying the vehicle in ""As is"" condition.  The seller states he can transfer the vehicle registration and that he does not need the vehicle for the vehicle inspection report.  I need a car as there is little public transport. What options do I have either for the mechanic or the seller to fix the problems with the car? Or is it possible to get my money back?"	No
"Currently, I live with my bf who owns 2 vehicles. Unfortunately, our apartment complex only allows one parking spot per person living in the apartment. I have 1 car and my boyfriend has 2 which obviously leaves us one space short. The next part of the story is super important, at the time of move in and multiple times afterwards (via email as well as verbal) the apartment complex I currently live in told us that the street across from our apartment is a public street meaning that we could park our extra vehicle on that street without paying for an additional spot. That was what we thought was the end of that. Additionally, at least 20-30 cars park on this street daily as spill over from our complex.  My boyfriend primarily uses one car over the other; however, both cars have been used throughout the 8 months we have lived there and we have never had issues up until this point.   A little bit of background on a separate incident but related in the sense that the same officer has issued all the tickets to the vehicle in question:  On 12/16/2016 my boyfriend received a parking ticket for being ""more than 12 inches away from the curb"". Not really thinking to take a picture of the vehicle before moving it, accepted the ticket and paid the appropriate fee.  Back to the current story:  After running into my neighbors and talking to them about what happened everyone I talked to had similar stories! I figured ""I guess this is how the police deal with their time in a sleepy town and while annoying parking tickets are apart of life"". I sent an email to my leasing office explaining the situation and the leasing office sent a reply saying their policies are their policies and to their understanding we are legally allowed to park on that street. I still have a copy of this email for my own records.  On 06/08/2017 we received a warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location (I do have this warning but it is not with me. I can upload this ticket late if need be). So not thinking much of it, my boyfriend moved the vehicle a couple of streets over with additional public parking(which I pass on my way to work everyday and can visually see the windshield and would noticed any ticket or warning).  On 06/29/2017 on my way to work I noticed that the car was not in it's normal ""spot"" which I check daily on my way to work. I sincerely make it a point to check everyday as we almost missed the deadline to pay for the first ticket due not seeing the ticket. I frantically call my boyfriend and explain whats going on. At first we thought the car had been stolen but after looking online realized it could have been towed. We contacted the local tow company and sure enough that was the case.  We promptly went to go retrieve the car; however; because the police department was the one who issued the tow, we could not retrieve the car until we have payed the associated fees with the police department. Great. At this point we were livid as we had never received any notification that car was going to be towed.   We go to the police department and to our utter shock there were apparently 2 outstanding parking tickets for ""parking without permission on public property"" (WTF does that even mean?!?!) and that we had received ANOTHER warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location. Outraged we said we were never notified of the tickets or the second warning to move the vehicle (The tickets are bright pink and I visually check the windshield daily and would have noticed these tickets/warning) and would be appealing them but unfortunately we were told we had to pay the additional associated fees if we wanted to retrieve the car from the impound lot. Additionally, we stated we had moved the vehicle after the first ""dead"" vehicle warning so clearly it was not a dead vehicle. The clerk stated all she could do was give us the tickets and pay the fee but if we wanted to appeal the tickets we would have to submit additional paperwork (we have the paperwork and are currently filling it out).   We then retrieved the car which had NO PARKING TICKETS ON THE WINDSHEILD and after getting home a reviewing the tickets realized ALL THE TICKETS WERE ISSUED BY THE SAME OFFICER!!! Including the first parking tickets we received in December.  I have no clue if what is going on is illegal or not and I am just really looking for advice on how to move forward. This situation does not read right to me and after everything is all said and done (and if we end up having to pay the tickets) we will have sunk 1k into this whole ordeal.  I can't help but to feel we were specifically targeted as about 20-30 people park on the street across from our complex all the time and never get towed. My head is spinning and the idea that a police officer can get away with what has happened sickens. I'm also having a hard time stomaching a 1k loss without any idea on how to prevent it in the future as my bf was about to go to college and we had to dip into that money to cover this expense.   /r/legaladvice please help. What can I do? Is this legal? Should I file a complaint against the police officer?"	No
My dogs got into my neighbors yard and now she is claiming they did $300 of damages. I fixed the fence already and she's still asking for more money. Can I just ignore her or can I get in trouble with law?	No
"I live in Virginia and my lease has just ended, but the landlord will not return the security deposit because they do not want to split it up when some of the previous tenants are staying. I guess for convenience they are having one of the new tenants (taking my room) pay me the portion of the security deposit that I paid. This new tenant is only willing to pay half of the security deposit due to the bedroom not being fully clean (just needs to be sweeped/wiped down, nothing extraordinary).  This feels sketchy to me for a number of reasons. I have no agreement with this new tenant, he shouldn't even be responsible for paying me and my lease specifically says that I may be responsible for ""reasonable"" cleaning fees on move out. A few hundred dollars for one bedroom needing maybe an hour of cleaning is not reasonable. My lease ended and they should have started a new one, are they able to pull me into this? Can I get the security deposit back from the landlord?"	No
Living in New Jersey and my landlord passed away. Have a signed lease through June 2018 but unsure of who to pay rent to. His wife and his daughters seem to have a battle looming over custody of his assets so definitely on edge. His wife asked us to pay her in cash but definitely don't want to put myself at risk of paying the wrong person and being forced to pay again. What should I do? When and how will we be contacted about who legally owns the house? 	No
"Good afternoon! I desperately need some advice. I purchased my own home a few months ago and rented out a bedroom to a couple that seemed to have fallen on hard times and decided to help them out a bit.  They have always been late on payments, causing extra drama and then not paying me $100 in rent due to said ""drama"" that they caused.  Now they're saying they found weed in the bathroom and will not be paying rent for 30 days and that I can't evict them before that.   I don't even smoke weed, the picture they sent me was like a microscopic piece of weed and my agreement with them is on a week to week lease.  Can I not just end the lease starting today and they would only have one week to move out? Please advise and thank you in advance! This Is in Houston, TX if that helps."	No
"My girlfriend and I moved into our new place last weekend, and we had the movers before we had the key.  It was agreed between all parties that the unit would be suitable for move-in on 7/7.  When we obtained the key, we immediately realized that the entire apartment smelled of smoke, the hardwood floors were covered with dirt, the carpet was filthy, the dishwasher was falling out of the carpentry, there was rat feces behind the fridge and on the back of the fridge, the bathroom sink was broken, there was mold on the ceiling of the living room and bathroom, and the piping for the tub needed to be replaced (this was not found out until the next day).  Since we were in a hurry, we did not get a copy of our lease.  And since the movers had arrived and were being paid by the hour, we started moving items into a dirty apartment.  When we went into the office, we are told that we cannot look at any lease until the Apartment Manager returns from vacation (next tuesday).  This is our first issue about the situation.  A plumber came last night and opened the walls to see that there was a non-lethal methane leak that was taking place and that the pipes from the top down needed to be replaced.  The lady quoted the maintenance guy for $500, and the leasing office refused to pay the amount; they stated that they could fix it themselves.  We went up to the office within 3 days after moving in to request to terminate the lease and the lady behind the counter chuckled at my girlfriend and replied with a sarcastic, ""mmmkay"".    I realize that we made some serious poor decisions, but I want to know what my best moves would be here.  Thank you in advance for your assistance."	No
"Ok so i own a hair extension company and I hired a photographer to take some photos for the front page of my site. I picked 2/3 models that we used and I had an agreement with them that in exchange for their time modeling they would be compensated with being able to keep the hair I put in their hair (around $500 worth) and being given an affiliate code where they can earn commissions. They would also be able to use the photos for their portfolio.    Exactly 2 weeks before the shoot the photographer lets me know he found the perfect girl and asked me what I thought of her and i approved and he said he would ask her if she wanted to do it as well as discussing how we were doing anything. 1 week before the shoot she says she wants a contract (she contacts the photographer) and I asked the photographer, ""a contract for what?"" and he seemed confused about what she wants and she wouldn't let him give me her contact info so I could discuss it with her and she didn't want to give her address so I could mail a copy of the contract I drafted so she can have it ready and signed by the day of the shoot. So I said fine as long as she understands what she is getting out of the shoot.   So the day of the shoot rolls around and I finally meet and speak to the model for the first time. Everything is fine, all 3 models shoot and everyone seems to be happy. At the end of the shoot the model asks me about the contract and I told her I am still confused about what she wants out of this ""contract"" and she talks in circles and I get the impression that she just wants a contract to have one and doesn't necessarily need one. She told me she would have her  mom-ager look it over and send me any issues with it. I told her if she needed time for her mom to look it over I would send her the contract over email and once we reached an agreement I would send her a DocuSign. So I sent her the contract and I got a response 4 days later with some demands: 1) she wants shared rights to the photos 2) she wants to be able to approve of all photos before i use/post them 3) she wants a personal hair stylist to make wigs for her at my expense on a regular basis 4) a 6 month term for the contract.   WTF. 1) I don't have a problem with sharing rights but I don't have the rights to give her since the photographer owns the photos. 2) I cannot give her the right or power to control the photos I use from a  photoshoot that I paid for. Basically signing my rights away. 3) The girl is bald and basically wants me to give her new wigs to wear all the time in different colors. 4) 6 months for what? There is no ongoing relationship implied besides the affiliate codes with is optional for the model and is just an opportunity for her to make money off of the promo of the hair.  So upon reading this I was taken back and trying to decide if I was just going to say NO or if I was going to negotiate further. I am very busy in general and sleep about 4 hours a day so i only have time to deal with this on the weekends. so a few days pass by and I let her know she will get a response by the weekend and she says okay. so she calls me first thing saturday morning and i was sleeping so she sent me a long message about how she isn't going to chase me down and I need to remove her photos and I can't use them now. This is all because I didn't answer the phone because i was sleep. As soon as I woke up I returned her call and she says I have been dodging her calls (she NEVER called me outside of this one day and I spoke to her mom TWICE so I am confused about what she is talking about). She says I have had months and months to respond to her. she is delusional because me and the photographer didn't even know she existed until June 15 so it hasn't even been ONE month yet. And I didnt have her contact info until the day of the shoot (July 2). So I am not sure what months and months she is talking about. She has called everyone and basically cursed everyone out saying everyone is lying to her and we are all confused. so i have a couple of questions:  1)since she never signed the contract or a model release, can she say that me and the photographer can't use her photos even though it is what we initially agreed on? 2) Who owns the photos : me, the photographer or the model? 3) does she have any recourse for me posting her photos on social media after she posted them first?  I am just over this chick and I am completely ready to sever the relationship but I do not want to do so if it means I have to pay the photographer to remove her out of all the photos but I am strongly considering it. She hasn't had a problem until literally today (July 15)"	No
"So after pretty much no word from former landlord, he sends us an itemized list within hours of his 60 day duration being up saying we owe him more money. FYI the numbers given aren't the exact quote more just a ballpark figure of what it is.  The first item that took our security deposit is that he expects us to pay for plumbing repair and replacing the plumbing system. In March our basement plumbing system started leaking water. We notified him immediately of the problem. However, he did not actually send a person to look at it until late May. (We have multiple texts from when we first reported the problem and trying to get him to send someone out) When a person did finally come to look at it, the only resolution we got from him was to put down towels around it. He did not actually get it properly looked at until a few days ago. Invoice for replacement is dated 8/01. According to him, the problem was cause by a rag getting stuck in the plumbing system. None of my roommates seem to ever recall flushing a rag down the toilet and I do believe them. Our apartment was one of three in a single building and not sure if the plumbing system in our basement was for multiple units or just ours. Either way, the long period of the plumbing system leaking caused baseboard damage which leads to the next item.   He is quoting us $2,500 dollars for re-painting the entire house. Besides the pictures of the damaged baseboards in the basement there are only a few pictures of minor scuffs on the wall which should be ruled as normal wear and tear. Also, we were told before moving out that he planned to re-paint the entire house anyway. We have texts with the landlord for when he was telling us that a painter would be coming to start the process while we were still living there. The ""painting company"" he hired seemed to be a friend of his and worked for about half a day while we were still living there. However, the invoice for painting in May 17 he sent us was for 61 hours of work.   He is also charging us $500 for Landscape repair. Our roommate did have a dog with dug up the yard a decent bit but the ""backyard"" is only about the size of a suburban and half of it is concrete/gravel so not sure if this is a reasonable quote?  Finally, many of the pictures he is using for ""damages"" are from when we still actually lived there. Earlier in the year he did a surprise visit with his dad so we did not have time to clean the place before his arrival. He is using these to claim we did not do any cleaning before leaving and saying we left the place in poor condition. In some cases, it is obvious as parts of our furniture and possessions are in the corners of the pictures. In other cases, there are pictures of corners/window sills we know we cleaned thoroughly but could not think of another time he would of gotten a picture when they were dirty. Unfortunately, we did not take pictures when we moved out. Besides his slowness to deal with the plumbing issue he had seemed like an honest person and we we're not expecting anything like this. In hindsight, obviously I will be sure to document pictures myself.  There are some other charges such as cleaning fees, carpet repair (damage from dog) and routine landscape maintenance which does seem to be in the lease but confusingly worded. These aren't such a big deal. It is mainly the plumbing and painting that are the issue.   Any advice would be appreciated! Especially concerning how much to reveal on things I can disprove when I initially dispute the bill before going to court.  Thanks!"	No
"Thanks in advance for any help.   My lease ended on May 25th and my landlord has yet to contact us about our security deposit. I'm listed as the agent on the lease and emailed her the day we moved out with my mailing address and a reminder that I was the tenant that would be receiving the deposit.  I read the Maryland statute that says the following ""If the landlord, without a reasonable basis, fails to return any part of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the termination of the tenancy, the tenant has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney‚Äôs fees.""  Today is the 45th day and I still have not heard from my landlord. How exactly should I proceed? The security deposit was a little under $10,000 and suing her for $30,000 seems somewhat unreasonable but is that what we're entitled to under the statute? At what point should I contact an attorney? Should I reach out to her directly again?"	No
TL;DR Can I and who do I sue, the home warranty or the contractor, or both?  I'll refer to Big Giant Home Warranty company as HW and the Poorly Communicating Contractor as PCC. Three months ago our AC started performing poorly, I called HW and they sent out PCC who charged it up and left. One month later still performing poorly. Called HW and again they sent out PCC. I work from home and am here all the time. I work on the phone and as such can't always answer my cell. Most of the tech visits are preceded by a phone call 15 minutes prior asking if I'm home (despite me scheduling the visit and knowing I'm there). Half of the visits the tech didn't show because I didn't answer. I've told them MANY times that if we have an appt that I will be there and to just come and not call. Somehow they never read the notes despite the receptionist confirming they have.   1. Tech 1 said the coil was frozen and there was nothing they could do that day (Friday). It was another week before another tech came out. 2. Tech 2 said there was nothing he could do because there were supports in the way and HW needed to approved further work.  3. Heard nothing for another week. Called HW and PCC to find out what the hold up was. After someone else explained I removed the supports so they could get the coil out.  4. many phone calls later Tech 2 comes and removes the coil banging it up nicely in the process, takes it to their shop to repair it 5. Another week goes by and no word. Call in several times to PCC and finally get someone to tell me that they want to put a whole new air handler in which means the engineer needs to come out and inspect or wait a month for a replacement coil. 6. Week later, engineer comes and inspects, they basically need to destroy the ceiling to replace the air handler. Engineer wants to muddle it over and see if he can figure out a way. I tell him that I'd rather order the replacement coil and wait than have to manage repairs on the ceiling. Also that I would appreciate a call sooner than later. 7. Two weeks later and I've heard nothing. I call in and they tell me the home warranty has denied it. I ask why no one has called me at any point, has my part been ordered (that I'm going to pay out of pocket for). They tell me the owner will call me.  There are details missing here. This is an extremely frustrating situation. What recourse do I have at this point?	No
Disregarding the fact my girlfriend had a crap realtor, she is currently in the process of selling her house. After accepting an offer and finding out the results of the home inspection, she discovered that according to the home inspection done, the roof on the house is still the original roof from 1994, not a new roof from 2009.   Now, she truly believed her roof was replaced in 2009. The home inspection she had done at the time (2014) didn't indicate the roof was 20 years old and the sellers confirmed and signed in their disclosure to her that the roof was replaced in 2009 (the sellers didn't give a receipt for the roof replacement itself).  Long story short, her current realtor thinks she should have a roofer replace the roof, give his professional opinion on the age of the roof, and that she should sue the sellers she bought the home from.  The crux of the problem comes with whether it is worth suing or not. Replacing the roof will likely cost 4-5k (we luckily can afford this). Including the fact she couldn't likely sue for the whole cost of roof and that the couple she bought it from are now almost 90, would it be worth pursuing legal action?  Thank you for your time, if you have any questions I'll try to shed light where I can.	No
This takes place in housing located Port Arthur Texas. It's a section 8 lease.  We've been staying at my parents house partly because it is so nasty. There have been roaches since day one but it didn't seem overtly bad. We've been out of this place for the past 4 weeks. We went back there to clean things out yesterday...  There are roaches everywhere. We have filed several requests for people to come by and spray, even before it was this bad.  Supposedly people have come by but the roaches are still literally everywhere. Mold is covering a decently expensive couch and chair to the point of it not being  even worth salvaging. There's mold on the kitchen counters and table. There is a fee for not removing all belongings before the lease is up. Should we be required to pay the fee and is there any way we could be compensated for damages to said couch and chair? Clothes have to be washed as well, like 20 plus loads.	No
I posted something on Facebook that apparently he is upset about. Is this a threat?  [this is what he said to me](https://imgur.com/gallery/a0LiP)	No
A little while ago I had a fire in a condo that was my fault. It caused enough damage to have to replace everything in the unit.   Good news is that I had tenant insurance with $1,000,000 in liability. Bad news is that the landlords didn't have insurance for themselves.   They have been harassing me with emails saying that my insurance isn't giving them enough ($5000 short), and that I need to pay them the difference. They are threatening to sue if I don't.   I spoke with my insurance and they said too bad for them. The amount they are getting represents depreciation of what was lost (appliances and cabinets). They should have had their own insurance.  I initially told them to contact my insurer as they are handling the liability of the claim, but they continue to come at me. I've decided to cease responding to them until they decide to contact with a lawyer.   I'm pretty sure my insurance will take care of me if they want to sue, but I want to make sure with you guys. Do I have anything to worry about here? Would the $5000 even be worth it for them to hire someone?  Thanks	No
For the past few months I've had an issue with continuously being charged overages on my utilities each month. Even following my 2 roommates moving out, the overage charges remained similar to what they were before.   In July, my overages were charged for the entire month in only the second week. This leads me to believe that the utility company could be charging me based on extrapolating data.   Is this legal or standard practice? Is there anything I can do? My searches on google left me with little information	No
"I am a landlord in Illinois and this is the first time I've run into this problem and am unsure of how to proceed. Here is the background and current situation.   My parents were renting a house out and after my father's death I took over the account. The tenant has been living in my unit for the past year give or take a month. The lease is over end of the month IIRC. I'm not entirely sure on this part as even though they have a lease with me they never returned a signed copy to me even though I have asked for it multiple times (I have the original lease template but not the signed lease with dates and what not). I know they have the lease because I handed it to them personally. The lease states that they must pay the rent at the beginning of the month but he contacted me and said that he and my father had an agreement where he could pay the rent in two separate portions one in the middle of the month and one at the end. Now I was not too thrilled about this arrangement but my mother informed me that such an unorthodox payment scheme was indeed what they had verbally agreed to when my father was alive.   Now this has not been much of a problem for the last year or so as we always received two checks at the beginning of the month, both post dated one for the middle and one for the end. He has always been somewhat bad with his payments because if I deposit the checks even one day late/early they would bounce and I would have to drive over there to pick it up in cash. But this month I didn't receive any checks at all. When I contacted the tenant about this (end of week 1) he said they were in the mail. So I gave it a week to show up in the mail. No checks so I said forget that I'll drive over there and pick them up (it is now week 2 at this point). Then I was informed that he was out of town and no one would be home until week 3. I stupidly waited till week 3 before attempting to collect the checks again. He then stated that his loan officer told him not to spend any money until they were approved for a loan (the f? never heard that one before). I pressed him again drove out there, no one answered the door, no check. I don't want to keep driving out there if no one is going to answer because it's a bit of a drive. I ask him to have the checks ready for Monday of week 4 (last week of the month, it's currently Sunday). I even said he could post date it for the end of the month like he usually does (this time the check is supposed to be for the entire rent plus late fee). He basically said no and that if I showed up either no one would be home or he simply would not give me a check because his hands are ""tied"" until the weekend whatever the hell that's supposed to mean (also the weekend would put us at literally the 29/30th). He also refused to post date it stating that last time he post dated it the check was deposited a day early and he was hit with an overdraft fee (again not really my problem because I'm not the one who can't pay rent). So now it' basically the end of the month, dude's been living there for free all month and is now refusing payment. I'm going to be out in the area tomorrow (Monday) so I'm thinking of serving an eviction notice but am unsure of the legalities behind it. Also because I don't actually have a copy of the signed lease I'm not entirely sure what my options are. I would like to get him out of the house and get paid for the past month.  TL;DR Tenant is refusing to pay rent and has been living for free in rental unit. Can I evict him without a signed copy of the lease and is there a way to still get paid for the month?"	No
Don't know if this is the right sub but here goes...  Started renting a property September 2016, moved in and there was mould in the bath, food from the last tenants still in the fridge and even some of the lights weren't working. The house wasn't even cleaned before we moved in and was handed over in the most vile state. We took photos of everything obviously and when it came to moving out (A week ago) we didn't really bother to deep clean the house since throughout the year he practically ignored us and hardly ever repaired anything when we needed it. (One shower didn't work most of the year)   He now is ignoring all of our calls and this is when it get's interesting he is actually a barrister (prosecutor) and he is trying to take all of our deposit.  He might be taking us to court :(  Any help would be appreciated	No
Recently a neighbor selling his place got dinged by the prospective buyer's Home Inspector who demanded a further inspection by a structural engineer of a dormer that was done 3 owners/20 years ago. It got me thinking about improvements that previous owners have and have not done to my house when I sell. Are there up and down sides to putting a house on the market and boldly saying 'This is it. Take it or leave it.'	No
I wasn't really sure where to ask this so well try here. My roommate has a gf that moved in with us a couple of months back. She has been trying to convince me to allow her cousin to live with us. I have always said no. The gf has mental health issues and voluntarily admitted herself to a psychiatric ward. She was released the next day. She is claiming she had to sign a contract stating that the cousin had to be with her 24/7 until a further date with another doctor. If they are not they will be faced with jail time. This seems fishy to me but I dont even know where to start. Is there any truth to this? I feel like shes very manipulative to get her own way. If I say no to this she is moving and making my roommate, who is also good friend, leave with her.	No
I am currently on the lease with a large NYC management company. There have been several robberies in this building this year and last week my apartment was robbed. Management hasn't replied to an email I sent asking to change locks or do anything to help heighten security. At this point, I really want to just get off of this lease...  My question is, is it legal for the landlord to act this negligent and do I have any recourse here?  Thank you.	No
"We had several improvements done to our front yard about one year ago (new walkway, new sprinkler system, planting, etc).  The general contractor we hired subcontracted out the concrete work.  After all the work was completed, we paid the contractor the final installment (50% was due before the job started, 50% due after).  Total job was ~$8,500.  Now, a year later, the subcontractor drives by my house on a Saturday and lets me know he hasn't been paid.  This is certainly news to me!  He has been stiffed by the general contractor and says he will try to come after me.  He then showed me the invoice for concrete work that was supposedly unpaid by the contractor (nearly $2000). He said he sent me a notice in the mail ""a month ago"" that he was going to file a mechanics lien and wanted to know if I got that notice.  I never received that notice.  At this point, my Saturday morning chores are pretty much the last thing on my mind and I am very concerned.  After 20 minutes of reading articles (from a google search), it seems like contractors and subcontractors have 90 days to file a mechanics lien.  It also says that they must file a notice to the property owner before filing the mechanics lien.  What do I do?  I have no evidence that the contractor didn't pay the subcontractor.  The contractor could very well have paid the subcontractor and I would never know!  Seems fishy, it almost seems like the subcontractor is trying to collect twice.  Since we are way beyond 90 days here, is this even something I should worry about?  What happens if I never got the notice he said he sent and he still filed a lien somehow?  Thanks in advance for your help.  I really appreciate it!"	No
I am asking about nonprofit organizations that arent registered in the state of WA, I giggled the name of their org and found nothing. I know someone who just started a Facebook page claiming to be a non profit organization and is accepting donations, the donations are toys and kids clothing and items for children, I do not think any money is involved but am not sure. They claim none of the things they get are new, but the basically take donations and give them out to people, but for free and some pictures look like new in box toys. My question is they aren't registered, is this legal? Are they supposed to keep books of the items they receive for tax purposes and such? I don't understand and want to know if anyone can help me understand and answer my questions and if they are violating any codes or laws. Thank you for your time and if you need any more information please ask!	No
TL;DR: There's an abandoned car in the parking lot at work and my coworkers and I are wondering if it's possible/legal for one of us to take it home.   Background:  I work in a retail store that is next to a body shop. Their parking lot is abysmally small and ours is huge, so we have an agreement that lets them temporarily park cars at the back of our lot when they need to for storage.   About two months ago a car showed up in our lot in the area that the shop usually parks their cars. We didn't think anything of it. A few days ago we asked  the shop owner to move the car, he said it wasn't one that had been given to them to be worked on and they had no information on it at all. It looks like it's been completely abandoned.   The question is, is there a way for one of us to legally take ownership of the car to fix it up and use it? How would we even go about that? We're in Texas in case I have to put it in the body of the post.	No
"I've been honorably discharged from the military. Under the military clause in my lease it says that with proof of orders (in this case, it's ""separation orders"") and rent for 30 days I am able to break my lease. Because I have separation orders rather than transfer orders am I still obligated to pay the lease breaking penalty?"	No
Hey r/legaladvice, do you think my girlfriend should do something about her latest manager? To keep it straight and to the point: her new manager told her employees to start thinking of a few days to go on vacation next month. When asked why, she responded that any employee who couldn't take vacation would have to work 1 less day per week.  Is that even legal? Is there something my girlfriend can do before she is forced to drop from 40 hours to 30-32 a week? Losing 1/4 of your income is pretty harsh so Im hoping that there is a way she can defend herself from losing that money.  Some minor details: This manager just replaced the previous manager who was fired for raking up more HR charges than Weinstein.   She is new and was hired from an entirely different industry. There was an interim manager that worked in this company for 18 years and surpassed all previous metrics from the previous manager before being replaced by someone who never worked for this entire industry before!   This new manager wants these employees to go on vacation because this company doesnt take vacation out of the payroll budget that is involved with the managers bonus.  This is a forbes 500 company. Idk if that pertains, but I figured it might be worth mentioning  Thanks in advance to all who may be willing to help :)	No
"Hey guys, I wanted to ask to see if there was anything that can be done about this.   I've been living in the same building for almost a year. At first, it was great, but as March rolled around and brought the rainy part of the year with it, I noticed that water started dripping though a panel in the ceiling of my bedroom. I reported this to the people at the front desk, and they _said_ they would send a guy up to fix it. He never did. This exchange has happened over and over for like two months now, and there's always some excuse for why they can't just either move me to another unit, or fix my damn roof. It's gotten to the point where if it rains in the morning, the liquid pours down onto my bed, and has caused a big pit in the middle of my mattress. It's not too common, but I'd like to know if there is some way to either get out of my contract or something because this place sucks for an ""upscale high-rise""."	No
It's just the morning after and I'm still a bit shaken over this, but not entirely sure which steps to take.  Last night my bf and I got into a fight over something trivial (he's currently staying with me while he sublets his apartment, until our new lease starts - yes I signed a lease with him).   During the argument I told him that I needed space and couldn't talk to him about this right now- I just wanted to be alone. He ended up locking me out of my room because I stupidly left the key inside and he took and hid my phone as well. When I was finally able to open the door he wouldn't let me through the doorway and ended up shoving me to the ground twice.  At some point- it's all a blur now, I make it past him and grab keys/phone and leave to take a walk.  I was on the phone with my best friend for the entirety of the walk, about 15 min. When I get back to the apt the front door is ajar, and my bedroom is locked. It took a while to open it because the lock had been damaged- when I finally got it open my entire room was trashed. There are several minor damages to the room, and after inventory my computer and a few other possessions (of low value) are missing.  I called the police and filed a report, can pick it up today and see if any charges can be pressed. They advised a restraining order (he's also known to be violent and had been in the past).  I'm at a friend's house now, as he still has copies of the apartment key. All of this puts me in a financial mess- we were signed to live together at the end of the month, obviously that's not happening but I'm signed onto that lease and have nowhere to go after 8/31.  What other actions can I take? Any hopes of getting my computer back or suing for damages?  TL;DR- got in a argument with bf, left him alone in apt, returned to find room trashed and computer stolen (and he put his hands on me).	No
Really hoping someone can help me out on here. I'm living in a basement apartment on a one year lease that started Dec. 1st. I have a horrendous mold/mildew issue in my home that started around the same time the warm weather hit (early June) all due to ventilation not existing with it being a basement apartment. From my understanding, I know that mold growth can be blamed on the tenants (i.e. not using fans when cooking/showering, not opening windows, etc) but the day I moved in, my landlord had made it clear that 2/3 windows in the house do not have screens or locks, nor do they even open. He had stated that he was not going to fix the issue until next year because he had ‚Äúspent so much money putting in hardwood floors‚Äù. Not long after, I came to discover that none of the fans in the bathroom or kitchen work either. Therefore, I have absolutely no way of airing out this place except by opening my front door and kitchen window. I made my landlord aware of the mold present, he said he would come by the next week to take a look. We had a discussion about the windows and fans needing to be fixed asap because the mold is getting out of control. I also showed him how my belongings were starting to get a little ruined which he didn‚Äôt say a thing about and didn‚Äôt seem to have much empathy but said that he would get to the process of fixing everything. The next day he dropped off a dehumidifier and said it should help with the moisture build up and what not. It is now almost August and the problem has not gotten better. My landlord has not further discussed anything with me about installing new windows or anything else since I mentioned the problem to him in June. I don‚Äôt know if the dehumidifier is his way of fixing the problem, but nothing here is fixed and I‚Äôve made it clear. The dehumidifier stays on all day/every day, I have to constantly switch it from room to room or the levels will get too high and mildew will start to grow overnight. This problem has become its worst and it‚Äôs destroying me and just about everything I own! Everything, and anything is covered in some type of mold and mildew no matter how many remedies I use to clean it, it is growing back overnight. Being someone who has had many health problems, including allergies I know my body and there‚Äôs no doubt that this mold problem has affected and deteriorated my health over the course of 2 or 3 months. This is my first apartment and all of my furniture as well as every little thing I own was just bought this year as I started out with nothing but the clothes on my back in December. Having the distress of having to throw out all of my belongings after just getting them is breaking my heart. Couch, tv stand, dressers, ALL of my clothes in the dresser, shoes, bedding, papers/journals, cookware/utensils. You name it, it‚Äôs probably covered in mold like you wouldn‚Äôt believe. At one point, I had some difficulty breathing every night, which never existed before, come to find out my pillow is close to black underneath which I don‚Äôt understand how it could of happened so fast. Some of the mold on my belongings isn‚Äôt even coming off at this point that I‚Äôm going to have no choice but to throw it all out. I‚Äôve had it living in this apartment with issues I can‚Äôt prevent from happening. Nothing but stress and if I were to move out to another place with no furniture, I‚Äôd basically be starting over again which is another stressful thought... I‚Äôm at the point where I‚Äôm ready to just live out of my car again since finances are tight and my health is getting worse. I just want to know a few things: can my landlord actually be held responsible for this and pay me for the cost to replace my damaged property? I have been taking pictures and documenting everything since it started and have every date &amp; conversation with my landlord. I‚Äôve been looking at possibly sending in a ‚ÄúTenant Application about Maintenance‚Äù form to the Ontario Landlord &amp; Tenant board which costs a fee of $45/$50 to send in. I just want to know how something like this works or if anyone has had a similar experience? If I do something like this is it just a waste of money or is it likely that I will win the case?	No
So I've known about this for years and years but honestly recently started using Reddit for real.   Growing up on the cotton farm my grandmother cared for her grandmother who was very ill. She was closer to her than much of the family. When she died my grandmother was in Italy with her army husband and couldn't go to Texas where the probate court is for all this land out in Texas she got, which has oil on it, a lot. That side of the family who did go get it ended up in politics and doing very well.  She has anxiety, always has, and is afraid of getting killed over trying to claim it due to the amount involved. She's almost 80 now and I'm not sure if this is something worth looking into since there have been some deaths around it. I called up the Clarksville Texas court to pull the old document that outlined what happened but they said it was incredibly long.   Is this something worth looking into? Sums involved are in the millions.	No
Hi legal advice! This is one of my favorite subs and an old situation has been bugging me on and off for years. At the insistence of my partner at the time I let the situation go but I've always wondered what I might have done.  My partner and I lived in a daylight basement of a split house - we had the entire basement and our neighbors the whole top. When moving in, the landlord mentioned in passing past plumbing issues but said all had been resolved. After a few months, our section flooded with backed up wash and toilet water (approximately 2-3 inches of poop scented water), leading to the damage of some electronics. The culprit was deemed the upstairs neighbors flushing 'flushable' wipes which caught in and blocked a poorly designed section of plumbing, leading to sewage backing up through a floor drain. Upon talking to the plumber, the landlord had been previously advised the system would continue to backup until the bad piping was replaced but he had elected to do nothing. Basically, he lied to us about the plumbing issues being rectified. We confronted him about this and, as he claimed to have insufficient funding to fix actually fix the issue, offered to let us out of our lease early and with only ten days notice. He also offered, via email, to replace the electronics if we provided him with an appraisal of value.  We proceeded to find another home while the apartment filled with sewage water another three times. We literally found floating nuggets of feces at one point. The smell was awful so we stayed with my parents. During this time, the landlord became aggressive, repeatedly telling us that he would hold us fully responsible if he found we had contributed to the clogging in any way. I provided the valuation and the landlord dragged his feet, never giving me a date for which I'd get a check. After a couple of weeks, I demanded an update on the status of the reimbursement. He claimed due to my rudeness he had rescinded his offer to replace my damaged goods. We attempted to get the plumber to provide us with written documentation regarding the landlord's refusal to fix the plumbing. They called the landlord to get his permission, and he promptly called and lambasted us.  Upon finding a new unit, we gave written notice and calculated prorated rent for ten days. After delivering the notice to the landlord, he became extremely aggressive, saying we would pay for the entire month of rent or he would take us to court. I wanted to prorate the amount anyhow, especially since the apartment was uninhabitable, but my ex-partner was spineless and insisted we just give in and forget it. I was a chump and went along with her, despite wanting to take him to court.  After leaving, he refused to perform a post-move walk-through with us but deducted the entirety of our deposit due to the state of the apartment, all caused from backed up sewage, and claimed the window mount air conditioners were all missing, a complete fabrication, and demanded we compensate him for their value. I told him to get bent and he threatened to sue but never did. All in all, we were out about $1200 (~$2500 if you count the electronics), not a lot but a sizable sum at the time.  Oh sages of /r/legaladvice, what sayest ye? Should I have taken it to small claims court or was it not worth the trouble, as my ex-partner insisted? I actually still have everything documented, could I possibly even sue now, four years later?	No
So, if I was living in 2 bedroom 1 room apartment with a couple. They have one room I have room and we split the rent three ways. Well one of the couple moved out, but is still on the lease. Now they want me to pay a half of the rent instead of a third, even though the one that moved didn't get removed off the lease. They are saying it's my responsibility to pay half now since the other person isn't living here, but they are still on the lease so is it my responsibility?	No
I have had an eCommerce business for about a 1.5 years and never filed for the LLC, but I have the branding, domain name, etc.  I just went to check the Secretary of State's site to lookup my name, and I found that just this May a corporation from Las Vegas, named **United States Corporation Agents, Inc.** filed for my exact name.  I know for a fact that no one would have picked the name of my eCommerce store randomly in my state, so I'm guessing they are doing this to try and make money off me.  Just look at how many other LLCs they've filed randomly: https://www.sosnc.gov/search/regagent/6542001  What can I do? Can I still get my name if I've had the domain name and branding for over a year?	No
I'll try to keep it short:  I moved out of an apartment and left it without damages beyond normal wear and tear (documented on video and was told so verbally by an office employee during walkthrough).  The rental company later sent me a bill for about $600 of damages.  I wrote them and let them know that the apartment was left in good  condition and that I disputed the charges.   After I sent notice that I wouldn't pay and was disputing the charges, they sent a reply saying they would just send the account to collections.  My question is: Can they sell this disputed debt straight to a third party or do they first have to go to small claims court and win a judgement first?	No
I've looked at multiple options online, but they can be a little confusing. First option was to just go for 6 months, and wait another 6 months to come back? I think that's what it said at least. Second was to get a work visa, the requirements seemed to be only for prestigious jobs though like doctors, lawyers, athletes, etc. The last option I saw was to enroll in college/university, but I can't really afford that much for American tuition. Please help me find another solution to stay with my boyfriend that doesn't involve these.  tl;dr I want to stay with my boyfriend permanently in America as a Canadian citizen and I'm not educated on Visas.	No
"Hi!  Thank you in advance for reading!   I currently attend a University of California school. I live on campus with my family in the ""family housing"" section of campus living. The property we live at has been there for 50ish years and the buildings themselves are 70ish years old. The buildings are in serious need of renovation, but the cost to do so versus our subsidized rent made it seem as though it was not financially possible (ignoring upper university admin paychecks...) So a need for change was coming - but we did not expect this.   Rumors had been going on for years that they would be closing and/or relocating family housing but we were always told that nothing was put into motion. In the early summer of 2016, rumors started to surface again and I personally called and asked if anything was up. They assured me that nothing was up and that there were no intimidate plans to do anything. About 2 weeks later they announced that they would be relocating family housing to an apartment complex nearby. The original email stated a large increase to our rent - which given our university employment stipends (most of the community is graduate students) the community collectively panicked. There were two town hall meetings held which were so incredibly hostile as we felt totally blind sighted by this announcement. They told us the property was sold to a third party to develop the area surrounding the university. After the hostile meetings, a committee was formed and we were able to negotiate some of the worst parts of the transition (cost to move, lower rent, safer living conditions for children, etc).   However, the entire process has been like pulling teeth from the university. They have given almost no new information since the summer of 2016. Basically all we know is that they definitely sold the property, and we are definitely going to have to move. But we don't know how, when, or where.   One of the major concerns is the units to be leased. The current situation is 2bd/1ba or 3bd/1ba and the new location only has 2bd/2ba and 1bd/1ba. So many community members are concerned about the living situations for their families. We have only been told that those with children and legal dependents will be given priority to the 2bds - but no information about unit assignment has been given. They have asked us to provide information in Feb 2017 that would supposedly be used to determine which families are eligible for the 2bds (had to give birth certificates of children and marriage certificates). In June 2016 they sent an email saying they would have unit assignments completed and leases ready in July. However, they have not met this expectation. I have asked for an update on this and they say they have no new information to give. Which is so incredibly frustrating. At this point I have not signed a lease - but i was made to agree to move or relinquish my spot in family housing.   Another issue is the moving date. They have been giving us a constantly shifting range for move dates. The most recent date they are saying is ""September."" Basically we are told we must move our families in a month, but we have no idea what the living situation will be. Honestly, I don't even know if it is going to happen in September. Which is also stressful as a graduate student - moving at the start of the quarter.   As we move further into August I am becoming more and more stressed about when, how, and where we will be moving. When I call the university to talk to someone they only state that they are ""working on it"" and will ""follow up"" with me. I have been doing this dance with the university for over a year now. I don't know what else to do and I am wondering if I have any rights? Do I have legal rights as a on-campus tenant? Are they required to give us more warning regarding moving dates and leases? I was expected to agree to live at the new housing without any information regarding the living situation or the moving date. If I did not agree they would have removed me from the list and I would have been ineligible to live at family housing post June 15th. So I agreed to stay in family housing, because we are financially tied to the subsidized rent provided. If I don't have any legal rights to require additional information regarding moving dates or leases - can anyone provide any tips for dealing with the university on this issue?   Thank you so much. If you need me to clarify anything I will."	No
I'm the owner of several rental properties and for the last 2 years, I've stopped renting to black and hispanic tenants after more than a dozen domestic disturbances, and many instances of late/missed payments. Would there be any way for someone to prove that I'm breaking the law and segregating based on race?	No
I am looking for advice on how to proceed with my outstanding debts from the last decade or so, and have not found a good place to get advice so figured I would try here since Credit Counselors only want to run your credit report and clean that up for you...my questions go back further than that.  So, I have been on the run from my debts for about 10 years.  Most of my debt has fallen off of my credit report, but I have a lot of money (for me...I would guess about $15-20K) still owed on these accounts that are no longer on my credit report and sold to various collection agencies.  I have moved multiple times and avoided requesting credit unless absolutely necessary (utilities, etc) to try and fall off the collection radar.  I never intended on getting credit again or buying a house, was young, and needless to say lacking foresight.  Now, it's 10 years since I ran from my debt, I have been married a few years to a woman who had a mortgage already.  We applied for a credit card 3 years ago and got approved.  It makes me nervous to have credit, and we have already managed to get ourselves into 4k worth of debt in just a few years.  We collectively also owe about 3K to the IRS we are paying off in installments as a result of our witholding being wrong for a few years but not being able to afford to correct the error.  We are no longer being undertaxed so we should work out closer to 0 this year and not go further into debt to the IRS.  My wife would like to look at selling our house and moving closer to work, but we don't qualify for good interest rates unless my income is included, but I have dings on my credit report and I don't end up helping.  I am nervous because I feel once I get assets on paper, someone might get the idea to accumulate my debt and sue me for the full amount once I have something worth taking like a house.  As of now, the house is in my wife's name.  Bottom line, what is my recourse for these old debts?  How should I go about getting them taken care of?  Is bankruptcy an option, can I do it individually, or would I take my wife down with me?  Credit counseling only wants to talk about what's on my credit report and can't answer anything about these old debts, and I would like to find out how these old demons will affect my future.    Any advice anyone has for me would be greatly appreciated.	No
Ex and I were together for a decade. Ex broke it off two months ago. Fine. Ex says she'll remove her stuff from the apartment and get on with it.  Except the part where she never did. And she stopped paying rent.  We are co-tenants on a lease that ends in approximatemy four months. Out of the eight months we have been here, ex has only paid rent for three.   Because we were together so long, there is only a verbal agreement of splitting the rent in half. Maybe there's a saved text or something but I never got a written contract because love I guess.  The main thing here is I can't stand being around her anymore. We had a domestic violence incident in the last year that I did not report. Staying in this apartment now is mentally and physically destroying me but I don't trust ex to 1) not steal my shit and 2) not wreck the apartment.  The only silver living here is that the landlord allows for leases to be broken with notarized signatures of both co-tenants. I've sent this is ex multiple times and they've yet to complete it. To be fair, I haven't done it either because I've been waiting on her to sign it first.   My main question is: Is there any way I can potentially just get my name off the lease? This leaves ex with the hot potato, as they say, and is the easiest way to dodge. I'm just worried about this coming back to bite me in the ass later either via a small claim or a bad landlord reference. That's probably out of the question, though, considering the early leave.   Thanks for any help you can give.	No
The police officer blatantly lied in the police report and if I can locate the victim, I can prove it. The victim (a store clerk) didn't even speak English but the police report has sentences of things I supposedly said to him, including a death threat which I never made. If I can locate that store clerk and have him verify  1. he didn't understand what I was saying 2. as such, he didn't understand a death threat I never made 3. he was not scared for his life based on that death threat   then: 4. i'm not guilty of criminal threats, which is what i plead guilty to.  How to do that I don't know. I've emailed several lawyers and none respond. I imagine this doesn't fit within the confines of their usual churning out plea bargain framework so they don't want to bother with it.   Thanks for any help.	No
I had some misdemeanor charges expunged at the start of the year.  I know at the county level it's complete. They made mention that it can take a bit more time at the state level.  I'm being offered a job and I need to fill out background check info. Im not sure if I should put it on there or not.  I know that some BG check companies 'cache' backgrounds so it might still be listed, but I can't find any info online about my case. The TN site doesn't show anything, but I'm not sure it ever did.  What should I do?	No
"To my shame upon moving into my current home I didn't think it was super important to have my name on the lease, my boyfriend signed his when I wasn't home.    The landlord saw us view the apartment together and even referred to us as tenants on the phone when we both payed rent in full about a week early.   My belongings are here. I have nowhere to go. Last night ex called the police because I was annoyed with him and we argued, after he held the ""lease"" thing over me he threatened to kick me out, started grabbing my stuff etc. I dared him to call the police (I thought he would smarten up because he has illegal things in the house and the last time he called the police they were very kind to me and told him to leave)   An RCMP officer yelled at me that I have no right to be in the apartment if he doesn't want me there. I explained that I pay half rent and that boyfriend won't deny that but the officer said that doesn't matter because my name isn't on the lease. Since I had nowhere to go, the ex said he would leave for the night until 12am. He is now telling me that I can stay as long as I'm not such a bitch.    I need to know if this is legal. I've heard about squatters rights and all the ridiculous rights renters have. But can I legally be kicked out onto the street of my own home where I live and own things because I don't have my name on the lease?"	No
He had no estate, so it was all insurance and retirement money and his wife was listed as the only beneficiary.	No
I took out a student loan in 2013 to attend trade school with a company called TFG and we paid those off in full. Now - 4 years later - NELNET is calling me saying that I have a student loan that is delinquent and will need to pay or it will start affecting my credit.   I know for a fact that we never took out federal student loans. What do I do?	No
It's a 6 family apartment building in NYC, no one in my building wants FIOS. There is a big building (50 apartments) that they have been trying to get to for years. Over the years various attempts were made to get my consent to cross my property, most recently they came on July 12, fitting, I laughed at the guy.  One guy had threatened to sue a few years ago but nothing ever came of it. Verizons options are to attach to my building or trench the street to run the fiber. There is no overhead wiring allowed where I am and opening the street is cost prohibitive. Can they force me? Am I entitled to compensation?	No
She asked for all original copies so she could bring them to wherever and have them copied. She said I wouldn't have to sign anything and it would be fine, because they just need proof that the person coming here knows a citizen from America.  This seemed really sketchy to me, 1 because I haven't known them THAT long... and 2 - she asked not to tell my mom (who keeps all of those documents for me) and lie to her and say that it was for work purposes.  My question is - is this as sketchy as I think it is? My mom told me it was definitely not OK to give those documents over and not to 'vouch' for anyone coming especially someone I don't know.  What are your thoughts?	No
"My girlfriend and I signed a lease with a landlord in August 2016 for a 1br apartment in Los Angeles. The lease states our contract begins November 2016, then after November 2016* it becomes a month-to-month lease. We assumed this to mean our lease was month-to-month from the start. When we left 6 months into our stay (giving proper notice as per the contract's specifications), the Landlord said there was a ""typo,"" thus we were breaking our lease. He is withholding our deposit ($1300) instead of ""pursuing the additional 6 months of rent money owed.""   This contract is the only legal document we signed with this landlord. Regardless of whether or not he meant for the lease to be 12 months or month-to-month, paper is paper. My question: Can we take him to small claims court to get our deposit back?   There is no damage to the apartment. We have before and after pictures to back it up. Our only concern is that he also misspelled my girlfriend's name on the contract we signed, but it is still her signature on the paper.  Bonus: Not sure if this is relevant to anything, but here are some additional problems with this landlord.  Rats - 2-ish months in, we had rats chew a baseball-sized hole from the apartment's foundation through the floor inside of a cabinet. Landlord simply came over and sealed the hole with sealant from Home Depot. He then went around our apartment and sealed off other holes that he said might be a problem. I found one of the rats in our kitchen prior to the sealing and chased it into the heating unit, which had a huge chunk of wood missing on the bottom (clearly manually removed by someone previously). I sealed the hole with a wooden shim that I built, but the rat could be heard scurrying around inside the heating unit for days. When we showed the Landlord video of the noises, he didn't do anything about it. We assumed the rat got outside via the heating unit somehow. My shim is probably still there. He paid another tenant to come clean our apartment for us with cut-up t-shirts and lysol.  Disgusting Tub - when we viewed the unit, the unit looked so dirty, particularly the tub in the bathroom looked like a murder scene (we never used it, there was a separate shower thank god). I asked if the landlord planned to have the unit cleaned before we moved in, but he said he already cleaned it. We were desperate for an apartment because our new jobs started on Monday and it was the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. Otherwise, we would've bailed on this place immediately."	No
"I was on my way into work on the interstate when the car in front of my slammed on the breaks and I couldn't react fast enough and I slammed into the back of his truck leaving a hole in my front bumper and scratches to my hood but nothing to his car.   And as I know, rear ending is always the person in the backs fault but when we pulled off to check our cars that's when things got weird. When the other person got out of the car I realized he was a cop and before I could even say anything he said ""my cars fine"" and hopped back in his truck and sped off. Also, he had a trailer hitch in place and left a hole in my bumper and I believe it is illegal to have a trailer hitch if you aren't towing anything.   Do You think he was helping me by not taking my insurance? Should I call the police? Should I make a claim. Any advice would be awesome. I'm kinda shooken up cuz I'm younger and I've never been in this situation.   TL:DR Rear ended a cop, no damage to his truck because of tow hitch but my front bumper is messed up , cop left before I could even say anything. What should I do?"	No
"Note: Posted in r/relationships and r/askto first, someone suggested you'd be a better resource.   Hey Reddit,  I live in a condo in a town about 45 min north of Toronto, Canada. My neighbors (we share one of those metal walls on our balcony, so sound basically is like it's right beside each other) they were blasting music from about 3pm to 11:07pm on Sunday night, specifically to affect us. I found out from their drunk rants back and forth that they are upset that I sometimes play metal music after work (I've never got a complaint from them before). I'll play music sometimes off my cell phone or off my TV, but they had a very loud sound system blasting oldies rock (van halen, AC/DC, etc) all day, while making jokes like ""hey Rocco think we should play some screamo music instead?"" He'd say ""nah I hate that shit, this is real music"". It's a man and woman, probably at least late 50s, my wife and I are mid 20's. (and Disturbed/System of a Down/ Otep is the music I think they're complaining about, certainly not screamo!)   Eventually we complained to security twice, they only answered the door to security for the first complaint, which I made on my way out of the building for a rec league sport I play downtown. My wife ended up feeling unsafe as she heard them after the complaint ""they don't know who they just fucked with, they'll regret this"", ""I'll fuck them up every chance I get"", ""we'll complain to security about every little thing they do now"", etc - those were all told to the security guard and added to their file (whatever that entails).   While I was out my wife went down to complain the second time, the male neighbor walked out of the parking garage, visibly intoxicated, was most likely driving just before that. He saw my wife making the complaint, both her and the security guard noticed that he almost fell over he was so drunk. I probably would have called the cops right then if I had seen that but neither of them did, pretty sure it's too late now.   According to my wife they then made more veiled threats to us talking with each other, my wife got scared and called me and I left my game early to come home. Neighbors continued drinking and playing music until 11:07pm, their son came out at around 10:30 and told them they should be careful because 11pm (official noise complaint time) was coming up, they just laughed at him (I'm guessing he's around 15ish, and I hear him smoking bongs on the balcony pretty often). He came out at another point and asked if they had any batteries and they just laughed at him and said ""what do you think we are, the dollar store?"" - obviously they're not the best parents and really drunk.   I took recordings with my phone of the loud music and backed them all up on iCloud. Even in the bathroom on the opposite side of the unit (950 sq ft), with my cellphone music at full blast and the fan on I could hear deep bass. Security entered our unit both times (at my wife's request) and noted the loud volume we could hear inside.  These neighbors are in at least their late 50s, maybe older. They don't seem to work at all, sound like they're straight out of Sunnyvale trailer park and best friends with Jim Lahey, they really just drink and smoke cigarettes all day. They and I smoke cigarettes so we're outside often at the same times (I've never talked to them before, I don't even know what they look like, but wife does). They rent, we own. Security guard told my wife that they and their landlord will be sent a complaint letter.   I'm worried that they'll cause more problems in the future, especially if I have music on that they can hear, it's the summer and I like to have the windows open and some music on for like half an hour when I get home from work most days, but I don't even own a stereo that could play music at even half the volume they had theirs on at today. I'll likely stop that or at least cut this back now.   Any suggestions? I'll call the cops if I need to (if this persists) but I really don't want to cause even more issues, these people sound like really vengeful children. I found the website for Toronto bylaw and it says noises at anytime, not just after 11pm that effect ""quiet enjoyment of a home"" can be grounds for a cop call, but  a) we're in a nearby town and I'm not sure if the bylaw is the same (couldn't find that online) and  b) we like to make noise too, we have the occasional party or times with loud music (but not as loud) - difference is if we get a complaint we've turned it down and apologized, not turn it up and make threats and loudly complain all day (only got one noise complaint in this building from a different neighbor and did exactly that, but have got some at past residences and did the same)  Any ideas Reddit?   Tl;dr - condo neighbors (who share balcony with metal wall between) wanted to get back at me for listening to normal-Volume music by blasting really loud oldies rock from 3pm to just after 11pm while drinking, we could overhear them making non-specific threats against us, wife got really scared. One of them likely drove really drunk during the day, but no proof of that."	No
"Good afternoon. I am a family friend of a disabled person who is in a bit of a pickle, and I'm wondering if you can point me to relevant information on how to proceed.    Quite a mouthful: My family friend has cognitive disabilities that are evident. He went to the mall on a day trip, where a third party salesman at a kiosk talked him into buying more than 1500 dollars worth of gift cards (rather than using his card or cash, which raises alarms since gift cards are notorious liasons for fraud) which were then used to purchase a multitude of accessories, two phones, and a new line of service. A new account was set up under his name. The kiosk entered their own email into his account though, he was not told his username or how to access it, and the security questions were not asked. The store must have put random information in, because when trying to access his account with common answers he gives to those questions, they are all wrong. I believe this was purposeful as the incorrect info made it very difficult to access the account or petition for a refund.   When he arrived home and this was all discovered, the phones and accessories were returned in full with ample time left on their return conditions.   He took back everything to the same kiosk and was told to expect a ""corporate check"" in a few weeks to his home address (we don't know if the address they have is correct, since the information on the account is not accessable due of the incorrect info filled in by the kiosk salesman...) Unfortunately when he returned these products, they handed him one return reciept which was folded- it shows only the return of the accessories, totalling about 185 dollars. The phones he returned are NOT listed on this, and this was not found out until later. They kept his orginal purchase reciept when he made the return.   It has been 2 months and no refund has been received, no corporate contact will speak with us or confirm that they have the reciept of this phone purchase in their system. They refer us only the the kiosk. The third party kiosk has not returned our calls. I am starting to worry that he was the victim of opportunistic fraud and that this is not a civil case.   So, what do you think of all this? Should we pursue civil action/arbitration over the untimely refund, or does this sound like a criminal matter to involve police in? We are unsure what to do and are very unsettled. Thank you!"	No
Okay, so my friend has been renting an apartment for a couple years near the campus of the university that we attend and every semester his landlord has called him and asked if he wants to renew his contract for the next semester. Well this semester instead of calling him, his landlord sent him a letter saying that all of the contracts in his building had been sold and that he would need to be out of his apartment by this coming Saturday.   So we understand that it's not her obligation to ask him every semester if he will be renewing his contract but is it legal to give him 2 weeks notice to be moved out of her apartment? Is there anything he can do to stay a bit longer until he can get a contract at another apartment?	No
"My girlfriend and I just received a voicemail from our apartment complex saying that we had to take down our [CA Pride Flag](https://smile.amazon.com/California-Pride-Flag-Rainbow-Banner/dp/B002OSQEUG/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8) because it's not on a flag pole (we saw a neighbor hang their USMC flag against their porch wall vertically, so we did the same with our flag.) and that it needs to be ""displaying colors properly.""  Our lease says nothing specific about flags, but it does say, about patios and balconies, ""any item not specifically mentioned here must be approved in advance by the community manager. Any item that has not been approved in advanced will be required to be removed immediately."" We didn't get permission, we assumed because we saw the other flags we could do the same. We can fly it on a pole, but we're worried about ""displaying proper colors."" What rights do we have to fly this version of the California flag?"	No
We signed a lease with a property management company two months ago that said we were responsible for all utilities. However, we live in a lot of duplexes, and water + sewage is covered by the landlord - there is no way we can arrange to pay for those. The property manager also claimed that we were responsible for lawn care - however, on the lease it says that that's the responsibility of the 'owner'. Basically, the lease is wrong. Do we have anything to worry about as a result? What will happen once the landlord realizes this?	No
"I live in Florida. Have lived in the same low-income apartment complex for 2 years. This is the last month of the current one year lease. Upon signing this lease last year I notified the manager of the beginning of a mold problem in my apartment. I signed for another year (wasn't economically a smart decision for me to move at the time) with the stipulation that this and other small problems be addressed. Well months go by and throughout all this time verbal complaints were made numerous times. It was not until this past May when we put in a formal request to have our windows fixed as they have a poor seal when it rains water comes in which is probably the main cause of the mold in our apartment. This request was marked as completed (we use an app for maintenance) and nothing was done. Around that time the mold really flared up to the point it was visible in every room. In June we went into the office and told the manager that the mold problem has become so bad that it is all over our walls our furniture our food etc. and said how our prior request was Marked complete with nothing done. This time we had pictures of the mold all over. She immediately came and took a look at our apartment and said she will address it immediately and sorry for the former manager ignoring it for so long. She also told us that we should probably go ahead and clean up as much of the mold as we can ourselves‚Ä¶ Which really should not have been my problem to deal with but I went ahead and did the cleaning anyways which took me about two days and a total of probably 10 hours to clean everything‚Ä¶ During this I discovered even more mold to the point I had to throw out furniture as it was beyond the point of no return. Also had to throw away food and some other smaller items, although all of this quickly adds up (especially for someone who lives in low income housing). At this point I was really fed up with how far the problem had gotten, especially after realizing that I am now losing personal items to a problem I have complained about for months. I did a little research and discovered they were not adhering to the Florida statute regarding landlord requirements. It is then that I notified in an email to the manager that I would not be paying rent until the problem is completely taken care of as that was within my rights as a tenant. Although they continued the communication via email nobody addressed me withholding my rent immediately. Though later when I brought it up again they did say that it was within my rights. They told us that they would replace the carpets in our rooms which they did and that they would have a mold remediator come (someone came in our absence and cleaned the vents I assume this was a mold remediator?)  as well as replace the Windows in the apartment. The Windows have yet to be changed, although a few days ago the manager approached me and told me new Windows would be in in about 4-6 weeks (oh.. so after my lease is up..? I don't think they actually ordered the windows). I just walked out of my apartment to find a note on the door saying that I owe the outstanding rent within 3 days or will face eviction. I now realize I should've been documenting everything from the very start. Although I do not have all of this I do have proof of the May maintenance request on the app. I also have all the pictures of the mold in the apartment, As well as the emails documenting our communication. When I originally looked up my rights as a tenant and saw that withholding rent is an option, I also read that it is possible to break the lease over something like this although because the manager seemed eager to help with the problem this time for real after seeing the pictures, I decided to stay put and allow her to deal with the issues rather than go through the trouble of moving. I see now this was a mistake. My question is what do I do now. I clearly do not want to pay rent when they still have yet to fix the windows which were acknowledged by the staff to be the likely cause of the mold. So I will be paying two months rent to have been living in an apartment with people in and out of my apartment the past two months and inconveniencing my schedule, having to clean up mold that was their fault, and to finally have new Windows after I move out .. if I had known this would've been the case I would have vacated from the start. The ""fixes"" they made to our apartment or stuff they would have had to do before a new tenant moves in anyways and I think they are trying to play that off as their effort to fix the mold problem‚Ä¶  By the way, another complex owned by the same company on the other side of town had a news story this past year about tenants with unresolved mold issues...."

My parent passed away 7 years ago. I was 18 at the time, and She left me a half the monetary value of the house, and the ownership name was put under my uncles (to make up the 2nd half) and specified on the will that I was to have access to these funds as of my 25th birthday. This is now coming up in 2 weeks, and my uncle hasn't made any moves towards taking out a mortgage nor has he put the house up for sale.  My last communication with him was in September 2016.. I have been attempting to get in touch with him semi-regularly since, as a reminder that we are nearing the deadline. The notary isn't helpful, and the executor of the will (my great aunt), is not doing her due diligence as she should have taken matters into her own hands and put the house up on the market. Not only has this been going on for 7 years.. but for the first 5 years, my uncle (lives in the house/lived with me but we do not get along and he kicked me out right) had been renting rooms out to people... one of them being a friend of a family-friend, and another being my cousin. He never once split the rent with me, which he should have been putting towards the succession, which he claimed he had been putting the money towards renovations for the house. This was a lie. He did not invest in the house with the rent money at all, and has in fact been reimbursed from the succession for the money invested on renovations as they are intended to help the sale of the house. He has ceased communications since last fall, meanwhile I've spent my entire adult life waiting for this to be over.   Basically, It's looking like this 25-year-old is needing to hire a lawyer under contingency. Has anyone had a similar experience to this that would be able to advise me?  I'm located in Montreal, QC.   Any help is appreciated.	No
Hello. I would just like some information about something that happened to me and my friends when we were young teenagers. I tried to use google to get information but it was confusing and not specific towards my situation. I'm using a throwaway since I don't want this attached to my main profile. I think this is the correct sub for my questions. Our interactions were during 2008. We lived in Ohio and John lived in South Carolina.   He met my friend Julie over Xbox online chat. John was friends with Julie's older brother and she was using her brothers account. He said he was 21 and she said she was 15 (she was really 13) he talked to her and they developed a romantic relationship. Flirting and talking to each other and all that. Julie introduced us to him so we could get to know him. Sarah was 14 with over protective parents, and she felt uneasy and unsure about him. I was 14 and wanted to get to know him and make sure he was ok. As I got to know him I would ask him questions and advice about growing up and boys and sex.  I still have some copies of some of our chats over gmail but most of our messaging was over aim. I accidentally revealed Julie was actually 13. He was upset about it and didn't want to talk to her anymore, but eventually got over it and continued to talk to us. Over time our messaging got more dirty and we would talk on the phone as well. I know he was romantically dating my friend and I'm a shitty person for getting flirty and intimate with him. Eventually he taught me how to have phone sex. At the end of one of the early sessions he said if I told anyone he'd kill me. I freaked out a little but he said he was only joking. We had phone sex regularly. I still have some of the chats on my gmail were I was talking about me moaning and him liking it. We even talked about that when he could finally come up to see Julie about the possibility of him and I having sex.  He stopped having phone sex abruptly with me. He said he was feeling guilty about having phone sex with me while being in a relationship with Julie. I've always wondered if he started having phone sex with her and was just done with me, but I never asked her about it. I've never told Julie about any of this. We've lost touch but we're still friends on Facebook, I figured I might ask her about it since we're not close friends anymore so I wouldn't have to worry about loosing anything with her lol.  Eventually our families found out we were talking to strangers on the internet. The three of us got in a lot of trouble over it. I told my family I was talking to him to make sure he was a nice guy and wasn't going to hurt Julie. I never mentioned the sexual conversations or the phone sex to them and denied that anything like that ever happened. The guy we were talking to ended up blocking us.  I don't know if I have any options right now. I'm not too affected by it, just kind of disturbed and disgusted. I know this definitely probably helped to promote my promiscuity as a teenager, but other stuff happened when I was as an even younger child so that probably helped to encourage my promiscuity too, but that's a different fucked up story lol.  Mostly I'm concerned if he did anything to Julie but I can just talk to her about it. My biggest concern is if he would do something like this again to someone else.  I have a handful of chats from my gmail account, I never delete anything. I've also had the same cell phone number since I was 13 so maybe phone records can be reviewed.  I don't really think I can press charges. I'm just worried about him doing it again to someone else.  I know Julie's older brother was talking to Johns younger sister for a while as well, even after our families found out about John. I know he was in a really terrible car accident a couple of years before he talked to us, and he showed us an article about it and it had the name he gave us, so I'm pretty sure he never lied about his name. I know he was becoming a Christian and I think he was involved or going to a Christian school. I think he said he was going to write a book about his accident and his relationship with god. Do you think I should report what happened? Who would I report it to? Would they even be able to find evidence against him or find him? I know I have 2 chats from 2008 about us talking and planning on having phone sex.  What do you guys think?	No
Our landlord scheduled for exterior brick work to be done on the apartment I live in and work started before we were notified and able to remove personal property from our balcony, resulting in concrete dust covering our edible plants making them inedible (at least $500 in herb, tomato, other veggie plants [purchase price of plants not potential price of grown produce, not including labor cost in care]) as well as damaging furniture on the balcony that can't be washed. Landlord says that they are not liable at all, and that renter's insurance is our only option (which I do have, more than enough to cover damages). Is the landlord responsible to compensate for damages? How about the dust that got into our apartment since the windows were open and we were gone without any advance notification of the work starting? Do we have a case for compensation with that part of our property being completely unusable? Any case for health damages for inhalation of concrete/brick dust?  Long story short- we were notified about the work after the damage is done. Are we responsible to cover the damages or do we have a case for compensation for property, cleanliness, and/or health?  Live in North Dakota if that is relevant for laws or anything. Thanks!	No
Suburbs of Denver They live in a duplex. Both sisters rent out their own side of the duplex. Sister #2 is getting evicted for not paying rent. Landlord in a text said that the children are not allowed back on the property of Sister #1's side. Is this legal?	No
"I apologize if this is in the wrong sub, but I'm having a hard time locating one more appropriate on mobile at work.  A note about the situation: my roommate currently is not on the lease. I am. This is in Nevada. My girlfriend is also not on the lease but lives there with my verbal agreement. My son is visiting from out of town. The roommate in question is an extremely heavy drinker, felon, and has tendencies toward anger and manipulation.  So this has been a long couple of weeks. For the past few months my roommate has been moving from disrespectful to rude to harassing to threatening. My schedule recently shifted from late nights to early mornings and I asked him to respect that. Since then I've averaged about 4-6 hours of sleep per night, damaging my work and personal relationships. He contributes to that in a large way by slamming doors throughout the house, harassing me, making noise in communal areas right next to my room (which I can't close the door to because the air conditioner doesn't blow to my room), and making phone calls on speaker right outside my door.  Essentially I broke recently when he was standing in my doorway calling me names while my son was sleeping on an air mattress at the foot of my bed because we're uncomfortable with him being around my roommate lately.   I asked him to leave the next day via text and he responded with ""I get mail there."" I sent him a text that said ""consider this your 30 days notice."" Then he said he would stay the duration of the lease, dropping it down to September at the absolute earliest. His sudden change of gears had me thinking something was up.  He came home that night and said he never received any notice asking him to leave and he absolutely refuses to leave under any circumstance and he has been researching his legal rights as a tenant. He also said he never harassed me as I had no proof or recorded evidence as it never happened (except non-emergency police confirmed the next day my suspicions that my live-in girlfriend who witnessed this harassment could constitute legal evidence and sign a statement saying otherwise). He said try to make him leave and I was living in a fantasy world where nothing I say is real. I took screen shots of everything he said that night and my polite terms of his exit from the apartment.  Later that night I got a text that said essentially he was sorry for being such a jerk and he appreciates the 30 days and he would be out as soon as he could.  After more research, it looked like my notice wouldn't hold legal weight if I left it at a text message. Everyone I talked to said he probably realized I had no legal leg to stand on and in 30 days when I asked him to leave as per his agreement he could change his mind and I'd be stuck for another 30 days. So I looked up what was required and got essentially a form letter off the internet giving him date of service, date of exit, reason for eviction, and a witness signature. I saw on the website that it wasn't necessary to get it notarized if there was a witness. I had my dad (only person in town who he didn't know personally that I could grab on short notice) serve it to him at work (the only place I could track him down as he spent only late evening hours at home when I had to be asleep for work). I understand this was probably uncomfortable for him but at the same time, I'm at the point where I nearly broke my lease because He's impossible to live with.  Last night his sister (my good friend who introduced us as we both needed a place and it was convenient) called me to inform me that my service was unlawful and he could escalate it if he desired and ""hopefully he won't."" That he had apologized before the moment of service and there was no reason to serve him, let alone a non-notarized notice to evict which he could sue me for fraud by serving that to him. I really want to call her and tell her that was unfair but now I'm not sure what good that would do. I also have about $250-300 worth of stuff at her house that I want to get back if I'm going to not be able to go over there anymore but don't want to worsen the situation.  I feel broken and tired and can't think straight anymore and I'm exhausted physically and mentally. I just need some advice if anyone has any. I know it probably doesn't sound like much of a big deal to everyone else but I've spent the last 6+ months spending 95% of my time in my room avoiding this guy and his rules and yelling and insults and I don't feel safe in the apartment.  Sorry if this is disjointed, I just woke up and started spewing out as much as I could think to put down. I would appreciate any advice on how to proceed.  TL;DR: My roommate refused to leave when I asked, then changed his mind, then I served him with a 30-days notice his sister called and claimed I could be sued for fraud with."	No
So this happened in Kentucky but I currently live in Indiana. I was sideswiped by a car last September while I was pulling out of a parking spot on the side of the street. The police made a report. I had insurance, the other party said they had insurance but didn't have the information on them. Anyway, I got the car repaired and paid my $500 deductible and it's fine.   I've been waiting for my insurance company to repay my deductible but they haven't yet. I called them and apparently they've been trying to get the money back from the other party but they haven't been able to yet. They said they have 2 years from the accident date to get it back. They also told me I could go to small claims court and get back the $500 that way.  My question is, is it worth it? Would I need to hire a lawyer who I would have to pay if I even got the $500 back? Should I just wait?	No
"I'm located in Oregon. Let's say my dad's name is ""John Doe"".  John Doe passed away several years ago, and the house he purchased (that we currently live in) was transferred into the John Doe Revocable Trust. The house still has a mortgage that still has John Doe's name (not the trust). The deed of the house according to the county clerk's office has ""John Doe Revocable Trust"" as the owner.  The John Doe Revocable Trust has three trustees - my mom, my sister and I. We have documentation declaring this.   All three of us have agreed that we would like to have the house just in my name since currently, I'm making the mortgage payments and I have decent credit, and neither my mom nor sister feel they are in a position to be able to take responsibility for the property.   **What are the steps needed in order to get the house transferred out of being under the Trust's name and just under my name? And, with as minimal cost as possible?**   Here are the steps that I have figured out based on researching, but I would like to know if I am missing something, or if there is something else I need to consider:   1. Find a blank Quit Claim Deed form and fill in the info to show transfer of the property from the Trust (Grantor) to my name (Grantee).   2. Have all three of us trustees sign the Quit Claim Deed under a Notary.  3. Take Deed Form to County Clerk's Record office to get it recorded.   4. Submit deed showing new title of ownership to the mortgage bank who can transfer mortgage over to my name.   ----------------------------------------------------------------- Questions I have:   1. Are there any tax or other financial implications that I need to be aware of when this transfer happens? (other than fee for recording office, etc.)   2. There seem to be a lot of ""buy a deed form"" websites where you fill in the info then pay $30-$50 to print the form. I'd rather just write one up and format it myself and save the money if I can. Is there any trusted website or place that indicates what language *should* be on the quit claim form?   3. Are there any steps above that I'm completely missing?"	No
Hi /r/legaladvice, I am a single child of two immigrants now living in Maricopa County. Since I understand the most English, they look to me for help regarding this stuff. A bit of background: My parents combined make &lt;40k/year (even now) but through bring frugal they managed to pay off their first home quite some time ago (&gt;5 years ago). Living on a new property, they started renting that home a few years back (3-4 years ago).  Though I was a minor, I tried to help them with lease agreements, etc since I understood the most English. Obviously in hindsight, it would've been best to look for a lawyer. However, they are the type to handle things under their own purview and due to their own ignorance and my own, we failed to notice that one must register the property as residential/rental. [See here for specific law](http://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/33/01902.htm).  I found out about the law this morning and informed my parents who are willing to comply with the law. Now my parents are looking at some hefty fines (at least, for their income level) of $1000 + $100/mo of not having the house registered while renting. They plan to cease renting soon (current tenants are not under lease, so I believe it's at-will?) and we all want to make sure we're not missing anything that could bite us later.  Regarding registering the property w/ the County Assessor's office, their current plan is to come forward to the office and pay the fine in full, then register the house as a rental residential. Then proceed to ask tenants to leave (with a month's notice at least) before registering back to residential (which will remain empty and not rented). My parents want to avoid hiring a lawyer since they believe it will just tack on a lot of additional $$$, but I can see where using one can be worth it to avoid a lot of hassle.  [Link to County Assessor's Rental Registration FAQ Page](https://mcassessor.maricopa.gov/faq/faq-rental-registration.php)  Is the problem best handled with my parent's current plan, or should they look for a lawyer? What types of lawyer would be best for the job (looking for specific titles to google)? What sort of advice/services should we seek and the ballpark fees for such help?  Separately would the fact on how the house was improperly registered impact my parent's past taxes (well, the taxes of the breadwinner of my parents)? Should we also be looking into a tax-related lawyer?	No
I have a roommate who moved out a month early and gave me 4 days notice. He intended to use his security deposit to cover his rent and I arranged for that to happen with the landlord because I could not afford to cover it myself. After that he began dodging my calls and ignoring my texts and owes me for his share of May and June GRU and cox for June. In total he owes me $264.   He didn't provide an address to reach him and was not on the lease (an arrangement the landlord agreed to)but I have pictures of his mail proving he lived in my house. I'd like to figure out how to go about getting my money. I know it doesn't seem like much but my second roommate is now skipping out on the final two GRU bills so I gotta go after at least one of them to make up a little for $500 in losses overall. Any input would be welcome.	No
Hi, I've been contracting full-time for a local firm. Recently they hired a new contractor who insists that they, their, and they're be used as the person's pronouns. The person also does not want to be referred to as man, or guy.   Though I don't mind trying to use said pronouns, it got me wondering about the legal rights an individual has to insist on using specific pronouns in a work environment. NYC if it makes a difference.	No
In the fall of 2015 I found myself in a situation where I needed to get a new car. The car that I had been driving needed so much work done to it, that for me it wasn‚Äôt worth fixing. At the time I was also taking care of medical bills that had piled up while I was out of work the previous year, and my credit wasn‚Äôt in the place it is now, so I couldn‚Äôt get approved for a loan myself. My girlfriend at the time offered to take a car loan out in her name that I would make the payments on. At the time there was no signed agreement between her and I made regarding me making the payments, and my name wasn‚Äôt on the car loan whatsoever. I was only an insured driver on her policy, something she did to make her own insurance less expensive, while also making it easier on me. I drove the car and made the payments on time every month for a year, until September of 2016.   Long story short, she was unhappy in the relationship and suggested I move out, which lead to us ultimately breaking up very shortly after I moved out. Of course, this resulted in me returning the car to her. She decided to sell the car at a loss very quickly so she didn‚Äôt have to deal with it, while making me feel as though I had to reimburse her for the money she lost on the sale. She drafted up an agreement at the time, saying the amount that I owed her, with a payment plan. Having been completely blindsided by her request to me move out, I wasn‚Äôt in a clear headspace and very depressed. I was out of the apartment that I had lived in for two years, she kept both of our cats that we had (one of which was MY LIFE), and I had no car.   For reasons I can‚Äôt explain now, I felt obligated to agree to and sign her agreement. I have begrudgingly sent her a check for $200 every month for the past 14 months, all the while thinking the agreement that we have is unfair. I‚Äôve done some research on signed agreements, and feel as though hers has holes in it, but am not sure. The agreement doesn‚Äôt detail what the money is for. The agreement provides an address that I am to send the payment to, but that has changed since the agreement began. (One of the bullet points on the agreement state ‚ÄúAny modifications to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.‚Äù) I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm legally obligated to pay her back for a car she sold that didn‚Äôt have my name anywhere on it, especially since there was no signed agreement in the beginning, when I originally got the car.    I have a copy of the agreement, and can retype (changing names) and send as a PM.	No
I am an international student currently enrolled in a University in CA. I had signed up for a 1 year lease for accommodation for my stay here. No actual pictures / sq-footage was provided upon request before I signed the lease but the place had great reviews on yelp/g-maps so we decided to go ahead given that there was a shortage of accomodations. Unfortunately upon arrival the place was too small for all of us, and we asked a few students if we can bail on the lease against the security deposit, to which we were informed that it does happen at times and shouldnt be a problem (I should have taken legal advice here itself).  Based on this info we decided to take a new place and signed up another lease for a year, and then decided to break the older place's lease (I wanted to break the lease before signing a new one but there is a shortage of accomodation so we decided to take this step first) - but the landlord has threatened to sue me if I do that. I am looking for alternative roommates to take my spot and settle this peacefully if I can. We cannot afford 2 places and are already burneded with student loans. Upon discussing this with a few friends, I have been suggested to default on the lease and handover possession of the apartment but I don't want to be sued for a lot more money than the actual rent.  Regarding defaults, the lease basically states that : 1. Failure of me paying rent / agreeing to this contract classifies as a default. 2. 3 days after owner gives a written notice (demanding that I pay rent or quit or cure default or quit pursuant to CCP Sec 1161 and 1162), this lease can be terminated at owners option, provided I fail to comply with owners demand. 3. After termination, owner shall have resident expressly grants to owner (what does this even mean?), the right to enter and take possession of the premises, exclude resident there from and store for 30 days, then sell the resident's surrendered personal property located therein.  Please advice, does it make sense to surrender ownership? Will I face legal trouble? Do I have any other options? I come from a poorer country and paying rent for 2 places is not going to be easy :(	No
Hey guys, so here's the deal: I was involved in an incident last week. I dont really want to call it an accident, but there is damage to my car. I was on the highway late night / early morning in extremely foggy conditions when I come up on a badly damaged car in the middle of the road with no lights on. Naturally I swerve to avoid hitting the car, but end up running over some of the debris from their accident. I pull over to assess damages to my car and don't notice any right away. I walk to the other car to see if there was anyone there (there was) and offer to drive them to the nearest gas station less than a minute away so they could report the accident (neither me nor them had a phone). As I'm about halfway home I hear an awful griding noise coming from under my car, I get home and check under and notice some damage to the tire rod housing.  I called the police to get information about the crash to give to my insurance and find out that the other party never called it in and didn't have a valid ID. I give them all the information I could and they call back a couple hours later stating that the other party was found and arrested and I can come get a crash report.  Now on this crash report, it states that the other party is from out of state, and has insurance. I called the insurance company listed and they say they have no policy that matches the number or name for the other party, which leads me to believe they either lied to the police about which company or they don't have any at all.  What are my options from here? I'm hesitant to file a claim with my own insurance for concern that my coverage will increase in price.  Sorry if this is in the wrong subreddit as well! Thanks.	No
Hi, I live in Arizona and I've told my apartment complex that my A/C is broken but they haven't fixed it yet. It's passed 48 hours now and I've told them again but no fix. Is there anything I can do?	No
I'm in Florida.   So I was arrested for failure to appear. While incarcerated the jail didn't give me my medicine and I had a seizure from withdrawal from Zoloft.   I broke my finger and had to had two surgeries, then the wound became infected while again incarcerated for failure to appear.   It's a shit sandwich. But is the county/jail responsible for my seizure, broken finger, two surgeries bill?	No
We're currently renting a house and it is infested with fleas. We toured the house before singing the lease but didn't feel any fleas at the time. We signed the lease a few days later and went on vacation for a week. We met up with the landlord at the house on June 15 to pick up keys. That's when he told us about the flea infestation. We ended up delaying our move-in date until the problem was gone.    Well we just moved in over the weekend and there are still fleas. We had an exterminator come by on Monday. This is the 4th treatment.   Is this considered an unlivable condition? The landlord did not give us a copy of our lease, so we can't go back and read it until he gives us a copy. We are wanting to break the lease ASAP. Already looking at other houses.	No
"I live in Omaha, Nebraska. My old apartment charged me rent for the month of July, but my last day of residency was June 30th 2017. Due to another semi-unexpected expense, this overdrafted my account by a fair amount and I have so far been charged 2 overdraft fees and will likely have an ""extended overdraft"" fee added on before I am paid and can be back in the black. Rent was set up to be paid automatically through their web portal, and I had not cancelled it, thinking it was unnecessary as I had signed all the paperwork to move out.   The property manager had called me July 3rd, telling me the automatic system had charged me, I went to my bank to try and stop payment, but it appears it was too late. I contacted my bank Friday to file a dispute, and then contacted the property owned Monday. They agreed to pay back the amount, but denied responsibility and so would not pay the overdraft fee, claiming it was my responsibility to cancel the payment. I wasn't happy with that, but $35 didn't seem worth the hassle and cancelled the dispute with my bank. Now that it is 2 fees, as a second bill came due before I was paid, and potentially a 3rd fee, I'm less inclined to accept that and considering my options, if I have any. I was wondering if I am indeed liable for not cancelling the autopay set up through their portal, and if I am not, if this would be worth pursuing in small claims or through my bank."	No
I just rented a two floor apartment in NYC, the top floor is the ground floor level and the lower floor is below ground - this floor has three doors out of the apartment, but no windows. My landlord told us when we signed the lease that the basement is intended for recreational use only, but not to be used as a bedroom. Is this something they're allowed to legally enforce?	No
"My Fiancee and I were on driving back home from Montreal to NJ yesterday morning, July 30. Literally around 10 miles after crossing the border from Canada back into the US, I got pulled over for speeding, 80 mph in a 65 mph highway (I-87). My question is if it's worth it fight the ticket, whether driving back for the court date or hiring an attorney. A few bullets below:  * Last speeding ticket in NY was like August 17, 2014. * Had a speeding ticket in CT in Feb 2015, but it was reduced to a ""traffic violation"" * I live right by NYC, so it would be a 5 hour drive to the local courthouse. * Worried about the fine/points since it would technically be within 3 years of my last conviction. * As stated, it was 80 in a 65. * I was driving with a couple of cars near me on a Sunny, clear morning. * I was driving in the left lane and slowed down once I saw the officer.  So what do you guys think, would it be worth it to fight it, or just pay it and plead guilty?"	No
In California. I told roommate (via text) that I would take care of all cleaning matters, she refused and said she had a right to clean the apartment as well. I wrote back to her stating that I would be out of town for two weeks and she was more than welcome to clean what I didn't get to. I returned to the apartment and she didn't clean anything. We have 3 days left on the lease and I'm curious if it's possible that she spoke to the landlord and made it seem like I should be charged for everything that is not done. I cannot ask her because she will not answer me and the landlord is very busy and does not respond right away.   TL;DR: Can roommate privately ask the landlord to charge me for certain things that pertain to our common space?	No
I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up.  He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.    Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car.  He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point...  I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt.  I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor.  I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes.  Will they take me in for my warrant?  Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted?  Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order?  Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing.  I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.  My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school.  Is this a good plan?  Thank you	No
I was fired from my job as a health inspector at a county government in Illinois. I was told it was because I was not performing to expectations. I was on a 6 month probationary period and at 5 1/2 months through it, and would not have protection from the union until 6 months. I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me.   I work very little with my bosses (the director and assistant director of the division), and instead work closely with senior people who work as trainers. In the 5.5 months I received no formal performance review or corrective action.   I was part of a harassment investigation, against the director of the division as I witnessed him say something sexist to another coworker. This was the second harassment investigation against the director.   There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire.   Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires.   The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women).   Do I have a case for retaliation since I was fired being part of a harassment investigation? Do I have a case for wrongful termination since there was little to no documentation about corrective action and heterosexual employees, who performed worse than me were retained.   If I do have a case, what do I do next?	No
So back in 2007 I moved out of the apartment I shared with my boyfriend at the time. He had thrashed a bunch of my belongings during a rough breakup and I had filed a police report, but eventually dropped the charges the police were planning on filing (domestic violence). He continued to live there, and I moved on. I NEVER signed the lease, but had agreed to be listed as an occupant - I don't recall if that involved giving them my social security number but they must have had it because when my ex left the apartment he did so a month early and didn't pay that rent. When I got the call from collections (now living in CA) I was super confused and asked if his name was also on the debt. They said no, it was just me.  Yes, I've waited a LONG ASS time to do anything, mostly because I have moved states a couple of times and have not been financially in a position to pursue him legally. I've asked him a couple of times to do the ethical thing and pay me the $700 but he is cheap and mean and will not.  At this point I get I may not have legal recourse, but just curious if this was even legal to do to a non-lease holder and would there be any way to remove the debt?	No
A few of my friends are looking to end their lease a month early and move out but per the rental agreement, cannot post online to get sub-letters for the month. Other people can post for them, provided they don't include the renter's names but other than that the renters have to use 'word of mouth.'   Is this legal? If not, why on earth would someone include that in a lease? Is this common?   Thanks!	No
Hi all, please advise; I am losing my mind! I rented a condo in South Florida that upon initial walk-through, seems updated and fairly well kept. On the first day of move-in I noticed a few bugs and once night fell, realized that there was a very serious problem. The landlord refuses to take responsibility for a roach infestation that has obviously been ongoing since prior to move. The catch is that under Landlord-Tenant Responsibilities in the lease, it states that tenant is required to conduct Pest Control. However, if I had known that there was such a serious issue, I never would have signed the lease! I feel duped and now my landlord is saying it‚Äôs my problem to fix. I cannot and do not sleep there. I had to remove my dog as well. Now the condo association is calling me and saying my dog is a nuisance to neighbors when neither of us live there! Doesn‚Äôt Implied Warranty of Habitability mean that the landlord is required to hand over the apartment in livable shape? Aren‚Äôt they also violating health code? Does this fall under a major repair +$200; meaning that the landlord should be addressing this?  I have hired a lawyer but would like to hear other advice and know if anyone has dealt with something similar? Thanks in advance!	No
Hello,  I need some advice on getting out of purchasing a condo. I have put a 20k deposit down on a $408,000 condo (Mississauga, Ontario). I am still waiting to hear confirmation from the bank in regards to a loan (home equity loan instead of a mortgage). The thing is my husband who is the breadwinner has been cheating and I cannot move into a condo with him knowing this. The condo and all paperwork would be in my name. Move in date was supposed to be Sept 01/2017.  Can anyone please provide any information on whether I can get out of this?	No
Hello, I entered into an illegal sublet agreement with the lease holder in February, 2017 who had taken a security deposit and overcharged us on bills. However, while moving in we were notified by the landlord that the lease holder had no permission to do this and we signed under a new sublet agreement with the landlord with an additional deposit.  We had to end our sublet earlier than the termination date and the lease holder doesn't want to come back to finish her lease, wants us to remove all of her furniture and items, and is refusing to give back our security deposit.   We found out about the bills when we found out from the landlord that the rent is $400 cheaper than what the lease holder demanded, but after discussing with her we relented to just paying her that amount, even without proof of receipts. Stupid, I know, but I was naive and she was adamant and pregnant so we just dropped it.   Can we sue them for the overpaid bills and the lack of security deposit or is it null because we signed into a sublet with the landlord? As a subletter am I responsible for terminating the sublet early? I have the lease agreement (with the landlord because I'm assuming the one signed with the lease holder is void) and to me it seems like there isn't a clause about such an event except for one part which I'm not sure if it says that I am the responsible one for the termination or if it is the lease holder's responsibility. From websites I've looked at it seems that it's not the subletter responsibility.  Other than ending early, we've been as helpful as we can and the landlord initially told us she empathized with us and that she would give back our additional security we had given to management, but now I think that the lease holder lied to her and now the landlord is saying she can't guarantee it. They've been coming in and out with repairmen and showing the apartment while we've been here busy packing so it's been a bit of a bother as well.  We're both not well off financially so I don't know how much it would cost to sue or how we can go about getting our security back, if we even can.  Very sorry about the long wall of text. Any information and advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.	No
Ok, so I'm a beneficiary to a generational skipping trust. We have inlaws that are for a lack of better words disruptive as well as aggressive towards some of the blood descendents Whom the trust designates as a beneficiary. I've considered calling hotel security to have them removed from the room as I assume they are not legally entitled to the information in the meeting when they get outta hand. Outside of this, what is the legal option to have them removed from the room entirely? Jokes aside please as I knew most people can't stand their inlaws.	No
Hello,  2 days ago I leased an apartment, got everything paid for, and this friday i was going to move in everything I owned from my current apartment.  I live with my girlfriend (now ex) and she has become a complete nightmare. Even physically abusive (lots of scratching) and instigates verbal fights at least 3 times a day. I wanted to remove her name from the lease and not let her move in to my new apartment. I'm the only one paying for every single one of our expenses (she doesn't contribute a single cent) so I'd still be able to afford the apartment anyways. She doesn't want to move out because she would have to go back to her moms house and she wants to stay in the apartment where she can be a a tyrant and be extremely abusive to get things her way (her mom controlled her instead when she lived at her mom's house). I want to know what I can do to kick this person out while avoiding having to sue her or taking her to court on abuse charges. The reason for that is that I just want to get a far away from her as possible and never have to deal with her again.	No
Given the recent tweets by the president that say that transgender people can no longer serve in the military, what is going to happen to those of us who are openly trans?  My background is that I have a medically approved transition plan from the military, and my ID card and all my legal documents reflect my new gender. Will I be kicked out? Will I be subject to UCMJ charges or court martial? Since my transition (minus surgery which I choose to skip) is basically complete can I stay in as my new gender? If I do get separated, can I re-enlist in the future if the next president changes the policy? Can I de-transition to stay in?  Should I start talking to JAG now, or get a civilian lawyer?	No
I received papers about a property that was foreclosed on. I lived there 12 years ago and will not be returning. Needless to say I cannot go back to reclaim the possessions and they are not of high value to me. Location: US Territory Virgin Islands. Is the term to go in and remove all the contents by court representatives or is there more to the term than this? I cannot afford legal fees.	No
"So as the title states I bought a used truck from a used car dealership and they claimed they would be sending the title to my bank since they are the lein holders. My bank says they have a copy of the title but not the original. I've just found out that the dealer went out of business when I texted the salesman who sold me the vehicle after the dealer phone hasn't been picked up for a while, and he told me ""they went out of business I dont work there anymore you gotta do what you gotta do."" I bought this vehicle in the state of Connecticut and I live in rhode island. Basically I am wondering what on earth I have to do to get my hands on a title. It is an 07 and needs a title to be registered still. What I have come up with to do so far is to find out who the owner of the business was and contact them and see if they have it. Does anyone know how i would find out who opened the business? Is it public record anywhere or anything like that? Also do I contact either the RI or CT dmv's about this? And can they even do anything for me? I will be letting my bank know as soon as they open in the morning since they are the lein holders on the vehicle. If there is anything else I can do please let me know I only have until the 17th until my temporary plates expire. The only information the business had to contact them was 1 landline phone and nothing else. The phone is off/disconnected and have no other way to contact them as the salesman isnt getting back to me anymore I have had the vin checked and it is supposedly a clean vehicle even though this situation is very sketchy. If anyone is interested in going past advice and doing some sleuthing the business was called Atlantic motors based in waterbury CT. Thanks in advance for any advice or help  This was originally posted in personal finance and removed so I reposted here. Thank you to the people that gave some advice in the now removed personal finance thread and thank you in advance to anyone that can help me out here."	No
"tl;dr:  - Moved to US in 2010 as mom's dependent on H4 Visa  - Applied for Change of Status to F1 in December 2016 - Aged out of H4 this year (2017) aka H4 status expired the day before my 21st birthday since children over 21 cannot be defendants  - Received an RFE from USCIS in June in reference to the gap between the expiration of my nonimmigrant status (H4) to F1 start date (June 5th)  - Responded to RFE, and was suggested by the attorney with the option to leave to go to home country (India) to go for an in person visa interview for F1  - Don't want to take that option because of the lack of strong ties to home country  - need advice on next steps   ---   I (then 14yrs old) moved to US in 2010 with my mom as her  dependent on H4 visa. H1B and H4 were set to be renewed every 3yrs, and ours was renewed in 2010, then 2013, and then 2016. When it was renewed in 2016, my H4 expiration date was set to the day before my 21st birthday, which was earlier this year (2017).   I applied for change of status (I-539) in late Dec 2016 to F1 visa with the Vermont Service Center, so I can continue to reside in US to finish my studies, since one can no longer be a dependent after they turn 21 hence why my H4 visa expired the day before my birthday.   My initial start date for my F1 visa was Jan 9th (beginning of Spring Semester), which was then deferred to June 5th (beginning of the summer semester) since F1 wasn't approved by the time registration period had ended for the spring semester. And my start date was again deferred to Aug 21st (beginning of Fall semester) because F1 still hadn't been approved by the time registration ended for the summer semester. This deferral process is necessary to prevent the automatic cancellation of my change of status application.   USCIS processing times for change of status is currently at the least 6 months but can take up to 9 months. I continued to attend school and patiently waited for USCIS to process my case and get back to me. I had been checking my status and the processing times periodically and was hoping to get an approval by mid or late July. Instead, on June 8th, USCIS sent a Request for Evidence (RFE). The RFE was issued because there is more than 30 days gab between the end of my non-immigrant status (H4) that I am switching from and the start date of my F1 - which at this time was June 5th, but was then moved to Aug 21st. The request had referred to guidances April 6th and on May 10th ""reaffirming that nonimmigrants seeking to change their status to F1, M1, or J1 maintain their nonimmigrant status up to 30 days before their program start date by filing additional Form(s) I-539 to extend their nonimmigrant status while their change of status is pending."" We looked up these guidances and found them to be specific to B1/B2 visas, and even then, as someone that has aged out of H4, I cannot file additional forms to extend that nonimmigrant status.   We worked with an attorney to respond to the RFE (the response was due by July 10th). USCIS can take up to 60 days to respond to the RFE, so I can expect a response by Sept 10th - which unfortunately happens to be after the beginning for the Fall semester and if the response is a denial, then I have to leave the country right away leading to me having to abandon my studies and having to try to return back for Spring semester. The argument made in the RFE response is that (1) when I filed the I-539 in Dec with a stare date in Jan, I was more than 30 days away from the expiration of my nonimmigrant status; (2) The school had to defer my start date to the start date of the next semester in compliance with SEVP guidances; and (3) I aged out of my H4 status and thus cannot apply for an extension; thus USCIS should grant my change of status should be approved. I also have a chronic ear condition that I am under care for and had a surgery in May for, and will need another surgery soon for cochlear implants. I need to be under periodic long term car for my ear condition. In addition to supporting documents from school, etc. regarding the response we also sent in my medical records.  The secondary advice provided by my attorney is that if my change of status application is not approved or even before they have a chance to reject my application that I travel to my home country (India) and go for a visa interview there to get my F1 approved and return back to US.   The problem I have with this suggestion is that I believe that it's going to complicate the scenario. As mentioned previously, I moved to US in 2010 and have not been back to India since. I have very little ties in India. Even my Indian passport has my US address on it because I had to renew it here in US and we didn't have enough proof to retain our Indian address on there. I do not have a bank account in India, or I might have a minor account under my mom. I have family in India, but don't have any contact with them because of family drama/ problems. I do not have a driver's license or any other sort of identification. One of the major requirements when applying for a nonimmigrant visa is to show strong ties to your home country, which I severely lack. This is the main reason why I am terrified to go with this option of going to India to go for a visa interview for F1. There are other time constraints as well, like for instance, I need to return back to US by Aug 21st or else I might not be allowed back at the border. Just scheduling visa interviews takes time, and I not sure if I am going to be able to get a slot to get everything done and return by the 21st even if the strong ties to home country issues is to slide by.   I need advice on next steps. What are the other options I have? What else should I consider? If it comes down to that I have to go to India to get my F1 approved, how can I show strong ties given the situation?"	No
"Driving at the start of May of this year in South Florida, I rear ended another 2017 Toyota at about 25 mph. There were no injuries reported at the scene of the accident, my 2004 Toyota sustained most of the damage, and I received a ticket for careless driving which was dismissed in court. The couple in the car I hit is middle-aged and they repeatedly and emphatically stated their lack of injury for three hours while the police officer was at the scene. About a month after the accident, I was notified that the couple was claiming bodily injury (soft tissue damage) and was seeking money to cover their chiropractic treatment through my insurance. I'm 19 and had my own insurance policy at the time, but the couple (or their lawyer I suppose) also tried to get compensation through my mother's insurance. We just received notice that my mother's insurance ""hereby disclaims and denies any and all liability or obligation to you and to others under policy number ... issued to you."" Does this mean that the couple can now retain their own lawyer to come after me personally? I'm very nervous and stressed about this because I am supposed to be leaving Florida for college up North in a week and I would never be able to afford to pay these people for their supposed injuries. Thank you."	No
My roommates and I have a joint lease that ends in April. Recently, one roommate, who signed the lease, moved out without notice to the landlords. By him moving out, this makes each rent too high for any of us to afford. We lease from individuals, not a company. The landlords have attempted to contact the former roommate with no luck. I actually cannot afford to pay the rent and we have had no luck finding a subleaser. Do we have any rights? Or are we royally screwed?	No
This is in Brooklyn, NY. Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage.   Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,  The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.  When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.  The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife.   The body damage is just cosmetic so it wouldn't be thousands (I don't think) to fix, but it would be at least a few hundred, maybe more. I'm also really anxious about what was done in my car without me knowing and how often this might have happened. I am due to move out of state this Thursday, 7/13, so I'll be severing my relationship with the garage anyway, but I'd appreciate any advice on how best to proceed. Thanks!	No
I'm trying not to be too specific because this affects a good friend of mine, but does anyone know what the legal ramifications of living in affordable housing under false income information are?  Said friend's SO entered a housing game lottery for a SWANKY NYC apartment, but largely gets paid under the table and underreported their income. They also never told anyone that my friend moved in as well, so their income is not being counted at all.  As angry as I am with the friend for taking this housing from someone who really needs it, I definitely don't want to see this come back to bite them later.  Any insight?	No
"Work from home. Have MacBook. MacBook died today--against company policy to take it to Apple Store or anywhere other than our IT department. Problem is... I work for the top sales rep at the company (he's in CA but I'm in UT) and IT is based in TX... I leave for a week on Monday for Amsterdam which is not a vacation, as I planned to work the whole time there. My computer died this AM (hard drive issue on MacBook, never encountered it before) and my boss is insisting I need to take my vacation days since my computer is broken and they won't be able to fix it for ""some time"" (our IT dept is sooooo slow).... they COULD just ship me a loaner laptop to Amsterdam since our company is global and it wouldn't be an issue,,,. But my boss is legitimately trying to force me to take my vacation days ""since I'll be out of the country anyway"". Is that legal?!?!?"	No
So to me it seems pretty cut and dry, but the company I used to rent from decided to charge me the remaining rent on the lease even though I let them know in person and in writing over a month before our planned move out date. The reason I needed to break my lease was that I had military orders and I was separating from the Armed Forces. Charging me past the move out date violated the SCRA and also Florida statues.  I know I'm in the right AND I have supporting documents (Orders, letter of intent to vacate, etc), but they're making me jump through hoops to not have my credit affected.   My main question is, after working for weeks to reason with them, can I be justified writing a formal demand to compensate me for having to deal with this for weeks? In addition to them striking my debt of course. Thanks!	No
"Hello reddit!   So basically my friend needed to find out some regulations regarding a certain immigration topic in Belgium. She sent an email to a  belgian lawyer asking for help and she wrote ""please let me know how much your help would cost"".   After they exchanged 2-3 more emails(the lawyer completely ignored the request for a fee). In the latest email he just wrote saying he'd like 275 euros for the information his given so far.  So my question is can a lawyer ask for payment over this? With no written contract or agreement to pay? My friend is willing to pay but she feels that the lawyer was shady over his fee discussion and does not want to pay 275 but since this is a lawyer she is afraid of maybe some loophole she might be caught in Belgium laws.

I moved into my new apartment on Monday (the 24th). I finished moving the last of my things out and cleaning my old apartment on Tuesday and went to turn in my keys. The landlord wasn't there, but since it was about 1600 I figured she left a little early, since the office runs on normal business hours, M-F 8-5. I usually work those hours so my time to stop by is very limited. Wednesday I actually had to go in at 1100 instead, so I stopped by about 1000 and she still wasn't there. I tried to call, but no answer, so I just went to work. Yesterday I was off, so I stopped by around 1200, she still wasn't there, and there was a note from another tenant put into the door between it and the doorframe. Went home, did some things, stopped by again around 1500 and the note was still there, meaning she had not gone in. Tried to make a call, no answer. Stopped by again at 1630, note still there, phone call went straight to voicemail. I'm currently on my lunch break, went to stop by again, not there no answer on phone.   My lease ends on the 31st and my question is what legal trouble could I get in if I still haven't been able to turn in my keys by then? What actions can I take on the 31st before any legal actions are taken against me?	No
I was on a short time frame because my former landlords were selling their condo and I decided to move in with my buddy. I didn't know the building just got bought by a residential management firm. I didn't have a problem with it at first but now the whole building is under construction, every day of the week. I can't work from home anymore because of the noise and I can't sleep past 8 am on the weekends because they start hammering/drilling away then. I'm thinking about asking for 25% off my rent, is that out of line? Am I SOL?	No
I moved into an apartment with some damage to walls and doors, etc about a month ago. The device I used to document the damage broke, there are no back ups and I cannot recover them. I really don't want to get charged for it at the end of the lease (1 year). What should I do now?	No
Hello and thank you!  I recently tried to start driving for Uber/Lyft for some extra income, and they told me no due to my driving record... About 5 years ago I got ticket for driving with no insurance. Car wasn't mine, so I paid the fine and continued on with my life. Unbeknownst to me, the moment I paid the fine, my license was automatically suspended until I got an SR22 on my insurance. Well, a year goes by, and I get pulled over... now I have a driving while suspended. Once i figured out that nonsense, I got the SR22 and they reinstated my licence. I maintained the SR22 for 3 years and haven't had a ticket since. Is there any way to get this crap off my record? Please, I need help! :(	No
"Need advice due to conflicting info from fam/friends, also /r/personalfinance didn't like my post tagged with Employment.    I am of the opinion that since my former incarceration info is sealed that I may now maintain complete assurances that I have never been convicted of a crime or having been arrested. Anyone who Google searches may find old data, which is why some are telling me I should ""own up"" and be truthful if confronted about these in an interview. This is tantamount to waiving my rights which I think is a horrible idea.  Would an employer not be in gross violation of civil rights act and fair credit reporting act if it was even brought up in an interview?? How would I address this topic strongly and respectfully if confronted?  Wouldn't equal protection also mean my expungement would also apply to an employer for any other state in USA?  I am looking at my first few interviews soon since fully cleaning up my record and also earning my bachelors and I don't want to deal with nonsense."	No
Last July I was sentenced to two years supervised probation, an alcohol awareness class, and 100 hours of community service. Since then I have completed my hours and class. My probation officer said I am able, after the one year mark, to reappear in front of my judge to have my charges dropped. Although it is not a guarantee that the judge will agree to do so. I do not want to hire an attorney and put myself in (more of) a financial hole based on chance. Any advice or experiences that may help me as I go forward besides dress nice, be polite?  TLDR: Reappearing in court to have probation dropped, need advice on appearing in court by myself in front of judge.	No
"Hi legaladvice, I've been having some issues with my current landlord, which have reached a bit of a head today when she told me I will *not* be getting my damage deposit back, regardless of the condition of the room at the end of my tenancy.  Some context and backstory: I rent a single room with shared bathroom/kitchen/everything with seven other people and the landlord.  When I first applied, Mng (for manager) was living there instead of the owner of the house, HO, while HO was on vacation.  The ad advertised a single bedroom for rent from the dates of May 1st 2017 to September 1st 2017.  Mng interviewed me, and I got the place.    I signed a contract that's first clause was along the lines of ""this tenancy not covered by the tenancy act of BC and all protections afforded by it"".  I was desperate, and also fairly certain that you couldn't just do that.  It also outlined several other rules such as showers having a maximum run time of 10 minutes, one load of laundry a week, and a $5 charge for leaving dishes out, subtracted from the damage deposit.  It also explicitly stated that the length of tenancy was from May, to September.  Mng collected my damage deposit, gave me a receipt (at my request) and mentioned that in 2 months (July) HO wanted me to move into a different room.  I hadn't even moved in yet, so that was fine with me.  AFTER I signed the contract and we were making small talk, HO called Mng and said she wanted me to sign a year long lease when I moved rooms, and wanted Mng to swing that by me.  I refused, but said I'd be open to negotiate with HO when she came back, and I had moved into the other room.  My first two months with Mng were fine.  Ever since HO came back though it's been a nightmare.    When HO came back, she did NOT offer me the year long lease, so I figured that she was not into negotiating with me or had other plans.  Turns out, I was wrong.  She's been pretty horrible to me, which I'll expand on at the bottom, so as to try and get to the point.  Today, after going through my garbage and scolding me for having McDonald's paper cups in my garbage and not recycling them, she mentioned that she was only coaching me because I was ""going to be here for a long, long time."".  What.  I told her right away that I was supposed to move out on September 1st, and had already made plans to do so.    She was incensed.  She told me that when I moved into the new room, that was implicitly agreeing to the year long lease.  If I moved on September 1st, she'd be keeping my damage deposit, in full, as reparations for breaking my lease that I never signed nor saw.  I told her that from the very beginning I had only planned to be here until September, and I had at no point done anything that would imply I would like to stay longer, and had in fact only done the exact opposite.  I told her that even the contract that I signed said until September 1st.  She told me that that contract was between me and ""the House"" not between me and her.  There is no mention of this House character throughout the entirety of the contract that I signed.  I asked her how the House was going to pay me my damage deposit, to which she said I had to take that up with Mng.  She told me that when she came back from holidays that she ""cleaned [her] hands of all of that business with [Mng]"" and she was not involved in anything to do with Mng.  She let me know that her and I had no agreements between us,  and no contracts.  I held my tongue on asking for my rent back that I've paid her for no reason I guess?  Or all these stupid rules I've been following for no reason.  So I'd just really like to know who the hell is giving me my money.  Is it HO?  Or do I have to track down Mng, whom I have been given no information on and HO says she will give me nothing in helping find this woman.  But Mng was an employee of HO was she not?  HO collected all the rent from Mng, she was just an inbetween.  But now I have to go after Mng for my deposit, when Mng didn't even get to keep it, HO collected it?  Wtf?  That's everything to do with my big issue: the deposit.  But it might also be relevant some of the things she's asked of me / done to me in this past month and a half so here's a few gems:  She suggested that I keep my room unlocked while at home (I always keep it locked, for whatever reason I want as far as anyone else needs to know right?) so that she can ""check up on [me]"".  I've kept my door locked all the time anyway because I don't want her entering my room at ANY time without 24 hours notice.  I only was given a key for the door knob, not the deadbolt.  So if the deadbolt is locked, I can't get into the house and I can't get to my room.  I work 3rd shifts, so I'm usually off work at about 1-2am.  I was locked out one Monday 'morning' so I called HO at 2am, apologizing deeply, but asking her to come and unlock the deadbolt so I could get in.  She was *pissed*, but let me in.  The very next night, the same exact thing.  This time, not wanting to make her mad, I just stayed at a friends place.  The next day, I let her know I was locked out again, and asked her to communicate to everyone that they shouldn't lock that deadbolt.  When I went to leave for work that day, the deadbolt was locked again, so I texted her on my way out: ""Hey, just leaving for work and the deadbolt was locked.  I guess someone didn't get the memo that that locks me out.  Could you find who did it and give em a good smack for me? :P"".  That night, deadbolt is locked again, for the third night in a row, with me texting her asking her to make sure it doesn't happen.  So this time I broke in.  The fourth night, as I was leaving, I let her know that I was locked out even after that text and that I'd really appreciate being allowed access to my room.  Surprise, locked out that night too.  So I texted her: ""This is kinda bullshit that I paid rent for a room that I only have access for in the mornings.  I feel like I've done everything I can from my end, and this is continuing to happen.  Just really chaps me that I can't sleep in my own bed, no matter how hard I try.""  Her response: ""never speak to me like that again"".  ????  HO's first month of rent that she collected from me she took direct deposit.  She texted me the email, told me what password to use, and I sent it along no problems.  The next months rent should be the same right?  Wrong.  At 930pm of the 31st she texted me saying she'd be knocking on my room to collect rent in the morning.  I can only withdraw $500 a day, and was already at work.  I explained that to her, as well as my assumption that I was going to direct deposit it to her again this month.  Guess what: She wasn't pleased.  She collected a $75 'late fee' that was not discussed beforehand or in the contract that I thought we had.  I handed her $700 for my $625 rent, and she pocketed it all and said ""we'll just consider that a late fee"" and walked away.  I was definitely expecting to get change...  All of those things felt super shitty and somewhat illegal.  But maybe that first clause of the contract lets her do that?  Or maybe that's not a thing you can put in a contract? Or maybe because she admitted that we have no agreement that clause is invalid anyway?  This whole situation just feels like she's an empty-nester renting out every room in her house for mad $$$."	No
I live with a married couple to save on rent. I literally just signed a new lease with them last month until next August and found out tonight that the wife left this morning and they're getting divorced. The husband wants me to sign to let her off the lease but I literally cannot afford to pay for half of this place plus all the other miscellaneous expenses. Am I right to refuse to sign on a lease release form until they can find me a replacement who will pay what we agreed to? Furthermore the  husband is a permanent resident of Mexican origin who is planning on taking a trip to Mexico in October and I can't risk him never coming back and me being the only one holding the bag on the lease. Wife moved back to Massachusetts I assume and my only legal recourse is if I keep her on the lease so they know where to find her. Anything else I should be aware of?  P.S. Is it also too late for me to throw myself at the mercy of the leasing office in terms of getting out of the lease? 	No
"I just got ""fired"" (he didn't say I was fired directly and didn't give me a pink slip or any notice like that but told me ""leave my restaurant"") after turning in my written two week notice last Friday. How should I follow up? Can this hurt me if in the future an employer calls for references? I've never been fired and am not sure what to do. "	No
We just finished our 5 hour drive to the beach, and our hotel says they never got our booking(through booking.com). We called two weeks ago to make sure that our reservation was in order and we were assured that we had the room that we requested. They owners were adamant that there was no booking, and the only other hotels in the area are more than twice what we were going to pay. Is there any way I can be compensated for the extra expenses?	No
I have contacted my landlord twice in the past week concerning a cockroach infestation. My home is very clean and I've even kicked it up a notch on the cleanliness front to deal with the bugs. I'm not exaggerating when I say I see dozens of them running around the kitchen a day (I can provide photographs to support this). This has been going on for a couple weeks and began very suddenly: I attempted to deal with them on my own first to no avail, and have had no luck getting a response from my landlord.   I have a pretty bad phobia of cockroaches and in this state I am unable to use my kitchen. Although, I feel that even if I didn't have a phobia, this is disgusting. I am fed up.   There are additional health and safety issues we are being ignored about as well, including other tenants leaving garbage in the halls, stairwells and outside the building doors (piles of dumped cat littler!!?!). However my focus is getting rid of the cockroaches. I am at my wit's end feeling so uncomfortable in my own home. I'm wondering what I can do if the landlord continues to ignore my complaints, or what I can do to expedite pest control. Is there a higher power I can get in touch with? Google has not been very informative.   I have been keeping records of everything. I'm in Ontario. Thanks in advance reddit.	No
Within the past month (sometime between July 7th and now), the cost of housing in my dorm listed on the ASU website was increased by $69 a semester. The amount listed, before and after the change, was explicitly listed as the cost for the 2017-2018 school year. This change in price was well after a late cancellation fee of $500 was in effect (the fee slowly ramped up, reaching the full $500 on June 20th).  At the end of the previous school year, to sign up for housing, we had to agree to [this](https://housing.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2017-2018_license_agreement_-_ftf-ret-upp.pdf) housing agreement. Part of this agreement does say  &gt; The Arizona Board of Regents, ASU, and/or designated facility management companies reserve the right to change room rates and other charges and fees if circumstances require adjustments.  Is it legal for ASU to change the amount they charge for housing after a cancellation fee is in effect?	No
I'm in Baltimore County, MD.  I just found out last night I am being sued by Amex for $14,959.50 - I had a CC with them with a limit of about 13,000 and at some point maxed out and was not able to make any more payments after December due to job loss and financial strain. My husband and I were also separated at the time.  I haven't been served yet but I know there is a filed suit against me because I got a letter from some credit company trying to get me to do debt consolidation.  I want to attempt to settle the debt but I don't know how to go about doing this with Amex. They're being represented by Zwicker Associates and I have read online they're a beast and don't like to settle. This isn't my only debt. I have others. One medical bill about $1500 and some other CC debt but I have been able to pay on all my other credit cards. What are the chances of them agreeing to a decreased amount on the principle over 5 years? I know I can't make a lump sum payment. How should I go about answering the summons when I am finally served?  I have 2 kids, my husband and I are barely scraping by as is. I am terrified. I own a home that we've had for 3 years and I don't want to lose it in a judgement or have a lien tacked onto it.	No
"Hi, I have an apartment with the lease in my name. I also have a roommate who is not paying rent and I want them to leave. She will not communicate with me, so I ca't even ask her to leave. She only comes back to the apartment when she knows I'm at work. She won't answer my calls or texts.   At this point, I don't care about the back pay in rent; I just want her gone. I'm scared that she will hurt my cat or steal my stuff.   What I want to do is have the locks changed and put a note on the door that says, ""Call me and I will let you pack up your stuff to leave"". Since she is not on the lease, the main office won't be able to let her in or give her a key. I'm worried that this is illegal though?  Could anyone give me some insight as to what to do?"	No
"Hi, this property is in Thunder Bay Ontario Canada, if that makes a difference. We have a seasonal cottage, the very last property on a dead end road. In the 1960's my grandfather spoke with the adjacent land owner and they agreed my grandfather could build a road over the property to access the cottage that attached to a new township road. Fast forward till 2003 when the adjacent owner died and the property was sold. The new owners were told by the township that they had to keep providing access but they have slowly impeded it to the point where it has become such an issue we have had to seek legal help. They offered to buy our property (and I think this is the real motive because they said they want it for their son). They created ""alternate access"" by getting these other owners behind their property to give us year to year access to be determined by them and it would cost a fee. That access gets us to the back of our lot and we would need to build a 100 m driveway through forest in order to access our place. Quite cost prohibitive to us. Our lawyer said we had a prescriptive easement and then their lawyer said we didn't because we aren't out at the cottage enough since 2003. We use to go almost every week in the summer and now we go a few days a year. The only reason we are not there more is because they built a lawn over our road and yell at us when we go their and we can't have any friends or anyone do maintenance because they blockade the access. This has caused us issues with staying there to say the least. What should we do? Our lawyer says maybe litigation but I am worried we can't afford it. I haven't contacted the person who was the estate manager but he was aware of the road and longstanding use at the time of sale. In fact he indicated the purchaser was aware as well. We weren't given a copy of the purchase agreement."	No
Can someone explain the consequences for this offense and what to do if charged with it?	No
I was arrested in Big Bend in May (Federal checkpoint) for possession of less than a half ounce of marijuana. After being fingerprinted, photographed and waiting in the cell for two hours, I was released. The judge didn't accept the case, they said. No charges were filed, no citations were issued. I signed no documents and was not asked to reappear at a future date. Without asking too many questions, I got the hell out of there.  &amp;nbsp;  Naturally, I became very concerned for my record, and looked into getting the record expunged. I called several lawyers, both in my city of residence, as well as a few in west Texas.  &amp;nbsp;  However, before I got far, none of them could even find the arrest in the system. I figured at least the court/county that denied my case would have record of it, but they didn't. I also checked the DMV database ($3 fee), and it brought up nothing.  &amp;nbsp;  Can someone explain to me why this might be?	No
I've been in my current apartment for several years now, and last year the old landlord sold the building to a new person, not a management company or anything like that. No idea if that's significant or not but the new landlord seems to have very little idea what he's doing, ie not depositing rent checks for weeks.   Anyway. Recently the water pressure in the unit has gone down significantly, to the point where the toilet basin doesn't fill after a flush. Basically, busted toilet. Only one in the unit.  I've e-mailed the landlord about it twice because I want a paper trail but he hasn't responded for almost 3 days now. What are my options here? Thank you in advance.	No
Happened in Missouri this week.  A company that seems to be contracted by the city was working on a line next to my house.  There was a surge of wastewater while they had the line blocked(my vague understanding of the situation) and it caused the waste to back up into my house, completely covering the downstairs floor in sludge that I assume to be mostly human waste.  I woke up sometime within the next 3 hours to find this;  went outside and got ahold of the sewage company workers who were still working outside and let them know about it, they contacted their supervisor who came to my house, took pictures, called his boss and then told me that they were taking responsibility for the  incident.  So far they've hired a company to do the cleanup, and the same company is expected to start doing the repairs(floors, carpet, drywall, etc) Monday.  They've also agreed to get the HVAC ducts cleaned out because the AC is currently circulating the smell of sewage through the house even after the cleanup downstairs.  I'm renting and my landlord and I both have concerns about the situation - most of my belongings got sloshed with sewage, including my computers and office furniture;  I'm also just cut off from the bottom of my house for the next several weeks.  My landlord's concern is that he is going to have to disclose this incident whenever he eventually sells the property and that it will damage the perceived value of the house and make it harder to sell.  I'm trying to figure out what, if any, sort of recourse we have in this situation beyond the cleanup and repair.  Nothing has been signed yet.	No
Is it legal for a landlord to tell you that you have to pay for and use a PO Box because there's no mailboxes or way to receive mail at the apartment? I've lived in this apartment for 2 years now and landlord has refused to put mailboxes here. I pay for a PO Box. Problem is, I've started working from home and need a way to receive packages there. Not every company will ship to a PO Box.	No
Can landlord assess fines not stated in lease for things we are not doing? He emailed us that he is going to fine us for leaving the back door open and unlocked... We never leave through the back and lock everything. 	No
Pretty simple.   I rented an old farm house in VA.   My wife and I discovered a grave from the 1940s that wasn't exactly hidden but not obvious.     Should my pandlord have disclosed this?	No
Hey guys!  I live in Oklahoma, I purchased a car off eBay from a classified ad in New Hampshire. I used PayPal for the deposit $500, and a check for the rest of the $12,000.   The company filed chapter 11, then converted to a chapter 7. I have filed a creditor claim with the NH Bankruptcy court.   Car insurance won't help, not a theft. eBay doesn't protect classified ads. Bank can't help, it isn't considered check fraud. Any advice on getting my money back?	No
I live in a condo with a Homeowners Association. Lately, the HOA president has been unfairly charging me with fines.  He asked me to replace one of my windows because it doesn't meet their requirements. However, this window was installed by the previous owner - not me. I decided to replace the window anyway, so I submitted an architectural application to the HOA to get approval for replacing the window. Half a year later and there was still no response, so I couldn't replace the window during this time. Then, just last week, I finally get a letter saying that I've been fined for several violations and for noncompliance...They started fining me for having things in my back patio that they didn't like such as a tent. Keep in mind that I've had these things for over half a decade without any problems. They also fined me for not replacing the window even though I was waiting for their approval to do so.  I've tried communicating with the HOA president several times, but he insists that I am responsible for everything. Getting a response out of him takes awhile too, because it takes him about 1-3 weeks to reply to my emails on average.  My question is: what is the procedure to replace the president of your HOA Board of Directors? Is there anything I can do about this situation besides paying the fines?	No
From my understanding he plans on renting the place out. I've spoken to him and he says the trees are all on my side of the property line (they're not). Currently there's my fence, then a three or four feet gap which contains the trees, then a brand new fence he had installed - it's like something from an 80s movie.   I'm concerned with a tree/branch falling on my house in a storm as the house has been dormant for a while and the trees haven't been trimmed in forever - smaller branches are already falling regularly, and a big on could take out half my roof. Yes I know I could sue once that happens, but I have a baby in the house and I'm not taking chances.  What can I do here?	No
[TX] I was driving in the left lane of traffic on highway 361 preparing to pass another car that was 1000 feet in front of me, I realize that I might have gotten into the left lane a little early but they were going slow and we were the only people on the road. As I'm coming up on the car I see a black SUV sitting in the median facing the wrong way and I slow down kind of panicking that they're going to pull out in front of me. I do not change lanes because I'm watching the SUV to see if they pull out in front of me. As I pass the SUV they turn their lights on and I realize it was a cop, I was not speeding at any point. I get pulled over and issued a ticket for driving in the left lane, the cop will not listen to the fact that I was preparing to pass a car until I saw him facing the wrong way in traffic and slowed down. What are my chances of fighting this? It's a $500 ticket and as I wasn't impeding the flow of traffic I don't really see what I did to warrant a ticket. The law is so ambiguous, and there is not place (that I can tell) that tells you when you can officially get into the left lane to pass.    Also worth noting, I have a Conceal Carry License but I've never owned a gun or really had anything to do with guns. Got it because my boyfriend is in the military and wanted me to get a gun and I kinda forgot I had it. The cop ran my DL and saw that I have a CCL and came back screaming that he could arrest me for not giving him my CCL with my DL but when I took the class they told is that we're under no obligation to give the officer our CLL granted we do not have a gun on our person, which I most definitely did not. I would really like to file an official complaint for this because as far as I can tell, he's just making up law to suit himself but I want to be sure that this is correct before I raise hell at the police station.	No
My husband and I are a young couple barely starting to build a life. We bought a trailer home for $500 with the idea of repairing it slowly since it's a bit run down.   We needed somewhere to put it so we got a property which was $1000 of downpayment and would be $250 every month.   We paid someone close to $2000 to move the trailer home into the property. He did and its been there for about 2 weeks now.   Today my husband got a call from the lady who sold him the property saying that she wants to break contract and move our home elsewhere into another one of her available properties all because the man who lives right next to our property is complaining that our home is too ugly to be next to his or in his immediate vicinity. The lady is siding with him because this man turns out to be the city commissioner.   The other available properties are not the same as the one we have now. They are by a creek and they pretty much get flooded every time it rains. The lady did offer to pay for someone to move our home again and use the first downpayment for whichever other property we get so we wouldn't have to pay twice but we don't want to settle for less just because this man feels superior to us but we don't know what to do.   Please help us. Your advice will be greatly appreciated.   	No
"So an interesting thing happened today. There have been rumors for a while about a potential list of employees who will be laid off. Someone in the office noticed in the printer queue from our HR manager (This printer is a public printer and used for most of the office) Seperate documents in the queue with titles that would say ""termination notice - employee name.""  Things got out of hand really quickly and the entire office knew by the end of the day. HR probably scared for their own job quicky called a meeting explaining who was the person who originally saw the Printer Queue as they will be fired immediately and if no one comes forward they will start making assumptions on who that person is.  I would like to know who is in the wrong here and do they have any legal standing"	No
"So pretty much I've been soliciting spells and rituals on apps like whisper. I have them pay me over paypal, and send them instructions for the ritual. I never promise health benefits or weight loss. I've sold two so far. A love spell and ""spiritual cleansing"". Both at 20 a spell. Can I be sued for selling a phony spell?  Is there anything I can add like a disclaimer or something to prevent someone from trying to sue me?"	No
My wife and I moved into a duplex with a 1 year lease; both of our names are on the lease and both had credit/background checks ran.  However, when it came time to sign the lease, my wife was out of state.  I signed the lease, along with my property manager. The property manager said he would get my wife's signature at a later date, however, that has not happened.   We've been here a couple months and the property manager is turning into a real piece of work; not fixing issues, not returning calls. We might be looking for a way out without penalty.   Is this lease valid without the signature of all parties listed on the lease?  Thanks in advance!	No
Hi!  Our lease renewal is coming up in less than 3 weeks. We want to stay in the apartment as it's well located and nice. We contacted the landlord recently about renewing the lease and she's responded that the rent would increase by $180 (9% increase). The apartment is in California.  My understanding is that a landlord as to provide a 30 days notice before a rent increase of less than 10%, 60 days notice otherwise. Does that also apply in the case of a lease renewal coming up? Can I do anything to pay the new price later than 3 weeks from now?  Ideally I would like to reduce the increase, can we use this in our favor?  Thanks!	No
Good evening, and thank you in advance for any advice. -------- TLDR: My wife had a C-Section and the internal sutures ruptured 8 days after discharge. She had no risk factors, and it apparently prompted the hospital to change their policy or procedures with sutures. Lingering physical and emotional issues remain to this day. --------  In April of 2016, my wife gave birth to our second child at an unscheduled but non-emergency c-section at a major hospital in Iowa. Luckily, both my wife and child made it through the Cesarian section just fine and we were discharged from the hospital 2 days later.  8 days after being discharged, my wife was getting ready for a Dr. Appointment for our child and coughed a few times. She felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, and within a few minutes notices a small trickle of blood coming from the Cesarian Section scar. It was very little blood, and we didn't think much of it until we mentioned it to our son's pediatrician. She recommended we get an appointment to the hospital to be safe, and we did so for later that morning. We discovered that the internal sutures for my wife had rupture, and that she had experienced a Fascial Dehiscence. They rushed her into surgery and several hours later she come out the other side alive, but with a serious road to recovery. All told, it took approximately 2 months to fully heal with regular wound packing and a wound vac.  At the time, her OB (who did not perform the C-section due to it being unscheduled) but who performed the corrective surgery mentioned that this was an extremely uncommon experience, especially considering my wife had none of the risk factors. She indicated that the hospital had switched the type of sutures used in the recent past and that they were convening a board of doctors to discuss my wife's case and changes that needed to be made at the hospital to prevent it happening again. Now, a year later, we are finally starting to realize the seriousness of what actally happened. My wife is still now dealing with some lingering physical effects (significant scar tissue causing her lower stomach to bulger) and she has had significant anxiety going back to doctors or being in a hospital.  We never really considered a lawsuit against the hospital until a family friend who is a doctor mentioned it recently. I'm curious if any of the folks here are familiar with medical malpractice and if this is somethng that would be worth pursuing or discussing with an attorney in Iowa. We have since relocated to a new state, and I don't want to spend the mental effort and spike my wife's anxiety again unless it is worth it.	No
I recently switched jobs but when I received my last paycheck none of my vacation hours were on it. I assumed, since I've always been paid for my vacation time when I leave a job, that they were supposed to pay for the vacation time I earned. After searching google I found some sites saying that I'm owed and others that says it's up to the company. Does anyone know what the laws are about these things? This happened in Arkansas if that's relevant.	No
"I was hoping to resolve my dispute with my previous landlord out of court, but his most recent response of ""See you in court"" says he wants otherwise.   Moved out of the condo I was renting from an individual owner by time on the date of my lease ending on May 15th. There was a $1300 security deposit in my name. On July 11th, I receive the letter and $500 check postmarked from July 7th claiming he needed to withhold funds due to:   1) deep pet-cleaning needed 2) a $250 pet deposit that was owed and never paid.  3) painting fee due to nail holes.   Event though I disagree all of the above (he already had a pet deposit for $250 that should cover pet cleaning fee, a lease renewal should not pay new pet fee... if so, he should have asked 2 years ago when i renewed, and I lived there for 5 years and spackled and filled all nail holes on the walls prior to leaving. its normal wear a tear), my main point of contention was that according to Georgia Code Annotated ¬ß ¬ß 44-7-30 to 44-7-37, I should have my full deposit returned since his letter and check were not sent within 30 days.  My main concerns with small claims court are that I think he may be hard to find. I sent certified mail of my request for return of funds and intent to sue to the address of the rented condo, the address he had included in my lease which appears to be a business address, and the address tied to his check that he paid me with (Maryland). Both GA addresses letters were returned to me, and the Maryland is at a front desk that I doubt is where he lives permanently. I'm worried trying to find his real address to sue him may be more costly than the $800 I'm owed.   Reddit, any advice on how to track him down, sue him in the appropriate state, and am I on the correct side of this 30-day technicality of the security deposit?"	No
 We currently live in Tucson, AZ. So, we are looking to move out of our apartment, breaking the lease a bout 3 months early. We have a few leaks that we have reported that they have not looked at, let alone alone fixed. In addition, both the wife and my cars were keyed, and the management didn't take any steps to help mitigate future losses. The estimated repairs for the paint jobs and clear coats is roughly what the remaining balance of our lease is.   Do we have enough cause to break the lease early?	No
I live in WA state for reference.  Suppose that I vacate my apartment, and the landlord sends me an itemized list of charges from my security deposit within the 21 days, along with a small refund check.  Is there a deadline to dispute the charges? Also, does cashing the check imply that I accept the charges?	No
I have been labouring under the intention I have no rights as I share a one bedroom apartment with someone as a subtenant who is officially on the building's (ultimate landlord's) listing as a tenant of the unit in Ontario.  I know the Residential Tenancies act states that an owner or someone related to the owner can immediately kick out someone who's renting a room and with whom they share a kitchen or bathroom, but does that also apply within the master tenant/subtenant relationship or do I have more rights?	No
I moved into an apartment complex 3 years ago. Since then they have continually raised the rent, which I know happens in a lot of cases, however many of the amenities that they advertised upon me signing my lease were not available.  The ftness center has been closed for 2.5 years, the pool was closed all last summer, and the laundry center has been under construction and  not available due to them renovating the property for about two and a half of those years.   They kept telling me those amenities would come back but now their website does not have them listed. I took screenshots of the website and I've been taking pictures of the property continually for the past 3 years. Do you think that there's any way that I can obtain retroactive rent abatement in small claims court?	No
Hello,   I graduated High School this past summer, and bought my macbook from the school. The guarantee was that once the laptop was fully paid for, the school technology department would remove unnamed management software. I don't know if it is a keylogger, website monitoring software, or what additional restrictions exist. I know that I can not change my energy settings nor control my security and privacy options.  After I paid the school the full balance, the software was not removed. I emailed the technology department requesting removal and received a preliminary response days later stating the the lead for such matters had previously been on vacation, despite not having turned on any sort of automatic reply indicator.  I am currently overseas, and have limited wifi options. I requested that the technology department give me a timeslot that they needed me to connect to the internet within. I told them that I would make whatever time they gave work.  In response, I was told that they were unable to give me a time slot, but that it just had to be connected for a short period of time. I further emailed and explained that I was unable to just randomly have it on, as my time zone is multiple hours ahead and wifi is very limited in the city where I live, so I needed them to provide a time that worked for them, and I would cooperate with whatever time they set.  Since then, I have not received a single reply despite nearly 3 business days elapsing.  I understand that this issue may seem minor, but I bank off my computer, and am soon going to be hoping to use it for purposes of a more sensitive nature where I am legally unable to have outer management software installed on my device.   Thank you in advance for any information or advice.	No
Roommate flew into a rage this evening about a lamp I broke and wound up punching me three times in the face. I did not return any strikes, he proceeded to call the cops.   I did not stick around for the police to arrive for the reason below, which is why I need advice.  I've been effectively homeless for the last 2 months, crashing on couches and paying people a pittance with no lease etc. I've spread the love across a number of couches so no one friend gets too sick of me. Being homeless is the result of me having been kicked out of previous living quarters during an event for which I am now on unsupervised probation.  The only condition of my probation is to notify them of address changes... Well they've been so frequent and entirely unofficial that I am technically in violation of my probation. Thus why I didn't stick around for the cops.  Having reached a safe location for the evening I was able to examine myself further and I probably have a broken nose, but have no insurance or funds for medical attention (and refuse to use the ER for shit like this, I'm not dying). I would absolutely like to file charges however I suspect I'm fucked on being able to do so because of the afforementioned probation issue.  Help please?	No
I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit. But my parents are having issues with our builders. They paid ¬£23,000 for 5ft kitchen extension (which sounds ridiculous) that's been going on for 3 months. This should've been completed within 1 month. There were delays because our builders are trying to 'toy' with us such as 'equipment/material not arriving', mistakes they made and sending in 1 worker instead or 3 or 4.   They're making us pay for problems that they caused. Mistakes that they've made! What's worse is that today, they abruptly came in today and demanded the 'extra' cost rudely.   I feel like this is so unfair. My parents have waited months and they feel like they got robbed badly. The thing is a mess &amp; they just things to just wrap up. The extension started in April. I feel like we should get our money back but I know for sure if we argue with them anymore, they'll stop working on our house. Our 'Building controller' has come in many occasions to inspect their work and even he says it's a disaster. Could anyone advice?	No
I apologize in advance for this long post. I'm located in North Carolina and am a student at a public university. When I transferred in, I applied for on-campus housing but was told that due to the extensive wait list I most likely would not get a room. So I looked for an apartment. I met two people who needed another roommate because theirs was moving out. I signed the lease the morning of July 21st, and later that day I got an email from campus housing after 5:00pm notifying me that I had been assigned to on-campus housing. I called the housing office on Monday and was told that all I needed to do was send them a copy of my lease and it would be taken care of. I did so, and heard nothing. I went into the office yesterday to make sure everything was taken care of. The lady at the front desk admitted to me that she looked at the email and forgot about it, admitting that she didn't do her job. I explained the situation and was told that the date on my lease was August 1st, I already knew about my housing assignment and they were going to charge me a $3,000 cancellation fee, half of the entire years rent for half of a dorm room. I explained that since it was a sublease, I was simply added to the lease and I signed it on the 21st. I showed the people in the housing office texts that I had signed the lease on the 21st but they said that they needed something official from the apartment complex. I went to the complex and explained my situation and they printed out an email exchange with their official email on it that proved that I had started the process and signed the lease on the 1st. I took that over to university housing and they said that the cancellation fee would be waived based on this. I went online to cancel my housing and got an email asking for proof that I had already signed the lease by the time that my on-campus housing assignment was available.  At this point I believe I'm being given the run around by the campus housing to get me to pay the fee. Do I need a lawyer to contest this?	No
Hey, this may be a dumb question and if I'm putting it in the wrong place please let me know.  I went to a new doctor who started me on a prescription for a new medicine to counter some side effects of another medicine I take. The new stuff actually started to help, a lot. For the first time in a long time it didn't feel like my stomach was trying to eat itself constantly. However, they put a typo on the prescription--they prescribed 15 pills at one dosage, and 15 pills at a second, but the second half had the typo and the pharmacy couldn't fill it. No big deal, they have 15 days to correct it, right? Totally wrong. The pharmacy called them 2-3 times in the first week, and faxed the request over as many times. I spent all of the next week calling, leaving voicemails, and never hearing back. Finally Thursday, the pharmacist got a verbal confirmation it was being sent over that day. I called Thursday and got the same confirmation. Nothing. Then Friday morning I called and told them that it needed to be in ASAP so I could pick up that afternoon, because I only had one pill left. They assured me it would be sent to the pharmacy within the hour.  Pharmacy again got nothing. I tried repeatedly to get through to them again and when I finally got someone on the phone, was told that it was still waiting for the doctor to sign off on it (the girl from the morning had told me she'd messaged the doctor but either she didn't do that, or the doc just didn't bother) and she'd gone home for the day. It's a controlled substance psych med, so the pharmacist wasn't able to even give the one pill to bridge the gap, even though they had the original prescription with that stupid typo.  So today has been an absolutely awful day of being sick, having stomach pains way worse than they were before I started this miracle medicine, and just generally wanting to curl up and cry.   I'm already looking for another doctor, and gave them honest reviews on Yelp and Google, but honestly with their other low reviews (I didn't even check first, was referred by a friend who didn't have as bad a time) I don't think they care to make improvements. Is there something that can be done to fine them, or somehow bring to their attention how badly they communicate? At this point I just don't want them to screw anyone else over like they did me.   Thanks everyone, and have a great night.  TL;DR doctor jerked me and pharmacy around for 2 weeks and messed up on a prescription for a psych med, caused massive frustration and a day and a half of feeling awful. Can anything be done to make sure they don't keep doing this to patients?	No
I have lived in my apartment for almost a year now. I have had issues with the apartment complex since I moved in but did not want to break my lease. Although it is coming to the end of my lease, my landlord just changed the locks on my apartment without giving me any kind of warning. I have never paid rent late, had any complaints against me, or anything of that nature so how is this legal. They are supposedly going to be renovating my apartment in the future but nothing has been started yet. This is a college apartment and I have been living at my parents home for most of the summer but all of my things are still in the apartment. I haven't been there since June and last time I was there they didn't mention they would be changing the locks, they didn't even send an email. So yesterday when I drove an hour and a half to stay at the apartment I couldn't get in because they changed the locks without my knowledge. Someone please tell me what I can do in this situation.	No
[California] Hypothetically, if a girl was visiting California from a country in Central Europe, and one were to get her pregnant, what are the ramifications?  Some other useful info:  * She's on some sort of 6'ish month visa with 3 months to go. * Claimed to be on birth control * Has a strong desire to remain in the US  Is child support required? Does the child get dual citizenship? Suppose the guy does not want to get married...what are his obligations?  This is all hypothetical.	No
My roommate got caught with so an eighth of marijuana while getting pulled over the other day, he was about to get his medical card this next week. He so far hasn't been charged but was taken to the police station. If he gets put on probation can he still get a medical card without any issues? I saw that the supreme court here passed a law saying that probation can't stop medical patients (http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/04/07/medical-marijuana-arizona-supreme-court/25416337/) but I can't seem to get anything about getting the card after being caught by the police.   Can anyone help me out on this?	No
I'm currently in a situation with my apartment management where I was sent a letter stating they're giving me 60 days to move out and I'm unable to renew it without reasoning.  I've always paid my bills early and never had complaints from neighbors. I did leave a review on Google about the area being unsafe and was asked several time by management to remove it in which I did not comply. My car was broken into , I went up to the office to report it but the manager mocked me and continuously asked me to remove the review.  I ended up calling corporate about the issue and it was resolved , this was a few week before I received the letter. I'm in the situation where I'm a single mom of a new born currently in the military and for this reason I'm unable to move out as requested. I was wondering what route I could take and if this is considered retaliation.	No
Background: I got pulled over on Christmas evening in NY for going 70 in a 55 on I-95 North (I didn't even know there was a speed limit that low on I-95).  I'm going to traffic court later today, I don't really care about the fine but the ticket carries 6 points with it which I'd like to avoid at all costs. How do I go about doing this? I am bringing a copy of my driving record that shows I am in good standing with 0 points on my license currently. Do I admit to speeding and straight up ask for the fine but no points? Do I just present the fact that I'm normally a safe driver and hope the whole ticket gets dismissed? Should I tell him I was trying to be safe and keep up with the flow of traffic (which was technically the case) or should I say something else? Please help me beat this ticket, thank you!	No
"Reposting for clarity.  Nearly three years ago, we had two garage door openers installed by Bill. Over the next year or so, Bill came several times to work on not only the new openers, but also on an opener that he had installed for the previous owner of the property. The work on the two new openers was covered under warranty.   Over the last year, all three openers stopped working. Due to Bill's deteriorating health, we opted not to call him and instead to just open the doors manually.   Bill died this spring and his widow sold the company and the customer list to two guys with no previous experience- just general handyman experience. The new owners called my husband to introduce themselves, and my husband told them that they could come give us an estimate on fixing the three openers, and also to see if they were under any type of warranty.   The first day, one of the partners was met at our property with someone who seemed to know what he was doing. They spent time looking at the openers, but didn't actually do any work.   A couple of months later, the partner came out. He told me several times that he had no experience with openers and was learning as he went along. He spent a couple of hours here. He got one opener working, and told me I would have to replace the second new opener. I expressed to him that I had no interest in a new opener and would just open it manually. He ended up ""trying one more thing"" and had it working 15 minutes later. He also worked on the third opener and told me it was in working condition.   Before he left, he told me that they had 5.5 hours of work in. I nodded uncommittally, remembering that my husband had told him that we needed an estimate, and also that the new doors may have been covered under warranty.   Instead of receiving an estimate, they charged us $60 an hour so they could learn how to fix garage doors.   I am planning to call and dispute this ridiculous amount (can I charge him $200 an hour to listen to how horrible his ex wife was?), but wasn't sure what my legal options are. Thanks."	No
"My sister is a resident of California, she recently was prescribed some Vicodin after oral surgery on July 6th, 2017.   In pain still; the doctor during a follow up wrote out another prescription today on the 11th for the same medication except now Target/CVS are refusing to fill the prescription because there is a *new law* that ""covers this medication every 8 days only"".   I'm curious; wouldn't the doctor who wrote out the prescription be aware of this or is this not even a true law?   Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"	No
I was in a collision on my motorcycle a few weeks ago and the police report stated that the other party was at fault. My left index finger was broken and I needed surgery because there was a piece broken off in my middle joint. The surgery went well but i may not be able to fully flex or extend my left index finger for the rest of my life. Therein lies the main issue: I'm a professional musician and my surgeon says I may not be able to play again. I'll also have to take 6-8 weeks off of work due to my injuries. So with her being fully at fault, should I get a lawyer?	No
"I recently moved out of Tacoma for work and had to break my lease early. I understand that I am responsible for the rent until they find a new tenant but the law only says ""reasonable attempt.""   I moved out two weeks ago and cleaned the place way better than it was when I moved in (3 months before) but they have not posted a listing for the apartment yet. The WA landlord tenant act says they don't have to drop everything and post it right away but they do need to make a reasonable attempt.   At what point can I stop paying rent because they are not doing anything and how would I go about it? I assume there is some process other than just stopping payments (which would probably not end well for me).   Side note - They are borderline slumlords that don't take care of the properties or fix problems. The place was infested with mold that started creeping back in after I moved in and I am very happy to be out of that place. "	No
Hello! College teen here about to move into my first apartment. This is a student apartment, and I want to be aware of my rights as a renter. This is the part of the lease that bugs me:  If you are in violation of this Lease, we can, without demand or notice (other than as provided in this paragraph or as otherwise required by applicable law) in addition to other remedies allowed and to the extent permitted by applicable law, do any or all of the following: a. Collect any fine imposed by the Rules and Regulations; b. Bring a legal action against you to collect past due Rent and any other damages we have incurred because of your violating the Lease; c. Terminate your right to occupy the Premises, institute an action for eviction, without terminating the Lease or your monetary obligations for the Premises by giving you written notice providing 24 hours for you to vacate the Premises; d. Bring a legal action against you to collect all unpaid Rent and other sums which would become due until the Ending Date of the Lease or until another person takes occupancy (and then, we can still recover from you the difference between the Rent you were required to pay and the Rent actually paid by the new resident, together with any expense we incur to relet the Premises); e. Terminate the Lease and your right to occupy the Premises and institute an action for eviction, by giving you written notice and providing the legal time frame for you to leave;  f. Report all violations to credit reporting agencies; g. Report all violations to criminal/judicial authorities. The exercise of any remedy by us shall not be deemed to exclude or waive our right to exercise against you any other right or remedy which we might have.  After we give you notice to leave the Premises or if we file an eviction suit, even it we accept Rent or other sums due, such acceptance does not waive or diminish our continuing rights of eviction or any other contractual or statutory right unless we specifically agree to it in writing. In the event we bring an action against you because of your violation of this Lease, we can recover all costs or fees involved, including reasonable attorneys‚Äô fees, as part of any judgment.   What it seems like to me is that they're trying to circumvent my right to remedy my lease violation by saying that they can request I leave the premises without terminating the lease. Is this legal?  Thanks!	No
Should I get a lawyer for this? Is it expensive?  Can I handle it on my own?  I have the letter they sent me with the offer, is that enough or do I need to ask them for a contract of some kind?  I heard the forgiven part of the debt counts as income for taxe purposes.  Is that true.  My debt is about 22k, they are offering a 10% settlement.  I looked at lawyers in the area but all the financial ones I found were bankruptcy  / credit card debt lawyers.  I didn't find anything about student loans.  Please help.  I have about a week to figure this out before I am out of town.	No
If an employer is doing a background check on me and I have a misdemeanor from 2013, does it show the court documents and the police report or just the charge?	No
On July 7, 2017 tenants were all notified that exterior painting contractors would be at the building and that this was a 48 hour notice to enter premises.  Painting was estimated to last nine weeks.  Go forward to August 8. I went to take my trash out and returned to find not one, not two, but three painters standing in my apartment!  I live on the top floor of a seven story apartment. They had used the cherry picker to access the deck, climbed over the rail, and entered my apartment through the slider.  They were not working on my deck or anywhere near my apartment that day.  They said they entered to shut a slightly open bedroom window, and that they had knocked and called out and discovered I was not home and entered. I was gone about five minutes since we have a garbage chute on our floor.  I went to the property manager regarding this scary entry at 8 a.m.  Today we received notice that the July 7 48 hour notice to enter qualifies the painters to enter our units at any time, whether we are there or not, without an employee of the property manager, for the duration of their contract!  Does a 48 hour notice give free access to all contractors for the duration of the contract?  These contractors (three, remember, to close a bedroom window that was open an inch and nowhere close to their work area) now have open access to all apartments, even though this is exterior work!  Thank you for any guidance on this. I've tried looking up local codes for this and can only find landlords right to enter with a 48 hour notice.	No
"I had a 1 year lease in south Florida with a notoriously horrible rental company called Invitation Homes.  I had to extend my lease for 2 weeks (because of my job).  Anyways, I just got my ""security"" deposit back and they took out $645.60 for ""damages,"" the bulk of which ($522.70) was for painting all the interior walls/trims/closets and to ""sand the imperfections"".  This is complete and utter BS and I even took a video as I was walking out of my apartment documenting everything.  I just wrote them an e-mail for clarification but I wanted to know what my legal options were.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.  And just for some backstory, I have lived in 3 places prior to here over the last 8 years (grad school, work, etc...) and I have never had any of my security deposit kept before.  Ever.  So this is really frustrating.  Thanks in advance."	No
"My wife and I have been threatened multiple times by the same woman in our apartment complex. She banged on our door and bedroom window at 7am, she banged on our door and screamed curse words at 10pm, threatened my wife that was telling her son to not make barking noises and intimidate our dog, and finally threatened to kill my dogs, my wife and I, if our dogs ever touched her son.  My wife is scared and worried that she might do something. We talked with the leasing office, they stated that they are in the process of making sure this does not happen again and ""unfortunately"" my wife and I will be an example to current residents and future residents. The office told me that for our safety, the only thing we can do is file a police report and work from there. Is it true that all we can do is file a police report and live in fear?  What confuses me is, this crazy woman is threatening us and making us feel unsafe, yet, she gets to do whatever she wants and live comfortably in her apartment while I take my wife to my parents' house and stay there on my days off. My rent is not cheap. I pay $2000+ for a one bedroom apartment...and it infuriates me that we cannot live comfortably and that we will be spending basically half the month at my parents' house due to this woman WHILE paying $2000+ for an apartment that cannot even be called home.  TL;DR - Threatened multiple times by a resident. We do not feel safe at our apartment. What can we do?"	No
"Hi /r/legaladvice,    Posting this on a throwaway.    I live in NE Ohio in a suburban area. I live in a residential area, a small city of approximately 20,000. My neighbor has lived here for many years - far longer than I.  I bought the house going on two years ago. Although I quite enjoy the city, my house and the area I live in - I can't stand my neighbor. In fact, nearly everyone around me can't.    Here's the problem with them - we live in a residential area. They run an auto shop out of their garage. They work on cars **all. day. long.**  Up until recently - they used to happen until 1, 2, 3 even 4 or 5 AM. They were ""decent"" enough to close their garage door but all that would do is muffle the noises.    Their garage is at most 50 feet from where I am sitting now and all I hear is loud talking and grinding.   My choices are to close my windows and turn on the AC or open the windows and listen to obnoxious noises all day long.   Sitting in the backyard - which should be a peaceful activity, is broken by them constantly banging on a vehicle, grinding on something, etc.    I got to the point of eventually calling the police every time they were working beyond 9 PM (quiet hours) and they seem to has ceased working beyond that time.     This has been going on for years. I spoke with another neighbor and found out that the person I bought the house from used to call on them all the time and the city has never done anything. I've called the police 3 times.     I've also contacted the Ohio EPA, who referred me to the Cleveland division of air pollution. The reason being is because a large portion of what they do is body work and there is a lot of air pollutants that I know they are not properly handling. There is also the possibility of fluid spills.     I have some concerns about going at this in a more aggressive manner - we share a fence. It's my fence and it's a privacy fence. It's in somewhat rough shape that I plan to replace in the near(ish) future. That means I'll have to deal with removing it, and standing on the other side while staining it.    More importantly, I have a dog that I am concerned about them trying to do something to while she's in the yard.    This isn't something that can just be talked about with them - they know people don't like this and they just don't care. They're really inconsiderate (and sketchy) individuals.    I'm really upset at the city for failing to do anything - it's against city law to run a automotive business out of a residential area. The city is aware of this and they refuse to do anything. I've contacted a city councilman and the law director. Both have not done much.   Right now is a ""slow"" time. They recently decided that they weren't making enough money to keep this up so they quit for 2 weeks only to start back up. However, the routinely have 12 or so cars in their driveway, garage, backyard + on the street. In doing so, they ALWAYS park in front of my house and leave their house open.    That may seem petty - but when they do this, they double park in front of my house and park as close to my driveway as possible. I've had times where I almost hit the vehicle parked there while turning in / pulling out. Which is another violation - parking too close to a driveway.     Basically - they're constantly violating city laws, the police routinely just show up and tell them to stop. The city won't do anything about it.    Looking for advice on what I might be able to do to get this to stop so I can get some peace. I'm tired of being woken up at 4 AM because they're working on their cars 6 feet from my bedroom window - in the middle of the driveway.  Thanks!"	No
Long story short, my father has been a slumlord towards one of the properties he owns because of some personal matter with the renter.  The best way I can describe the situation is that the guy renting the home didn't have many option s on where to go and my father rented him a house in a nice neighborhood for what living on the property was worth (assuming that there wasn't a hole in the roof or that the garage is collapsing, the place is a structural nightmare).  The tenant has been there almost 10 years and is up to date on rent.  I ended up being involved in my dads renters issues within the past month, the moment the tenant of the property heard this he said he wanted to move out at the end of his lease. So, I began snooping.   It turns out my father was renting out that home to said tenant claiming a family member lived there (he could claim a homestead tax exemption saving him 2.5% on property taxes per year on the property (the tax rate is almost 6% in this city).  The property is worth close to $200k and from what I've found he has been underpaying on it for more that 20 years.  There may be more, that is all I could find.   I w not lie, my father is a piece of shit; I know for a fact he was dodging taxes on at least one income property and may own thousands of dollars know are in taxes/late fees.   What could happen to my dad if this information was brought before a court?  What civil or criminal problems could arise?   I'm trying to decide if I should just walk away.	No
Last week a wiring issue in my apartment damaged some of my property and I‚Äôm trying to figure out if I have any chance of getting compensation from my apartment complex. I had three power strips burn up and die over a two day period. When the maintenance guy came out, he tested several of the outlets and assured me that everything was fine and it must have been a defective power strip. I explained to him that there had been three separate power strips that had all died over a period of two days, but he again assured me that there was no problem and told me to buy a new power strip and use it as normal.   So Thursday afternoon I‚Äôm sitting at my desk using my computer plugged into a fourth power strip when I hear a loud popping noise and I start smelling burnt electronics. The lights start to flicker and dim and then become really bright, and everything plugged into the power strip abruptly shuts off. I call the office and they send out their head maintenance guy who looks behind the outlet and finds a broken wire. He fixes it, and is on his way.   I purchase a fifth power strip, but when I plug stuff into it, I find that my computer and printer no longer turn on. Since I was using the computer immediately prior to the power strip burning up, and I was told that the cause of the power strips burning up was the broken wire, it seems clear to me that the broken caused the damage to my computer. Given that I was assured it was safe to buy a new strip and use it, it seems to me that my apartment should compensate me for my damaged property. It also seems to me that it could have been a significant safety hazard, but what do I know?   I emailed my apartment stating the facts of what happened, explaining why I think they should compensate me, and asking if they would be willing to do so. They called me back saying that they would not.   The main lesson that I‚Äôve learned from all this is that I should make sure I have a renter‚Äôs insurance policy that covers this kind of thing, but what I would like to know is if there is anything I can do to get them to compensate me. I‚Äôm planning on calling them back tomorrow and trying to speak with a supervisor, but I‚Äôm not optimistic of that route. Is it worth it to take them to small claims court? Could I have a lawyer write them a demand letter?    Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
Some years back, my gf's brother was charged for possession, but not with enough on him for attmept to distribute, and finished his probation last year.  Today, officers pulled him over, charged him with the same thing as before and arrested him, took about $1,000 from his wallet, impounded his car and threatened not to return it to him.  He had his pistol registered in his name with him, but I'm not entirely sure if he can have one legally. Either way, they confiscated that too.  They set his bail for about $300. Can they really keep his car or the $1,000?	No
"Posted this in a thread over on r/finance, and several people suggested I ask the question here.   My gym has a habit of randomly increasing our monthly payment with a $20 ""Club Fee"" a couple times a year. This charge was not initiated until after I signed up, and had signed authorization for a set monthly rate. The agreement I signed included no wording of this fee, so I have not given them permission to charge me this extra amount. I also have received no type of notification of this fee prior to it being charged to my credit card on file.  This seems very illegal to me. Am I right? What course of action might I have to get this stopped?  Already planning on talking with the gym manager when I go in tomorrow morning."	No
I was involved in a road rage incident in which someone fired shots directly at my vehicle as I was driving down the road- one of the rounds hit my car, less than a foot away from me. The perpetrator was arrested immediately and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. It is a cut and clear case and I believe that this person will be convicted.  I am far from what you would call a proponent of pursuing damages in court, but I believe this individual intended to harm me (or worse). I was extremely shaken up directly after everything happened, but went on about my business as usual after providing my statement to the police, etc. It scared the hell out of me, naturally, but I never expected to have any further problems. Unfortunately, ever since the incident occurred, I have had persistent nightmares and experience panic attacks almost daily. I have missed nearly two weeks of work. I think most people would consider me to be a fairly realistic and level-headed person, but there have been times where I've been afraid to even leave my house due to the admittedly paranoid misapprehension of my assailant stalking me with the intention of harming me. I get anxious every time I see the same kind of vehicle the assailant was driving or if I hear a car backfire, etc.  Basically, I am dealing with quite a lot of unexpected mental woes stemming from an event that was more traumatic than I initially realized. I've given this a lot of thought and I have yet to come to a final decision, but I'd like to know what steps I should take in the event that I do elect to take legal action against my assailant.	No
Hi I have some confusion regarding a leasing situation. Ill start with some background info before getting into the details. I signed a 1 year lease with an LLC, in 2015 from august 1st to July 31st. I renewed the lease last year for another year ending July 31st 2017. I sent an email with my notice to terminate the lease on May  2017. Now this is were the issue comes in to play. Last night my roommate sent an email to the landlord with a few general questions about deposit and other moving out related things. She replied that she had no idea that we were moving out and has started with demands that we need to pay rent for august and September.  Now some details from this point on I will refer to the landlord as B and my roommate as J. In 2016 B emailed us a lease renewal document on the June 1st, it had 2 options a check box to renew the lease or a box to terminate lease and vacate at end of the contract. It had a due date of June 5th. Because of this i thought that we needed to provide 60 days notice of intent to terminate the lease. Fast forward to May. After discusions with my gf and J I decided that i would not be renewing the lease. To give B plenty of notice, I sent the email stating my intent to terminate the lease on May 10th, 2017. The email was written as follows:  subject re Tractor   Hi B, I was wondering if you had an update on the mower? I would also like to inform you that I will not be renewing the lease. I met a wonderful women and I will be moving in with her. Last I checked J did not have plans to renew please double check with him.   Regards,  Now I know the email was received and opened on the same day because B replied with an update on the mower. So i assumed she read the whole email since it was 4 sentences. I forwarded that email to B showing her that i did provided notice. upon receiving that email B changed her demands from Aug and Sept rent to that the lease states the tenant must provide 90 days notice and that the lease automatically renewed.  this is what the lease states about renewal: 22. LEASE RENEWAL: A. At the end of this Lease Agreement, Tenant shall have the option to renew the Lease for an additional term that is equal to the initial term of this lease (Term of Lease Agreement) pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein.  B. If Tenant or Landlord does not wish to renew the Lease, written notice must be given to the other party at least 90 days before the end of the term (Term of Lease Agreement) to terminate the Lease (including any exercised renewal or extension thereof).  I understand that I only provided 82 days of notice.  Finally to my questions. Does the section of the lease above actually automatically renew? i understand that it gives me the option to renew and states how to go about terminating the lease but never mentions auto renewal. Since she only required 60 days last year and never sent a renewal email this year do I have some kind of case based on confusion and lack of notification from the Landlord? What should i do and expect from here?  Thanks for your time and advise	No
So I had a home loan that was sold to Nationstar mortgage (about to be Mr. Cooper &lt;&lt;weird name).  Escrow was paid and had no trouble the first year.  So I get a notice in the mail today stating they'll provide insurance because my coverage lapsed.  After talking with Esurance and them both stating one or the other did not notify each other, my premium is up $400 a year due to the lapse.  Is there any legal protection for me as this rate increase is all on the mortgage company's fault I believe.	No
[AZ] I just moved back home, so I was unaware that we had a sticky situation with the HOA because my mentally ill father who harasses and yells at them on a daily basis.  We have a lakefront property that is adjacent to the community pool. Our HOA sent us notices three times last month about there being free dirt on our backyard which is against their bylaws.   * ^The ^back ^yard ^has ^not ^been ^maintained ^in ^good ^condition. ^The ^following ^condition(s) ^were ^observed: ^add ^granite ^to ^back ^yard ^granite ^areas.   * ^The ^back ^yard ^has ^not ^been ^maintained ^in ^good ^condition. ^The ^following ^condition(s) ^were ^observed:  ^back ^yard ^lawn. ^dirt ^areas.  After the second notice, our household has been attempting to fix it. We've added grass to our lawn areas, and bought sufficient granite to distribute throughout the granite areas (which seemed to have been washed into the lake due to the rain).  Just last week we received another notice about the same issue, and now they have doubled the fine.  * ^The ^back ^yard ^has ^not ^been ^maintained ^in ^good ^condition. ^The ^following ^condition(s) ^were ^observed: ^add ^granite ^to ^back ^yard ^granite ^areas, ^dirt ^is ^showing ^through  I can't help but feel like they're targeting us because of my dad. I'm only sharing what I know within the past month, but we have HOA complaints very often about our house. Has anyone else had a similar situation and how was it handled?

I was a misclassified 1099 employee by a company I was with for over a year. I am in the process of filling out the ss8 and I am 100% sure I will be ruled as being an employee. However, in that case I would like the state of IL to investigate overtime wages I have been due that amount to a little over 5k.   Can I file both documents at once?  Or should I wait to file the DOL wage complaint?  In my previous post about this issue I had someone mention I didn't have to wait to file the DOL wage claim but I would like to know how they'd be able to investigate or make a determination if I haven't been ruled an employee yet?   Thanks guys.	No
So I am looking to rent a new place, the application I applied for had [this wording](http://i.imgur.com/w8PqZ1y.png). The landlord is telling me the fee is separate from the security deposit. From my understanding this went towards the deposit, am I in the wrong here?	No
Hello My wife and I agreed that we need a divorce. We are aiming for uncontested divorce.  We have been married for 4 years - we have reached a point after counseling and therapy  And multiple attempts that our relationship is toxic and we need to end our marriage. This is so overwhelming to me as I am ali dealing with my ill father and finding work which adds up stress. Now we both can't afford a lawyer in the Los Angeles area and need to find legal help to do the paper work properly. Since we neither can't afford at the time to get our own place we will have to live together till divorce is final and also since we have three months on our apartments lease- can we still live together while seeking divorce? Does it really take all 6 months till we get divorce decree? Is it possible to get a Probono lawyer to help us submit the uncontested divorce paperwork?  We only share a car loan debt of 9000$ no assets or property we own and no children. This breaks my heart as I love her and it's days before my birthday as well as my fathers third surgery. I don't know what to do or how to go about this- it will definetly cause me financial hardship now that I am currently unemployed and she works part time  I can use any piece of advice or experience I can get from those who have walked down that line	No
Paid application fee, first month's rent, security deposit/fee/nonrefundable. Do I still have to accept the unit? First one was on a great floor at the front of the complex. This one isn't and at the back and pretty shady. They are sending over a new contract with the new unit #. At what point is my money gone if I don't want this unit if I can break the lease?	No
"Sorry if my post is a little messy, this just happened yesterday and I've been a complete wreck.  A little backstory: my cat was about 13 or 15 years old (I can't recall what age I adopted him, I think I was 7 or 8), and I'd had him since he was about three weeks old, and we grew up together. I have severe anxiety due to mental illness, childhood abuse, and the death of my father, and he was classified as a therapy animal by my therapist who'd I'd been seeing for four years at that point. He was my best and only friend and I'm just beside myself.  On Sunday I let my cat outside (he had arthritis and liked to lie out in the sun for a couple of hours before coming inside, I guess it helped because he started walking better once it got sunny) and went about my day. Later as I was outside, I saw a huge Boxer dog carrying something in his mouth; once I realized it was my cat, I streaked across the lawns to the neighbor's house where I basically had to fight the dog off my cat so I could hold him as he died in my arms. I was inconsolable and traumatized. The owner wasn't present, but her mother was and assured me that she was sorry and informed me that the young child in the house had incorrectly tethered the Boxer dog to its chain, causing it to break out of its yard and run into mine, where it found my cat.  After wrapping my cat up and talking to the owner when she got home, she apologized and offered to pay for any bills, which I accepted. I called a vet, got an estimate for cremation, and everything at that point seemed as settled as it could be.  I walked to her house this morning as I was headed over to the vet appointment to ask her for the finances she offered, and she refused, saying she didn't have the money and that she has leukemia and simply doesn't make enough to cover the bills. I told her I was sorry that she was ill but she is responsible for my cat's death and she needed to take responsibility, and she told me to contact her attorney. My mom offered to pay for my cat's cremation, but now I don't have money for an urn to put the ashes in (the vet doesn't offer free urns so it would come in a sealed bag).  **Since she told me to take her to court, I'm here asking for advice. Here's a TL;DR bulletpoint with information**  **My therapy cat was killed by an unleashed Boxer dog and the owner refuses to take financial responsibility.**  * The leash law in West Virginia states:   &gt; ¬ß19-20-13. Dog running at large; liability of owner.  &gt; Any owner or keeper of any dog who permits such dog to run at large shall be liable for any damages inflicted upon the person or property of another by such dog while so running at* large.  * My city within West Virginia's leash law states:  &gt;  The City Code of Ordinances Chapter 4 states that ""no person shall allow any dog owned by him or in his custody to run at large within the city. The term ""running at large"" means allowing a dog to leave the property limits of property owned, leased or occupied by its owner without restraint. The term ""restraint"" means being secured by a leash or lead, or being under the control of a responsible person and obedient to that person's command.""  * The owner admitted fault and offered to pay for damages * The owner then refused to pay for damages she previously offered * The owner requested that I take her to court * The owner verbally attacked me when I went to her house on Monday (I don't know if this is relevant but I'm including it) * The owner admitted negligence in allowing her young child to handle a Boxer dog three times her size (again I don't know if this is relevant but she admitted to being negligent in this respect) * The owner keeps three dogs in a 3x4 kennel in the backyard, which is way too small for the size of her dogs * The owner admitted that her Boxer dog was actually looking for a different cat that has been wandering around her yard lately, so she admitted to knowledge that her dog had vicious intent but did nothing to prevent it  I can't think of anything else. I don't want pain and suffering money, I don't want to hurt her, I just want her to pay for the price of my cat's urn. I want to put this behind me so I can grieve my best friend. I haven't had a day of restful sleep or without crying and and wailing into a pillow for two days. I'm really hoping you guys have any advice, and I thank you in advance."	No
"This isn't a traditional ""legal advice"" type of thing, so if it's deemed inappropriate for the sub, mods can remove.   I got roped into a catfish, but it's such a well designed one, it's worrying. Typical catfishes are usually just bots, right? Not this one. This person has been going around Instagram of local people and attempting to message them and get their Snapchat.   They added me and I went along with it. They've been adding people through the ""suggested"" portion on Instagram and then adding them on snap if they can get it. Dude even knows local high schools and things so it's definitely an in area deal. The catfish itself is also super obvious. I asked for pics of them touching their pinky finger to their ear, which they sent a pic of a random girl doing from their laptop. I asked for a similar pic of them with a fork pressed to their nose. They sent a pic of a different girl with a fork in their mouth. They then started pressuring me by asking if I'm single, if I wanna meet up, and sending obvious videos of porn from their laptop.   I'm not stupid enough to fall into this shit, but it worries me that other local kids will. Again, this is a local thing as they know area high schools. Should I be contacting the authorities about this? This seems troubling"	No
I'm a college student. On Aug 1, I will be moving into the spare bedroom of a home owned (and occupied) by a woman whose ad I responded to on Craigslist.   When I asked her about a lease, she said she typically doesn't use them, has been renting her spare rooms to students for the past ten years without issue, and has 'always trusted her gut'. She also mentioned something about it impacting a homestead tax exemption, which might not necessarily be legal but also isn't my concern. Our agreement (verbal, not written) is that I'll pay a set rate every month and that, if I want to move out, I just need to give two months' notice - no security deposits, no first/last.   Being someone who would rather not commit to something like a 12-month lease at the moment anyhow, I was happy to hear this (and yes, I am assuming that that two months' notice thing goes both ways, and am OK with it). Now, though, I'm wondering whether I should insist on at least a written agreement of some kind.   On one hand, this woman OOZES levelheadedness and hasn't put up any red flags for me whatsoever - plus, I would imagine she has more to lose than I do from not having a lease. And on the other hand - well, you can never tell with people.  Am I potentially getting myself into trouble here? Is a rental agreement still valid if it's not in writing? What rights, if any, am I giving up by not having a written agreement?   Thanks for any input, folks.   **Tl;dr Am moving into spare bedroom in a stranger's home, she seems to prefer not having a written lease. Should I insist on one?**	No
Hello r/legaladvice. I feel like I'm starting to become a regular on this sub ever since I bought my house. Long story short, my neighbor will call the police if ANY leaves from my tree or ANY grass blades from me cutting my grass go into her yard (yes, she stands out there and watches me cut the grass).  Last week we talked  to one another with a police officers presence so we can try and work something out. Basically, the moment she sees a leaf in her yard, she gets pissed. I told her I'm not home all the time to constantly monitor every single fucking leaf that falls from my tree. Oh, the tree is on the OPPOSITE side of the yard from her. My yard is not littered with leaves and the police even said that my yard looks fine but she persists on calling the police out every time anything comes into her yard.  I have done my research on the situation, as dumb as I think it is, but once a leaf falls from a tree, I'm not liable for what happens to it. That's what internet articles say at least. Could anybody produce any sort of Pennsylvania state legal documentation that says that leaves falling from a tree is not a crime? Lol. I can't believe I am even here asking this but I'm getting really sick of the police coming out for everything I do outside. I just want to present it to the police/neighbor so it stops.	No
"Hey, Guys! It's my first time posting here but I've been a long time lurker of this Sub.  I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do here so I figured I would ask.. Back in mid June my fianc√© and I went to see a movie at the local theater. We were leaving and back on the main road that has a few exits onto a main highway. It was very busy and the traffic was stop and go. While trying to change lanes into the lane to our left the traffic again paused very quickly and we hit the back of the car in front of us. It was a low speed collision and there was absolutely no damage to the other car, not even a dent. We took pictures. We have been in contact with the other drive since and there have been no issues with her car. Our vehicle took some damage but we later found out it was cosmetic only and only because our inner rebar had rusted. The damage was minimal enough that we did not go through our insurance.  Cops were called, everyone gave statements.. As far as car accidents go it was pleasant. I was not driving (I currently have an injury that prevents me from doing so but didn't drive previously either). My fianc√© was. He has been driving for over 10 years and had never been in an accident before. This was his first. We get a ticket to appear in court.  We get there at the court date and are given a packet of info pertaining to the case. Included is the full police report as well as a plea deal. His plea deal was for a $85 fine and 2 demerit points. We were shocked... Both of us had assumed it would be a fine only. We considered taking the plea but then started looking through the report. The summery that the Cops wrote does not match what actually happened at all, nor does it match the statements from either of us or the other driver.  In the report it states that we were turning onto the road we were already on from a completely different road and literally turned into her from there. This sounds much worse than what actually took place and there is a diagram to match this false account. At the court was the first time we had seen this report. It also states that the other car had a dent and took damage which is untrue and we have pictures to prove that. I am able to take pictures of this if it would help for advice on here.  I'm at a loss. When we got to the judge he tried to explain that the report wasn't correct but all we got was a new date to appear, which is this coming Wednesday. This is new territory for both of us and I'm not sure what to do next or what he may need to say to get this dealt with. The original plea is still on the table. The technical charge is ""Changing Lanes Not in Safety"". There was a woman ahead of us in court who was there for ""Wreckless Driving"" which originally held a charge of 6 demerit points and her plea was for 2 and a fine.  Neither of us think his plea accurately reflects the accident. We're just really shocked at how all of this went down considering he has such a clean record (like, not even a speeding ticket!).  Really, we just need advice on how to move forward. Thanks in advance. :)"	No
I‚Äôve had this phone number for nearly 2 years now. And when I first got the phone number i would receive unwanted calls but that‚Äôs normal. I Would inform them this is no longer ‚Äúso and so‚Äôs‚Äù phone number and then would block them. Over the course of time I‚Äôve learned the previous phone number holders name and nicknames but that‚Äôs about it. Since the beginning of December I‚Äôve been getting calls from this woman who would call looking for ‚Äúso and so‚Äù and i would tell her ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt ‚Äòso and so‚Äôs‚Äô number anymore and then would block it.‚Äù But she managed to keep getting new phone numbers and continuing to call. It turned into this degrading competition to her to see how many nasty things she could call me. I told her the whole story. How i have had the phone number for a while and that that‚Äôs how i knew who the previous owner was but that i didn‚Äôt know him in real life and she wouldn‚Äôt believe me. She would call and say awful things. Calling me a ‚Äúscary ass bitch.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat I‚Äôm just a little side hoe‚Äù that i was nothing but a ‚Äúlittle piece of ass‚Äù for this man. So i put her phone number into Facebook and sure enough i found her and where she lives and all about her. Mind you any time she would call from a new number i would continue to block it. Then she decided to start calling from No Caller ID which i couldn‚Äôt block. I would get 40 phone calls in 5 minutes from this woman. Continuing to leave voicemails and call me horrible things. Now she‚Äôs threatening to show up to the previous phone number owners home and ‚Äúbeat the fuck out of me‚Äù i told her I‚Äôm filing a police report. But I‚Äôm not sure how to go about that. I‚Äôve never had to do this before. I seriously want her to learn a lesson. She‚Äôs nearly 40 years old. It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs a 16 year old little girl who‚Äôs got her britches up her butt. This is a grown woman calling and harassing and threatening me and I‚Äôm only barely turning 20.   Suggestions? And how should i go about filing a report?   Thank you so much in advance. 	No

"the parts of the lease they've highlighted are;     4. **Rent.** Rent for the full Term shall be paid in monthly installments of $700.00 payable in advance, on or before twelve o'clock noon on the **first** day of each calendar month during the term of this Lease at the office of the Landlord at: X, without notice (""Rent"") 14. **Late Fee.** In the event any payment required hereunder is not made within five (5) days after the payment is due, a **late charge in the amount of 10%** of the payment will be paid by the Tenant. Such fee shall be deemed ab Additional Payment. No partial payment or performance by the Tenant or acceptance by the Landlord shall cure any outstanding default, stop the Landlord from pursuing, or continuing to pursue, remedies for such default, or act as a waiver.    i paid my rent on the fourth of this month and quite frankly i literally cannot afford to pay this late fee if i want to eat. also worth noting that my landlord is actually the father of the person who i interacted with when signing the lease and who is trying to get me to pay a late fee.     she has also included a cause in the lease that in the case of any legal dispute that goes to court the tenant has to pay the legal fees. am i boned?"

"Hey friends, would love the community's thoughts on my situation.   I own and operate an ecommerce store. We're currently talking to a well-known artist about licensing his work to use on our merchandise.   The artist's licensing people have asked for a proposed royalty, advance, and guarantee. I'm trying to calculate these figures in a way that makes sense. In the last 30 days, our top 400 products generated a total of $1900 in sales per product (over $20k annualized). We plan on licensing over 500 designs from the artist. What sort of calculation needs to happen here?   My understanding is that a royalty of about 15% is appropriate give the fame of the artist and the fact that I operate a sort of ""specialty shop."" I've heard a $25k advance for an artist's catalog makes sense. But what about the guarantee?   We only have an online presence (only retail, no wholesale).   Does anyone have any experience in this area? Many thanks in advance."	No
(Indiana and California, for the bot, but I think it's all federal.)   My former cell phone provider thinks I owe them $300. I disagree, but that's not really the issue here.  I sent a general dispute letter the first time it was sent to collections, asking for verification. Instead of verification, I got a letter back from the collection agency that they were returning it to the cell provider. Today, I got a new letter in the mail from a different agency.  I plan on disputing that one as well, but if the same thing happens, is there a point where I'm done? Or can the provider just keep sending it to a new collection agency every time I dispute it, rather than having them actually send the verifications they're required to provide by law?   Sending certified letters will eventually rack up more than the debt, but I'd hate for the one I don't send certified to be the one I actually have a solid FDCPA violation with.	No
"Hello, throwaway account here...originally posted in thr wrong sub...  Seeking some advice on my current situation. A little background...  Currently living in a small, older apartment with less than 10 apartments in the building. Have lived with my wife, toddler, and infant for the past year without any issue. Rent is affordable and the location is ideal. The most attractive part is that the landlord doesn't rent to college kids, which was important with my family.  Once our lease ended this summer, we decided to renew for this upcoming year. We verbally agreed to the lease through text message this past June, which would start August 1st. We have NOT received a lease to sign as of today.  Unbeknownst to us, our landlord had trouble filling out the apartment directly above ours and we had college kids move into it recently. We received no warning to this and only found out in passing from a neighbor.  It has been a nightmare since they have moved in. With it being an older building, sounds travels through the floors/walls. The first few nights consisted of moving furniture at 10:30 pm at night, people coming in and out of the building at all times, and vaccuming past midnight. I understand thry are college kids. Hell, I wouldn't have wanted to live next to me when I was a college kid if I had a family. I thought a few knocks on the ceiling to the apartment above us when they got loud would solve our issues.  I was wrong. Things gradually increased. The kids have only gotten louder. My wife and I have respected the fact that they are college kids and make sure our kids stay quiet before 9 am. We don't feel that we are being unreasonable with asking for them to quiet down after 10 am. Last week, I bought up my concerns with the landlord and asked him to speak with the kids. We asked for them to respect the fact for them to quiet down at 10 pm and maybe save the vaccuming for the afternoons. He defended them by suggesting they didn't think vaccuming at midnight was a problem. He always promised to speak to them. It has yet to happen.  The last two nights have been the final straw. The parents are in town visiting and brought some furniture over. I was looking forward to potentially getting a good nights sleep. Once again, they decide to bring in the furniture at 11 pm at night and move it around. Once my infant is woke up from the noise, I send a text to my landlord regarding it. I receive a reply in the morning with a ""promise to speak to them."" Last night, they once again have people in and out of the apartment. The infant and toddler are both woke up from yelling from upstairs. I decide to handle it myself and head upstairs. I find a parent standing in the open doorway of their apartment. I ask her if she ""could please keep it down since my kid was woken up?"" I receive a nice glare and an ""ok."" It continues far past 1 am.  I have reached my breaking point and have lined up a rental at a small, more expensive location where I do NOT have to worry about the noise. Again, I understand that they are college kids. I don't have an issue with that. Our schedules just don't match up and it is starting to affect my family.  Since I have not signed a lease (I did pay rent for August), but agreed to one through text, am I able to move out without consequence? Has anyone had a similar situation? How did you handle it? I am looking to make a break as cleanly as possible. I don't anticipate a way of making things work with the current location.  I apologize for the long post and venting. Any suggestions are appreciated!"	No
My father fell at work (construction) in November 2016, tripping over a tarp on the ground. At the time he was sore but no severe or lasting pain. Two weeks later, he was laid off for the winter season, starting back to work in April. In early December he was casting a fishing rod and his shoulder dislocated. He was able to pop it back in and has been fine until the last few months. He has had his shoulder dislocate a number of times since April and more recently 3 times over the last week. These dislocations are severely painful for him, to the point that the pain is unbearable for him. A doctor's appointment with xray results showed that there was an past (healed) fracture and new liesions, most likely as a result of repeated dislocations. I am wondering if this is a workmans comp issue since the only fall that could have caused a fracture was at work last November, or if this would not qualify for workman's comp.	No

My grandmother passed away in February. Originally, my aunt was supposed to buy the house (about 50% left on the mortgage). She has since decided to move to another state. My mother presented me with the opportunity to take it over instead.   We've been setting plans for my wife and I to move from Massachusetts (where we live) to Indiana (where my grandmother's house is).   I grew up lower middle class and my Grandmother is the only person my family to have a consistent living space for more than a few years. She had it paid off at one point and has since taken a second mortgage (im not certain on my terminology).   This has felt like a true blessing. My wife and I have even talked about starting our family. I never thought I'd be able to buy a house at 26, let alone my grandmother's house! It's been grandma's house since before i was born.  Today, a week from moving there, my mother found out medicaid took a lein on her estate.   Please tell me anything i can do. I'm so scared of losing my grandma's house. We are paycheck to paycheck people doing our best and this felt like the break that comes once in 3 lifetimes. My grandma worked hard her entire life for this house.	No
"First post and I'm on mobile so I apologize for the errors/formatting.  Beginning of April A tree has fallen on the back side of my property and is now blocking my path down the hill. Since there was no storm the previous night I checked out the roots of the tree and found grey looking water seeping from the hillside where the tree was. So I decided to contact the health department to see what was up. So I got ahold of the county health department.He said he'd come out and investigate.   April 14th I showed him the water lying underneath the tree. He asked if it was my property, I told him it was on the line seeping into my property and over my bank. He said he'd have to test the water to see if its sewage or not, and to not say anything to my neighbor, ""let me handle it, don't act like you even know me.""   Couple days pass and I notice a large amount of mosquitos laying eggs in the water. The health department sends me some mosquito dunks to deal with that problem, and I ask what's the progress on my case. He tells me that he can't get ahold of my neighbor by phone or knocking on his door, and that there is no record of him installing this sewage tank.   End of June He gets back to me and tells me he ran a test on the water by sending dye down his sink drain and let it run for an hour while he sat and talked to my neighbor. He couldn't find any dye in the grey water so he tells me it can't be from his sewage and that it must be 100 year old leaf water (whatever that is.) Basically telling me I should just drop the whole thing.   Mid July Not satisfied with this I called them again and asked to please not close my case, what else can I do. He told me to take it up with the state. So I called them and they sent over two vials for me to sample the water and send it back to them to be tested.   Yesterday I filled both vials and drove it to Charleston myself.   This morning They called and told me the results and emailed them to me as well and said my neighbors line must have busted or something, test results show positive.  Vial 1 E. coli-present-670 per 100mL  Total coliforms-present-17,329 per 100mL  Vial 2 E. coli-present-591 per 100mL  Total coliforms-present-24,196 per 100mL    So where do I stand? The sewage is eroding my trees and hillside at the back of my property. The man at my county health department apparently dropped the whole part of my neighbor not even installing the tank legally/through the county.   Is there any legal action I can take to have my neighbor remove his septic tank and have it properly installed?"	No
So, I rent an apartment in a complex managed by a large management company. I'm on the third floor and all of this week they have been replacing the structures and concrete on all the floors landings. It was supposed to be done 8 to 5 Monday through Friday. Ending yesterday. ( which we recieved a notice for) Well, here it is 10am Saturday morning and they are just starting to pour concrete and I am literally trapped in my apartment until after 3pm. They gave no notice that this would be happening today, nor that I would be unable to leave my apartment. What can I do about this?	No

Florida, if it matters.  I'm helping my Ex with a suit against his HOA. They have not done by right by him or the community that's made his living conditions miserable for the last 5 years. I'm talking toilet water flooding in from upstairs, not repairing it correctly, mold and mildew, constant construction, unprofessional management, not overseeing renovations, and many many other things that are not part of my question. :)  What's the best way for us to prepare our evidence for you? These events took place throughout the 5 years. It will consist of mostly pictures, video, and emails with a few paragraphs explaining what happened.  I looked into some of the software that companies are marketing for you. But the ones that look good cost money for a one-off use and are desktop-only, no cloud or collaboration.  I believe the best method is organized by time and event with everything associated attached. However there is a lot of it and it's easy to get it confused. My first though was to make a Google Slides presentation for each event as it would be a way to easily present the information and can be exported into multiple or a single PDF.   How does that sound? What would you like from a client? I want to make this as easy and possible for the lawyer.	No
I'm an FLSA exempt employees in California.  Last weekend, my employer had a major emergency and needed me to remedy it.  After working my 40 hour week, I was kept in the office until obscene hours and asked to return each day of the weekend.  When the problem was fully solved, I had spent nearly 40 extra hours working between the hours of 6pm friday and midnight Sunday. I slept very little each day. When I asked if I could take Monday off to fix my sleep schedule, I was told no. I have yet to receive any extra compensation and am being asked to work every Saturday for a month, on top of my Monday-Friday work week. By EOD this Saturday, I believe I will have seen a 90+ hour work week with no extra compensation.  Enough of the sob story. I just wanted to give context around the magnitude of the situation.  I've read many posts on FLSA exempt employees and how they can be required to work extra without a compensation change. I consider that a given.  My question is, what's the upper boundary of extra required hours? Surely there are laws to protect these workers from situations that are a danger to their health?	No
Quick question for everyone here. I just got a speeding ticket via photo enforcement in Washington DC. I was going 16 over so it's a 150 dollar fine.   I have two questions for everyone here.    1) If I go to contest the penalty is there a judge that I speak with or is it a random person behind a desk? I ask this because it looks like the address is just a suite and not a court house.   2) What are the odds that the judge lowers the fine if I've never had a moving violation before? (Been driving for over 6 years) Is it even worth me going in? Or should I just pay it.    I am obviously guilty of speeding. I'm not contesting the ticket itself. I am wondering if the fine can be reduced though.	No
I gave my Landlord everything I had, applied to a new apartment  (got the call today that I got it) but now the Landlord is beating down my door, and I'm sure he threatened me through it a few times with coming in and ditching my stuff on the side of the road.  The pay rent or quit notice I was given is invalid, and they have not served me a Court Eviction paper, so I know what they're doing is illegal. I have reached out to a local firm to get legal back up in the situation but with the threatening and feeling terrified of leaving the apartment I am wondering if I should contact the police.	No
My friends car was stolen out of my driveway last week and the cops found it 2 days ago and towed it to a local impoundment. My friend is in Europe for the next 2 weeks (from US) and will obviously not be able to pick up. The impoundment is charging $30 per day which will add up to about $400 plus the cost of towing. Is there any way that he can give me permission to get his car out? The impoundment is claiming there is no way anyone can retrieve it besides my friend.	No
"I'll try to keep it brief. I was just pulled over (petty traffic, improper signal). No biggie, until cop comes back with license ""you're driving on a suspended, we're writing you $500 in tickets and impounding your car"". Uhhhhhh....what? This was just now.  More info:  I had let a ticket lapse, but two months ago I paid 1/4 of it off and setup a payment plan, this is what I was told I needed to do to reinstate my license. I've made every payment on time and have even paid more than the minimum to pay it off quickly. I have another ticket that is newer that I have not paid off or setup a payment on, but I went to the courthouse and spoke with a clerk before a work trip where I was responsible for driving a company vehicles and I was told I am still within the 60 day ""grace"" window. I am still supposedly in that window.    I know I need to go to the courthouse to figure this out tomorrow, but my question is: will I be able to seek damages from the state for not following their own rules? I'm not going to be able to work this week (need to be able to drive), and the impound fees are always a nightmare. I'm sure a judge will throw out the tickets given this is apparently an administrative glitch...  I'm in Oregon."	No
Starting in September, I'll be moving into an apartment with 5 other tenants. It's been brought to my attention that one tenant, well call him Tommy, hasn't paid any of his fees yet (security deposit, last months rent) but has signed the lease. Is there anyway to remove him from the lease or is he legally contracted to pay up?	No
Hi, I'm signing a lease for an apartment in Florida, that comes with attached garage. The lease says I am to get notice to enter except emergency for the apartment, but says owner can enter the attached garage at any time without notice. Is this legal?	No
"So I pled ""no contest"" to a shoplifting charge I received after a night out drinking with buddies 3 hours away. I appeared in magistrate court and the judge cut the fine to $1 not including court cost, which I paid on the spot, but also had to pay $50 in resitutions to Sheetz. I wasn't given any information on how to do that when I was at the courthouse and haven't received any mail about it. What do I do? The magistrate judge said it wouldn't be difficult to get the charge expunged and wanted me to follow through with it quickly since I'm a medical student and this can affect my residency. How do I pay the restitutions? And is it necessary to have them paid by the time I file for expungement?"	No
My renter neighbors are incapable of following multiple HOA rules. I've tried talking to them, they just spurt a million excuses. The biggie is with vehicles. 24/7 they would work on their cars (fluid changes, brakes, you name it) and park in the street. We've been woken up multiple times by them working on loud cars in the middle of the night.    I finally snapped, took a photo of multiple infringements, and sent it to the HOA. First time filing a complaint, our HOA claims reports are anonymous. The HOA apparently forwarded my photo to the home owner, who then gave it to the renters.   A little about the photo: The people in the photo are in the (public) street, profile view, and too far away to get a proper ID. Their house is in the photo with it's house number legible. They of course have no way of proving specifically who took the photo, simply that it likely came from my house.   So anyway, renters come over furious and start spurting nonsense about having a police officer in the family and they said taking a photo like that was illegal and they could sue me, on and on. I told them to go ahead and do whatever they thought was necessary.   Now I'm second guessing myself. My understanding of photo/video/etc taking legality in Colorado, USA is that if that unless it's somewhere that privacy should be expected (ie a bathroom, changing room, etc) it's perfectly legal to take a photo of them without their consent. It is of course best to err on the side of caution, like definitely don't go taking photos through an open window, etc. A public street is clearly uh public, right?  Good news is they've ceased working on vehicles in the street.   Tl;dr Took a photo of my neighbors violating HOA regulations in the street, neighbors got ahold of the photo, and threatened to sue me.  And sorry, on mobile.	No
"My 3 roommates and I just moved into a new house. Let's call my them Aaron, Adam, and Matt.   Aaron and Adam found the house. It fit all the criteria and after seeing the place with the landlord they told her that we're 4 room mates. She didn't like this and said the house is for 3 people to live in. It's practically 4 bedroom and 1500 square feet so it made no sense. They said okay thanks but we will keep looking.   Later the landlord calls back Aaron and they talk more about the 4 room mate situation. Aaron tells the landlord that Matt is just a guest and not really a ""roommate"". This part was true. He moved in with us at our old house and was staying as a guest but it looked like he'd move in full time (as the new house was bigger). Lease is signed. Three of us signed the lease (not including Matt).   After moving in this weekend the land lord is saying that she wants a written document with the guest's SSN &amp; the exact date he will leave with all of us signing it. If we fail to do so she said she will use it as grounds to evict. No where on the lease does it say anything about 4 people not being allowed to live in the house. Quite honestly two of the bedrooms are big enough for 2 people to share (for a total of 6). No idea why she's doing this. I should mention that one of the bedrooms is actually a family room but has a separate door and is private. It can be used as a bedroom. She verbally expressed to Aaron and Adam when they were looking at the house that she wouldn't like it to be used as a bedroom. Does she even get a say in this? I'll sleep in the kitchen and cook in the bathroom if I want can't I?  I'm not in love with the house but moving is such a hassle that I do not want to deal with it again. What should we do? Should we write up a document as she requested? Or just not contact her? Is she allowed to come and inspect to see who's living where and how many people? Any help is appreciated!"	No
"Hey legal advice, should be a quick questions.   I rent a house with 4 of my friends. The kitchen sink has been mostly plugged since we moved in. I asked he landlord to deal with it within the first 2 weeks that we moved in. He sent somebody but they didn't really unplug the sink, just made it barely usable. We have dealt with this as is for a couple months now. When it gets really bad occasionally somebody will use a plunger to unclog the sink and allow it to drain. We are not putting food down the drain - we use the food catch and empty it often. When I got home after being away this past weekend I noticed the sink had detached from the bottom of the sink, leaving an inch or two gal between the countertop and the sink basin. I informed the landlord and he is blaming us because we used a plunger on the sink a few times. The repair bill came out to $280 ($220 labour, $60 materials). While the landlords contractor was repairing the sink i spoke with him for 10-15 minutes about the job. He told me that the sink failed because it wasn't installed properly and had essentially been held in place by nothing but silicone sealant acting as a glue to the underside of the countertop.   When I asked the landlord (who is very set on us including this $280 with our next rent payment) he is adamant that improper installation was not the cause as it was ""professionally installed 10 years ago by Home Depot"", his words.   How, if possible, can I get out of some or all of this ridiculous charge?"	No
"Hi!  I don't know what to do here.  I just moved to Virginia, found and signed a lease before arriving. The place is lovely but the AC was only working downstairs when I arrived on Thursday and now isn't working at all since Sunday. The seemingly terrible property manager (for other reasons besides this) originally said this was normal but after pushing, had someone come out 2 days after move in and just switched the dampers. A day after he left, the AC stopped working all together.  A new HVAC tech was sent on Wednesday and said there was just a little refrigerant left and he was going to recommend to he owner to refill that or replace the unit all together.   Today is Friday and the property manager reported that the owner talked to the AC company and said it was fully operational. This is not the case.  It was 85 degrees at 11pm last night, I'm near 8 months pregnant, and it is impossible to do any kind of unpacking because it's so hot during the day.   The owner is taking her time now because she believes it is working(?). She's sending out a tech again for ""preventative maintenance"" on Monday.  It's Friday, so that will be another weekend of no AC.  I'm foreseeing now that on Monday, the AC tech will hopefully verify and report back that it is completely down and it will be weeks during the days it takes to schedule a tech for troubleshooting, scheduling for any repairs, the time it is taking the owner to make the decisions and her seeming hesitance to put any kind of urgency on this. Is there anything I can do here or am I at the mercy of her and the property managers very slow approach to this.   Perhaps I should also mention that the property manager did a walk through when we moved in - the place was filthy (crumbs and food left in pantry and fridge, broken glass and film on counter, multiple spider webs and bugs) despite the property manager insisting it was professionally cleaned.  I overheard him talking to the owner and said we wanted cleaning because ""there was some dust around"".  I'm concerned he's conveying messages and understating the issues, although today I reached out directly to the owner to tell her the AC was completely broken, which she didn't believe because the AC company supposedly reported differently.   I hate this. After a long move and not being able to unpack, not being able to use the stove or oven, not being able to sleep comfortably because of the heat, I am near my breaking point.  I'm tired, I'm pregnant, I want to sleep and have my things unpacked and be cool.   Is there anything that can be done???"	No
First off we three each paid a deposit to this apartment of $100. The front desk woman we gave these money orders to was just terminated by management. The new management says since they have no evidence of us paying through money order we must prove it through receipts. If I can't find the original receipt what can I do from there? Old management lost the deposits and now I'm in a confused place on this.	No
"Clarksville TN, CHS.  I sold and printed about a hundred shirts with the message ""Sex Is Okay"" and a illustration of a bee. They are innocent in appearance, as was my intention.  The reason I did this was to promote a more open culture in regard to sexuality among people of my generation. I live in the southern US where sex negativity is at the root of massive STD rates, teen pregnancies, and foolish legal jurisdictions. I knew the school wouldn't be HAPPY about this, but since I saw them as being a part of the problem, I figured that was unavoidable.  What I did not expect was for the school to bar me and my fellow supporters from wearing the shirts all together.  I understand that the school DOES have the right to bar freedom of speech if it is ""vulgar"" as defined by the Bethel VS. Fraser case, and if it poses a ""material and substantial disruption"" as defined by the Des Moines VS Tinker supreme court trial, but I can see no argument by which the word ""sex"" is vulgar, as there is no more politically correct replacement. Besides, the word is included in non-literary educational material.  Am I missing something important here? Is the school perfectly within their right?  ------------------------------------ TLDR: Printed and sold shirts reading ""Sex Is Okay' for a movement I've been working on. High School banned them. Is my freedom of expression being trodden upon?"	No
Advice?  I normally would be somewhat okay with this as it is a short period of time, but upon the threat that if the door was locked she would break in I am worried about keeping her things here.	No
My neighbor last night drunkenly harassed me, and started banging on my front door then my back door and after several warning to go away or I would call the police, I did. They came, they did nothing but laugh at the situation, then they left. After they left my neighbor tried to have another conversation and proceeded to insult me and I ended the conversation by going back into my apartment. They she started to message me on social media ( I don't know her or have ever exchanged information) harassing me again. I have blocked her. I contacted the landlord about the event. But I want to know if I have any grounds to break my lease and move because of what happened and me not feeling comfortable here anymore.	No
"I took over a lease with a previous tenant. There was already a washer and dryer installed and the tenant told me they were his and that I could have them when I moved out.  The week before my lease ended, the landlord came to view the unit and looked at the appliances and asked who they belonged to. I told her to inform me if they belonged to the complex before I moved out so I could leave them. She never did, and the tenant confirmed they were not the apartments, so I moved cities and took them with me.  The landlord sent me an email and said she will be filing a report for theft since I took their property. The tenant said they were a gift so he doesn't have proof of purchase, but he said he requested the previous washer and dryer to be removed so he could install his. The landlord can't find the work order, so this is her ""proof"" that the units belong to the apartment. The brand isn't even the same as the ones supplied by the apartment!  I don't know what to do! I don't want to be arrested and I don't have any money to pay for the units. She will not accept me just simply returning the units. I've never been involved in something like this so I have no idea what I should be doing. I have a clean record and I don't want it tarnished, I don't want to be a criminal"	No
Hello r/legaladvice! This is my first time posting so I hope I'm doing this right. I am a tenant in Toronto Ontario who has been renting a room in a basement apartment for the past year. The basement has 4 rooms, one of which I occupy, and the landlords live upstairs with their rather large family (somewhere in the 9-11 range). I signed for a one year lease running from Sept 2016 - Aug 2017, so this is my last month renting. I intend to move somewhere else after my lease is up.  My relationship with my landlords up until now has been fine. I pay my rent on time (and in cash per their request), am quiet, and keep the common areas clean. However, after I notified them I would be leaving in September, they started showing my room without any notice. This slightly irked me, but I figured I really couldn't do anything. Also, I had been spending more and more time at my girlfriends, so I was rarely there anyways. It was more of just a place to keep my stuff and occasionally cook/shower.   I should also mention that the three other tenants who had been renting with me this year somehow disappeared at the beginning of the summer, leaving the entire basement to myself. I know two the them were related to and/or friends of the landlords, so they probably weren't paying rent. I've messaged the third to find out her situation.  Fast forward to this past Sunday when I return from a five day trip to find that the entire upper floor of the house was under renovation and the whole family had moved into the basement apartment, save for my room. Their stuff is piled everywhere, from hallways to the common areas. There is literally not an inch of counter space left in the kitchen from food being piled everywhere. They have 4 small children, and coupled with the sound of destruction from upstairs, the noise is unbearable. I received no notice of this and I find it unacceptable.   The catch is, knowing that I was going to be away on my trip right up until my last months rent was due, I payed my rent early. So I can't withhold my last months rent, I have to ask for it back.   I guess my real question is, are they doing something wrong? They obviously should have notified me of this changed arrangement, but are they actually breaking any laws that I could take them to court for if they don't give me my money back? I feel like there must be something but I just don't know where to look.  Thank you in advance. I hope I explained everything thoroughly enough.	No
My roommate and I signed a lease for an apartment (September-September) in Nova Scotia two months ago. Now, almost a month before we're supposed to move in, she tells me out of the blue she cannot come live with me, she has to stay at home. Her (completely legitimate) reason being she is incredibly sick, her mental and physical health issues have caught up with her, and she has to stay home near her doctors until January at the very earliest. Long story short, she has no other option but to break her lease - the lease we signed together.  From what I understand, since we signed the lease together, if she breaks it, then I am forced to break it, too. If I do that, I have to pay a $300 fine as well as pay monthly rent until new tenants can be found. My other option would be to break it, re-sign it, and be on the hook for my rent as well as hers, unless I find a new roommate. A third option would be to find a new roommate and just sublet my old roommate's room. But, seeing how I apparently need to give a month's notice for a sublet, I have two days to find a new roommate (which is an incredibly difficult, if not impossible, task, especially when I do not live in Nova Scotia and cannot meet potential roommates in person).  My question is this: are my three options I outlined flawed / false in any way? Do I have any other options that I haven't considered, that might be better alternatives? As my roommate is dumping all this on me with such short notice, do I have any protections? Or am I completely and royally screwed?	No
Sorry for being vague, but who knows who is on Reddit? I have a longstanding case against someone who fled the state and has been avoiding service for all legal matters. I have reason to believe they are back and I have a possible address for them. Going up and knocking on the door isn't an option. What is a good way to verify that this person lives where I suspect they do so that I can serve them?	No
I moved into an apartment with my bf and we both signed the lease. He moved out after 2 months because of alcoholism and I stayed. He never paid any rent since the day we moved in, only I have. We broke up and he has been harrassing me and treating me terrible. So I want to get off the lease that he's on and move away. I'm afraid he will not cooperate. Does anyone know what I can do to get him to let me get off the lease and leave.	No
I just moved into a new place, 2br, 2 bath. A good friend of mine wants to move in. Now, I already have a co-signer for me, who is prepared to take care of any problems that may arise. Would my friend also need a co-signer? He has little to no credit.   I have the funds to take care of anything by my own means, so the Co-signer will never be involved, really. I only got a co-signer so I didn't need to to expose too much of my finical situation to my landlord.   Thanks!	No
He freaked out on her and then tried to cover it up saying he was giving the cards back to the respective customers in an effort to get them a better deal on their phones/plans. Shady as fuuuuck. I am certainly not a lawyer, but this smacks of fraud to me.   Question: legally, what specifically is this considered? I'm telling her to seek legal advice, but I need her to understand the gravity of the situation (if there is indeed gravity).  Thanks in advance.	No
One of my neighbors (either the one directly behind me or the one directly above me) smokes a lot. It is annoying. You can smell it mostly in the bathrooms but it isn't unusual for it to permeate throughout the house. The bathroom also gets very smokey. Not like smell but obviously smokey.   My son has a lung disorder and the smoke  often leaves him up at night coughing. It is frustrating. I usually go to my parents or to a hotel but the cost of the hotel will be prohibitive after a while and I'd like to stay in the apartment I rent since I pay for it.    I've talked to management who says that although I specifically requested and got  a no smoking unit, that they made no promise that the adjacent units would be smoke free.   The smoke at some points is enough to set off our smoke detectors nearest the guest bathroom. Usually when we are asleep. I complained to the apartment but their response was to send maintenance out to remove the smoke alarm which is near the bedroom and needs to remain there.  So I asked them to put it back up. The office manager suggested just removing the battery. It goes off a couple of times a week, usually after 10 when we are asleep when whoever starts chain smoking. Around that time, we either leave and go to my parents or we go to the opposite end of the apartment to sleep with the window open.   One of the types of smoking they do is illegal in my state so I've reported them to the police who never come out.   I have looked in my lease and there is no way to break it.   I've tried to talk to the neighbor I think it is because he smokes and leaves dropping everywhere over the building (hallway, porches, etc) who basically told me to get lost and never knock on his door again. He dared me to call the police. Which I did but they again have not come out.   Obviously, my son's health is more important than an apartment lease but I don't make enough money to really break it as they are saying I'll be responsible or the whole of the lease. We've only been there a month.   I've had a doctor note that since moving into the apartment that my son's lung condition has worsened but he obviously doesn't give a concrete reason why. But he did mention that smoking could cause the condition to worsen.   It does have a clause about excess noise and nuisance. Saying I have the right to quiet enjoyment of the apartment and the right not be harassed by neighbors.   Would this be covered under the quiet enjoyment clause?  Also, if they re-rent the apartment they can't collect on the full amount of the least right? They can just collect on the months the unit is unre-rented right?   So obviously I am moving out but I am trying to cut my loss a bit on the cost of breaking my lease. Medical bills are a huge expensive and I just can't afford to pay two leases at the moment. I've offered to negotiate and give them literally everything in my savings at the moment by paying 3 months of rent upfront if they just let me out of the lease. They declined saying as long as the apartment wasn't inhabitable then the full lease stood. They said they could take the full lease amount and let me move out. I don't have that.    Can I do anything here?   Right now, my son is staying with my parents temporarily but it just isn't logistically feasible for a long term solution.	No
"for legal reference, I live in Alaska  TL;DR my roomate is shit and I have shut off most of the breakers at the panel because he won't help pay the electric bill, which he has more than doubled in the time he's lived here.  can he get me arrested for that?  I have one of the worst roommates in the world (I'm working on getting rid of him)... and I'm getting really sick of him... I could write a book on the reasons why... but it really boils down to he is considered disabled, he flashes that victim card every chance he can, and uses it as a crutch.    Anyway, to the point.  he has lived with me for almost 7 years now I think... he is (currently) married and his wife lived here too, but she went to her home country because her mother was sick, and now she doesn't want to come back here and put up with him.  she plans to divorce him.  she also went back just to visit last year before her mother got sick, so she has been gone more often than here.  whenever she is gone, he stops cleaning up after himself at all... so, while she is around, he is not as bad, but he is abusive and that's why she isn't coming back.  she has been gone most of the last year, and so things have been getting bad.  to the point I have stopped using the kitchen entirely because it's too disgusting to use, and I bought a microwave, minifridge and induction burner to use in my room so I can occasionally cook stuff.  the burner tends to blow the breaker though so I don't use it too often.  but I digress again...  so... in all the time they have lived with me they have never helped with the electric bill.  She didn't really do much that used electricity, and initially he didn't either... so no big deal.  roughly a year ago though, my bill jumped from $60-$80ish to $200ish regularly.  last month was slightly under $250.  this was mainly due to him starting to grow his own weed (it's legal here and he mostly stayed within the allowed legal limits).  I do not smoke it or have any interest in it myself so this was not something I was part of.  so I asked him to contribute to the power bill and he said he can't afford it.  I've mentioned it to him occasionally since then and always get the same response.  when his wife went back for her visit last year, she gave him $3000 for his bills... he didn't pay a single bill... instead, he bought her something worth a few hundred dollars, and then bought a $2000 sex doll... he dresses it like Nelliel from Bleach... complete with hollow mask and a sword.  so... his wife for some reason didn't walk out the door when she saw that... but she mentioned to me that he wasted a bunch of money she gave him, and she wouldn't tell me what he bought, but told me to look in the room some time when he isn't around.    so... that's been grating on my nerves a long time, and that's just one of the worst examples, but hardly the only example.  we built our own 3rd bedroom in our living room so that each of us has our own space and the wife made that room hers.  last week I noticed the light was on and I looked inside to find out why, and I notice his computer sitting on the floor... just the main case.  I knew he had been using a computer earlier that day because I heard him typing in his room... he wasn't there so I went and took a look, and as I suspected... brand new alienware computer!  Also, he has a portable radiator style electric heater in there that was running full blast and making the room 90 degrees.  and this just a week or 2 after I paid the highest electric bill I've ever had.    so he and I had it out earlier and I shut off most of the breakers and told him not to touch the breaker panel because it's my electricity and I'm done letting him freeload. as usual he made lots of threats, like ""better make sure your bedroom door is locked tonight"" and then he threatened to call the police on me (which is really ironic seeing as how he has a really low opinion of any authority figure, especially police).  so... as far as the lease agreement, it's month to month, and technically I am the renter and subletting according to the landlord.  the landlord has actually never made me sign a lease agreement though... different issues entirely but I could write a post just as long about him.  he did once have me sign a fake agreement that said I was paying more rent than I was at the time, because he was getting the building appraised and wanted to increase the value.  I am 99% sure, knowing him as I do, that he has long since lost that fake one.  however at one point, in order to help my roomates, he signed a fake agreement with them so that they could use it as proof of residence.  he probably wouldn't even be able to find that one either if pressed though.  the utility bill is in my name only.    so... could I actually get in trouble for this?    the heat is not electric (and it's warm enough this time of year, we don't need it anyway), and I've made sure the fridge still has power, but because I know how he is, I will probably have to turn off the main breaker to the apartment when I leave to work tomorrow or else he will just flip them on until I get home."

Posting for a friend. Female was Injured on the job at a grocery store due to constant lifting. Coerced into not filing a workers comp case, but has x-rays and a chiropractic visit on record from that time period. The company continues to schedule her for active shifts after hr filing her into a non active shifts which she is unable to do.     On top of this, she makes 12.80 an hour. Less than 20k a year. I was wondering what public assistance she might be able to take advantage of to help stay afloat and any recommendation on legal routes to obtain a lawyer.      Thank you	No
"Last fall I moved into my apartment complex and everything was going smoothly. A couple months in, I was offered to attach on another year to my lease, at $50 dollars less a month on the new term.

Neighbor provided false information to previous owner and took a net 1000 sq/ft from previous owner. All surveys were input into software by surveyor indicating this is the case. - Problem is, previous owner trying to remedy something based on false information (seriously, he should have done more to verify) said neighbor could put a chicken coop on our property (2010) (oral). In 2014, the previous owner signed a property agreement reaffirming the original property agreement. It is evident that the previous owner acted on false information and at the very lease agreed via official document 4 years later that the property where the chicken coop resides is his property.  What do you think? - We're in Utah.	No
"I can't seem to find an attorney to speak to in my area until after they would be needed (which I get,no argument about that). I've been evicted. Tried to fight it myself but was unsuccessful.

I‚Äôm living in university housing over the summer (3 months). I was hoping to save some money by sharing a bedroom. This is the description available for the general category of bedroom I chose:  ‚ÄúDouble Occupancy (shared) bedroom ‚Ä¶ configurations vary and include two-person studios, one-bedroom apartment for two interns, and two-bedroom apartments for four interns‚Äù  Now, instead of getting a shared / double occupancy bedroom, my roommate got a small bedroom big enough for one person and I got a bed / dresser in the living room. It‚Äôs pretty big, so no complaints there, but I have literally no privacy and the only thing separating my bed from the kitchen (and kitchen lights!) is a half wall. So basically my roommate has to walk through my ‚Äúbedroom‚Äù to go to the kitchen, go to the bathroom, or exit the room. And when she has people over (and turns on the lights!) I am left in a somewhat awkward position of having to leave the apartment if I don‚Äôt want to join.  I have been snooping around for legal info and I did find this definition according to the Mass Dept. of Environmental Protection for use with listing bedrooms for septic purposes: ‚ÄúBedroom - A room providing privacy, intended primarily for sleeping and consisting of all of the following: (a)   floor space of no less than 70 square feet; (b)   for new construction, a ceiling height of no less than seven feet three inches;   (c)   for existing houses and for mobile homes, a ceiling height of no less than seven feet zero inches; (d)   an electrical service and ventilation; and (e)   at least one window. Living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, halls, bathrooms, unfinished cellars and unheated storage areas over garages are not considered bedrooms.‚Äù The major concerns are ‚Äúa room providing privacy‚Äù and ‚Äúliving rooms, dining rooms, kitchens‚Ä¶ are not considered bedrooms‚Äù. My bedroom is also a living room and kitchen..  Do I have anything to go on here, especially if it‚Äôs a document from the dep of environmental protection? If so what do I even do? Honestly I‚Äôd be fine just getting a discount or something but I‚Äôm not sure how to go about approaching this.	No

There are two young men taking a room in a house where I am a tenant.  The men are using a room where the initial understanding was that only one of them would be using the room (the guy who was sublet the room has another guy with him none of us in the rest of the house agreed to letting stay).  I am not the landlord to these tenants.  As I understand it, the landlord (the tenant acting as landlord to the subletters), allowed them to move in back in May.  There was never a contract signed by the tenants and landlord despite the landlord's attempts to have them sign a contract (the most it appears there is with a sublease is a verbal agreement and some text messages).  The landlord changed the locks to try to lock these guys out.  All while this was happening, I was out of town seeing my grandparents because I thought my grandfather would pass away (he was put on hospice while I was there).  At a time later when I had been back in the house, the landlord of the room came into the house at 2am and more or less yelled at these two guys.  Fwiw, I think the landlord of the room is an idiot, and I think he should carry much of the blame for these circumstances.  He no longer lives in the house, but myself and another guy have to suffer the consequences.  There is finally an eviction process underway.  We have posted notice wherein these tenants can respond within seven days to a magistrate court order.  Us original tenants of the house are all students. We feel taken advantage of.  On top of all this, one of the two tenants at hand complains he has asthma and has to keep the AC to 68.  Our utility bills have been very high and we have not received any payment from these two from last month.   I am writing this as much to vent as to seek any words of advice.  Tomorrow, the landlord of the sublet room will call the court to see if there was a response to the court order.  Also, I understood the sublease to last from May to August.  It is now August 7, and the landlord of the house states he has not received any word from these two even though I told one of the two he needs to contact the landlord of the house if he wants to get on the lease for the new year (the actual lease of the house is August 1 - July 31).    If there is any help any one can recommend in this eviction process, it would be greatly appreciated.	No

hello. I live in Wisconsin and own my own home. My boyfriend has lived here for the last 4 years. Things have progressively become more abusive. Never physical but definelty verbal. Today I was in fear it would progress. I had to call the police which required him to leave for the night, but now I am lost. The officer mentioned a 5 or 30 eviction? but any research ive done online does now help. He does not pay me rent. He does pay the electric and cable bill, although only electric is in his name. Can someone please help me because these forms make me believe the 5 and 30 difference is based on rent? he has never paid me rent. Please help. I need to go to the courthouse first thing in the morning and I am so lost.	No
"I received the following email from my landlord today.  &gt; Good afternoon,  Our office has not received rent for the month of August 2017. Even though your lease is expiring and not being re-newed and you have a move out date of 08/31/2017 you are still responsible for the rent. Due to your NSF check you must pay with either a cashiers check or money order. Also when you will be completing the repairs to the property including paint and replacement of flooring's and baseboards which have been destroyed. The backyard is dug up and destroyed. The property will need to be detailed cleaned and we do have the name and rank of the unauthorized tenant you have sub-leased to. The property needs to be given back in good clean condition as which you received it or we will be contacting both chain of commands and filing in court. I hope you plan to cooperate with this.  For context: I am in the military and had a returned check *one* time and the realtor now requires me to bring a cashiers check, I was in the field and have already payed my rent, before it was late.  Here are the facts  -I have not subleased to anyone. I believe the realtor dug through my things and found my husbands information and made assumptions. He is no longer in the military; and is attending school in a different city.   -The damaged floors she is talking about are floorboards that are cheap laminate faux wood flooring, and are starting to raise at the corners. I believe it is normal wear and tear and the damage is only affecting panels in a small area, it is in no way destroyed.  -I put down a $4700 dollar deposit including deposits for the pets I have.  -I was at a 45 day training exercise and could not pay my rent while I was away. 2 weeks before I left I contacted them 3 different times to fix my online account to accept payments; they did not fix it until after my rent was late, then they slapped a late fee on it, fixed my account, and served me a 3 day notice to pay rent or quit. I paid about ten minutes after my account was fixed.   -My property manager did a walk through in May and found some damages, they did not contact any vendors, as they said they would, to make repairs. Nor have I received a list of things they claim to be damaged by me.  -I moved in after the grass had died for the year, when spring rolled around I realized the landlord had just used dead grass to cover the land as mulch, the grass never grew back and is now completely dirt except for weeds. This is what she means by ""completely destroyed."" I do admit my dogs dug a couple of holes, but those can be easily covered.  -The property manager asked my permission to let the owners enter the property to survey the second bathroom because they wanted to do renovations. I locked the doors into all rooms and placed scotch tape on the walls to see if they entered other areas of the home. They went into every room.  -The property manager made a statement that the owner of the realty did a walk through with me. I told her he hadn't, she became accusatory and refused to believe me. I have never met the owner of the realty.  - My lease states that I should not do any repairs myself.  So my question is, can the landlord force me to make repairs before I move out even if they are holding my security deposit? Also, can they contact my chain of command for this? I don't see the point if they have my security deposit and if they plan to take me to court. It seems their goal in that situation would be to simply get me in trouble. I do not disagree that I have caused some damages, but it is absolutely not something that a good contractor couldn't fix in a day or two. Please help!  -"	No
So I worked for a pretty decent company for the past 6 years, I was part of particular department (we had 4 staff members and 1 outsourced IT personnel, that we picked up a few months back).   I was brought into the office of my VP this past week and was being told I was laid off, nothing more. I never had a negative review, never had any work performance issues. I was brought in and told my position was being outsourced. Now what has me wondering is, my title was the same as the rest of my team and we all had different responsibilities. They are currently hiring for the team (but as a different title).. and when I brought this up they told me I can put a resume in and if I qualify for the position they would consider me. I am completely livid, they offered me two weeks of severance after 6 years of working there and that is all.   I am located in Long Island, New York. I just don't see how it can be legal to lay me off (I have been in the company the 2nd longest).. when they are hiring for a position under the same supervisor - while having 4 people with the same title - and they state that its because they are outsourcing my position.	No
So my mom is trying to find an apartment and the places she has been going to look at have flat out told her no because of her service cat and they don't allow pets. As far as I know they can't do that right? What steps can she take to make sure she can do to defend herself in this situation.	No
Since I had posted bond for both charges, from both of the 2 counties, when I appear in court for sentencing after court appearance has been scheduled (plead guilty), would I be incarcerated? Or would that only be the case if that was my sentence was incarceration and not fines?  Feel free to ask me further questions - I'd prefer minimal admonishing, since I'm doing that to myself enough.  Thank you, community	No
Not much context to be had here. Just wondering if a 21 year old can legally be tried for underage drinking after their 21st birthday.  Say that there is video evidence, and you are pleading 100% guilty. Would a judge still rule guilty if you are no longer a minor?	No
"I currently attend a University in Oklahoma and I have been living in the same rent house since last June--a little over a year now. My ""landlord"" owns a popular local bar near campus and is known to be very wealthy and very friendly. A couple of my friends worked for my landlord a while back and had to go pick up a couple items from one of this guy's ""storage houses."" They asked him (my current landlord) if they could move into the house and live there, to which he obliged on the condition that they signed a lease and did not mess with his stuff he was storing in the garage. Fast forward a few months and he had only asked for rent payment for the first few months and never did for the rest of their lease.   The June after their lease ended (and they moved out) my new roommates and I tried to contact him to set up a meeting time to sign a lease, however, he bailed last second and told us he would call us when we was ready, but that we could go ahead and move in. We waited all summer and he never called us about a lease so we've been living here for over a year now. He never asks for rent and we just pay the bills. We know that he knows we live here because he still sends us letters reminding us to keep the thermostat up over winter break and the lawn service still comes every other week. Moreover, he never brings up the house or our living situation when we go to his bar.   I guess what I'm asking is, what exactly are my rights? I've hypothesized that he's using this house either as some sort of tax write-off so he doesn't really care or that we just scored the deal of a lifetime. I figured I'd ask because with the Fall semester coming up, I'm extremely stressed that he'll come kicking down the door out of nowhere and I'll be having to move out in the middle of the semester."

When the landlord is a step father to the wife of the husband who abandoned the home and his belongings, what action can be taken? Can the home owner legally withhold the processions of the renter who has abandoned the home, leaving his family behind and not paying the agreed upon rent to the landlord? Is the landlord within his rights to confiscate the personal belongings until he pays past rent and returns all keys to the landlord?	No
I live in Wisconsin WI. This is my first apartment. The problem isn't so much that I have to give a 45 day notice (although it SHOULD be a 30, seeing as that my apartment has no lease) but it is that my contract states that I must give this notice by the end of the month. So, if I am moved out by the end of August, I am forced to pay a full month's rent of $550 for 15 days in September that I won't even be in the apartment for. My question is, is this legal, and if so, how is this fair to me at all? It's not like I could give him the notice on the 15th of August and then move out on the end of September. I can only give the notice by the end of the month, which makes no sense other than that he want's me to pay him for something that I'm not using.	No
This is a bit of an unusual one. I will try and make it simple points.  There are 3 of us each with our own room. We all signed jointly.  One roommate failed to tell the others that he has stopped receiving income. He kept paying late until the point he couldn't pay anymore and is now waiting on disability money from the government.  The other roommate and I have covered his last 2 months of rent and late fees. He kept saying he will get the money but it doesn't come. We can't afford to keep covering his rent.  He signed an agreement that he will pay us back but I doubt we will get our money.  Even if we win against him in small claims court the money he is getting is disability money and normally we cant collect from that.  I talked to management and they said the only way to get him off the lease is for them to evict us all for non-payment or him to sign himself off the lease.  If he refuses to sign himself off the lease, what are our options?  I was thinking of putting all of his stuff to an offsite storage unit and putting it under his name. Then adding someone else to the lease and renting out his room just so we cant get someone to pay rent.  He basically lives with his partner and uses the space he has with us as storage.   Are there any legal repercussions of moving his stuff into a storage unit in his name?	No
I inherited an older house and it needed a new roof. Searched for roofers, found a guy, and hired him.      Materials and dumpsters paid for directly by me. About $25,000. (It's a metal roof where the metal is stamped to look like slate and they interlock like a puzzle. That's why so expensive.)      His labor was agreed to be $10,000. Half up front, the rest upon completion.      This was February 21st. It's now almost halfway through July and the roof is only half finished. He comes sporadically and will go a week or more at a time without coming. He has left trash all over the yard. He is wasting materials. Basically, the guy is a mess and I want to hire someone else.      But we signed a contract before he started. I am worried that if I fire him and hire someone else he might be able to sue.      Can I fire him without being liable?      Would I be able to sue him for the wasted materials, months worth of dumpster rental, or anything else?      I can upload pictures of the contract if it helps.      Thanks!!	No
it's a really long and complex ordeal i'm going through and it's been a long day. Basically would they have a case, what could happen to me, etc.   longer version is way overly complicated and I don't think all of those details matter for just the bare bones advice I'm asking for.   so the details I feel are important are  1) She does not want any of that to happen 2) She is 18 and is still my girlfriend  really about it. I don't know what exactly to do. my brother (not a laywer at all) insists that they can't actually do anything because who the hell would prosecute me over something like this  but I'm still unsure of what to do. I just want a happy life with her.	No
We move in 10 years ago and put down a $1000(about) deposit. The house is approximately 1200 square feet. When we moved in they replaced the carpet in the front of the house that covers the front room and dining room. The carpet in the hall and 3 bedrooms was unchanged. We have a couple of damaged doors, a drywall hole that we plan on fixing before we move and pets have damaged parts of the carpet that we can't really fix without recarpeting the areas  I have read in places that due to the length of time we've been here the carpet should be replaced and walls repainted before new tenants move in anyways, so along with that what things are covered under wear and tear? Also what things should I worry about that they can take parts of the deposit for?	No

Dear LA:  I am considering leasing a New Jersey home, and it has a small in-ground pool in the backyard.  The backyard is fenced by a short (roughly 3 feet high) fence, and the pool is covered by a fairly standard thermal pool cover.  The lease contains no provisions mentioning the pool.  My main questions/worries are the following:  1. Am I liable for any damage occurring to the pool as a result of not operating it? 2. Am I at risk if anyone trespasses and injures themselves (or dies) in the pool?  Basically, I wish I was looking at the same house with no pool -- if the lease with no provision regarding the pool means I'm as liable as having no pool, then that would bring much peace of mind.  Alternatively, if I'm liable -- or if there's anything I'm not thinking of -- advice to seek a lawyer or walk away would be good too.  Any thoughts would be much appreciated, thanks!	No
Dear r/legaladvice,  I recently was driving long distance when my tire blew out on the highway.  I put in the spare and drove to the nearest rural town but everything was closed since I got there on a Sunday.  I stayed overnight and in the morning went to one of the local tire shops.  They said my tires were old and all needed to be replaced (which turned out to be true), but that they only had two tires that were the right size.  So I got the two front tires replaced on my car and drove to the next nearest town to another tire shop that replaced the other two.  After my long long road trip I finally made it to my destination.  The next day one of the new front tires was flat.  I had to put the spare on again and drive it to Pepboys, and the folks there said the two front tires were the wrong size and poorly installed, and that the damage to the flat one was irreparable since it was probably poorly installed.  So basically I had to replace two brand new tires to get the correct size.  I will never go back to the rural town hundreds of miles away so I can't return the poorly sized and improperly installed tires, so I left them at Pepboys.  Anyway this has all been extremely frustrating and costly and I am totally unsure what to do.  Should I call the rural tire shop that screwed up and yell at them and demand a refund, even though I have no way of returning the tires they put on car?  Should I call my credit card company and dispute the charge from them?	No
"Good evening, Redditors. A couple of years ago, a friend of mine left her home in my care. She had to move away for personal reasons and I took over as the landlord (I also live in the house). Though up to this point, I've not had any problems with tenants/roommates, I've made it a point to draw up a lease that outlines specific rules/expectations for the roommates, myself included. This has helped me keep the roommates accountable so that in the event that someone is continuously breaking the rules, I have something to refer to.   Cut to the last six months: my current roommate has taken advantage of me, stolen money, food, took my car without asking, drove my car drunk, etc. After finally having enough of trying to support her and push her in the direction of being sober, I asked her to move out. Colorado requires 30 days written notice in the event of an eviction but the tenant is fighting me on moving out stating that the rules I wrote into the lease aren't legally binding and I can't evict her over repeated violation. Is she right? From what I've read, the lease terms can include ""specific agreements between the landlord and tenant"".   Help me out here!"	No
"Hi /r/legaladvice. Sorry for the incoming wall of text, I'm trying to be as thorough as possible because I'm really at a loss for what to do here.  As the title states, I signed a lease for a new apartment on July 31st. I was given a Move In Condition Report in addition to my rental agreement, which had to be filled out, signed, and returned within one week.   I should mention that on the Move In Condition Report I received from the landlord, there is a note right above the tenant signature line that states ""Tenant agrees that if property is not left in same clean condition as stated above, a minimum $250.00 cleaning fee will be deducted from the security deposit. Please make sure you deep clean the unit before you return the keys. Deep clean all appliances, bathrooms, ceiling fans, fixtures, sliding doors, window treatments, etc."".   Upon my inspection of the property in an effort to fill this report out, I noticed that the property was clearly not given to me in the condition they expected me to leave it in. There were dead bugs in nearly every room of the apartment, including in the kitchen cabinets and drawers &amp; bathroom vanities. The refrigerator and microwave both had dead bugs inside of them. Some windows had what looked to be years' worth of dust and dead bugs on the sills/tops of the windows. The showers and tubs still had hair/grime from the previous tenant, etc. I took pictures of some of the worst items and contacted the landlord the following morning.  I spoke with her on the phone and informed her that I was uncomfortable signing the report with this note on it, because the unit was obviously not deep cleaned on my move-in date. She told me to note what I saw on the form, sign it &amp; they would fix and clean everything while I was out of town (I had already planned to leave town from August 3rd through August 9th). I received a text from her on 8/05 saying that everything was taken care of, the place looked great now &amp; I should be satisfied upon my return. She also said she would send me a new Move In Condition Report to fill out, which she never did.  When I returned to the unit on August 9th, most broken items had been fixed, but the unit still did not appear to have been cleaned to the standards they mentioned on their own form. My landlord was leaving town herself from 8/06 to 8/14, and I did not want to call and bother her on her vacation, so my girlfriend and I decided to clean the place ourselves. I would have preferred to hire professional cleaners and deduct the cost from the next month's rent (a reasonable solution, in my mind), but our current lease is ending soon and we did not have the time to waste going back and forth with the landlord over this.  I took more photos before we cleaned. We cleaned for hours and hours and finally got the place to a point that we were happy with. This afternoon I wrote my landlord an e-mail summarizing what had happened since I returned to town. I told her which items were fixed, which were still broken, and then mentioned everything we had to clean &amp; attached the pictures. I did not make any demands in my e-mail to her, I simply informed her of the situation and ended by saying ""Despite this, I am very excited about moving into the unit now that it is clean. Hopefully we can come to some sort of agreement on how to handle this issue and move forward from here. I look forward to hearing your thoughts after you have had a chance to read this e-mail &amp; see the attached pictures.""  Her response back to me was not at all what I expected. I'll quote most of the e-mail here (only redacting some possibly identifying info): &gt;I am still on vacation but I wanted to take a moment and reply to your email and decide the way forward.  I have to say I was quite surprised with your overall dissatisfaction with the apartment. I was personally there until very late the night before my trip to make sure everything was up to standard.  Great effort was put in to make it even better than the first time. For you to say that it looks the same is almost insulting, as I know and can vouch for that almost everything on your checklist was done.  It's not a new apartment with new appliances and accessories so some movement and wear and tear is expected. I...have managed hundreds (of units) for big companies and never have I had someone be so unhappy with a unit that I have handed in the condition this was left a few days ago. If you needed to take the day off to clean then that was another level of perfection that you need.  From this business relationship so far, I can see that you are not happy and will most likely be difficult to be satisfied.  For this reason and after speaking with the owner, we think it is best that you find another place that is up to your standards. I apologize if this was a waste of your time and for the owner but I think this is probably not going to work out.   The owner will refund the money you have paid him in full and we will find another renter who will be happy with the place as is.  I have not responded to her e-mail as of yet. I have a rental agreement signed by both parties which mentions nothing about the lessor terminating the agreement, other than them being allowed to evict for illegal activities. I paid over $4,300 to move in (first, last and security deposit), plus a $250 application fee to the association. If I agree to her proposal, I'm assuming the entire $4k will be refunded as she mentions in her e-mail, but I doubt if the application fees will be refundable. I also spent money on cleaning supplies and to copy keys, and spent lots of time cleaning.  With the way she responded to what I thought was a simple request of wanting to move into a place that did not have dead bugs and someone else's dirt all over the place, I don't think I want to stay here, even if I do have the legal right to. But, if I do agree to her proposal, I'm essentially paying nearly $300 for the privilege of cleaning someone else's apartment, and I'm still stuck with trying to find a place to live in the next week (current lease ends on the 20th). What are my rights here? Is it worth talking to a lawyer? Or should I just agree to her proposal, and move on?   Thanks in advance if anyone actually reads this entire thing and cares to comment!"	No
Hey so I was planning on buying my cousin's 2013 Honda Fit, KBB value around $7000 for getting to work and college. Me and my mom live in NJ and she receives SSI, food stamps, Medicare, and we're living on public property. So I've seen mixed messages online that if I buy the car the value might be treated as an asset and can reduce our benefits. These programs have a asset limit, but I've seen some stuff saying that cars don't count towards these assets. I don't want my mom to lose healthcare or any income benefits as she's disabled and money's tight. The only reason I could afford this Fit is my cousin letting me pay the money over time. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	No
"I will have lived in this rental property 1 year as of August 18th. When I moved in last August he prorated my rent for the rest of the month, but my lease agreements of 6 months have always been from the original move in date which falls on the 18th of the month. I've been paying my rent on the 1st of the month since September of last year. This month I paid my rent as per our agreement (agreement says by the 3rd of the month without penalty) on August 1st which covers August 1st through August 31st. On August 7th my landlord emailed me a new rental agreement (without any prior communication about the new rental terms) along with a note that said the rent would increase from $650 to $670 for the next term (which starts august 19th basically). I told him then that I likely would be moving out.  In our text messages it's clear I was interested in doing this based on what he expected and I texted back and forth with him over the next few days asking various questions about the move out process and what his expectations were for me to leave on good terms. I even explicitly asked about prorated rent and deposit if I left on the rental agreement date of August 18th (since I've already paid this entire month of August). He said ""I can refund you the amount if you choose to leave during this month. It's 22 dollars per day"" and ""The deposit is for leaving the room in clean and great condition. Once I see the room I can send the deposit back through Venmo."" I will be leaving the room clean and in good condition regardless of how this ends. We had other various exchanges about me keeping him informed on whether or not I'd officially found a place. After our conversations I believed it was understood and ok for me to move out on the 18th without any loss of funds (neither deposit owed after inspection nor prorated rent money) and was actively looking for another place with a move in date of August 18th.   Today August 10th he texted me saying that since I didn't give him 30 days noticed in our lease he would not be refunding my rent for the rest of August. This blew me away and I texted him back and told him that I'm willing to abide by the terms of our lease, but I'm curious where that leaves me? My lease agreement says August 18th, but I've paid through September 1st. So I'm not sure what happens after the 18th? I live here for 13 days with no rental agreement or I move out and leave $280 dollars on the table? Can I get that money back? Even september 1st wouldn't be proper 30 days and I'm worried he will not refund my deposit because of it even though the room is in good condition? If this becomes nasty (which I hope it doesn't) do I have any rights legally if he takes my deposit out of spite? I have text messages showing my intent to leave on good terms, his respones to that, and this his flip flop 3 days later. Is the lease agreement the only binding thing here?  tl;dr landlord is increasing rent. I decided to move. I've paid through the end of the month, but my lease expires on the 18th. Do i get my money back, am I out of $280 dollars ($22 dollars per day), or do I stay for what I've already paid for? Can i sue him if he tries to keep my deposit and prorated rent after he failed to notify me of lease agreement changes in a reasonable time?"	No
"My wife, 1 year old and I recently moved into a house for rent in Pennsylvania. The landlord is an older man who owns multiple single family homes that he rents out in the area. Before signing the lease we informed him (in person) that we have a two dogs (70 lbs Goldendoodle and a 15 lbs mini weiner dog). At the time of the lease signing he had no issues with allowing the dogs to live in the house. Within the lease it includes that two dogs are allowed to live in the house with us. We never tried to hide the size of the larger dog and even made sure twice that he was aware of his size.   On the day of moving in the landlord expressed concern (without ever seeing the dog) that he wasn't sure if he wanted the dogs in the house (he said this to my wife as I was at work). Today, he showed up to the house to ""trim the hedges"" while we were not at home. My very well behaved and friendly, but protective dog was barking at the landlord through the back door. The landlord promptly called my wife saying that he does not want the dog in the house anymore and we are meeting this Sunday to talk about options in regards to the dog. When I called him back he said that he was afraid the dog was going to ""come out the window after him"" and was ""scratching the door"". I know my dog and all he does is bark and look out the window at strangers. I checked the metal door and there are no scratches on it at all, not even dirt marks.   The advice I am looking for is can he force me to remove the dog from the house. The lease was signed by my wife, the landlord and myself. The dogs were written in the lease that they were allowed to be on the premises. The lease also says that verbal changes are not authorized and that only what is written in the lease is legally binding. If he tries to force me to remove the dog (which I will not do as he is part of the family) can he evict us for that? If he does, am I legally entitled to get my deposit/first month rent refunded? Also, could I demand that he pays for any moving fees that I accrue if I do have to move out.   I do have access to a group legal through my employer. Would it be worth contacting an attorney if he tries to force us out of the house?   Thank you for your advice and I apologize for the choppy/bad writing."	No

"Hey all! I've never posted on Reddit before, but my current housing situation is driving me batty and a friend said you might be able to help.   Story time:  I moved into a rental house on Saturday 07/15. When we were done unpacking, I went to take a shower and discovered there was no hot water.   ""No problem,"" I thought, ""I'll just call the landlord to get it fixed.""   Then things started snowballing.   The landlord's maintenance worker looked at the water heater and said the problem was that it's a gas heater, and there was no gas going to the heater. (When signing the lease, the landlord had said everything was electric, so I didn't get the gas turned on). To have hot water, we'd need to get gas services started.   Well that's a little annoying, but at least it's an easy fix.  I called the gas company on Monday, July 17. They informed me that the gas had been off for over 6 months, and because of that a home inspection would need to be conducted before the service could start. I informed my landlord immediately after ending the call.   My landlord's maintenance worker contacted me today, after a week of radio silence, to inform me that the earliest inspection date they could do would be two days from now, on Thursday from 11-4. He also said that I should contact the city's inspector to schedule the inspection.   I have now been living in this house for 11 days without hot water. I have been taking cold showers and boiling water on the stove to wash dishes.   Can y'all please give me some advice on what to do, or at least validation that this is Not Acceptable? I keep calling and texting and am at my wit's end in how to make my living situation, well, livable. Is this even legal?   (I live in Texas, if that helps with state statutes)"	No
"and i qoute   ""Your unit was professionally cleaned prior to your move in. We expect it back in the same condition with confirmation via a receipt or invoice from the cleaning service used. Please e-mail the receipt or invoice to""  It does not say this is mandatory anywhere in our lease. We moved in and the place was filthy. We complained and they sent a cleaning service. We didn't explicity request it ourselves. "	No
"to start off, my landlords are terrible people. They own roughly 40 rental properties in my town of around 10k people. I have know many people who have rented from them, and have spoken with various city officials who all agree that these guys are slumlords. In the almost 4 years I have lived in my house, the roof has never been leak free, and the only time they have ever gotten anything minor repaired was the afternoon they sent an unlicensed handyman/meth dealer (who i later found out was about to be charged with child abuse) to my home. why do I stay? Well, since finding the house I am in (3 bed, 2 bath, fenced yard, 2 car detached garage) rent has skyrocketed in my town. I would be lucky to find a shitty 2 bedroom apartment for the amount i pay- which is $650.  About me: I am a newly single mom. My ex left right after our 3rd son was born, and I am trying to make the best of it.    Where I am going with this: my 4 year old son had to have a physical to start kindergarten in the fall, he tested positive for lead poisoning. I then had my other two boys checked, and my oldest son also has elevated blood lead levels. their levels were 8 and 9... which is serious, but not serious enough to start living our lives from inside hazmat suits. So, I bought some lead paint tests. .. Well, there is a lot of lead paint in my house. its everywhere, and all very unstable (cracking, crumbling, peeling). And most of it is in places where it can easily become airborne, inside window sills, and door jambs. I am a in shock.  I must be so naive. I never received a lead paint disclosure (which i have in past rental situations). And shortly after i moved in I found out that the house had in the recent past, burned.. and had (as far as i understood) been gutted and remodeled, while salvaging the pretty painted victorian woodwork. I thought the chipped paint inside the window sills was just caused by rainwater entering over the years. because typically you find lead paint underneath many many coats of newer, safer paint. but here, there is only one layer.  Anyway, after telling my landlords, who have never given a shit about anything.. they are all of a sudden my new best friends, but keep showing up at my house without notice to confront me and ""iron out a plan"". they told me to just keep sweeping and vacuuming up the dust which, the EPA, poison control, and the health department have specifically told me not to do. that i needed to remove the dust by wet wiping as to not create airborne dust particles.   My landlords are hiring a painting company that as far as google shows, has been permanently shut down... and when i asked my landlords if the company was EPA lead-safe certified, they immediately showed up at my door and offered to move me to another property, a much nicer 4 bedroom house, and match the rent i pay now, and that they would give me my deposit back outright, and waive my deposit there. But they never answered me about whether or not this company is certified to safely treat lead paint in a home where children reside... these guys keep ambushing me, to talk when i don't know what I am doing, and furthermore I have no options. I am literally at their mercy, because i have no where else to go. and I know that they are going to further endanger my kids, so that they can save a buck.  so, in addition to my problems, I started thinking about what their other tenants may be going through without realizing... I have asked a couple former tenants and they never received disclosures either. Most of the properties they own were built in the early 1900s so, I am sure they do contain lead paint. could we potentially have a class-action law-suit? Should i go knock on doors? I am morally obligated to report them to the EPA, my kids and others' could have life long injuries due to their negligence.  but i am really really scared of doing it.  like I said, I have nowhere to go, and I am afraid they are going to start working on the house just to make me uncomfortable and eventually force me out. I have in the 4 years definitely violated the terms of my month to month lease. I have cats, and have made improvements to the house without permission..  but they have done nothing but compliment me on what a model tenant i am, and how well I keep the house... so.  any advice is greatly appreciated. I apologize for the rambling and altogether disorganized thoughts. I likely have much higher blood lead levels than my kids, so that's my excuse.  please ask any questions you may have, and thanks!"

Are knives equipped with SpeedSafe¬Æ Assisted Opening by Kershaw legal in California?  I know that laws in California are fairly restrictive when it comes to knives, so I always stick to small everyday carry knives that you can only open using 2 hands. Recently I came across this one being sold in walmart in California: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kershaw-Blur-S30V-Steel-Stonewashed-Knife/21980329, I was fairly surprised, given that it has some sort of assisted opening. I later asked few friends of mine from the police department, but I would also like to know the opinion of the lawyers. More about the technology is here: https://kershaw.kaiusaltd.com/technology  My question is specifically about this knife model, so I will appreciate if people only comment if they have specific knowledge or experience.  P.S. I don't know if mentioning a specific brand or retailer is a violation of the rules here, but I am not affiliated to any of them and not trying to promote or otherwise affect brand visibility.

Bought a car with my ex about 6 years ago. Was on and off with payments most of the time. My Ex leaves me and leaves me with the car and no way to contact her. About 3 years ago they took it back. Then said we still owed over 6,000. I never responded or made any attempt to pay for that as I no longer had a way to get around. Costing me more money to live. If I could have afforded to I would gladly pay for my mistake. Still don't have a car and still too poor to do anything about it right now with a 2yr old to watch. Not to mention the 30 minute drive to his babysitter. I got issued some legal paperwork from the local official, was wondering what the chances of getting the bill split between the two parties is, and basically what to expect in a worst case best case format.

I know that it is illegal to brandish or present a firearm with the intent to intimidate people in all states. I was wondering if this law extends to all weapons or just firearms.	No
Hi reddit.   So he gave me the engagement ring a few years ago and recently I found out he had been cheating on me for months. Now he is asking for my engagement ring back.   I looked online and found out that unless he specified when he gave it to me that he would want it back should we split up, he is not entitled to it. Well, he never informed me before the split that he wanted it back, and it was a gift, and he was the one who cheated causing the relationship to end.   So does he have any leverage at all?   Thank you for reading, any help is appreciated.	No
"I worked as a crew leader for a landscaping company in NV off and on for two years. Last Wednesday I was sent to work with another crew because they where short on people due to two or three people quitting the week prior. I had worked with this crew a few times before and due to them being short on people and hadn't had any major issues other than that I was made to do a majority of the work while they where often either just standing around talking or nowhere to be found. There was one individual who I could tell didn't like me from the first time I met him and I could tell it was a racial thing(he was Hispanic and while I have native blood in me I'm usually assumed by others to be white). In a job like landscaping you have to have thick skin, it's all dudes and it's all outside manual labor. I can put up with a lot, and for a while I did. Now I don't speak Spanish, but it's not hard to figure out when I hear the word gringo while they are talking, then immediately after tell me to go do something(I was often the only ""white guy"") that it was the old ""make the gringo do it"". Fast forward to last week. I've been sent to work with them again the prior day I had worked and this day they made me go dump my trailer then meet them up there. I get up there and drive around looking for them at their normal work areas for a while, then finally find them. First thing the individual asks me is what took me so fucking long. I told him I had been driving around looking for them to which he huffed, put his truck into gear and said ""fucking gringo"" as he started to drive off. This behavior continued through the day until around lunch, when this crew simply disappears. I've been sent to help them and they just leave without telling me where they are going. So I waste a good amount of time driving around looking for them and I finally find them and start working(me and another co-worker who had been sent up there with them(also a white guy)). We went back to doing what we where doing before lunch and at some point they just left us again, without any word. At this point I've had enough and I decide we would just work on our own and I would talk to my boss about it at the end of the day. About 20-30 minutes into working by boss pulls up and starts yelling at both of us not to work so close together because we ""look like butt buddies"". He then tells us that we need to go help the other crew or we will be fired. I started to tell him that I refuse to continue working with that crew and to continue being called a gringo when he cuts me off and threatens that if I don't go back to work with them he would fire me. I told him ""well you can fire me"" to which he replied ""fine"" then asked me for the keys to my truck. He then preceded to force the other co-worker to go back and work with the other crew and left me stranded in another town.  The day following I was told that I needed to sign some price of paper when I went to pick up my check. This paper stated that I had quit and that my ""final pay had been explained to me"" even though I was yet to receive my final pay(the check I was picking up was for the week prior)  I have tried to contact the companies HR(they are a huge company) and was told they don't even have an HR. I've contacted the Nevada equal rights commission and filed a report with them and am currently waiting for word back from a lawyer. Until then I was hoping for some guidance as to what else should be done. Is there a better agency to contact than the Nevada equal rights commission? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.    Tl;dr was repeatedly being called a gringo at work and was fired when I refused to continue working with them."	No
The other side has told me that they have drafted some kind of stipulation or other agreement to announce to the court at the upcoming hearing, which was supposed to be the date of the trial. They say it closely tracks the original agreement. I am not sure if this is proper or necessary.	No
Hello world of Reddit.  This may seem inconsequential to some, but for me, this is a big deal..one that has been weighing heavily on my mind the past couple of days..and I do not know where to turn, who to talk to, or if there is any action that can be taken. So...here is my story in short.  I am a first time homeowner. I bought a house in January of 2016 under a construction loan. Although that part does not mean a whole lot to the story, there is a small significance to it. Since my house loan still has not been 'closed' due to us fixing it up, the homeowners insurance cannot be escrowed in yet. Therefore, the first year of homeowners insurance was included in the initial loan amount, and when a year passed, it was time to pay again. This time, it would be out of pocket, because, again. We still have not completed the loan process. Well. We have updated the house significantly. The insurance company told me that I could send in proof of all updates, and that the policy amount would drop significantly. So, time comes to pay the bill, I call the insurance company and they tell me what to send in to update the policy. I send in the documentation. Call back, they don't have everything. Apparently I didnt understand one part. Agent says. No big deal. So I send I'm the proper documentation to the e-mail given to me. I don't hear anything....I send it again. I still don't hear anything. I finally call, and am told that where I sent it was not the proper place. They give me a new place to send it. So I send it...again. At this point I have faxed and emailed. So fast forward to freaking June.... Yes this started in January... And I get a cancelation notice. I call them and explain what is going on, yet once again. They tell me why something wasn't right. I explain to them that it I DID send what they are asking for...once again. They give me a new e-mail to send it to. I send in the info. The insurance agency says, OK, we have this taken care of. You are not canceled and your new policy is $XXX (almost half of what it used to be). I am ecstatic. I get a new e-mail asking for that amount, due by the 28th of June. I pay the full amount on the 12th of June. The money is taken from my account. Fast forward...once again...to yesterday. The bank contacts me to let me know they have received a cancelation notice of my homeowners insurance. I send the confirmation e-mail to my bank, and call the insurance company. After being put on hold numerous times and being on the phone for over an hour, the insurance company tells me that the policy was canceled and the amount I paid was for the coverage from Jan-June! The told me that my policy was NOT canceled and that amount I paid was the new policy amount. There was no mention of the policy only being for the beginning of the year and if my policy was canceled, why was I not offered to reinstate a policy? Oh...that's because they told me it wasn't canceled. Well apparently that is too bad for me. The insurance company gave me a mailing address for a complaint department. They told me I could write a letter and send it in. They would not provide me with a different number, a fax number or e-mail. Just the mailing address. They would not provide me with a refund or a reference number for the call. I also asked for an e-mail to be sent with documentation of contact from the call and proof of attempt of resolution to both me and my bank and they refused.  Now my bank is mad, I'm broke, and uninsured. Do I have any case at all whatsoever? Is there anything I can do? I'm just at a loss at what step to take next. I don't even know if this post will get read at all...but I would be forever grateful for any advice.  TL;DR. Homeowners Insurance agency told me I was covered, took my money, and then canceled my policy. Help.	No
2-3 weeks ago my neighbor's dog started coming on to my property. We live in the city and the dog used to have an electric fence, but it seems that is no longer the case. The dog is on the larger side (40-50 pounds) and very aggressive. Several times my mother has had to run for the front door while out gardening because the dog will run towards her and begin growling and trying to bite. Tonight the dog attempted to bite her and she kicked it several times until it ran away. We have told our neighbors on three separate occasions about the issue and they keep saying they'll handle it but never do. We have also called our local police department whenever we see the dog on our yard, but because it is not an emergency, it usually takes 10-20 minutes for them to arrive, by which time the dog is back in it's yard/house. The police knock on the neighbor's door, but they never answer. The officers we spoke to last said they could do nothing until there was evidence the dog hurt someone or was dangerous. My mother is beginning to fear working in our yard because of this animal. I love animals, but this dog is becoming a threat to my mother's safety, so I was wondering if it was legal to shoot it the next time it tries to hurt someone in my yard. Between the police and lack of problem solving by my neighbors, I feel like I am running out of options and it is only a matter of time before someone gets hurt by the animal. However, if shooting is illegal, what other steps can I legally take to resolve this situation?	No
I don't know if city statutes are relevant here, but if they are, let me know and I'll add it.  I have one roommate on the lease. His girlfriend visits all the time, and I want her added to the lease. They want to get a dog, and have already picked one out and started going through the adoption process with a rescue. The dog will be arriving on Monday.  Roommate already doesn't pay rent and doesn't do anything around the apartment, so I don't know how he expects to take care of a dog. I talked to the apartment complex, and they have a bunch of fees associated with a dog, but once again, I don't know how roommate expects to pay that when he doesn't pay rent.  Do I have a legal way to stop them from getting this dog? As a related question, do I have a legal way to evict my roommate or  get out of this lease and this apartment without having a black mark on my credit? I hate this whole situation and want out.	No
Just what the title says, this is in California. I have a lawyer that wants to meet with them in person but they arent willing to meet, is there anything I can do?	No
So we had a guest staying with us for several months who moved out last week. She left her car in our driveway with much of her stuff in it.   We want it out for many reasons. We dont want to be liable for someone taking studd out of it (its unlocked), she may try to say that she still had belonging on our property so she can still claim squatters rights, it blocks us from taking garbage out and from using the parking space, but mostly she's a toxic person we want out of our lives asap.   We spoke to an officer who said all they can do is ticket it until it visually looks like it is abandoned. They said call back in two weeks and they'll put a tow notice and tow a week later. This is way longer than we want to wait.   We live in Rockford, Illinois.	No
TLDR: Landlord is ending our roommate's monthly lease, she refuses to move out and is threatening legal action.    I live in a household of 3 women, including myself. My roommate and I are on the original lease while the 3rd roommate agreed to a monthly sublease. Due to recent events, feeling overall uncomfortable and somewhat threatened by the new roommate, we offered her 30 days to find a new place. She claims we have no right to end her monthly sublease and has threatened to take us to court. With my limited knowledge of Chicago leasing laws, I understand we may not directly be able to end her sublease, however she has no lease with the landlord and he is able to end her sublease. He gave her a signed 30 day termination notice, she still attempted to pay rent after the notice and he didn't accept her portion from her. Is there anything else we can do to get her out of the house? I want to go about this as civil and legal as possible.	No
Not sure my state matters,  I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I need advice and feel stupid.   I received my first credit last week.  It's through Capital One. I activated it, set up my account, then used it at the grocery store for $7.  Today I went to pay my electric bill and it was declined.  When I check my online account I see they locked my card due to fraud.   I call Capital One and get directed to their fraud specialist.  Initially she tells me there is no fraud,  the card just isn't activated yet.  She puts me on hold to fix it.  Before this, she verified: My social Phone number Email address Credit card number and crv on the back  When she comes back she informs me she no longer thinks I am who I say am.  She tells me someone else called and asked for a new card to be sent out (somehow verified all the info down to my credit card number??)  So she tells me in order to prove I am who I say I am I need to email them a front and back photo of my drivers license, a front and back photo of my social security card and a photo of a utility bill in my name.   I understand they need to verify me,  but the whole explanation was very sketchy and I'm really nervous to email them all this info.   I could really use some advice please.   Thank you so much.	No
Our landlord has charged us a $100 fee for denying access to our apartment for contractors to do repairs. They claim the contractirs sent them a bill because we denied access, and they passed the bill for rescheduling on to us.   We did not deny them access, we were not home at the time, and our superintendent has a key to out apartment, so they could have let them in if needed. The day before we had called our superintendent IF it was possible to reschedule to another day, but she said she wasn't sure and would look into it. After returning home to find no work had been done, we assumed all was well and the work would be rescheduled.  Our superintendent agrees with us that we only made a request, and did not deny access, however the property manager has ignored our argument and attempted to take the fee out of our deposit and last months rent interest. We have had no luck speaking with anybody who can resolve this issues, we just get passed from secretary to answering machine.  We have contacted legal aid and out universities legal department, but don't meet the criteria for them to help us, and we can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars to resolve a $100 issue. Any suggestions on where to go from here for advice would be great, we are in Ontario Canada if that helps. Thanks	No
My question involves a traffic ticket from the state of: Washington  Hey guys, seriously appreciate any advice here.   My car was parked in my apartment complex's lot and had a resident sticker in the windshield after I registered it with management 2 years earlier. I had left for about 2 months to take car of my father who had a stroke, I didn't let management know I was leaving, paid bills on time while away. Looks like 30 days after I had left they decided they wanted to give everyone assigned parking spots, and if you didn't move your car for painting within a specific date, they would tow you. Obviously didn't move my car cause I wasn't there so car got towed and sold at an auction. I understand it‚Äôs my fault for not letting management know I was leaving but I never received any phone calls, emails, or anything from them that my car would be towed, or that we needed to move our cars for the parking assignments. I did receive a letter in the mail from the tow company though, which I only saw 30 days later when I returned home.   I haven't had a chance to speak with management yet because I just got back.   This is over a $10k loss for me if I can‚Äôt be reimbursed for my car...  Reading around on google looks like I have to take it up with small claims court.   What do you guys think?  Any feedback is greatly appreciated!!!!	No
So, my girlfriend has been living in an apartment complex that houses primarily college students as it is close to campus. Tonight, she came home and thought her apartment had been broken into but it turns out it was a new roommate she had never heard of. This terrified her and she has no idea what to do. Her roommate is a 30+ year old women whom she's never met and doesn't even know her name. This is obviously extremely uncomfortable for a 19 year old college student. Anyways, the apartment complex didn't notify her about this roommate. She had actually received an email yesterday stating that it would only be her and another girl living there. But, this 3rd women just showed up and moved in without any notice. Is there any law against this? Should the apartment complex give notice of a stranger moving in? Any help would be appreciated.  This happened in Oklahoma.	No
I live in Iowa.   Relevant information:  In March of 2016 I move into a house for rent and put 950$ down for a deposit, 200$ nonrefundable pet deposit and I sign a paper to say he can automatically withdrawal 950$ on the 1st of the month.  There was no washer and drier in the place when I moved in, so I knew I would have to provide my own. When I signed the documents, I was also finalizing a divorce.  I signed all the documents (first name) (married name)-(maiden name).  I told him once the divorce was finalized I was to go by my maiden name.    January of 2017 I tell my landlord I'm looking for a house to buy and I've had no issues with him or the place, and would keep him up to date on my hunt.   I get a house, approved and signed in like 2 weeks. It happened way faster than expected.  But I couldn't pass this deal up.  I love my house.  But, there's a crossover month of rent and mortgage payment.    I asked Landlord if he would consider letting me out of the lease early and he wholeheartedly agreed over the phone.  He stopped the recurring 950$ payment and I was not charged for my final month. I moved out February 27th when we had our final walk through.   He didn't find much to fix up, basic paint and small scratches from my dogs.  Nothing major.  He said he would take off the carpet cleaning from the deposit and any other cleaning things.  Totally reasonable.   We also had an agreement that I would leave my washer and drier there and he would buy them from me for 100$ total.  I just didn't want to deal with them.  They were working when I left in February.   All is good in the hood as of Feb 27th. We shake hands and walk away.    In April (I have the texts)- I ask him when I would receive my security deposit check. He tells me over text that it was returned via post office and he was out of the country.  Once he gets back on May 6th, he would reach out.   He never did.   I call again on May 15th.  He picks up and we have a phone conversation in which he apologizes and says he'll talk to his wife (the bookkeeper) and he will get back to me asap.   On June 1st I text again asking what's going on.  No reply.   On June 5th I call and no reply.   3 voicemails, 6 texts and I'm fed up.  I call my uncle who is a lawyer in Pennsylvania and ask him to send a letter. Im very aware he can't do shit in my state, but maybe it'll get the ball rolling.    Out of no where I get a certified letter that's dated July 3rd, I just get notice of on July 29th. I go pick it up on July 31st and it's a letter from my landlord letting me know he is not going to give me the 100$ for the washer and drier because in April the new tenants tried using it and they were broken.  The receipt for the service provider was dated 4/4/2017, a full month after I had left the premises.   I just received my second certified letter, this morning, dated August 3rd stating that in order to get my security deposit check I need to:  -meet him in a public place -sign a document that the original envelope is unopened (dated 4/6/2017) that was returned to him  -I will sign a cease and desist document - I will acknowledge that I received the certified letter dated July 3rd about the washer and drier.    More relevant information:  -the original check envelope is addressed to (first name) (married name). This hasn't been my name for about a year at this point. This is why it wasn't forwarded to me in the first place, but I texted and left my forwarding address to him  -the way I understand the Iowa law, he has to send me information regarding the check (and receipts) within 30 days.  According to the original check date, he was past that date.  (I moved out February 27th, the certified letter was April 6th)   Should I just take him to court for the 1050$ or go meet him in person and drop it?  What should I do?  It's 85$ to file which I think I can tack it on... should I also include interest?  He never attempted to resend the letter even after telling me over the phone he would... 3 months ago.   It's kinda bullshit that I left my washer and drier there (and they were working) and he gets to decide after a month of having them that they don't work so he doesn't pay me?   That doesn't make sense or sound legal at all.	No
Hi /legaladvice  My dad died last week. He was too young. All of the funeral services and arrangements are complete and the family has gone home.  Now we're starting to get into dealing with estate stuff. Bank accounts, retirement fund, social security, car titles, etc. I think that we have most of the major things noted to take care of, but what are some of other things that people don't really think of where I should keep an eye out? What sort of unexpected hurtles may I face that I should be aware of?   We have his will and it names my mother the executor of his estate.	No
"We live in a condo rental for about 3.5 years without problem. Recently the unit below us had sewage back-ups from the toilet 3 times in 2 weeks. The tenant of the unit moved out after the first incident. She had lived there for about 3 months.   The management company sent the plumbers 3 times (I think they are all from different plumbing companies) and the first 2 times they worked from our (upper) unit because the below unit was a fountain of filth and they would not work there. The janitor guy in our condo believes the flushable wipes we used was the cause of clogging and he reported so to the management company.  Our owner attended to HOA meeting this week and they were blamed for the damage of lower unit. Now the owner of the lower unit is asking the recovery cost of the damage from our landlord if the management company goes after  them. And our landlord is asking us for the responsibility.  The point is the plumbers didn't work from the lower unit and the tenant of the lower unit is already gone. So no one actually can't say what the real cause was. The janitor guy took the photo of the wipes we flushed backed up from the toilet for the evidence but at then everything we flushed was backing up because lower unit pipe was clogged (the photo proofs what was clogged but not the cause of clog). And yes we already admitted that we use ""flushable wipes"" to flush down the toilet.   Where do we start? Can our landlord legally go after us to recoup costs? Where do we begin? "	No

"Specifically Little Flock, AR which might as well be Bentonville. First things first, the failure to appear. He has open court on the 24th of this month. I would like to get that dropped for him. What is the best method there. The truth seems best but I am open to suggestions. He wrote the wrong date in his calendar and missed the actual date. In the interim he lost his job and his mom moved two states away. He freaked out and didn't do anything. (He's 18) Explains it all right? I was thinking go early to court and try to talk to the prosecutor, tell him the story and hope for the best. Any other suggestions?  Second question. He was going 40 in a 25 and the officer wrote him for ""more that 15 miles over the speed limit"". Do that math! If we plead not guilty to ""more than 15 miles over"" does the officer just write a new ticket or does the judge dismiss it or what?Any and all advice would be appreciated. I am just a dad trying to help his kid and maybe save him some money."	No
We are currently in Jersey, my dad is in the hospital. We want to take him into Penn for cancer treatment, but they won't discharge the only way they will let him leave if he signs a against medical advice form.  We want them to do a transfer, and they won't, Penn already has an agreement with hosipital. We want to know what their treatment plan is but they don't have one and say we need to talk to the oncologist who is on vacation until Aug 3rd.  He had a procedure done last night and it was successful. They took another MRI and noticed more cancer cells. They said we need to start thinking of a plan and need to talk to an oncologist who is here till the 3rd of course.....   We want to leave and we are ready to sign the ama but there's this  thing that's been bugging me. The nurse said we need to sign it so we know the hosipital is liable.   I'm think why would she say that??? Was there something for concerning in the second MRI?? Why won't they just transfer to Penn???  ---  If us signing this form means my dad can get to Penn that so be it and great, but I want to make sure the currently place we are at didn't put us in a worse situation. He's been there since Thursday and we've requested for transfers since Friday. Their stent doctor came Monday and preformed the procedure we were there for originally. Now we are looking for an out to start cancer treatment.	No
"Hello all,  I recently moved into an apartment and really wish I would have gotten to know the management company first; it has been quite a headache getting moved in and all of the appliances in working order to this point. Now that we are settled, however, we are looking to adopt a dog. The agent who found us this apartment told us it was cat/dog friendly, the apartment complex itself it very dog heavy, and while the lease we signed stated that we weren't allowed dogs without written permission from our landlord/property manager, he assured us it would be ok.   Now, after having picked a dog from our local shelter, he has given his verbal agreement to the shelter saying that we are allowed, but refuses to give written consent to either myself or the shelter stating that, his ""word is gold"". I am afraid we might leave ourselves open to action later without this written consent. Is he allowed to say yes on the phone but not give it to us in writing???  Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!"	No
So I moved out of my last apartment at the end of the lease on the 1st of this month. Naturally I would expect my security deposit to come back to me by now, but I have not gotten anything from my landlord thus far. When I called him (the management company), he told me that my former roommates have not come up with a replacement roommate and are short on covering the replacement security. He stated I would not get my security back until my roommates covered that cost.  I am wondering why this should be an ongoing issue for myself if I am no longer legally binded to the lease.  My general experience with the management company has not been great. He never responds to my emails when I've requested information in the past. He answers the phone only when its convenient for him. And I have not actually ever met the guy. When he informed me of how the security deposit is being handled, I asked him if this was written in the lease and he said yes. I don't believe him though and am in the process of getting a copy of the lease to be sure.  Does a situation like this seem probable (legal) or is he just holding my money until he knows it's been covered (illegal)?	No
Hi, I live across the street from a popular restaurant in my town in Kentucky, so popular that it often has a line with a long wait. I'm thinking about setting up a public webcam and website that will broadcast the front of the restaurant so people can see the line before they decide to go. The webcam would be placed inside my apartment, just pointing out a window, across the street at the restaurant and its parking lot.   I won't be trying to make any money from the website, just want to do a small public service. I know many people have said it sounds like a good idea and they'd love to use it.   Thoughts? Thank you!	No
Standard info for my county is [here](http://www2.duvalclerk.com/departments/county-civil/).  I cannot find the instructions for master tenant / subtenant evictions.  Maybe I can look up some similar filings somewhere?  In addition to the above general question, one specific issue I have is how to prove (or if it's required to prove) that I'm the master tenant if my lease with the landlord has been lost by both parties.  Or will the court simply accept that I'm the master tenant on the face value of my assertion that I am on the eviction filing?	No
I am renting a room on a month to month lease and as it turns out, the owner had defaulted on the loan in 2008 and has been fighting it in the court system since.   On Saturday (7-22-17) the owner, informed me of this legal battle, that the judge had ruled against her and that she was going to lose the house on Tuesday (7-25-17).  I all currently paid up on rent until 8-18-17, and I have asked for a refund for the last 30 days of rent, the remaining days I have paid for and my deposit, in exchange for voiding the contract and moving out today. She refused, offering one months rent and my deposit back.  Is this something that is worth fighting, or should I just accept her offer and focus on finding the most comfortable couch to sleep on tonight?	No
"So i live in a end unit townhouse in northern VA with another couple with our own fenced in backyard. I own a 15 year old dog who is both deaf and mostly blind. I received a somewhat threatening email today from our landlady...  (I had a chance to go to the house today to see what ""blank"" had cut down.  I was disappointed to find that, again, the yard is FULL of dog waste. Please let dog owner know this MUST STOP!  If there were no yard at all, she would be walking the dog with a bag ready to collect its poop per County code.  Why does she feel it is ok to leave the waste in a small yard where you all live if it is not ok to leave it in the streets or sidewalks???  I don't get it...I would think it would be in your best interests, and everyone else's to have the waste collected...  Please let her know I mean it...this has got to stop. This was one of the prerequisites to our renting the house to you with the dog...remember?It is disgusting to see, not to mention a major attraction for rats. Do you want rats around there?)  My wife and i were caught completely off guard because we pick up the yard once a week and maintain the yard per the lease agreement, even going so far as to finished jobs that were started before the last tenants left but not yet finished. Her husband has come over several times and spent time in the backyard and never said a thing. We went home to check our yard and found maybe 5 spots where my dog had used the restroom but we had not yet picked up since returning from vacation. To call is ""full of dog poop"" is a gross over exaggeration.   We checked out lease again to make sure we did not miss a section pertaining to picking up after our dog once a day. The lease states that we must dispose of waste in a timely manner. I do not understand the point of getting a closed in yard used only by our home with a dog and getting what i perceive as a threat from the Landlady.  Is it possible she can have us evicted if we don't pick up after our dog every single time in our own backyard?"	No
So my dad is on a ton of medication for his blood pressure that causes extreme frequent urination. Yesterday morning when he was headed home he got the urge to go RIGHT then. Anyone that has been on diuretics will understand. We are in Oklahoma by the way.  He pulled over in to an enclave (in a fairly rural part of town). As he was leaning against the hood urinating into the woods, someone drove by. They turned around as he was getting in the car screaming at him. (The guy had his wife and child in the car). My dad drove off because that is obviously a scary situation to be in.  Later we find out that the guy is blasting all over social media that my dad had his pants around his ankles and was masturbating in public. He didn't name him by name but we have an EXTREMELY recognizable car. Think only one of them in the state. He has since taken down the posts but claims to have made a police report and such.  My dad is an absolute wreck. He believes he has ruined our families reputation, is going to be hauled off to prison because its his word against theirs and they have three witnesses.   We have been in contact with lawyers and they just told him to lay low and not worry about it. They said worse case the cops might come by and talk to him. Urinating in public isn't a sex crime here in Oklahoma either.  Is there anything else I can do, what should we reasonably expect? What can I tell my dad to calm him down?	No
I recently had to move out of a rented flat because the landlord wanted to completely refurbish the building and sell the individual flats. I was given the required notice period. Soon after being given notice, the landlord's contractors began putting up scaffolding (very noisy). I was quite surprised at this, because I hadn't been told the work would be starting while I was still in the building.   I contacted the Tenancy Relations dept at my local council to check whether the landlord could actually proceed with such major renovations with tenants still in situ. They said yes (subject to safety laws), but I might wish to ask for (or sue for) compensation for the infringement of my right to Quiet Enjoyment of the premises. They suggested I ask for 25% off, and consider settling for less.  I had a meeting with the landlord while the scaffolding was still being put up, and before the interior work started on the empty flats. I mentioned the right to Quiet Enjoyment and asked whether he was considering making an offer of a rent reduction. He said he was not obliged to.  The work on the interior of the building started fairly soon after the scaffolding was up. It was incredibly noisy and produced a huge amount of dust. The contractors were ripping out cupboards, breaking tiles, removing floor and ceiling material, and smashing down interior walls with sledgehammers. All of this material was then removed via the windows and brought down the scaffolding, since the interior staircase couldn't be used while tenants were still in the building.  In short, it became a living hell to live there, not least because I usually work from home and it became impossible to do so. The contractors worked a six day week.  25% off seems very low to me, considering the amount of disruption to my life that the work caused.   Has anyone got experience of making a claim in the UK for infringement of the right to Quiet Enjoyment? How much can I ask for? North of 50% seems fair to me. Will a small claims judge agree?	No

She has a pacemaker, and is a 3 time cancer survivor in her mid 20s. She has been in and out of the hospital every month for the past few years. First it was heart issues, and another was breathing problems. She got many heart surgeries, including heart valve and stents. She has had heart attacks too. She barely has any muscle on the back of her neck, so its hard on her to look up while at work.  I almost lost my mom many times. I'm 20, she is 52. All of these problems are from the radiation she endured in her twenties. Recently, she was hospitalized for over a month because she couldn't breath. She had fluid drained out of her lungs, which was a major surgery. She made it through it, and now has to use an oxygen machine at home and oxygen tanks every where she goes.   We struggle financially, and as a college student that works almost 40 hours a week, half of my paycheck goes to bills. She has applied for disability twice, and has been denied twice. I'm in shock, especially because of everything she has been through. And now that she relys on oxygen tanks, it makes me feel horrible she has to still work because she got denied. We did get a lawyer, but it could take up to 2 years now.   Is there any way to fast track this process? Or any place we can appeal this? There is absolutely no reason she should have been denied. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm a Florida resident if that helps.  Edit: we were also denied food stamps, even though we can barely afford food and barely get by with bills. She has lost too much weight since she has been on the oxygen machine.	No
I requested to use my PTO and sick days instead of short term disability or FMLA after I give birth in a month because I will need to take FMLA later in the year when I will have no family help and therefore need to be at home.  My employer says they have never had this type of request before (taking PTO instead of FMLA) and that they will dock my vacation days since I do not want to take FMLA at this time.  Is this OK to do? I know they can't legally dock my sick time as per NY law you are required to provide 40 hours of sick time but is it OK for them to dock the vacation time they provided me as well?  Seems weird.  My husband is taking parental leave from his company and he gets to take his full PTO (his is accrued). My PTO is not accrued, I get it the first day of the year.	No
I'm a US citizen (land living in the US) and also a partner of a company based in Australia.   What is the best way to handle distributions in my case -- would it make the most sense to create a subsidiary in the USA for tax purposes, or is there a better option?   While we have a few customers in the USA, we don't plan to pursue the market here and will not open any offices in the US. We'd like to remain focused on the Australian market. If we did open a subsidiary company in the US in order to pay distributions, would that open us up to US law and liabilities? We'd prefer to remain under Australian law since most of our customers are there.  I plan to speak to a lawyer about this, but thought it would be nice to get a few different opinions to prepare in case anyone else has dealt with a similar situation. Thanks in advance for your help!	No
While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell.   I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home.   My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with. While I was at the ER, I told them it was a work related incident and to contact my employer. I received a bill for a little over $500 and promptly handed it to my general manager. I have now received another for a lowered amount, $267. When I received the bill for $267, I sent it to my employer with a note asking what we needed to do to take care of this and haven't heard anything.   I no longer work there because I accepted a position for an internship in another city. What legal obligation do I have to pay the remainder? I don't want it to go to collections, but I don't feel responsible for paying it, either. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have gone to the ER at all. What is the best course of action?  TD;LR: got Tilex in eyes at work, boss sent me to ER, stuck with bill.	No
"will try to stick to the facts here. the last year of renting from our landlord has been an absolute terror.  year long lease, began August 1st 2016 ending August 1st 2017. located in Vermont  landlord contacted us 72hrs ago saying there would be a showing 7/16/17 at 2:30pm, ""might be"" one at 3:30pm  contacted us again 22hrs ago says there would be showings at 1:30pm, 2:30pm, and ""maybe"" 3:30pm  this is illegal correct? we can deny entry to the 1:30pm and 3:30pm showings because he did not give us legal notice (it's 48hrs in VT)? what happens if he tries to enter with them? we can tell the prospective renters ""the landlord is showing this home without legal notice, don't rent from him?""   we have tried to resolve our differences with the landlord amicably, but he is not interested in discussing or following vermont law. all responses welcome, he burned this bridge of a relationship months ago!"

I‚Äôd like to preface this by saying I actually like our HOA board and our management company and feel they do a good job, but I do need advice on an issue:  Last October we bought a condo in a 160-unit complex built in 1972. The units are not individually metered for water usage; the water bill is included as part of our monthly HOA fees.   The individual units were not built with in-unit laundry capabilities. (The complex has on-site laundry facilities for use.) Over the years, however, several owners remodeled their units to fit in-unit washer/dryers. The unit I purchased was one of these.  The copy of the CCRs I received before closing the sale stated any units that had been retro-fitted with in-unit laundry facilities before 2004 would be grandfathered in, but no more in-laundry remodeling would be permitted after 2004. We confirmed with our realtor and the seller‚Äôs realtor that our unit was one of the ones grandfathered in.   Our closing date was actually held up a few days, however, because the HOA president was insisting that the washer/dryer in our unit be removed before the sale could be approved. Both of the realtors fought this, and we were eventually able to close with the washer/dryer intact.  Our HOA board is now rewriting/updating the CCRs, and the committee doing the rewriting has stricken out the language about in-unit laundry that was fitted before 2004 being grandfathered in. (The board president said specifically that ‚Äúthis has never been true‚Äù and she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know why it‚Äôs even in the CCRs.‚Äù)   So here‚Äôs my question: can the board force us to remove our washer/dryer now based on these rules re-written after we already bought the condo?	No
My dad was supposed to pick up the car from long term airport parking because I couldn't find a ride. He was just gonna snag it from the lot the next day or later that very day. Through one reason or another he didn't, and it had been there accumulating 13 a day for 8 days. I went to get it when I came back from my trip, livid that I now have to charge money on my card that I don't have at this very moment. So how do I get it out? Well I rode the ass of the guy in front of me and I drove out with him. I can pay tomorrow but like idk if I'm gonna have like some sort of warrant out for me or something. I know this is such a small thing but i am 19 years old and do not want to have to deal with this as some sort of ticket or anything. Do I call the airport? What should I do?	No

Just wanting to know what, if anything, I can do in this situation. I filed 0 exemptions on my W-4, yet 2 exemptions are reported for my W-2. We now owe about $3k in taxes to the IRS. I did not notice that not enough taxes were being taken out, and I do realize that that was a huge oversight on my part. Thank you in advance for any advice you may have.	No
To start ... this isn't easy. It took me several days to gather the nerves to post this... please be forgiving. I'm a stupid teenager...   In October of 2016 I met a very friendly foreign exchange student. She came from southern Beijing and we really hit it off. She had never had a long term relationship and we dated until January. I was her first boyfriend, and it was her first year in America. We basically met the week she arrived. Eventually we broke up she was mean at times and it was hard for me to keep going. By march I had to go to the hospital. It was later said I had hepatitis b.   This girl comes from a region of China where many people are born with or contract this disease at a young age. They may be immune to its affects but they are carriers themselves. I've tried to hold many conversations with this person and she has stated that there is nothing wrong with her and that I was sick with strep most likely .... she's not the brightest. I still have her on Snapchat. Ever since I broke up with her she will snap herself with other presumably lovers. To spite me.   I know she's having sex, and I know she's most likely spreading disease. Is there anything I can do to stop her? I truly believe she is harming society.	No
"1) Is it illegal to pass a vehicle inspection without the vehicle? 2) In a bill of sale, what would ""Title Fee: $400"" legally mean? Would it be seen as the cost of registration, taxes, and fees in the buyers name. Or is it too vague to mean anything? 3) If someone registers the car with a fraudulent VIR, is there a way to prove that?  For all of you people who seem to want to criticize me for buying a used car, and being unhappy that it broke down the next day. I have taken the story out and only left with the questions I need answering. If you need background, I won't give any as you will just insult me."	No
"I moved into a 2 bedroom apartment here in California in September 2015 and signed a sublease with the tenant who occupies the larger bedroom.  The sublease is month-to-month, and includes the phrase:  &gt;Said tenancy may be terminated by either party on at least thirty (30) days written notice to the other, and Lessor shall have the right to change the terms of this Agreement by a similar notice in writing, of such change or changes (CC1946 &amp; CC827). In the event of Lessee's failure to give such notice of intention to terminate, he/she shall be liable for another full term.  A few months after moving in, the tenant informed me that the landlord wanted me to sign on to the actual lease, which is also month-to-month.  I signed alongside the tenant, as an equal on the actual lease.  The actual lease includes the section:  &gt;21\. ASSIGNMENT/SUBLETTING: Tenant shall not sublet all or any part of Premises, or assign or transfer this agreement or any interest in it, without prior written consent of Landlord. Unless such consent is obtained, any assignment, transfer or subletting of Premises or this Agreement of tenancy, by voluntary act of Tenant, operation of law, or otherwise, shall be null and void, and at the option of Landlord, terminate this Agreement. Any proposed assignee, transferee or sublessee shall submit to Landlord an application and credit information for Landlord's approval, and if approved, sign a separate written agreement with Landlord and Tenant. Landlord's consent to any one assignment, transfer or sublease, shall not be construed as consent to any subsequent assignment, transfer or sublease and does not release Tenant of Tenant's obligation under this agreement.  There was also an addendum to the lease that I (and the other tenant) signed that includes the section:  &gt;8\. Sublease of any portion of the property is not permitted.  When I first moved in, I only submitted an application with the tenant.  There was no separate application with the landlord.  Yesterday afternoon, the tenant handed me a letter which read:  &gt;Dear [my name],  &gt;The service of this 30-day notice requires you to vacate this residential premises situated at [address] on or before August 31, 2017 as per our Residential Rental Agreement dated September 9, 2015.  &gt;This notice takes effect August 31, 2017,  &gt;This notice is served July 31, 2017.  In handing the letter to me, the tenant informed me that she ""wanted to move a friend in.""  We have not had any major conflicts, and have not even had to discuss any minor, roommate related conflicts in months.  This morning, I called the landlord, who was also somewhat surprised to hear that she gave me notice to vacate, and recommended talking to her directly.  I threw in a question if he knew about the sublease, and he didn't really answer, saying he'd have to review his notes.  He essentially told me he was sort of ""aware"" of me moving in.  **My question is this:** does she have the authority to kick me out like that considering I signed on to the actual lease, and given the sections regarding subletting?  Obviously, I no longer want to stay in this apartment, but I'm in an area with a very difficult renter's market, and need more time.  Particularly in light of the fact that, for an entire year, I've been planning a trip that would put me out of town on August 19th until early September.  Finding a new place to live in just over 2 weeks is highly unrealistic, though I'm certainly searching already.  I'm just hoping to extend this to 60 or 90 days.  Let me know if you have any questions I can answer."	No
I rented a room at $445 on August 3rd, 2017. The landlord demanded $300 of security deposit, which I gave him along with my first month's rental fee. Later I learned that in BC, Canada, the security deposit cannot be more than one half of the rent, meaning the maximum security deposit is $445/2 = $222.5, not $300. Last night I brought this up and demanded the extra $77.5 back. He brazenly REFUSED to do so, even after clearly stating the fact that he's breaking the law.  What do I do now?	No
So I signed a lease at a place where I'm filling a vacant room, two other roommates are living there already. I put down a deposit. The landlord hasn't been around, so we've communicated via e-mail. He sent me a lease, I signed, scanned, and sent it back to him, but he hasn't done the same. I don't have his signature on anything. And it's supposed to start on Saturday.   Now I see a better option has presented itself. The deposit is supposed to hold the room, right? Since I haven't gotten anything signed from the landlord I'm wondering if it's actually, legally too late for me to back out?	No

"Hi Reddit! Thanks in advance for the help.  I am attempting to move out of an apartment that I currently live in in San Mateo, California. I alerted the landlord that I will be leaving yesterday, and he responded that I should have given 30 days notice as per the contract.   The 30 days notice before leaving (with a yearlong lease with a set end date) clause was not in the original contract. However, the landlord sent a notice 31 days ago which reads,   *""Dear Valued residents, Thank you for your concerned residency. Your rental agreement is about to expire and we would like to extend the offer for you to sign a new lease. Because of management changes, it is necessary for you to sign a new contract with us, even if you will be remaining on a month to month agreement. Below you will find your best available option to renew, as well as the rate for choosing a month to month agreement. New rental rates begin August 1, 2017.   Option I: 12 MO $2400   OPTION II : Month to month $2880   *If you do not respond to this notice by July 30, 2017, your rent will change per the month to month amount listed above. It is necessary for you to sign a new contract even if you are deciding to go month to month. If you are intending to move, please remember a written 30 day notice to vacate is required. So don't wait and renew today. Turn in the bottom portion of this letter to the Leasing Office and we will email your new lease paperwork to you. "" *   So I will alert them today that I will NOT be moving to a month to month lease. However, i am forced to break the 30-day notice rule. The only penalty stated on the original contract is that if I break the contract, they may choose to evict me within three days (which is fine, since the lease is up on the 31st.)  Is there anything I should know or do?  Thanks so much for reading."	No
"We've since moved out of state but the property in question was in Eastern Washington. Landlord sent a proxy for the walk through who was in our opinion completely over the top with the walkthrough, but despite that we thought it went okay. We were expecting for the landlord to find ways to chip away at most of our deposit with stuff here and there (for instance, there had been an ancient, cheap garage door opener which disappeared; we got charge $50 for it, but whatever). So even though we thought we had done a very good job taking care of the place and prepping it for the next renters, we were prepared to kiss our 1200 goodbye.  The landlord sent us a bill for $5,000 in ""damages"". That's it. No explanation, just ""tenant damages"".   There was no damage whatsoever that was caused by us that wasn't repaired before we left. There had been some severe damage caused by a freak windstorm a year prior that the landlord had never fixed. There had been damage that had been there before we even moved in, but the landlord claimed they didn't have our damage report on file and that they were going to go off old photos from ""before we moved in"". We had completed that when we moved in, sent it in, and wrote it down separate in a notebook since it was a single page form that they said they would copy and send back and of course never did. We completely repainted, we completely rebuffed and waxed the floors, we made every bathroom sparkle cleaned the chimneys, etc. We can't think of anything else they could possibly be charging us for.  What can we do to dispute this? They said we had ""ten days from the time of this letter"" to respond before it would be escalated to collections, and the date on the top of the letter was clearly marked two weeks before it was even sent. I've never had a landlord try to screw us like this before so I don't even know where to start."	No
"I lived at an apartment complex for 4 years (68 units.)  My lanlord and I got along well.  I paid $1300/month rent for 4-years and just recently moved.  My rent was always paid a month in advance.  My lease was up on 6/30/17, and so I was out by 9pm.  When I moved in we never did a walk-through, when I left we did not do a walk-through either.  The complex is privately owned and ran by the owner.  He owns many businesses, and does not always have alot of time; however I took a video of the apartment before I left.  I of course left everything in prisetien codition.  I took care of his apartment well, he too commented that in the past.   I have been calling and texting regarding the return of my security deposit to no avail.  I realize he has a ""reasonable amount of time,"" to return.  He normally always replies but now I have not heard a peep.  My question:  I noticed a clause in my lease:  SURRENDERING OR VACATING The resident agrees to vacate and surrender possession of the apartment at least five (5) days prior to expiration of termination of the lease or any renewal thereof.  Whatever the reason may be, and if resident does not comply with this provision, Landlord may retain the security deposit as liquidated damages and also may take physical possession of the premises or take such legal action as it is authorized in this lease or as it shall see fit, none of these measures excluding any of the others.  I did not leave 5 days prior, I left at the end of the month becuase that was what I paid my rent; until the end of the month.  I did not notice this clause until now.  Am I SOL?  Is this even legal to put in a lease.  My fault I did not anyalize before I signed; I've been renting since I was 16 years of age; I'm now in my 50's, and have never seen a clause like this before.  All my other leases state to have apartment returned as I rented.  Is this legal, its like he is now getting double rent.  I'm so upset with myself.  Should I fight this?  If he does have a right to this clause, can I at least get the intrest, because it says nothing about that; however I'd rather have ther $1300 plus intrest.  Thank you for whatever help you can give to me."	No
I have two credit card debt default judgements against me from about 5 years ago.  Even though my credit is repaired now, I am concerned if those creditors can still use that default judgement to come after my brokerage account.  I have recently opened a brokerage account where I am attempting to do some stock trading and my concern is if those creditors from the past can use those judgements to try to seize and/or garnish my brokerage account and I end up losing all funds in it?  The judgements were issued in an NYC court.  Any input would be appreciated.	No
Recently (a month) I accepted a job that I am very unhappy at and know will not work out for me in the long run. I am an at will employee and both the offer letter and the employee handbook mentions that management requires 14 days notice in case of quitting. Now would i be in any legal trouble if I quit immediately?	No
"Throw away for super obvious reasons. TLDR: Dr. groped and propositioned me and. now won't send medical records to new doctors.     I saw this doctor for almost 7 years without major issue, he was always a bit flirty but in the last few months he had made some ""jokes"" that made it obvious he was getting a little out there. During  my last visit during the first week of June he asked to view my scars from a skin removal and breast augmentation. This made sense because all these years later I still have nylon sutures that very painfully come to the surface and breakthrough the skin.   This part is super hard to type out, idk why but I can't get it out of my head, can't sleep, can't stop thinking about it.    He repeatedly rubbed his hands around the scar from my lower body lift and then closed the room door and asked to see the scars on my breasts. I was not aware anyone else should be in the room so please don't yell at me about it. He then proceeded to rub his hands all over my breast ""feeling for sutures"" and after about 30 seconds I started totally freaking out because it was going where there weren't any. Then he proceeded to ask me repeatedly if I would ""play"" and if I liked to play, how he was a boob guy and an old man like him was just happy to touch them. I completely shut down as a human and said no I'm happily married and my scars weren't bothering me, pulled my bra back up and shirt back down. He then kept making comments about how I was probably grossed out and would tell my husband, I think I was in complete shock and I just needed to leave that room asap so I made a comment about no big deal I just need to run home to pick up my kid so I needed to get going. I knew I needed to find a new Dr right away and should officially tell someone but I was so ashamed, so embarrassed that this could happen to me and that I didn't handle it by yelling for someone to come in the room.. I just had no idea what to do.     So a few days later I'm sitting there watching the news and I see he was arrested for sexually assaulting another patient. It turns  It he's been doing stuff like that for awhile.  I have 2 new doctors that have changed my quality of life tremendously in less than a month as far as changing nearly every medication and actually checking my vitals. Previous Dr. checked  maybe twice in 6 years. Now the issue is his office will not send my medical records to the new doctors despite several requests and my signing all the documents for it to happen.   I don't know what to do. Should I still go file a police report about what he did to me ? How can I obtain my medical records if his office won't send them to my new doctors after almost 7 weeks of requesting them?   I'm a hot mess, I can't get it out of my head and I feel disgusting, depressed and ashamed of myself for not speaking up right away.   Thank you for wading through to the bottom of my post and for any advice in the right direction."	No
Hello,  I am facing a situation where I decided to move in with two roommates in Massachusetts that I met them through a Facebook Housing Group. I met them in person, and they seemed like decent people I could live with. We all submitted an application and put the money down on this place, and were e-mailed the lease to sign. Me and one other roommate have signed it; however, the third has been hesitant. She says due to health reasons she may not be able to work, and does not want to commit to signing the lease without first getting results from a specialist (this appointment could take many weeks past the due date of the lease signing to get). There is a broker's fee also, so we'd potentially lose both our down payments and the lease entirely if she does not sign it by the appropriate date. I care about her health and don't blame her for being hesitant, but at the end of the day I do not want to lose my money or this apartment. What are my options if she doesn't sign, or is that entirely at the discretion of the lease office? Thanks for any advice!   TL;DR My third roommate won't sign a lease, and it may be too late by the time she does. My concern being is I can lose the first month's rent I put down as a deposit if she does not sign it by the date. What should I do? Would this mean I lose both the lease and the deposit (there is a broker's fee)?	No

Hi r/legal! Recently split up with my s/o and am now in the process of setting up a new life for myself. While with s/o, we had an arrangement for rent/bills. Basically everything was split 50/50 including mortgage. The mortgage was paid off earlier this year and since February, we have both been setting aside money to pay property taxes and insurance at the end of the year. I still continued to pay my half of utilities while putting the property tax/insurance money aside in my savings account.   S/o is now asking me to give him all the money that I've saved up for that, now that I've left.   Am I legally obligated to pay him back?	No
We need advice! We live in California and have lived in our apartment since March. This all started because I requested reasonable accommodations from the landlord for an emotional support animal. I have a legitimate need and my therapist wrote a letter to my landlord to explain.   To be clear- we do NOT have a dog or any other animal yet. An animal has never been in our apartment or building in our time living here.   But, the building manager wrote us today to say they found traces of urine in the hall and dog feces behind out back door (there are animal feces there. I don't know where they are from). They then said that we have had a pet in our apartment in violation of our lease and therefore will need to leave and end the lease early.   What can we do? We haven't broken the lease, again no animal has entered the apartment, and I just sent the official letter from my therapist on Friday, so they should receive it in a few days.   It's also worth noting that this landlord is pretty negligent. It took them over a week to get us a smoke detector and the landlord who owns the building (and we have never met) entered our apartment without cause or notice a few months ago. This is all admitted to in writing from our landlord too.   Any and all advice would be very much appreciated!!	No
When I was homeless, I left my vape out on the window ledge. And after coming back from being scammed by a fake landlord my neighbour was peeping through the fence at me. He had my vape and he turned it on and a vape cloud formed and he was coughing.  Afterwards a signal went off and people surrounded the garden ( either he was trying to scare me. Or he called police in claiming I was trying to attack him, or a mafia. Cameras were popping up in the hedge and I could hear a helicopter and things spraying and trying to shock us.  I've tried reporting this to the police but there's no evidence. The vape cost me ¬£120 and because he is an old man the police would beleive him over me and people would also beleive him over me and my family and parents down beleive me where it happend.  Is there anything I can actually do about this?	No
I had a very, very bad experience with a dental  surgery the other day. Woke up during surgery, surgeon held me down and finished procedure with me wide awake, no pain meds, and left the room.

"I'm a 24 year old male, (was) working in a metallurgical quality control lab of a steel stamping plant with two old ladies (who I despise). I tolerated the 12.25hr job for a year now. Yesterday it was just me and my manager (the one who groped me) in the office and I said some like ""Yeah he's in a meeting or something"" and she awkwardly grabs my bicep in a weird in a unusual way. This isn't the first time this has happened either.   I went straight to HR and the president of the company and told them what happened,  and they were trying to make me sound like I'M crazy and hats a normal thing to do when you need to get someone's attention (even though we were alone in the office and right next to each other). They sent me home to ""calm down and collect myself""  So, this morning I go into work with the intention of going straight to my manager and saying ""Listen, about yesterday, I just don't like being touched like that"" and when I try, she interrupts me mid-sentence and tells me to go talk to HR.. I go into HR and they basically tell me that I can still use them as a reference, for another job because I'm no longer ""compatible"" to work with my manager in that quality control office.   The place was beginning to make me want to kill myself and I don't think 12.25/hr was worth that anyways. I just don't know what to do now. Hopefully a years worth of experience is enough to get somewhere else in quality control. I feel like they were scared they could get sued. Help."	No
"My friend was talking about non-competes and brought this question up...""Is a non-compete valid if you sign it but you physically haven't started working for them yet?""

Cheers also the location is Massachusetts"	No
My BF's family recently got a notice that they have to pay $100,000 within 5 years in order to connect to the closest sewer system. The project will be more than 1 million dollars. Their septic system is fine and they just recently replaced a bunch of stuff within the house and property in the past 2 years. If they don't comply within 5 years, the house will be seized.   Another major thing is there is a major farming giant that owns the surrounding fields. The family refuses to sell the land despite the fact that they spray pesticides less than 10 ft. from residential houses...more than 2 people have died from emphysema even though they are not around smoke (mind you my bf and his family live in an area that has less than 20 houses and they talk and are all friends), some have asthma and others have developmental disorders. This could be because some of the residents on the block burn trash...like everything, even plastic... or well some aren't the brightest bunch lol. The burn in your nose that the plastic creates is not even close to the suffocating air you have to breathe in when they spray the crops. The people who own this land were offered a lump sum (which they refused) that would greatly benefit and lower the cost for the local residents...but they refused.   Is there anything they can do? How would they go about selling the house if the worst comes? And how should they go about fighting this. There are so many impoverished families and people who have passed on the houses for generations that will suffer mainly just because of the owners of these farmlands...	No
"Is there anything I could do if someone repetitively ignores a prominently placed ""No Solicitation"" sign? I have a smart door bell (camera/mic/speaker) and have asked the person putting it on to not put it in the future. I have even called the business and spoke with managers/owners and requested they stop putting flyers on my door.  I travel for work, upwards of 3 weeks at a time, and I know advertisements at the front door is a sign to thieves that no one is home. My previous neighbor used to trash them for me however they have since moved and the new neighbors arent too friendly.   Could I add a sign that say violator contact information will be entered on junk mailing/telemarketer contact lists?"	No
I rented a place at college for a year and graduated 6 months before the lease was up. I got a sublet for the second half of the year. I was never able to sign over the lease to him because my roommates weren't ever current on rent, so I stuck with the lease. We are close with the rental company, so they allowed this to happen and allowed him to pay the rent without us having to do anything shady to trick them. He paid the first one on time and everyone was happy, so from then on I just asked/ reminded him to pay rent. Every time I asked if he had paid the month, he would say yes and I bought it. Now the lease will be over at the end of the month and I have $2,500 that hasn't been paid, which came as a big surprise. The kid moved away and isn't responding to any calls or texts. I have no idea what to do right now, I don't have the money for the rent or for lawyers. And the other two roommates will probably be dragged into this as we all have a lease agreement on the full rent being paid. Any help would be appreciated, and I know I'm an idiot... but I had no choice but to gamble in this situation.	No
"Hey folks.  My family just moved into a new apartment and today it will be exactly a week.  Before move in we noticed the light in the fan wasn't working in two different rooms but the lady showing us the place told us not to worry they would be fixed before move in.  Move in comes along and they're still not fixed but we figure it's not a big deal we don't need them and they'll be by to fix them at some point.  Then we go to do laundry and discover the brand new dryer in the apartment isn't working so I take a peek behind it.  It probably is new because they never bothered to hook it up to anything hence why it's not working.  We called and informed the leasing agent immediately of these problems then handed in the move in paperwork that you fill out any damages/problems at move in and included both issues.  We have called every day since then and every day we've been assured that maintenance is coming that day to fix these problems, and every day they have not.  Now we honestly don't want to rock the boat here because it's hard to find an affordable apartment complex here that you aren't likely to get shot by.  But I was wondering if it's reasonable to ask for prorated rent based on the value of a working washer/dryer.  I was digging through our lease and found this about repairs, *""We'll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections. Rent will not abate in whole or in part.""*  Now obviously this states that they won't prorate rent at all, but I figured it can't hurt to ask if there's a legal definition or whatever for customary diligence and if over a week without the working appliance would be considered breaching customary diligence.  At the end of that day we're not going to fight this if it's not a black and white yeah you can ask for that and see what they say kind of thing.  As like I said, we don't want to rock the boat."	No
My boyfriend and I just moved into our first apartment on August 1st. When we looked at the unit, it was perfect. Within a day of moving in, though, it's started vibrating all day, every day. I understand that no place is perfect and that every apartment has its problems. However, this vibrating is to the point where I'm not able to be in most of my apartment for more than a minute without extreme discomfort.   When we talked to our landlord, she had said that a piece of equipment in the chain restaurant two floors below us was broken, and that was causing the noise. She said it would be fixed by the end of the week (luckily, they also own the restaurant below us, so at least they have the power to make those repairs). But it hasn't. And now I'm at the point where I spend the entirety of my free time out of the apartment or forcing myself to sleep to avoid the pain.   We're willing to wait out this week and see if they get around to fixing whatever is wrong. But we can't live like this long-term. If they don't fix it, what are our options for breaking your 12-month lease? Is there a way to get our last month's rent back if we do?	No

Hello Everyone!  So my girlfriend is currently a DACA recipient from Honduras and has been here in the United States for 13 years. She always talks about wishing her and her family the ability to become legal residents but she says the only way she can is either for her to marry a citizen  (were not in a rush to get married) or to wait for her sister who was born here to turn 21.   Is there another way? She went through k-12 here in the US and is going to start college soon. And she works as well.  Thank You!	No
I live in Oregon. I have the opportunity to buy a property with cash. My Dad wants to live on it and build a home, which he happily wants me to own. No strings attached, no contract.  My question is regarding my security. If there is no contract between us, and he finds himself in debt, could a debt collector come after me? For example if he spends a lot of money on building a home, then files bankruptcy, can the house on my property become involved in his litigation?  Alternatively, if I wrote a contract with him, how could I protect myself from his potential debts?  It goes without saying, I know a lawyer will be able to answer these questions in more detail. Thanks for any advice!	No
So my gaurentor accidentally signed and sent in the acknowledgment part of a renewal contract of a lease I did not want. I had called them when he sent it in that i did not want to renew my contract and was told that i would not need to worry as it only has the gaurentor signature and not mine. I have also noticed that there was no signature for the amendment part of the contract.  I got an email about my move in date and got curious and rang the administration staff of the estate. I was told I was legally blinded and that they had only required one signature from either gaurentor or resident. Keep in mind that this was only for the acknowledgment part and not the full amendment for renewal of original contract.   In my eyes I view this as an incomplete contract and was not agreed upon all parties.   Am I legally blinded to this renewal? 	No
While delivering at work in my personal car.  I was involved in an accident that was not my fault.  I had the right of way and the other driver was cited at the scene.  Law enforcement came and I went to the hospital for minor  injuries I sustained in the accident.    If the other driver is completely at fault will my ability to accept pay out be at risk since I was delivering in my personal vehicle?	No
A while back I (car driver) got into an accident with a bicyclist and had a police officer come and file a report. The police report pretty much stated that the biker was at fault (because he was biking in the opposite direction in the bike lane) and I filed a claim to my insurance company afterwards. My insurance company also said that he was 90% at fault for this accident and agreed to send me a check for my cars repair. The said they would send me a check for the total amount minus the deductible; meaning that I would have to still pay my deductible. My insurance company said they would reimburse my deductible if they were able to successfully pursue and obtain money from the biker but they said it was unlikely because he is not insured for this accident.  I feel like I shouldn't be paying the deductible if I'm not really at fault so what would be my best option here? Is my insurance company really not capable of obtaining money from the biker? Should I go to a small claims court? Should I take the loss and just pay my deductible?  Any information/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.	No
As the title says, the house took weather damage. The county claims we've been rebuilding the house. In reality, it's been a mix of cleaning/organizing/placing vapor barrier to prevent any more water entry/removing mold/removing unsafe structures. No construction. Most of the house was already not done to code when we bought it.  Consequences are fines and doubling the price of any future permits.  So what's going on? Is this legal? It seems like an extreme amount of duress on an already painful situation.	No
How can I get rid of a roommate that refuses to pay utilities?    She is obnoxiously stubborn, and doesn't thinks she has to pay utilities because she has a smaller bedroom.    Landlord says we have to work it out.    Roommate refuses to communicate, and wants to take over the apartment.  I've been in the apartment for 6 years, the new roommate for 1 year.  Its becoming a hostile environment.	No
[near Lachine Canal, QC, Canada] So, I fucked up really badly. I don't know what to do or how exactly I should proceed, so I'm turning to good ol' reddit. Disclaimer: I have a very severe anxiety disorder, and panic attacks are a usual occurrence for me. So, I left work 45 minutes earlier than usual today, because I was feeling dizzy, had heart palpitations and a high blood pressure. I needed to lie down, so my boss gave me the OK to leave. Living 45min away from work (traffic), I started heading home at 3:17pm. It is now ~3:45pm, and I'm 10/13min away from home, finally. I start to feel uneasy once again, and decide I really do need to get get my blood pressure under control, considering the possibility of needing to go to the hospital. I get to the stop sight right before the train tracks. It is my turn to proceed, and as I start to accelerate, a grey van perpendicular to where I was decides it's her turn to go as well. I brake suddenly to avoid an potential accident. At that point, I'm beginning a panic attack, and I get flustered. The grey van is now in front of me (don't have the plates, I was too panicky to think of that), so I accelerate along with it. At that point, the lights and sirens of the train tracks are getting louder and stronger... The grey van and I are stranded on the middle or the train tracks and I'm panicking even more. The grey van then accelerates quickly, but just as it passes the tracks, the wooden bar comes down in front of me. I react right away and reverse as quick as possible, only to have the second bar fall right on top of my car's roof (FUCK ME). I'm panicking, scared.. and what comes next? The police comes out of nowhere, sirens and lights blaring. I'm happy they were there, because it calmed me down and they helped me get off the tracks.. however, as a repercussion, I got a 139$ ticket (which is not what I'm upset about). With the ticket, I got a monetary fine, but I also got 4 demerit points. Keep in mind: I have a probationary license, which only has 4 points on it. Bam, licence is lost for 24 months. I fucking lost my license because some guy decided to cut me off at the stop sign. I'm turning 18 in 5 days, so things would've been different. Damage to the car and rail were minimal, thank goodness. Anyhow, the police tells me that both my infractions led up to the ticket I received, and that the guy in front of me was in the wrong, however I was the one who got caught under the bar, and I was the one they caught/had to first help out. I will be contesting the ticket via lawyers from Tickets911, however I want some outside and objective opinions about this. What should I do? What are my chances? What can I do to at least get 1 point back, to possibly be able to keep my license? Any opinions/tips are welcome. Thanks, reddit.	No
So I was sleeping, when I was awoken by loud banging at the door at 3:20 AM.  It was a 24 hour maintenance crew from our apartment complex and he said that our apartment was leaking water. Upon hearing this we turned on our lights, and saw that the bathroom was flooded with about and inch or water, and it had progressed to some of the carpet. After we allowed the maintenance in, we started placing towels everywhere to soak up as much water as possible and cranked up the heat to help dry out the carpets.  The maintenance said that our water heater was old, and overtime rusts on the bottom and he believes that is why it broke and leaked water everywhere. We have  $100,000 of Personal liability coverage which protects you financially (up to the policy limit), if you are responsible for damages to your unit as a result of fire, smoke, explosion and in most states water damage. If you accidentally start a fire you will be responsible for damages to your unit and damages to your neighbor's unit and their personal property. A liability policy will pay for these damages up to policy limit.  My question is we ARE NOT responsible for these damages because we didn't cause the water heater to break so will we need to file an insurance claim for this, even though we did not cause the damage or reason for the damage (water heater breaking)?    Sorry if there are any errors, I was just asleep 20 minutes ago, and am dealing with this as we speak.	No

"So ever since I got hired at this job there has been an issue with a co-worker and there is a long list let me just start   #1: complains about every thing I do. If it's not my music it's about the way I work and he goes to tell our boss and I get either yelled at or asked to turn of my music  #2: I was playing my music loud enough that I can here it in my area but walks over to my area and complains that my music is too vulgar and it offends him and his religion(Islam) I was listening to wu tang clan and the song had nothing to do with Muslims or middle eastern countries but claims that the words ""mother fucking nigga"" offends him and proceeded to yell it across the shop which in turn offended me because he's not African American I am that pissed me off  #3: I was working on a tire and proceeded to bitch about the way I work and how I'm inconsiderate to my other co workers and that I'm a lazy fat fuck   I just wanna know when it's legal to punch someone in the mouth to make them shut the fuck up and my boss won't help me either btw because the employee make the company more money than I do slightly and has tenure there. Please someone just tell me I can punch him in the mouth because I'm heated and this is the last fucking straw "	No
So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	No

My apartment building that uses a website to accept ACH and credit card payments, and I've had an automated payment set up for the ~18 months I've lived there.   In June, that payment failed. The company says the ACH payment bounced; my bank says the charge was never presented. A second try worked fine.   The July 1 automated payment worked fine. On July 28 I got an email saying that my rent payment was scheduled for August 2.   Today, I noticed that the payment had not processed. The payment website tells me to contact the manager. The manager says that because there were two NSF's (?), they will no longer accept payment via online ACH or personal check, so the website never tried the payment I was told was scheduled... and they'll only take cashier's check or money order.  Which would just be annoying and I'd just get a cashier's check, except my bank (Citibank) does not have branches in Washington state. So getting a cashier's check means a trip to Portland.  FWIW, this may be an intentional strategy to get me out of the building, since they are moving more and more units to company-operated AirBnB inventory, and I negotiated a long lease for probably the nicest unit in the building at a rate that is now pretty low for the market.  Specific questions: - Given that they indicated they would submit the automated payment and never communicated that they had not and would not, do I have any leverage to argue late fees? - Is the company under any legal obligation to give me advance notice that they will no longer accept personal checks? - Can I insist on paying with actual cash, since I can get that from ATMs locally rather than traveling out of state to get cashier's checks? - If the company does just want me out before my lease ends so they can use the unit for AirBnB, what else should I be doing?	No
I'm looking for a new job and am willing to contract.  Some recruiters, I'd say less than half, have language that states I agree to accept the position if the employer wants me (at the negotiated rate).   Is such a contract binding?   If so, if the job is at will anyway, what prevents me from joining for 1 day and then quitting, say if I don't like the office smell?  (promissory estoppel issues perhaps)  More curious than anything, because I occasionally agree to such terms, but only when the money is so good that I really would take the job.	No
"So I have a slightly convoluted and problematic issue regarding my (and friend's) security deposit. Before I go on, we understand a lot of things were done incorrectly and are willing to concede that this may just have to be a costly life lesson. I should note that the landlord was a former coworker so we put up with a lot of things since he was a ""friend."" He's entered our property multiple times without notice or with very minimal notice - i.e. texting us that he'll be at the house in 10 minutes, etc. So we didn't really do anything by the book at all unfortunately. He also tried guilt tripping us multiple times when we signed the original lease saying that ""there were tons of people who wanted this place and offered him more money per month."" We told him that we already signed the agreed upon price of $2600/month and if he really had offers of $3.5k+, we'd be happy to cancel the lease and move on. He always backed down when we called his bluffs.   Anyway, my friend and I signed a lease with our landlord back in 2015 for a ~15 month lease that was suppose to end in February of 2017. The agreed upon terms were $2600/month for 3 people, upped to $2900 if 4 people moved in and a security deposit of $3500. We had a friend move in a bit later as an unofficial subletter with nothing signed (landlord was okay with this). My roommate and I are the only people on the official signed lease so we continued to just make payments in our names. We had no issues until I decided to move out last July with permission from both landlord and roommate. We had a friend come in and unofficially sublet my room and my original roommate continued to make payments. We're all very good friends so I decided to wait to get my original security deposit after the lease was terminated (we're all childhood friends with no money problems so trust isn't an issue).   Then things got a little messed up. The landlord owns 2 properties next to each other. The tenants from his other property decided to move into our place and ""break"" their current lease (our lease wasn't affected by this at all). However the landlord used this opportunity to raise the rent for EVERYONE. There was no new lease signed or anything. Again he quoted that the original lease was below market price and that he'd like to make it fair for him (yes, bullshit I know). They all agreed and it was all verbal since they viewed him as a friend and that he was pretty flexible given the chaotic change that just occurred. So he raised the rent to $3600 without any documentation, no new leases or anything. I thought they all had signed a new lease when this happened but it seems that the only signed lease that exist is the on from 2015.  Regardless, rent gets paid every month on time without issue. Now fast forward to this year and my former roommates wanted to extend the lease for a few months. They notified the landlord (verbally) that they intend to vacate the property by July (they let him know in June). However they didn't give an official 30 day notice in writing (yes, I told them to but they didn't listen for some reason). That's when the landlord notified them that he had spent/didn't have our security deposit and would return the deposit to us as soon as new tenants came and occupied the rooms they vacated. He would just take their deposits and give it to us.   So on paper, there's only one lease that ends Feb 2017 and switches to month-to-month. Then my ex-roommates verbally notified the landlord they'd like to stay a little longer. They give a verbal notice to vacate the premise in June with intent to leave in July. They move out in July but paid the full month's rent just in case. Now the landlord says the money is gone and won't have it for us until new tenants come in. He's demanded we find new tenants to cover the vacated premise even though they already gave him an verbal 30 day notice (and they paid him July rent as a goodwill gesture).   Sorry if this is super confusing as it's been pretty much a disaster since I moved out. I realize this would've been a slam dunk had my roommates just documented everything but it gets messy since they didn't. Any advice on how to proceed? Thanks!"	No
Feeling torn about this and just looking for perspective. I work at a private hospital. On our internal email server (no external communications outside of the building), a department head's secretary (by way of the CEO it turns out) forwarded an email, explaining that the hospital held a position against the ACA and encouraged staff to contact their legislators in support of repeal. The email also request that once the employee contacted their representative(s), they should respond to the email so that the CEO could have a record of support for stats. Surely this isn't legal? It's one thing to encourage staff to contact legislators WITH THEIR OWN OPINION. It's a whole other issue when there is a possibility of discrimination based on participation. Just looking for thoughts.	No
Hi all,  This information is all from my mom's memory and she told me as many details as she could recollect.   My mom is currently 56 years old (California current residence). She came from Guatemala in 1989 with my dad and oldest brother. They were caught by immigration. After paying a $500 fine per person they were let go with court dates etc. My mom actually was pregnant with me at the time. I was born and a couple of months later she went back to Guatemala to see her family. My dad (now deceased) attended all court dates but she did not because she was not in the country.   When she returned around '92-'95 she applied for a work permit and was granted one that lasted from 8-10 years. Around the time the permit was up she received a letter that informed her that she needed to apply for residency. She went to see a lawyer and due to fear told him she was in the country when she was required to appear in court but was unsure of what to do so she did not attend. (In reality she was in Guatemala and that's why she wasn't present but she has been too afraid to admit this fearing the consequences.)   She applied for residency in the mid-2000s and went through the process almost getting to end until she was informed that due to the 1989 deportation order it would not be granted. She was too scared to do anything else and that's where the situation is now.  My mom has been in the country now since returning from Guatemala for 25 consecutive years. I am 27 and a citizen that lived abroad for about a year after she had me. Currently she is married to an immigrant from Mexico. She has three children born in the United States including me aged 27, 25, and 17. She is still scared every day of being deported and asked me to please seek out any resources/advice I can regarding her particular situation to try and find options for her to become a legal resident.  I appreciate anyone and everyone's advice. Thank you so much.	No
So I received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/spDd1) in the mail today along with a settlement check in the mail today.  This is the very first I've heard of a law suit against DeVry for fraudulent advertising.  I attended DeVry from 2010-12 and incurred significant student loans but never graduated.  The loan in question is actually in default and it would be absolutely amazing for my life if I could get out of paying it back.  That probably makes me sound like a horrible human being but I'll live with it if I can get out from underneath that mountain of debt.  I went to [the mentioned website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) but I really don't understand if I qualify or not.  If anyone could advise I'd greatly appreciate it.	No

Hello!  So about a few years ago my parents house in Texas got foreclosed on.   Recently my mom was contacted by someone who had been looking for her for a while. (She had a change of name) They sent her papers and said there was a surplus from the sell of the house.   The papers kind of look legit.   They said there is around $15k that my parents will receive. They just need to file these papers by the end of August.   They sent her: *An additional notice of surplus funds from trustee's sale *Statement of claim to surplus funds *A W9  I was unsure of what to do next.   1.) Is this a real thing and not a scam? 2.) How will this affect them the next time they file for taxes? 3.) Is there anything else I should know/look into?   Thanks so much for your help!! 	No
I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back. Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this. After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time. By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything. I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts. Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?	No
Long time lurker, first time poster, so please excuse any formatting mistakes or anything.  Basically, back in June 2015, my dad was tight on money, so to help him out, my gf and I decided to purchase his 2011 Nissan Murano off of him. She got an auto loan to pay the car for approx $15,000. This mean my gf would have a total of two cars, an Infiniti Sedan, and now a Nissan Murano SUV. Every time we approached him to sign over the title and registration, he claimed he was too busy and stuff (we opened a restaurant together). On our off days, he was always wanting to stay home and do his own thing instead of just signing it over, and he would sometimes get mad when we bugged him about it. This all happened in NJ. We currently posses the only copy of the title, but it is in my dad's name.  Fast forward to about Feb 2017, we got into a series or arguments that basically ended in me and gf moving from NJ to CA. As stated before, the 3 of us (Gf, myself, and dad) opened a moderately successful restaurant in NJ, but the my dad was essentially emotionally abusing us throughout the course of the restaurant (calling us worthless/names constantly, yelling at us all the time, throwing things near us to scare us). We could no longer deal with it, so we packed our bags and moved to CA, and took the Infiniti as the car to road trip in. We finally got to CA in April 2017, and we realized we still haven't gotten the title or registration transferred to my gf's name. We are still paying the auto loan for the Nissan (loan under her name), and the Nissan Murano is still with my dad back in NJ. We obviously live in CA now, so we can't just take the car, and we would prefer not to speak to him, but will do so if it benefits us financially.  I sent him an email about a month ago telling him he needs to transfer the title and registration to her name, or he needs to take over the loan payment. He did not respond.   Right now, as it stands, these are the issues:  1.) We are paying for a car that we do not possess (we are in CA and the car is in NJ).  2.) Dad is currently using our car for his own work/personal use (He is in NJ using the car).  3.) We are paying for the auto loan that is under our name. We took out that auto loan to purchase the Nissan Murano from my dad.  The possible solutions that I would like to happen would be:  1.) We are able to bring the car to CA, and preferably sell it just to pay off the auto loan  OR  2.) He takes over the loan payment.  I am not too comfortable on letting him take over the loan payment as he has abused his power in the past, and he is the type of individual to not pay the loan just to ruin my gf's credit.  OTHER INFORMATION:  He currently owns the restaurant that me, my gf, and him worked on together (he financed, we put in sweat equity, no pay for 1.5 years, but that's another issue). He definitely has the money to either purchase the car back OR purchase another car of his own. We just do not want to be stuck with a payment for a car that we do not have. When we finally get the car, we would most likely sell it to pay back the loan.  My questions to the readers are:  1.) What would be the best route to obtain the registration?  2.) How would we transfer the name of the title and registration to my gf's name?  3.) How would we get possession of the car?  4.) Is there anyway to punish my dad for his actions? Will there be any punishment on our end for being unable to transfer the title and registration to our names?  Thank you all so much!	No
I posted a few months ago about the city shutting my building down. Well I found out that wasnt the case after calling the city inspector my self. Apparently there where no permits pulled by the contractor the owner hired for the initial renovation of the building, so none of the wiring or Hvac had been in inspected or was up to code. Once the tenants found out, everyone left but me since I had no where to go. I never paid rent for the last two months, fast forward to today the land lord comes by  saying I need to pay or get out even though no corrections have been made yet to fix anything. What do i do or who do I contact about this?	No

So I recently bought a trailer from a guy here in New Jersey. The guy that I bought it from bought it brand new recently but never used it or registered. I have the certificate of origin, a receipt, and a notarized bill of sale. The problem is the certificate of origin has the place it was bought from name on it and the bill of sale has the guy I bought from name on it. I go to Dmv and they said I can not register because the guy I bought it from needs to register it first basically so they can collect the tax on it. The other problem is the guy I bought the trailer from wants it back all of a sudden. So even if I went with him to Dmv and had him register it then he could technically say oh that's my trailer and try and say I stole it. Not really sure what to do here. Don't really want to have to give this thing back because I bought it as a package that came with some other stuff too and it would be hard to separate everything.	No
We got a notice from our village about being required to cut down a dead tree. The tree is in between our house and our neighbor's house, and we are 90% sure it's on our neighbor's property. It's definitely dead and needs to come down.   The notice said we could either cut it down by a certain date or provide proof (a plat of survey) that the tree is not on our property. We don't have a plat of survey since our home was a short sale.   The thing is it costs ~$1000 to get the tree removed or about $500 to get a survey done. We've called the village and a few other leads and no one has an old survey of our land. Neighbor has been unresponsive in requests for a survey of his land.   My question is, is it really our burden to prove whose tree it is? If it went to court, would the judge make us either cut the tree or get a survey or would he make the village get a survey to prove it's on our property?	No
"So I recently have had a situation arise with my place of living. Would be extremely helpful if someone could take a look at my situation who might have knowledge with leases and lease agreements and agreements made over places of living.  So since 2014 I have been living in the same apartment with a room mate. He has been significantly longer than I have. However we are in the same boat in this issue.  So, as of April 1 2017 our lease has been up or done. Normally we resign our lease no issues. This year however as the date was approaching we brought it up a time or two and finally when we went to pay rent for the month of April, there was no lease presented to us. Instead we were told ""Dont worry guys its fine, your on for another year"" without us actually signing anything. We leave our April rent payment both a little uneasy but take our property manager on their word and figure we will get it a week or 2 later. So we mention the lease and needing to resign it multiple times and we keep hearing ""dont worry guys your on for the same agreement no problem"". This has been going on since April all the way to yesterday July 11th.  Keep in mind we've been asking for the lease to resign on it weekly for this whole 3 and a half month period, while paying the amount of rent we did each month for 2016 and were being told ""your good for another year, do not worry guys"". We heard this over and over again from our property manager.  As of yesterday July 11th we are now being told by our property manager our lease is in fact not good and we are not ok and we were right to be worrying this whole time. They are now telling us the owner/landlord (who we have not met, been giving contact info for, or even heard over the phone) wants to raise our rent and have us resign the lease asap. This aggressive move leaves us in between a rock and a hard place. We either resign the lease and in August start paying a Significantly higher rate of rent or move out by the end of the month.  Is this something that they can legitimately do, withholding our lease from us for over a 3 month period while telling us verbally our agreement is solid and we should not worry, then flip the situation on us and say ""Resign the lease or gtfo"". Do we have an recourse in this to say this is not right?  I also want to mention a few things. My room mate who has lived in this place far longer than I have and has a good relationship as I do with the property manager, and we have always paid rent on time, and fixed what we could around the apartment including wear and tear such things like bathroom vent fans, and other minor issues. We have worked with the property manager to get compensated for some of the work we have done to keep the apartment nice and in good conditions. We have not done anything to result in us being undesirable tenants, this is simply a matter of a greedy landlord trying to get more money.  However I also need to point out that because of the age of the building and the refusal to fix roof leaks (for multiple winter seasons) on part of the owner, my room mate has black mold which has been photographed and shown to the property manger and still nothing has been done about it.  Giving what I have typed above. Is there anything we can do. Last of all we live in Summit County Colorado. People who rent dont seem to have many rights here in this county, however this situation giving the verbal BS we were told and the withholding of the lease, followed by this force to resign a new a lease (nearly 4 months into what should be an active lease from April), does not seem legit to me. Please help. What can we do?"	No
Long story short, lived here 7 years, getting ready to build a privacy fence.  Got an overhead shot of the property lines from the bank and my lot extends 6 feet past where my neighbor believes (I assume) the line is.  He has 2 sheds, 30' fence, and 2 feet of a driveway extension in this zone.  Main question is in what order should I call a lawyer, get it surveyed, and contact my neighbor about negotiating?  The total area of this oversight is about 1000 square feet, or about 6% of my total property.	No
Not sure what to do. He was supposed to drop off the keys to me yesterday, and instead texted me that he would be returning my deposit because his partners had decided to sell the house and they are now in escrow. I mentioned legal action, which I cannot afford, and he didn't care and told me not to threaten him. On Tuesday I will now be homeless with an entire apartment worth of stuff with no plave to go. What is my best option here?	No
"Ill try to make this short,  Found a bedbug (confirmed it is a bedbug). Told our apartment complex right when we found it (Friday 8/4). They are telling us a exterminator will come to make an ""inspection"" on Tuesday 8/8. And told us that we will be charged for the whole ordeal.  The charge I can fight on my own I know they are 100% in the wrong there, however do they have a legal obligation to react faster to the bedbugs? They are giving those bastards 4 extra days to party and feed off of us. Also if its only an ""Inspection"" they have more days to feed off us!  Couldnt find it with my google skills, anyone have any experience?  Thank you,"	No
A buyer purchased a week of our time share via eBay back in July 2017 for travel this March 2018, and then couldn‚Äôt find cheap flights to get down there. She has been harassing us to get her money back since then when the posting had said no refunds.  She disputed through eBay, but their policy (rightfully so) doesn‚Äôt support ‚Äúbuyers remorse‚Äù or ‚Äúinadequate research before making a purchase‚Äù. She then disputed through PayPal, saying that she didn‚Äôt receive her purchase at all - when we had all the confirmations as well as her emails and texts saying that she received the confirmation, but just couldn‚Äôt find flights and wanted her money back for that reason. PayPal ruled in our favor, but now she‚Äôs disputing with PayPal again through a chargeback with her credit card issuer.  What does this mean? What legal options do we have to ensure that she‚Äôs unable to receive her money back for the non-refundable purchase?	No

Hi all, I am not directly involved, the guy was an ex from 15 years ago who went to jail for a terrible thing against his now ex wife, got out on a technicality, initiated contact with me and over a 6 month period threatened repeatedly to harm her family. I was asked to submit the proof by a mutual friend to police and I did. Ex wife got restraining order and seeking a harassment charge. He did 3 months in jail waiting on trial, and was released last week as trial date was pushed back into next month. His sentencing guidelines for the new charge are 1-3 months of jail time, credit time served. Confirmed with prosecutor's office, that there will be no jail time and they can offer me NO protection order, nothing. Basically they just want me to testify so they can slap him with a felony that will prohibit his job search and he can put blame on me.   I have a baby, no time off work, no reliable transportation to cross a mountain pass to GET to this trial 4 hours away... this is all so irritating. Should I be getting a lawyer to try to get out of this? CAN I get out of this? They have no ability to skype, legal assistant says they want witnesses present to jury can read body language.... I feel like Im being used here for nothing and they cant protect me and I just need some advice man. Can I get out of this?	No
"So there is a guy who for this story i will call ""Tyrone"" who grabed my girlfriend (19F) as she was at the drinkstation at Mcdonalds. She and i used to work there and Tyrone was an aquantence, but without warning today he grabed her, im wondering what we should do. I am going to try my best to get her to file a police report but aside from that what should we do? I belive that it was caught on tape because there is a camera over that area. The people who own this Mcdonalds have covered for an employee in the past who was accused of sexual harassment, so we are not expecting much sympathy from them. I am willing to hire a lawyer for an hour or two to send a threatening letter to the owners, ideally i would like for this guy (he might be a minor, like 16,17,18) to face criminal charges and to lose his job. If you have any questions please let me know, sorry if this is not well put together i am just upset right now."	No
"Hi legaladvice crowd,  I met with an estate planning lawyer recently, and she drafted up a will, power of attorney, etc. that I am currently reviewing.  I am somewhat naive about how all this works, but could you kindly let me know what is ""typical"" or standard practice for Trusts?  -----------------------------------  * For the trust itself, once it is set up, how is money put into it?  Is money transferred from all of our accounts into a single account in the trust?  What about stocks that we own in brokerage accounts?  Our house? Is the executor/trustee required to sell these and have cash, or are they just transferred into an account owned by the trust?  * The Will indicates that all interest earned on the principal within the trust is to be distributed each year to the beneficiaries. Is this normal?  Why would it not just accrue?  Do I want a 10 year old receiving tens of thousands of dollars each year?  For background, my wife and I have one child (a 2 year old).  If we both pass away, the trust would be set up and money distributed in three installments when our daughter reaches certain ages. Estate right now is about $3 million once you take into account life insurance proceeds.  I do plan on asking follow-up questions to our attorney, but wanted to try to make them sound somewhat knowledgeable!  many many thanks, GR"	No
Hey all! I've recently started an NBA blog. I'm currently writing posts to fill up the site before I begin to promote it a little bit, and, I use images (which don't belong to me) in posts. My parents have mentioned that this might get me into some legal trouble, but I wouldn't think so as I don't profit off the blog.  A lot of NBA YouTubers use images such as the ones I use on my website. As well, many use real footage of the NBA. These are monetized videos with hundreds of thousands of views. If they never get into trouble for using the material, is there any reason I would?  I'm planning on getting this site to be fairly big (I have the ability to promote the site pretty well, so there's a decent chance it can get pretty popular -- that sounds kinda braggy, I don't mean it in that way though haha). I figured I should mention that because I'm guessing it's a bigger issue legality wise if the website is popular.  Thanks so much for any help! Feel free to ask any questions in case I left anything important out.	No
I am moving out in purchased a home and my landlord has attempted to come in to show my apt. I gave them a list of days and times that are good because I work 12 hour overnights at a hospital. They tried to come in and I had the hotel lock on. They said they were going to come in even though I was sleeping and they wouldn't enter the apt. Their lawyer called me now and stated if I have the hotel lock on again or don't let them in whenever they want I will be evicted. What can I do ?	No
"Hello, looking for some advice about the probate process for a small estate in the state of Arkansas. I've read up on what to do but I am still confused. Trying to understand if I need to go through probate court, or if this can just be solved through Arkansas's small estate process. I feel like this should be straightforward, so hopefully someone has some answers or recommendations.   My mother passed away last month. My father passed away 11 years ago, and I only have one (younger) brother.  I am named in her will as the executor of the will. My brother and I are listed in the will as beneficiaries, splitting any assets 50/50.   Her assets that are part of the estate are as follows: Checking account &amp; savings account, together totalling about $3K 11 year old van which she didn't owe money on, worth $1K at most  Assets that have my brother and I named as beneficiaries (so they shouldn't count towards in the probate process, right?): Life insurance policy for about $40K IRA account, about $30K 401K account, about $7K Another savings account, has about $200  Debts: Student loans, at least $20K Chase credit card, about $2K Not aware of others but will be running a credit report soon to confirm  From what I've read, her estate qualifies as a small estate in Arkansas, since it's worth less than $100K. So it should bypass probate court, and I simply need to file an affidavit of small estate. However, on the form for the affidavit of small estate, one of the stipulations for filing as a small estate is ""There are no unpaid claims or demands against the decedent or the decedent's estate."" This is where I am confused. Chase wants to make a claim against the estate. If they make a claim, her assets are enough to cover the amount of their claim...so I assume I would need to pay them from the estate. However, I can't get the funds from her bank account to pay the claim without filing this affidavit. So how the heck am I supposed to pay them? Do I have to go through the probate court simply because there is a claim against her estate? I don't believe I should pay it out of my own pocket, it's not my debt. So it should come out of the estate. I'm just so confused about what to do next."	No
Hi all,  My parents are currently having a problem, and I was wondering if there is any legal recourse.  There are several trees that are on my neighbors property. A significant part of each tree overhanged onto my property, and the trees both provided significant privacy and shaded the property for most of the day. The power company came yesterday and cut down those trees completely. We now have the lovely view of the trailer park behind my house, without so much as a bush in between us. Additionally, my parents are concerned that their property value (and they're trying to sell) is going to go down, because you can now see the aforementioned trailer park quite clearly, and there's much less privacy and shade on our property.    My question- is there any legal recourse for my parents? I'm guessing not, since the trees weren't even planted on their property, but I figured it's something worth exploring.	No
So I was randomly home in the middle of the day on Tuesday because my dad was in town. How often or How much the neighbor flys his drone over my house I have no idea, I work 10-12hrs a day 5-6days per week. I live on 1 acre out in the country (unincorporated county) and all the houses are spread out so from no where on my property can you see any other houses at all, very private and secluded which is why I bought it. There is a great expectation of privacy where my home is, this is not cookie cutter track homes in the suburbs. I have a small parcel, but all nighbors are 5-25 acres.   So I know which house it came from as I watched it go back and land, but I had to leave to go back to work immediately and couldn't go talk to him also I was very angry and wanted to cool off first.  He hovers this thing directly over my house and goes down about 25 feet off the ground (10ft above my house). I'm outside with my phone out taking video of him taking video of me.  It was a really nice expensive drone. I wanted to shoot it down (shotgun obviously, rifle is unsafe and travels too far), but can't legally because you have to be 300ft from a property line to legally shoot a gun . The property is perfect square and is 200ft by 200ft.   Can I legally take it down with a sling shot or pellet gun?   Yes he'll come looking for it, but I have a key coded gate with 6 ft privacy fences and he won't be getting in at all. Dude is seriously invading the privacy of me and my wife.   He'll then file a civil lawsuit against me for the cost of the drone? Which he might win?  Can I file a restraining order against him for the drone shit? Should I go talk to him?	No
I'll start with that I'm living in Atlanta, GA. I moved here and have been living in this apartment since June. Last week the apartment complex was taken over by new management. Over the weekend I got a letter stating that starting in September my flat rate water/sewer bill is gone and in it's place will be a $46 sewage, pest control, trash, and management fee + water charge based on consumption.   The issue is that in my lease I signed for the $xx flat rate water/sewage fee and the rest was just included in the rent. Is it legal for the new management company to charge this new rate or are they breaking the lease?	No
I know, I know. We (my boyfriend and I)should have called the police. We took his information and thought that was enough. We called the police and they told us that since we both left there scene there is little we can do now. They informed us that if there is an agreement made on site it becomes a civil matter.  We have pictures of the damage, of him in the driver's seat of a car that doesn't belong to him without a license. We took his information but he didn't take ours.  It seems like this is a fairly common thing to do, just take the other person's information and charge them with the bill, I've done it before. There has to be something we can do in the case of him backing out of this verbal agreement. Any advice is appreciated.	No
Hello Everyone,   The title says it in a nutshell. I have lived here since April and it has been ok in that time, but I've suspected there might be mold, which is why I called my landlord asking how that would be handled. They informed me that they have never tested for Radon or mold, and that if I wanted testing it would have to come out of my end since they wouldn't pay for it.   What are my options? The lease agreement doesn't say anything about testing or anything on this subject.   Thank you all in advance.	No

I have to remove everything from my kitchen counters and cabinets and they will be tearing it apart for 5-7 business days. My stuff will have to be laid out on the living room floor, and that's where they will be putting my fridge as well for the renovation. So far they have told me my pets have to be removed from the apartment for at least one of the days, and they can't tell me which day that will be. I work 14 hour shifts leaving at 630 in the morning and getting home at 930 at night. I am expected to kennel my cat for at least a day and I will not be compensated for that, not to mention pick up and drop off times aren't usually that early or that late. I also will not have a kitchen and will be forced to eat out. They haven't confirmed it but the bathroom will certainly be renovated as well to match the kitchen the way it currently does. They are making the argument that I won't be compensated because I will be getting upgrades in the apartment for free. I never asked for these upgrades and no where in my lease does it say that this was a possibility. Is there any way to fight this? Is this really something that's typical for apartment complexes to do? Should I just take it in the chops and suffer through this? Thanks in advance for any help and advice.	No
"Hi r/legaladvice!   I live in a multi unit apartment complex in California. There is a cockroach infestation in our building. There are cockroaches in our bed, refrigerator, toilet, all counters, drawers, our furniture, and more. Our neighbors below and next to us also have infestations.  We sent written notice to the office of the complex June 28 for the cockroaches to be eradicated. We also requested either separate accommodations or to mutually end our lease due to the level of infestation. The office refused our request and said they would send out pest control to spray for 3 or more weeks to remove the cockroaches, and we would have to live in the apartment throughout treatment.  We have not been living at the apartment since June 28 due to being unable to store food, cook, or sleep without cockroaches crawling on us. As of Tuesday, they have sprayed the apartment 4 times. We visited the apartment today and the cockroaches are still (alive) everywhere. The pest control only sprays the kitchen, bathroom, and cabinets in the hallway. They have made no effort to spray the bedroom (where a lot of the cockroaches are) and the entire living room.  We have continued to pay rent.  The complex is aware that we haven't been living in the apartment. From research, I've seen that 30 days in CA is ""reasonable time"" to fix an issue. I wanted to know what next steps we could take to solve this issue. Pest control told our next door neighbor that they recommend tenting the complex, but the management refuses ""due to turnover"". We have already had Code Enforcement come to the complex and issue a violation to the office. We have also given letters to all of our neighbors in the building with Code Enforcements info/contact information for the officer assigned to the case for them to call and complain.  I'm wondering what time frame would be required for us to be able to break the lease without penalty. The conditions are uninhabitable (and we haven't lived there in almost a month) and we do not want to continue playing rent on an apartment that is not healthy to live in."	No
I have a two bed one bath rented out in a multi family complex in Alameda. The rent was originally at $1350 and I raised it to $1700 in August 2016 without being aware that there was a rent control ordinance in effect. All rent increases above 5% had to go through a certain procedure, and because I was not aware of it, failed to comply with it then. However, I recently found out about it and was planning to follow the proper procedures for this year's rent increase. I wanted to increase the rent to $2000, taking into note that the apartment was not refurnished, as most 2 bedrooms in Alameda are at least $2200. However, because I did not comply with the procedures the first time, I have to refund back the difference in rent to the tenant as the rent increase was invalid. Therefore, I would have to pay the tenant $4200. And they have determined that the rent increase should be from $1350 to $1500 for this year. What can/should I do now to ensure the least losses?	No
Hi Reddit Law,  My dad is a contractor and recently finished tile work on a new house. The owner did not want to pay the balance and my father threatened to break the tiles throughout the house with a hammer. My gut is that this isn't legal but I'm not really sure, it is his tiles and setting materials after all and this guy hasn't paid.	No

"So, bare with me as I write this! My girlfriend has a degree in Film/Communications and roughly about a year n half ago one of her old professors came to her asking if she'd like to help edit a local man's film. She met with the man and all the material was shit, she agreed to try and edit and make it salvageable. She was able to finish it and he was able to air it a local arts theater about 8 months ago. The original agreement was for them to pay her ($250) on the spot at the airing, well that never happened. The man and his family started making excuses about how they wanted some stuff changed before paying her. At this point she was already frustrated, but agreed to help out. Well several months go by of her trying to meet with them and more excuses or them canceling on her. The last meeting consisted of her and his parents, where they basically tried to tell her they weren't paying her anything until they were 100% satisfied with the material and they were expecting her to hand over what she had, so at that point I refused to let her hand anything over until they paid what they owed. After that meeting and one more failed attempt to meet with her they just went silent and at this point she just basically wrote it off as a loss instead of trying to go out of her way to pursue it. Well it's been about 5 or 6 months since and now suddenly he decided to text her telling her how he'd making a new movie and how he wants to pay her. Well she works  50 hour weeks and doesn't have the time to meet and really doesn't even want to meet in person, so she responded letting him know she' doesn't have the time, but would be more than willing for him to send her a payment or a check in the mail and then she would send him the Flash drive with all the data and movie. Suddenly he went from ""hey Sam"" to ""I'll just take to court Sam. I don't do my business like that and that's that.""   Sorry for the long winded paragraph, but basically I'd like to know what kind of legal actions we should take and what to do from here. We're right on the border of Michigan and Ohio and if we were to go to court it would be probably be Ohio if that helps any!"	No
Hi there,  Few days ago, I received a letter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stating in that I had used the toll road twice in locations in Massachusetts in which that wasn't me. The requested payment was $2.60. Even though the amount was very little, I do not want to pay for the amount for something I didn't do.   So, I started googling on what I should do because I was afraid this was some sort of scam. I started reading articles about a lady who didn't know she was being charged and ended up owing $49,000 as a result. I started worrying about what I should do to resolve this matter so it doesn't come back to me again.  I apologize if this is not the right post for this subreddit. Could you please guide me to the correct one if that's the case? Thank you for taking your time to read my post. :)	No
"&gt; Just wondering what legally I can do. I found out tonight after work that my apartment requires me &amp; my cat &amp; dog vacate my apartment mon from 9 am - 6pm. And that I ""deep clean"" my kitchen and bathroom, as well as clear out my cabinets and counter tops and have everything pushed from my wall or be faced with a $100 fine. Problem is, I'm single and alone in Texas - no boyfriend or family and I work in the service industry. I work from 9am - 11pm Saturday &amp; Sunday leaving me NO time to clean OR find accommodations. I have no clue where I'm supposed to go on Monday all day especially with a cat.  Im hourly and broke and cannot afford any extra expenses this month and they gave me zero time to figure something out. What are my rights?! Can I make them put me up in a pet friendly hotel?"	No
I'm in a dispute with my former landlord. Long story short, my lawyer send him a letter that he never addressed.  I prodded him about it and he just now asked that I have it forwarded on to his lawyer. The letter gives him 7 days to act, so there is a little time sensitivity to it.  My question is, is it my responsibility to have the letter forwarded on to his lawyer after he received it? Or should I tell him it's not my job to do that?	No
"I moved into a townhome back in May with my three year old son. The company that owns the property is a nonprofit and the leasing office is responsible for two other properties nearby. The day I signed the lease, I did a move-in inspection with one of the women who worked in the leasing office. I wrote down all the items that needed to be repaired/replaced (weather stripping on the front door, broken porch light, washer/dryer inoperable, bathroom door off the hinges, etc.) and signed that as well. I really needed a place as my son and I were essentially homeless, and rent here is cheap being that the property is owned by a non-profit company. Since, in my opinion, none of the needed repairs made the home uninhabitable, I moved in anyway figuring they would be fixed later.   I've called the maintenance hotline multiple times, and they have come to my apartment to repair a leak so they are aware of what needs doing around here but every time I ask when are they going to fix my washer/dryer I get an arbitrary time frame (""the manufacturer technician will be there soon"" ""some time next week"", etc) but he never comes. I last spoke to maintenance two weeks ago but the last time they were out here was a month ago. At this point it seems they're either completely ignoring my requests or prioritizing other units over mine. Where should I go from here?  tl;dr I need a handful of repairs done on various things throughout my apartment that maintenance hasn't taken care of since I moved in back in May. What do?"	No
This might be stupid but I'm just covering my bases.  A telemarketer called me on behalf of the Association of State Troopers of America or something like that asking for a donation. He was nice, and I figured why not help the police and said I would send 20 bucks. He got my mailing address to send the form.   I hang up and google the number, apparently they're a huge telemarketer known for scams, fake collections, selling insurance, etc. I'd rather just not donate now but since I agreed to, can I be held liable?	No
There was a pipe leakage in my apartment. Nothing of mine was damaged, however the carpet and walls got a little wet and last night they had to bring in very large dehumidifiers. I couldn't sleep in my own room, since the dehumidifiers are noisy and blocked me from being able to get into my bathroom, so I was told I could sleep in the bedroom in my apartment that is currently empty. Note that I pay rent for MY bedroom, not any other bedroom in the unit.   Apparently, the dehumidifiers will have to stay in the apartment for at least a couple more days. However since nobody from maintenance works on the weekend, I will have to wait until next Monday AT LEAST to have my bedroom back.   I'm sick of this. I just want to sleep in my own bed, but I can't. I've had it with this management and I want out. Would this be anywhere close to constructive eviction?	No
"I am located in New York.  Long story short, about 9 years ago I ended up damaging someone's property (twice!) as a result of two farming equipment accidents. As a result of it, I agreed to pay them $15K to settle their civil cases against me. We signed and notarized the repayment agreement, in which I was supposed to pay a certain amount per month.  A variety of family problems were present and I really didn't have the money, so the person specifically put into the contract that they could grant me reprieves from the agreed upon payment schedule if necessary, but that they had the right to rescind those reprieves at any time for any reason and have me continue upon the normal payment schedule. Basically, if I didn't have money to pay them in August, they could say don't worry about it pay me in September or something like that. After signing the agreement, I had a variety of unforeseen things happen to me, and the person told me don't worry about paying it back right now. I basically never brought it up to them again, moved and hadn't heard about it since. About two months ago, I received a certified letter in the mail from an attorney stating that ""any abeyance in payment is hereby revoked"" and that payment would be expected the following month at the law firm's address, as well as a copy of the signed contract. Having consulted online resources, I determined that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and that the contract was well over its effective time and ignored the letter. I just got a second letter from him stating that I was now in default of the agreement and they were prepared to ""file an action"" against me in county court and that according to the agreement and that I was responsible for attorney's fees, etc. unless I immediately corrected the default. I still have not responded. Am I right that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and thus their agreement is worthless?"	No
About a year ago, I moved in with my husband, who already lived at the apartment complex he was at for a year with two other roommates by the time I moved in. We recently got our own place, and just received the final invoice from the old apartment.   Unfortunately, the move out process was a bitch. My husband and I somehow got stuck cleaning not just the entire common room, but both of our roommates rooms after they had all of their shit out (vacuuming, dusting, etc). During this, we noticed our one roommate's carpet had a huge black circle from where he sat at his desk with shoes on. We tried to clean it as best as we could, but it was still pretty bad. Lo and behold, the invoice had a $1000 carpet replacement charge. We're still working on contacting the apartment for more details as to what specifically caused that charge, but I'm anticipating it being having to replace our one roommate's apartment, and subsequently replaced all of the carpeting in the apartment.   If the carpet replacement was due to an irreparable stain in one bedroom, how can the other people go about not getting screwed over financially? While I'm referring to my husband and I as well as our other roomie that didn't cause the stain, I'm especially concerned for us since they'll want to split the cost four ways, meaning my husband and I will have to dish out half of the cost of replacement for another roommate's mess, while he only pays 1/4th of the cost.   I have a post-cleaning video of the common area and our bedroom, where the carpets look just fine, but nothing of the other two roommate's rooms.   I'm not sure how to approach this situation. Any advice would be appreciated!	No
"I own an apartment on a leasehold basis (999 years), and also have an equal monetary share in the buildings freehold, as part of the Ltd. Management Company that is the freeholder.  Myself and partner have lived here as private renting tenants, until purchasing the property at the end of 2016.  During own residence here we have owned a cat. This has never been raised has an issue.  Recently a neighbour (and also the Company Director) has raised that our lease forbids us to ""keep any domestic pets...without written consent and discretion of the landlord"" ...(it's also worth noting, the this chap really dislikes animals)  No other neighbour has raised an issue, and we take care of any time the cat 'spoils' the surrounding grounds.  We are looking to be as legally solid with this issue as necessary.  So, considering I am a shareholder of the management company upholding this lease, what are my options in dealing with it?  Is a change to the lease possible/likely? Am I going to be legally/financially shafted? Or (considering my partner would never get rid of the cat) would it be better just to ignore the problem and hope it all blows over?  As always, Thanks Reddit."	No
I was laid off the week of Christmas. Filed for unemployment, Tuesday 13/26/17. Called MARVIN, Monday 1/8/18. Christmas was a paid holiday, so we have to claim it when we call MARVIN. I haven't been paid yet, because my employer hasn't provided paperwork to the state regarding holiday pay. When we get laid off and don't get holiday pay, everything goes through just fine Everytime we get holiday pay during a layoff, we can count on not getting paid right away.  Is my employer breaking any laws? What can I do to try and get paid in a timely manner?	No
"The title wasn't very clear, I know.  Allow me to explain.  Please bare with me.  I am desperate for advice here.   I live in a duplex in a region with relatively high crime.  The lease agreement for myself and the other tenant in the house identifies that a background check is required for all tenants and that anyone who is residing in the home for more than ""X"" amount of days (can't remember the exact number but its about 2 weeks) must be processed through the background check and be signed on as a tenant of the home.  From day 1, about 5 months ago, the other tenant's boyfriend has been living here unofficially.  I have observed the trends of their schedule, to an extent, from my outdoor security camera pointed at the driveway/garage, and identified that the boyfriend does not appear to have a real job and spends nearly every hour of the day at home.  I have spoken with in briefly on only a couple occasions and he has a concerning demeanor.  I honestly don't want to judge a book by its cover, but living in an area like this, I can't help but believe he has a criminal record.  Why else would he not be put on the lease?    This next part might sound silly, but bare with me.  In our communal basement, which is where the washer/dryer are, I find several large piles of clothes regularly and I believe the boyfriend is running some sort of laundry business out of the basement.  Why is this a problem you ask?  The laundry is run constantly, the water bill for the house is split 50/50 for both apartments in the duplex, one set of laundry units he uses is hooked directly to the electricity for my apartment.  So he's living here illegally and is running a business out of the house with the help of my utilities.  I'll just list a few more things before getting to the point.  The boyfriend (or his girlfriend who is on the lease) does not contribute to the yard work, they smoke pot in the house, they smoke cigarettes in the house (violation of the lease), and they use a grill (also a lease violation).    My girlfriend moved in with me a couple months ago and has been worried about the other tenants ever since.  She is very afraid of the guy.  We have heard them yell at each other and we are we both uncomfortable living in the same house as them.  I have expressed concern throughout the last 5 months or so to the landlord and he has not taken action to investigate the boyfriend.  Note that this is an amateur landlord and this is his only rental property.  I believe he is also afraid to approach them.  I believe that because our landlord won't take action to justify the violations of our neighbor, he is essentially violating the lease agreement as well.    I want to break this lease without repercussions.  I worry that the boyfriend could be dangerous and I'm also fed up with my utilities being high due to his laundry business.  Does it appear that I have a case to break my lease?"	No
My wife and I are in the middle of short sale that we started in December 2016. To clarify we are selling our house and moving in with her parents. My aunt died about two weeks ago and we just found out that her house has my name and my sisters name on the deed. Apparently it was my aunts wish that me and my sister sell the house and split the money. My sister is currently in the process of getting the house ready to sell. I have a couple pf questions: Will this in anyway affect the short sale? Do my wife and I have to inform our lawyer and real estate agent that I may be getting money from this house? Can my mortgage company put a lien on my aunts house and or take all of the proceeds from the sale of the house? If I have my name removed from the deed will there be any legal repercussions? If anymore details are needed please ask. Thanks, Al from Maryland	No
"Hello! So here is what happened:    Back in April I paid $250 to have a self-employed stylist (she goes to people houses to do hair) to give me a ""brazilian blow-out"". For those of you who dont know what that is, here is the definition:    Brazilian hair straightening (also called Breezilian straightening, Brazilian Keratin Treatment, BKT, Brazilian Blowout, Escova Progressiva, Keratin Cure) are a semi-permanent hair straightening method done by temporarily sealing a liquid keratin and a preservative solution into the hair with a hair iron.   Typically this is supposed to last 10-12 weeks.   Well I paid her for this service, and awoke the next morning to discover my hair was a giant frizzy poofy mess (my baseline). I have had these done before in the past at salon's so I knew what to expect (not this); this was the first time I had used this individual.   I contacted her via facebook, as that was how we were communicating, informing her that her treatment did not work whatsoever and that I either want a refund or a treatment that actually works.   She blocked me.   I attempted to contact her via telephone and got no response.   Seeing as I didn't want to pay $250 for someone to shampoo and straighten my hair for an evening and given that I attempted to get a refund from her, I contacted my bank to dispute the charge on the basis of not receiving services I should have. (Of note, there was no 'no refund' agreement with this individual)  The bank decided in my favor and returned the amount to my account.   She has now charged me $250 again, without my permission and without contacting me.   Where do I go from here? Thank you in advance!"	No
I'm working on remodeling a house. I tried to save a few bucks and had my friend out work on the electric. Well, it looks like she removed the meter to work on the panel. The electric company found out the meter was missing and turned off the power. I called the electric company to turn back on the power. They turned it on, but I think they took a pictures of the electric work.   She didn't get a permit and I'm worried about the electric company. What could happen to me for hiring her? What could happen to her? What should we do?  IN	No
We moved out from our previous apartment at the beginning of June. We just received our move out accounting on Friday 07/14/2017, after I had to call them multiple times and request it since we never received it in the mail. They have already threatened to send us to collections if we don't pay.  They charged us $800 to replace the full apartment carpet due to pet damage. We were shocked by this. We are aware that our pet had a couple accidents in the living room and hallway, but we were surprised that it required replacement instead of cleaning.  They sent pictures of the damage and we understand and are willing to pay for replacement of the living room and hallway carpet, even though only two edges of the living room carpet had damage. Neither of the bedrooms have carpet damage because the pet was not allowed in the bedrooms. They are still charging us for full apartment carpet replacement. Can they do this?  I asked if there is anything in our lease that permits them to charge for undamaged carpet replacement and they gave a vague answer saying that if they didn't replace the full carpet, it would look patchy because the carpet was dyed in different batches. We appreciate any advice you can give. Thanks!	No
"Hey so I just found this sub and I've been having this question in my head for a long time. My last job, I was working about 55 hours per week yet still considered part time. On top of that, my boss would take all the hours over 40 (15 for example) and move it to the next week so I wouldn't get paid overtime. I was young and didn't really mind because i liked the place and I wasn't doing it for the money, I'm just a hard worker and I like to work. But I just told my mom the other day about it and she's like ""you should sue for all those hours."" Could I really sue for that?"	No
Hi there! I live in Colorado and have a question about a security deposit dispute I'm having with my landlord. Colorado law states that SDs must be returned within 30 days, unless the lease states another period, which can be no more than 60 days. My lease stated 60 days.   I contacted my landlord (a company that owns a bunch of apartment buildings) on day 71 after my lease ended, inquiring where my security deposit was, as I hadn't received it. The leasing manager told me that it had been mailed out 30 days ago, and gave me the address it was sent to, which was wrong. I double checked that I had given her the correct address, which I had, and I let her know that it was mistaken. She apologized for the clerical error and said they would write me a new check and send it out asap.   I finally received the check in the mail 85 days after my lease ended, and found that they had taken out $134 from a $500 security deposit, and did not provide an itemized list of the reasons.   I'm planning to write a 7 day demand letter, since a) they did not provide me a list of the deductions taken, which is illegal, and b) CO law states that if the landlord sends the SD after the 60 day period, they are not able to take any money out of it.  I'm hoping for some advice as to whether the above checks out. I'm particularly wondering if the fact that they sent out the check within the window, just to the wrong address, at their own error, in any way negates the fact that they sent it late, or whether the fact that I received it 85 days after moving out is all that matters. Thanks for reading and I'd appreciate any insight, this is my first time dealing with something like this.	No

Lets say that the citizen was kept there for, say, 24 hours with no charge whatsoever.   What is the emergency motion someone might file on his behalf in the 25th hour to effect his release?

"Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.  Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.  Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an ""online debit card"" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this ""online debit card"" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.  Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like ""what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc"" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.  Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.  It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.  It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.    I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...  I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn."	No
I paid my roommate, let's call them Blake, the $173.96 owed for my share of our hotel room for a convention through Venmo.  I was told that they did not receive this payment and asked to pay them in cash.  I (accidentally mixing up the amount slightly) paid them $176.93 in cash in front of three of our four other roommates.  I ended up leaving the room after one out of four nights, due to another roommate's hygiene issues; this is unrelated.  After the night I left, I asked for part of the hotel fee I paid back, as I had not stayed the full duration; I received a long, angry text not only denying my request for a partial refund, but also claiming that I should be paying a cancellation fee to Blake and their partner because I had left without consulting them.  After the convention, I contacted Venmo trying to get my initial payment back; they responded telling me that Blake themselves would have to email Venmo, as the payment had gone through.  How do I go about getting back my initial $173.96?	No
My mother-in-law has been living in a 3-unit building for a few years. She's always known that the place *probably* wasn't up to code but due to finances and disabilities did not have much recourse or any better living options.  This morning, she was visited by housing code enforcement and was told she has to leave today. The renters in the other unit have 30 days since their half wasn't as drastically off-code. It turns out that the units were made by splitting one unit into two; neither are up to code and the owner knew this, renting to them all anyway.  I know, obviously, my mother-in-law has to find a new place to live, but I was wondering if she had any legal recourse against her now ex-landlord for representing this as a habitable dwelling, or perhaps for her sudden forced removal (again stemming from his claiming it was a rentable/livable property)?	No
Hey all, ill keep this short. Cop pulled me over today, suspected pot in my car, I complied and cooperated fully. They searched my car and found a one hitter, as well as the roach to a joint. The officer threw the roach on the ground, and took the one hitter. He let me off with a warning. Are there any long lasting repercussions for insurance, criminal record, possible summons in the mail, etc? Im 23 and live in minnesota.	No
I have a friend who recently got pulled over in VA for speeding on a highway, and since it was over 80mph they also got a reckless driving charge, but rather than just a ticket they have to go to court. Would you recommend getting a lawyer to go with them or are they better off not paying a lawyer and dealing with it themselves?	No
"I'm late on rent, but the owner of the house says I have to leave now. I have every intention of paying rent when I get paid this week...but now I'm freaking out. He said ""be out tomorrow or I will make you get out"". I have that on a text from him. Yes I signed a lease, but now magically ""I don't have a lease"" "" we never agreed to the lease"". I have been living in this place for 4 months. My name is on the utilities bills, government letters, and it's the address on my DL.  I also have a recorded phone call of him saying that ""I don't have a lease so get out"".  I apologize for the poor wording or such but I'm losing my shit."	No
The home was owned by an old man who passed away.   We were told that there was no disclosure because he was old and lived alone and that the property was being sold as part of an estate sale.   We purchased the home and found some major problems, not that we didn't expect them. But when talking to neighbors they said that his son lived with him for the last two years. We also get mail, to this day, for the son.   So the son lived in the house and benefited from the sale, but didn't file the disclosure.  From what I gather from Michigan law, he was supposed to disclose. But he didn't.   What is my legal standing here?	No
I'm on mobile so hopefully this turns out okay.  So recently at my wife's job a couple of dishwashers started selling lsd. My wife was the assistant manager, she tried talking to the general manager about it but turns out she is buying it from them and wanted to sweep everything under the rug. Fast forward a few weeks.   At the end of Monday night my wife was cashing out her drawer at the end of her bartending shift. It's short. Alot of people were in the drawer that night and my wife is very good with her money. So naturally she's a little peeved about being the only one that had to cover it but she did it anyways. The general manager wanted to talk about it but my wife was over it at that point and left, resulting in a write up the next day.  That evening my wife and her general manager exchange some texts, basically my wife calling the general manager out about buying lsd from minors and allowing it to run rampant through the store, the general manager wanted to talk about this in person so my wife agreed but only on the conditions that there is a third party present, like the regional manager.   The regional manager texts my wife and says that a third party isn't required and she is being terminated for not agreeing to talk to her manager without a third party.   Is any of this legal? Aren't you entitled to a third party  being present in a situation like this? How in the hell is my wife the one being fired when there are people selling and buying acid on premises?  The regional manager says the GM has talked to her about the drugs and they are handling it, but I have the feeling that she is believing everything the GM is feeding her which certainly doesn't include that she has been buying and using acid.  Someone please help I have a feeling none of this is right and my wife was fired wrongfully.	No
"I signed up for a subscription service where you get online courses for a fix monthly price. On the sales page, the website owner states that subscribers will only be charged X, and that he is ""not able to charge more, and will only charge X""  It turned out that the price of the monthly subscription is X + VAT, and he only mentioned the monthly price without the VAT included, which is upsetting because this is in a country with the highest VAT rate in the world.  Now, on the checkout the price with VAT included was shown, but I didn't give it any thought because the seller said he will only charge X, and is not able to charge any more than X. X=price of subscription without VAT  Does this count as misleading people? Do I have a chance to make a chargeback through my bank? Purchased it on june 15th."	No
I live in a studio in Aurora, Illinois, with my two year old daughter and my landlord has refused to hire a professional company to address a roach infestation that he did not tell me about when I signed the lease. It's been two-three weeks since we last talked about the issue, and the City of Aurora inspectors have come to my unit and have said that they will send a letter to the landlord requiring him to contract professionals to deal with the issue. Am I legally allowed to withhold rent until he does so without punishment? I do not wish to live in my apartment anymore, but I don't believe he's willing to just let me go out of my lease without any kinda of penalty on my credit.	No

First post to this sub with a throwaway. Here's the story my mother passed away when I was nineteen in 2008. She had life insurance and our home was paid in full. I live with my two brothers, step-brother and step-father. It's a four bedroom house so there is plenty of room for everyone. I don't really speak to my step father except hello when I seem due to past issues, things used to be rough but now everyone just goes about there business. There is I'm ready to start my own life I'm 28 now. I love my home but unfortunately I can't say the same for the other people who live here. It's constantly messy because nobody cares. It's a free ride for them and they are taking advantage. I just wanted to provide a little backstory.  I've never seen a copy of the will and there is a trust fund set up. One of the trustees told me that I will not be able to receive my portion of money until my youngest brother is 25 and that's ten years from now. My question is there anyway for me to purse legal help so I can receive what I'm owed? I don't want to just leave my home and watch my step father take complete advantage of it.   I just want to know if I have even the slightest chance to pursue any thing.  Thank you.	No
"I just moved into an apartment in Michigan. When I was shown the apartment I noticed there were two AC units, I would not have selected an apartment without AC. Upon moving in neither units are working. One is an electrical problem with the wiring, the other just doesn't make cold air.   Upon talking to the property management they said they would try and repair the units but will not replace them if they are broken and can't be repaired. They said they don't have to as the lease says that AC is not included. The lease says the landlord must maintain the premises and all appliances (without listing which ones are included) and then under a section labeled ""Other Restrictions"" it says ""No Air Conditioners"" listed alongside other things such as ""No pets"", ""No washer/dryer"" and ""No waterbeds"". Obviously I interpreted this to mean no installing or bringing in your own AC unit as I already knew there was AC in the apartment. However they are claiming this means they don't have to replace it.   I'm waiting to see if it can be fixed before making a fuss but I want to know whether or not they legally do not have replace the unit. It's hot and it's frustrating as it just seems like they are trying to weasel their way out of spending the money."	No
I live in an apartment building and someone in the neighbouring building has an incredibly loud motorcycle. I live downtown in a major city, and next to both LRT and heavy rail train tracks so I am used to road noise, motorcycles, trains etc.. This is way beyond normal. I live on the third floor in a different building and him leaving is so loud I can't hear a TV over it.  Normally I am willing to just ignore annoying neighbours but this is a particular problem for me because I have a serious issue with tinnitus and the extreme loud roaring will trigger my ringing to be much worse. i should also note that I have poor hearing, and so if it is loud to me it must be worse to everyone else.  I called 311 and they advised to call the police non-emergency. I did that but the police seemed very reluctant to do anything (even come issue them a warning) because I did not want to give them my name and contact information. The reason I don't want to give that information is because I am fairly sure that the guy in question is some kind of skinhead or neo-nazi, and essentially i don't want to have problems with him.  My questions are:  Would anyone know if he is actually violating a noise ordinance (he comes and goes in the middle of the night fairly often)?   If him modifying the bike to be louder would be illegal (I am suspicious he has done this since the bike is so extremely loud)?  How I could get the police to take my complaint as credible without sharing contact info?   If anyone knew the consequences for the issue that would also be helpful (i.e. will he have to stop using the bike)?	No
Recently it came to my attention that the house next door to my mom may be going on the market. I'm interested in purchasing this property and listing it as a rental. I have a few questions.  *  If i intend to purchase the house with my brother and sister, should we form an LLC or some other business entity? Can an LLC purchase a home?  *  If my brother and sister and I all live in Los Angeles, but the House is in St. Louis what are the legal quirks that might arise from this sale?  *  If we do form some sort of business entity, would it be better to do so in Los Angeles or St. Louis?  Thank you for the advice.	No
Myself and two friends are currently renting a standalone home. Our problem is the main Air Conditioning unit has broken five times in the last month. We are only liable for replacing the filters. Our landlord claims our neglect is the cause of the unit malfunctioning. However my roommate is an Air Condition HVAC technician and knows the problem yet the landlord refuses to repair it do to not wanting to fix it. We are currently in violation of lease by having an immobile vehicle on the premises but have received no written document stating it needs to be removed. We would like to leave the said property as we only have 6 weeks remaining and I am disabled and cannot tolerate heat. Any and all suggestions are appreciated.	No
In Kansas, you receive a temporary paper driver's license when you go apply for one. It's supposed to take 10-14 days for them to mail the real thing, but it's taken longer than that. Are private persons and businesses required to accept the paper license as if it were the real thing?	No
"It's a long story, I'll do my best to keep it short. Back in March, I started renting a room in a house I found on CL (mistake #1). I came to find out from the other roommates that the ""landlord"", we'll call him D, wasn't actually the owner of the house, but the only person who's on the lease. The landlord is our next door neighbor. I also found out that D was in prison for insurance fraud, and has been in trouble for scamming and stealing in the past. I have no problems at all with any of the roommates (there are 5 of us right now), but the rest of them are all having problems with D right now, and a couple of them are threatening to move out. I was talking with one of the roomies roday, and she told me the tenant who had my room before me was evicted by D the same day he paid rent, and wouldn't return the money. This really worried me when I heard this. I know he has to give me a 30 day eviction notice, he can't just kick me out, but my main concern is getting my deposit back. What should I do? Should I lawyer up just in case? This guy is a psycho, I'm starting to get a little freaked out. Thanks for reading."	No
"A couple months ago, as title says, I was offered a job through a contracting agency, which I accepted and relocated for (only a few hundred miles, but still a trek when relocating all your belongings).  The day before I was supposed to start, I hadn't received any onboarding documents from them so I started to get a little worried and tried to make contact. They ignored me all day until that night when they told me that there had been ""some mistake"" and I no longer had a job.  I was able to maintain some sort of contact with them for about  a week after, in which I was told they could give me some compensation for things like **relocation, security deposit, one month rent**. However after this they simply stopped responding and I never got my compensation.  I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to move forward with getting said compensation from them."	No
A few months ago I moved out of my apartment building. The reasoning behind this was because I had fallen victim to harassment and stalking. My car tires were slashed outside of the building, and a picture was sent to me of my apartment door so they somehow gained access to the building, they also sent messages stating that they would cause physical harm. I field a police report with the local police department, who said they couldn't really do anything because there was no evidence, or whiteness to the events, and because they were using a fake phone number and fake accounts they couldn't track them. So I decided to leave.   When I left, I contacted the onsite manager by phone, and had advised him of my situation. I said I was going to leave in accordance to Wisconsin Statute 704.16. This would allow me to break my lease early with no consequences. However, I made a deal with him, that I know I should have got in writing, but I agreed to pay rent until he found a new tenant. He promised me that he would find someone ASAP. I continued to pay, and pay, and pay. No tenants in 3 months. I have unfortunately run out of money and have a month an a half left on my old lease.  Today my old property manager texted me asking for rent money for this month. I don't have it. Am I obligated to give him the remainder of the money? I told him that I don't have the cash, and reminded him of all of this. But I have not received any word back. I understand that I should have just written a letter and provided the police report at the time, but since he had always been so nice I thought I would help him out by continuing to pay in the time being. If I sent him the letter and report now, would I still be able to get out of the lease?  Also is it required by law in Wisconsin for them to provide me with a copy of my lease? I know it is in some states, but I'm not sure about Wisconsin. I never received one, and had requested a copy multiple times during my stay at the property. If it is an obligation on their part, does it void the lease having not provided me with one, even after requesting it?	No
"My boyfriend and I signed a lease with a couple on Tuesday of this week and put in our 30 day the next day at the place I am at currently. We were supposed to move in the 1st, but graciously allowed them to extend it to the 14th and yesterday I went to drop off the first months rent and security deposit and I was notified by the realtor that the owners have to ""take the place off the market"". The realtor forwarded me his email in which he described his need to take the place off the market due to ""needing the residence"". He acted like he didn't take the place off the market Tuesday when he signed the lease and offered us no financial compensation for the 35$ application fee or the amount of gas we used from traveling from out of state to see the place, meet with them, sign leases, etc, etc. We had already reserved movers and everything. He was saying how he wanted long term tenants, that if we wanted to buy it eventually we could.   I am unsure until tomorrow, when my apartment manager gets in if I am able to rescind the 30 day notice where I am at now. I know they have a waiting list.   I start a clinical rotation in that area for nursing in 20 days and even if I am able to rescind my 30 days here, the driving will be very taxing. I am beyond disgusted and fed up and wondering what my legal options are?"	No
My lease expired on June 30. Gave more than the standard 30 days notice (as required by lease as well) that I would not be renewing.  Landlord resides out of state and dealt with his realtor in Houston for all transactions (though I paid him the rent directly). Last communication I had with either realtor or landlord was realtor saying to wait until first week of July for a walk-through. Heard nothing back for the entire month of July. August 1 I asked about the walk-through and security deposit, and provided a forwarding address (I know, I didn't provide it right away but the [statute](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PR/htm/PR.92.htm#92.107) seems to provide for that lapse still.   Still heard nothing back and followed up with another email on August 7, landlord wrote back saying the remainder of the deposit would be forthcoming after he got deductions and itemization from the realtor (separate dispute I'll have to fight).   Since it has now been 38 days since the lease expired, [has the landlord acted in bad faith and is this worth pursuing through an attorney?](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PR/htm/PR.92.htm#92.109)	No
Finished up my lease on an apartment with 3 other guys on the first of July and received the itemized list of charges against the security deposit. Some of the charges on it were $150 for labor in replacing a fist sized hole in the wall, 150 for parts and 225 for labor in replacing a broken door jam which I had already bought a door jam to be installed, and some other things. As of right now he said that he was being a nice guy and not charging the cleaning fee, which he priced at 400 and pretty much said that if we complained about the pricing he would apply that fee.   What I'm wondering is if there is some standard for pricing that a landlord can charge and if they are able to tack on more money after sending the itemized list because $150 to replace $10 of drywall and to paint that area seems absurd. Anything helps, thanks	No
Hi there, I recently found out that I'm going to owe over $3,000 to upgrade the elevators in my condo building - Chicago suburbs, IL. Our HOA fees are already ridiculous (close to $600 a month) and I was under the impression that part of the reason our fees were so high was that we were contributing towards funds that would take care of upgrades such as these.  The condos range anywhere from 80k-175k, so most residents are senior citizens on very fixed incomes, or young people getting their start in life. An unexpected $3,000 fee is REALLY stressing me out.  So I'm wondering. Do we have ANY rights at all? For example, should we have had the right to vote on this special assessment? Did they need to notify us? Shouldn't we have some sort of right to see what contractor they plan on hiring and vote on whether or not the amount is fair? I know when you submit yourself to an HOA building you are handing over rights, but I just can't imagine we wouldn't have SOME sort of legal protection - i.e. what if they just decided that they wanted to build a new swimming pool or upgrade the garage without our consent?  Any advice would be appreciated. I am so stressed out and it hurts me inside to see senior citizens on VERY fixed incomes worry as well.	No
Recently, my roommates and I contacted our landlord after our downstairs neighbor let us know there was a ‚Äúscrew‚Äù coming out of the ceiling below one of our bathrooms. Our landlord sent somebody over. Turns out this was termite excrement (ewwwww). Landlord let us know that they would be sending somebody over to repair the damage.  A couple of days later, we got an email message from the landlord after he received pictures from the contractor who did the repairs saying that the shower was dirty, mold was growing, and that that there was a leak between our unit and the unit downstairs. He claims there were thousands of dollars in damages, and we should have identified the leak sooner. He states we could be personally legally liable for damages.  As you can imagine, we freaked out when we read the email and started investigating and gathering documentation. The contractor who retiled the shower says we could not have identified the leak, and that the mold was unrelated. The contractor also recommended the shower be replaced years ago and it was not. The shower has leaked in the past. When our water bill spiked a year ago for no good reason, we advised the landlord to come out to the apartment and check for leaks and he did nothing.  We consulted with the Tenants Union in San Francisco and a lawyer. Both told us the same thing. Say nothing. He probably doesn‚Äôt have a strong case. Do not admit fault. He‚Äôs fishing to try and pin the fault on us. Maybe pay the lawyers to write a letter in advance stating that you know your rights.  Anyway, a couple of hours ago, the landlord sent another email asking us to confirm that we read his last email and to confirm that repairs were made. Does confirming receipt of an email where our landlord claims we could be personally liable an admission of guilt? Should I just ignore that portion of the email completely and just confirm that the shower was retiled? I feel like staying completely silent isn‚Äôt the way to go, as it may aggravate him more. Sorry if my question seems stupid. I‚Äôve never dealt with anything law related besides jury duty.	No
I signed a 2-month lease and an addendum saying I get half off for the month of June. I paid the full amount in June and went to the office to talk about getting half month off on my next lease.  I've come into the office 5 times about this and the manager is never there. It's July 8th now and I've gotten charged a late fee of $70 so far. The 'employees' have promised to email/call/contact the manager and she never does anything. I went in once and one employee went outside to talk to the manager for 10-15 minutes, then came back in and said she'll solve the problem tomorrow, which she didn't. She called me back in June and told me to wait until July 1st and she'll resolve the issue since she can't change anything in the system until then. July 1st I came into the office and she was on vacation indefinitely. They were closed the 3rd and 4th, and I got billed a late fee on the 4th.  What are my rights here? I am not going to pay a full month rent, and I am sure as hell not going to pay these late fees.	No

"I posted here awhile back about my new roommate acting sketchy. Long story short I'm moving out because it's confirmed she's trying to make me pay more in bills. She wants me to be out by August 5th which we agreed on, I prorated the August 1-5th rent which will be $169.   Now the hard part that comes in are the bills. She wanted me to pay her TV bill essentially, also it was last months bill for the previous roommate but she said people have always paid the previous tenants bill when they moved in. Smells like BS, and it definitely is. So she wants me to pay this huge portion of the bill that isn't internet, it's TV and I do not own a TV or cable box in my room. She argued with me that I could've put one in there and that it's my fault but I brought up her OWN contract that she is blatantly going against. On top of that the contract states 50% gas, electric and ""internet time Warner"". Now that's a play on words, she said that the internet is included in the time Warner bill but it has its own price. I'm simply not going to pay her TV, and the contract is specifically saying Internet, but that is one of those either or scenarios due to the wording. I just feel since the contract literally says internet time Warner, and not just ""time Warner"" that I should be paying for...the internet. I included the pics for you guys to see for yourself.   She keeps bringing up that she has an attorney she's speaking with about her rights, and how we have texts that are saying I want a TV (I checked our texts, nothing is along the lines of that except her saying the previous roommate is taking his TV back) when I really don't watch TV since I'm never home anyway. Her entire contract is going against what she's saying except that small play on words with the internet.  How do I go about doing the math for July 1- August 5th utility bills? I am not including the $95 and anything TV related. Just gas, internet and electricity. Prorating rent is one thing, but this is different. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.   http://imgur.com/a/0LVbv http://imgur.com/a/6R5fP http://imgur.com/a/09XGB"	No
Six years ago my (now ex) boyfriend and his friend raped me. He had been pouring a flask in my drink all night and when I passed out in his bed he and his friend brought in another girl and tried to get with both of us. She got freaked out and called a taxi and left. My ex and his friend cornered me and his friend had his way with me while my boyfriend held me down.   My ex stormed out the room and called me a whore.   Fast forward to last night, I get a call from his latest girlfriend and after hours on the phone talking about the abuse we both endured with him we found out that he and his friend raped her too in the same fashion.  This guy has a history of sexually abusing women and abusing animals (put a cat in a microwave, gave a small dog a seizure from kicking her across the room, abusing this girls dog to the point where she had to give him up so he'd be safe). He is truly the scum of the earth and there is no end to the carnage he causes anyone in his life, mental and physical abuse.  I may have what constitutes as a confession from him about the sexual assault and his latest gf went to a doctor right after so that may be proof.   Now that I have this girl's experience, I know that it'll happen again and I am wondering if we have a case? There are at least 4 other women I could contact that would potentially testify against him.  Thank you for any advice.	No
I got an e-mail from my community advisor friday saying that I need to move out of my dorm to a temporary living space this weekend for the remainder of my stay on campus. I'm not actaully able to move out today and I e-mailed the community advisor back informing him and telling him that I need to move out Monday or Tuesday at the earliest instead. He said that's not an option.  Is this legal? Can they just spring a change on me and then force me to leave? What can I do in this situation. 	No
I am 22 years old and mom and I rent a house together with my brother. Both her and I are on the lease.

A teenager saw, but I don't think he saw my plates let alone cared enough to remember them somehow. I don't know what the neighbors are like there but the car looked new (at most five years old), and seems like the neighbors might know one another. What legal repurcussions do I face if ever caught? Going forward what would be my ideal actions? I don't think I can ask my friend about this.	No
Hi all,  My mother in law was just at the casino playing slots when she hit a $1,200 jackpot. When they came to pay her out the manager told her he would only give her $800 because she did not have a good social security number (she is undocumented)  they then told her that if she made a big fuss about it they would ban her from the casino. Can anything be done here?	No
Located in San Francisco, CA  I am one of three tenants on a lease that ran for 12 months and then converted to month-to-month back in July.  One roommate has moved out and gave the landlord and us 30 days written notice.  We've been advertising the room everywhere but haven't found a replacement yet. I'm panicking about paying rent on February 1st. My remaining roommate says departing roommate is liable until someone else moves in. Departing roommate says he gave 30 days notice and that's all that was necessary.  All three of our names are on the lease agreement. Can one roommate give 30 days notice and release himself from his portion of the liability, even though all three names are on the lease? I've reached out to the landlord but would like to hear from this group as well.	No
I rented out one bedroom of my apartment to a girl. I was unaware of the rules that I have to register her as a room mate to the apartment authority. I innocently talked to the leasing office about my roommate and they asked me to register her as a co-occupant. There were complains about different living conditions of her from my apartment authority. I requested my roommate to register herself as a roommate  with the required amount but she is refusing to pay that. Then, I requested her to move out of the apartment by the end of this month and she is ignoring me and threatening that I can call cops but she is not going to move out. I am completely helpless now and I do not want her in my apartment even if I pay the roommate registration fees for her. She is anyway not moving out. What is the law about and what can be I approach to make her leave the place.	No
Hi all,  I recently, (in the past year), purchased a home in the greater LA area that was a flip from an investor. The flipper did some upgrades but clearly he cut some corners as we have come to find out a year after the fact.  The major issue is that he re-did the kitchen and ran line from the main sink to the island sink that is not intended to be used underground. The piping is leaking and has destroyed the flooring, cabinetry and the drywall in the kitchen. I am afraid that there may be blackmold behind the wall or cabinets as I have 2 toddlers in the house... this is my greatest concern.  I filed a claim with my insurance company, but they are being unreasonable, IMO. 1. They want me to use their contractor. 2. They will not allow the contractor to start working on replacing/repairing until after a plumber has ripped out the problem. I get that they can't totally assess the damage until then... but there is damage that can be addressed before we know the scope prior to knowing whole picture. I'm trying my hardest to not have to uproot the family and have them stay in a hotel for a month. Toddlers plus dogs in hotel room... no thank you.   I have to pay the plumber out of pocket, I also have to pay a deductible for several thousand dollars to insurance. My questions here are:  1. Do I have to use the contractor the insurance company is ramming down my throat?  2. Can I go after the flipper for this issue? I would like at least the deductible and the plumbing costs back, can I go for more? Every plumber who has looked at the situation has said this is gross negligence... I don't want the flipper to be able to do this to someone else and I'm quote livid about this. I paid seven figures for this house and it has been one thing after another of shoddy work failing on us.  At this point, we are going around in circles with flaky plumbers and my terrible insurance company. What should I do?   Thank you in advance, -Cleveland_CKCS	No
I signed a sublease on an industrial commercial warehouse property. It has a 1 year lease with a 2 year option. The main landlord consented verbally and via an email, but there was no place on the lease for the main landlord to sign.  I am in the business of buying impounded cars and performing minor repairs as needed to get the vehicles in sell-able condition. We do not do major repairs like paint, body, engine/transmission, etc. Mostly things like replacing battery, starter, alternator, etc. Once the cars are functional we either sell them on EBay, or reconsign them to other auctions as running vehicles. The ones we are unable to repair are either sold as-is or have the major components removed to sell as parts online or as spare repair parts in our warehouse.  The location is zoned for light automotive business. In fact our location is next door to the city auto impound lot and surrounded by several automotive shops, paint&amp;body, etc.   The building owner informed his property manager that he didn't want a messy business on premise and basically told her to get us out. We listened to her request to keep our covered work area cleaner and better organized. She sent us text and email saying the placed looked great (we kept pics for our records).  The next month the owner told her he didn't want us there anymore and told her to take care of it. I asked her what grounds he had for doing so since we have a valid lease in place, we pay timely each month and our business purpose is allowed under the zoning. Her reply was that he just wanted us gone.  We incurred a lot of expense setting up that location including transportation fees for the vehicles plus typical setup expenses like  installing warehouse shelving, setting up PC network, etc.  We informed the office manager that it would not be realistic to expect us to move just because he changed his mind. In an attempt to appease them we agreed not to have any additional cars delivered there and started looking for a new location to move into at the conclusion of the lease.  The sublease landlord is not willing to let us out of the remaining term of the 1 year lease because they are counting on our portion of the rent to afford the total lease rental.   I got a nasty VM and EMail from the landlord today stating that he would have all our cars towed in 2 days at our expense. I have tried explaining that we are current in our lease, we are not violating any codes or ordinances, and that his office manager had already told us that this would not happen. With 2 days notice we will not have time to secure adequate storage and transportation for 7-8 vehicles.   Question is... should we just figure out a way to move them and be done with these people? Should we let them tow them away and file suit for the damages? Should we move them and the file suit for the costs associated with complying to this demand?   Question is... shou	No
I was walking out with merchandise in my hand. I past the last point of sale but did not exit the building, three security guards tackle me then two grab my arms while the third chocks me out and I'm begging for my life this happens for about two or three minutes. When the cops come and review the footage the one who chocked me out is cited for aggravated assualt. Is there anything I can do?	No
So in March, my girlfriend and I signed a one-year lease for an apartment in a small city in PA. Everything was going well, until around May, when our landlord request we start sending our rent to his property management company. Although they were not mentioned on the lease at all, we did what he asked because we figured it would be fine.   About three weeks ago, our ceiling started leaking. Water is coming in the side of the house and was dripping through our drop ceiling. Last Friday, one of the tiles caved in dropped a bunch of water on the floor. It's Monday, and the property management team came once and has been avoiding us since, maybe to come tomorrow, but i'm really starting to get worried. They also said that they just got this property, so they have been introduced into the equations since we signed our lease. Our landlord tells us there is nothing he can do and to call property management. Is it legal for him to do this when they were not mentioned on the lease? I really don't want to break another lease but I cannot live like this.  Thanks so much in advance.	No
My home lease says it is only for residential purposes. I do a lot of work from home and recently registered for a fictitious name (DBA) including placing an ad in the paper stating this that contains my home address. My wife is freaking out, thinking this violates/breaks our lease and we could be in trouble. Am I correct in thinking that operating a business from my dwelling and working from home are two different things? I'm okay, right? My wife is totally just being a freak, right?

"I live in the wonderful state of Colorado, but recently I have come under fire from one of my ""friends"" whom I let stay at my place for an extended period of time. The guy was having a rough time figuring out his life, and I offered to help him. He moved in with me, and started working things out. He did his house arrest while with me, and started working. I never asked anything of him except that he does a fair amount of chores while he is here, and abide by the rules of his probation. Well, he decided that probation wasn't real, and proceeded to purchase alcohol for himself and steal some of my own. According to his probation he isn't supposed to drink. I was out of the house for a few days, and he was supposed to watch over it along with the dogs and cat. This turned into a long stream of arguments that ended up with him being told to go to rehab and curb his alcoholism that he has an issue with. He refused to do so. He then threatened to punch me if I ever talked to him like that again. I told him to get out. He has been sucking off my nipple for 2 months. I guess this brings me to the big question.  He has never paid rent. He tried, but I returned it saying that he needs to use it to pay his phone bill, gas, and his community service as outlined by his probation. He is requesting a written 30 day eviction notice, but I gave him 10 days to leave since he failed to go to rehab. None of this is written record anywhere. Do I have a right to kick him out? Does he have the right the right to stay at my house? If he threatens me again, what actions can I take?"	No
We both were fined on the basis of violation of title. Is there any angle I can argue in court? He has rented a car in the past and been pulled over with no repercussions. Can I argue that I did enough due diligence? Thanks for the help 	No
Rental managers want me to move into a different unit that I've only seen online. By the looks of it, I already don't like it. They told me if I don't move into this one, the one I signed for will be ready Thursday. I can't afford to move again/ pay for a truck/ storage. What legal options do I have?	No
I'm currently in college in a city school where students typically rent apartments next to campus rather than living in dorms after their first year or so. Last year, around December, I signed a lease and paid a security deposit of $600 to live with two friends that I'll refer to as A and B. Before I could pay first months rent, my one friend A and I had a falling out with the other friend B in which B decided that she wasn't moving out. A and I decided to find people to take our spots in the lease and live elsewhere to avoid further conflict. The landlord of that property understood what was happening and said all was fine if we found other people to take our spots in the lease. The landlord said that he would switch new people to our spots and those new people would just use our deposits and pay us back since we had already given him money. A and I agreed that was easiest. So I found a girl who I'll refer to as S to take my spot. I told her that she would have to pay me back the $600 for the security deposit and she agreed. This all happened at the end of the year at the beginning of summer when we were both moved back home and S lives out of state so all our correspondence has been through text. So far, it's been 4 months and I've only received about $100 of what she owes me that I received in mid July. I texted her for the third time this morning, politely asking about the other money but haven't gotten any response from the other two times before today. I'm hoping today she'll respond but if not, I'm not sure what to do which is where I need advice.   I have all the texts exchanged between us two from the beginning as well the the money order and the Venmo transaction I received from the fraction of the cost that she's paid me. I'm planning on contacting the landlord if she doesn't answer today but I just need to know where I should go from here. Being a college student, $600 is a lot of money to me and I don't want to lose it. So, should I take legal action and if so, when? Or is there another way to solve this?  - I hope this is the right sub to put this on. If not, I apologize and would appreciate it if someone could point me in the direction of the correct one. Thanks!	No
My wife and I bought a house and closed about a month and half ago and moved in.  Apparently the house used to be a rental house as the last tenant has contacted us saying he is being sued by the previous owner(landlord). He wants to ask us about move in condition and wants a picture of the back screen door.  If I talk to him about move in condition would that tie me up in his court case?  I own the house and just want to get on with living here and don't want to be pulled into court for statements if that's something that could happen.  Thank you 	No
So my buddy just called me, he had been on a dating app and been talking with this girl. She was posted as 19 and going to college in a few weeks and was just looking to mess around. Things happened and nudes were sent. After a few days she wanted to meet up and he was trying to figure out the logistics. Before that happened she told him she was actually just turning 17 in a few weeks. He said the hell with this deleted the nudes and cut contact. The next day he gets a call from a supposed lawyer and the lawyer said the father was an understanding guy and just wanted to talk to my buddy and figure out what happened. He got a weird vibe asked about the law firm and got vauge answers so he said he can't verify the lawyer he won't talk to him. Me and another buddy have been looking into the supposed lawyer and the name given doesn't show up on the MN and ND lists. I called the number and got a different last name that was a lawyer. The cellphone number doesn't match the lawfirms number. We are all confused and this smells of scamming... anyone have any similar situations or advice we would greatly appreciate it.	No
"I work at a minimum wage service job and put in my two weeks on Monday last week. As the usual two-week courtesy notice would have it, I would typically work until my last usual shift which is this Saturday. However, I told him in writing on my two-week notice that I only want to work til this Thursday (two days from today), which is kinda like a one and a half week notice. To get me to work the last couple shifts, he claimed two things (in person)    1) I need to show up to work because ""I already paid you for those hours, so you need to show up for them"". and    2) ""I need to give you your last paycheck on your last day"" in exchange for my uniform.    ...now for the record I think I know the real reason as to why he's doing this. A number people are leaving for vacation during this time (which is why I couldn't request time off myself in the first place) so he kinda maybe needs me. I also know that I have a direct deposit with the company, so the ""hand me my paycheck thing"" seems pretty bullshit. At the very least, I know he's heavily bending the truth, either too proud to tell ask me straight ""Hey I know you wrote you wanted to give me one and a half weeks, but I really need you this weekend."" or just hoping I'm gullible enough to believe whatever he claims.    Or is he? That's what I want to ask you guys.    Is he legally able to indebt me with ""wage prepayment"" and as a side question, how bullshit is his need to ""hand me my check on the last day""?    Thanks for your time."	No
I run a bar in a commercial building in the State of Florida.  My neighbor, who is also my landlord, has a massive bitcoin mining operation next door.  It is clearly written in our lease that he may not take any action that interferes with my ability to conduct my business.  About three weeks ago, he installed some massive exhaust fans to help with cooling his operation.  Ever since then, there has been noticeable suction in our property (most noticeable when opening a door).  The air conditioning is running constantly, and is not able to pull down to temp (July in FL doesn't help, but we've been open for over a year, and it has never been an issue before).  Our floor and sink drains are exhausting a terrible sewage smell.  We've had repeated conversations with the neighbor/landlord (and his employee who is his surrogate for landlord activities) about it, and he has basically told us to F off.  He says something like we should have sealed our space better (He built the walls between our space!  They were pre-existing!).  The only way we've found to alleviate the problem is to leave all of our doors open, but then it is miserably hot and bright in the space.  Otherwise, it smells like sewage.  This is really costing us customers.  I figure I can take him to court somehow.  But, what preparations should I make?  What evidence could I bring?  I can't think of a way to prove a smell, or prove loss of revenue.  Our plumber doesn't know what to do.  Our HVAC contractor doesn't know what to do.  I talked to a lawyer about it, but he basically said it didn't sound big enough for his time, and I should keep trying to find a way to resolve it with the landlord or file a suit on my own.  But the landlord isn't budging and we are losing customers.	No
TL;DR- Got lost in the health insurance system due to a glitch; now have a wisdom tooth tearing up my mouth and want to know if it's okay to get medical help despite being in an appeal process   So! Back in December of 2016, I applied for health insurance via NY State of Health and uploaded my tax returns as proof of income (I'm freelance). I was then told I hadn't given enough information of proof of income despite uploading my tax return, so called the phone line to ask what more I needed to do. They told me tax documents were enough, it was a glitch in their system, and they would contact me when it was all settled. In February I hadn't heard from them yet, so called again to check in---was told once again that it was a glitch and they would contact me shortly.  Fast forward to now--I still hadn't heard from them, but apparently have a wisdom tooth that decided to show up in my mouth last week and wreck havoc (constant pain, hard to eat, hurts to swallow, all that fun stuff). I called the office again to check in, was told it was a massive error on their part and they got me set up to pick a plan (which I did), except it doesn't start until August--I cannot make it much longer like this, one week has already been hell. I then requested to file for backdating due to an urgent medical need, which was denied (not sure why entirely, more than willing to call and ask for specifics if that's helpful).   I can expand on all of this further if the wall of text hasn't already been a turn off, but the basic questions I have are:  -now that I'm filing an appeal, is it okay to still get my tooth removed or does that hurt my standing in the appeal process?  -if I win this appeal will I be reimbursed for whatever costs my dental would've covered (if it's kosher to remove the tooth)?  -is it terribly stupid to not have someone to represent me for this telephone hearing?  Thank you for any/all help and hope everyone is having a wonderful Sunday!	No
"My neighbors are driving me insane. They're this married couple with a newborn baby. Ever since they brought home the kid, they've become the worst sort of busybodies.   I invite my friends over to jam at my house at 3am because we all work crazy hours and we just want to chill and listen to music. It happens a few times a week. When it does, our neighbors called the police. I know it's them because the cops told me after I asked repeatedly who it was. I talked to them about it and they told me that the loud music bothers them and their baby. That's bullshit.  I accidentally hit their mailbox with my car backing up. This freaked the wife out. She came out, and screamed bloody murder at me. I cursed at her which I know I shouldn't have done but I was pissed. I offered to pay for the mailbox but she told me to ""fuck off"". The next day, she and her husband asked if I could pay for the mailbox then I told *them* to ""fuck off"".  Ever since then they've been harassing me. They stand in front of my house, glaring. I've asked police for help but they tell me they can't do anything because they are on the sidewalk. I mysteriously got dog poop on my lawn which I think was their doing. They don't have a dog but their friends bring their dogs over.   I threw a huge block party on Monday night, and they got angry about the noise and the fact I had some friends park their cars in their driveway. They threatened to call the police but the cops never showed up. Next day, they said they would get a restraining order on me.  Can they do that? If they do, can I get kicked out of my house? Is it possible that I can get one first? What else can I do to help get them out of my hair?"	No
"I signed a new lease on paper at my current apartment a couple months ago which will take effect August 1. Since then, the management company has switched to DocuSign, an online provider of documents for signatures. Today, I received an email saying I must sign the electronic copy or face ""late charges"", even though they've already acknowledged receiving the paper version. That part is obviously bullshit on their part.   I haven't yet reviewed the electronic version and compared it to the paper version I already signed. If they are exactly the same, would there be any consequence in re-signing the electronic version? If they are different, I'll take whichever version is more advantageous. Anything else I should be aware of? Can they really assess charges for not signing their electronic version when the paper one is already signed?"	No
landlord is trying to add tons of cleaning fees upon moveout, none of which are on the lease, how do we deal with it?   Signed a lease in January with a crazy landlord that's non stopped harassed us since we moved in, refusing to obey by the 24 hour notice or just showing up uninvited so we asked to end the lease early. She found new tenants, signed a lease with them today to start September 1st and is now telling us we have to pay all of these additional cleaning fees that aren't in our lease.   Telling us we have to pay her cleaners around $600 to come clean the place, hire a professional window cleaner, someone to do the carpets, and then someone to clean the backyard, when in our lease all it says upon move out we pay for a carpet cleaner, we have a dog so we agreed to this. She made us keep her gardener with the place, $50, a month, and she's saying the new tenants don't want to pay him but she wants them to have a gardener so she says we have to keep paying his fee until January and then she'll cover it after that.   We haven't signed anything but she's trying to rope us into a document saying we'll be paying her around $1200 of our $2000 security deposit, not sure what to do about this. What grounds do we have?	No
So back in Feb 2017 I was very stupid and drove after drinking. I have a lawyer and he has looked at the video and everything and says that while the stop may be challenged that if I loose then I have to go through the trial and I could lose more because I was clearly drunk in the video. I've reviewed the evidence myself and I agree with him completely.  I am mostly just concerned about the First Offenders Program in general. I live in MD and never plan to drink or drive again. I don't mind doing the classes, or getting the evaluations, or joining AA because I was wrong and I could have really hurt someone or myself.  I am just wondering how this is going to look on my record.	No
Currently my roommate and I are renting an apartment for 1010 a month and have a year long lease. Since fall semester is coming up apartment companies are marketing like crazy and we found out that our management is now offering our same exact style of two bedroom apartments for only 700 a month. We contacted them and inquired about the price decline and they said that we are locked into the above 1010 price. Anything we can do? 	No
Hello  I live with my bf and i had a pet (dog/cat, rather not say which) for 2 years before we moved in together. Once we moved in he expressed hatred for my pet. He was willing to deal with it, it seemed. But we got into multiple fights daily because of the pet's behavior. I mentioned once in passing that I feel I might have to give the pet away (this was in no way shape or form permission for him to give away my pet, just a passing thought because of our fighting). But he said, no don't do that.   One day I go to work and I come home to no pet. He decided to give it to a coworker without my permission or knowledge. Once I expressed to him how upset this made me, he promised to get it back. Well the coworker gave the pet to someone else as a gift, but was willing to work with us. He approached the person he gave the gift to.  Gift receiver said no initially. So we offered money. Person later felt bad when they found out the pet was not a random animal but in fact had a previous owner and was given away without permission(they had no idea the pet was not a stray when they received it as a gift). But would only return animal if money was offered to recoup for expenses ($200). We paid money happily.   Gift receiver starts giving us the runaround at this point. Keeps promising to return pet if we met at their house, but refused to meet anywhere else. The whole thing was shady and weird but I was desperate. When we arrived at the residence the new owner said hang tight while I find the pet. Never came back to the door. After almost an hour we knock again and they tell bf to come inside. I'm not sure what happened at this point but there was some sort of altercation and pet was never returned. We left. Situation was sketchy and we were worried about our safety.   My question is, what can we do at this point? This person has agreed to return the pet, with no problem, but now it has been a few months since we initially started going back and forth with these people. I understand the pet was given away but the pet did not belong to the person who gave them away in the first place. And what's more, we paid this person money and now we feel left high and dry. Aside from the situation i have to deal with inside of my relationship because my significant other thought it was okay to give away my beloved pet, what else can i do to deal with new owner?  TL; DR:  Boyfriend gave my pet away without my permission. Person in turn gave pet to someone else as a gift. New owner thought gift was a stray, was not aware it had a previous owner. We offered money in exchange for pet. New owner insisted we meet at their house to pick it up (this was weeks after we paid $200 to them). Upon arrival at new owners house we were met with confrontation and never received my pet. What else can I do?	No
"Long story short I got a vandalism charge, and went back the next day to pay the owner for the damage.  It was exactly 250 and the arresting officer ""added"" additional damages to get a felony arrest so it was originally vandalism over 500.  I didn't realize until I got my background check that it is incorrect and has been on my record this entire time.  So that makes me think the amount that I paid my probation was incorrect as well.  What steps can I take to getting this fixed and correcting it to a ""misdemeanor"" which is what it should have been in the first place."	No
Someone filmed me having sex through my window. My university conducted interviews to get more information, and I have the transcripts from those interviews which pretty clearly point to who was responsible for taking the video. Is there any action I can take against that person? Can I take action against the people who viewed the video and didn't report it? Should I take it to the police? Does it matter that I don't have access to the video?	No
Note: GeekChic may voluntarily refund or something, I don't know yet, but I'm trying to find out my worst-case-scenario options. I live in Oregon, GeekChic was located in Washington.  I placed an order for a custom coffee table through Geek Chic (a custom furniture manufacturer) in January. I paid for it in full ahead of time (as is required since they hand make every piece). They gave me an estimated delivery date of August-October, which is also typical.  However, they've now announced they're out of business and have stopped responding to calls, emails, etc. I don't believe my table is built (or finished), or in any way deliverable, and I've already paid for it in its entirety back in January ($4770).  GeekChic hasn't announced anything about customers money yet, but I'm trying to find out my options for what I could do if they don't (or can't) refund it. I paid for it with a Chase-branded Visa Signature card. Does anyone have any suggestions?

"I signed a 12 month lease for my current apartment which ends next spring. The landlord never sent me back a signed copy of this lease, and it specifically says in the lease that ""This form becomes a binding lease renewal when signed by the owner below and returned to the tenant."" They also never provided any required attachments --lead warning and a rider regarding rent stabilization law.   I contacted the landlord about leaving early at the end of August and they came back at me that they want me gone even sooner at the end of July because according to them that is what my lease says (which is not true at all). They also said if I do not vacate then they will be billing me for damages (which there are no damages other than normal wear and tear).  I plan to stay through the end of August regardless.  My main question is -- Is it ok to not pay them last months rent and to just use my security deposit as the last month, since I'm sure I will never see that deposit again based on their rudeness; and since my lease is not technically executed?   Or do i risk legal action from them and risk getting sent to collections for not paying the last months rent?  I would appreciate any advice!"	No
"Good Morning /r/LegalAdvice  First and foremost, the person in question does have a Reddit account, and does know my username, but attempts at contact with him have failed so I need advice.  What I thought was one of my best friends moved in with me after I got him a job working as a Sales Rep in my office. I'm not here to discuss our friendship, but what happened when he quit/was let go and moved out all within 12 hours.  On June 29th, at 11p, while my Roommate was drunk and upset, he sprung on me that he had been looking for jobs in Dallas and ""had a line on a job"".This was very shocking to me because 1) told me at 11p on the first night of the first PTO I'd taken from work since I started working there. 2) He was drunk 3) My life had just started to come together, so I was also a bit emotional. We argued a bit, and it came down to that he hated Houston because all of his friends were in a town where we went to college together, and he was used to the bar life of getting up at 4p, going to work at 6p, partying while working, and then going to bed at 6a. The M-F/8-5 life was not ideal for him.  We had both agreed I would talk to my boss in the morning to see if there was something that could be done about getting him more training. But in the morning when my boss agreed to more resources and training to make him feel more confident, my roommate said he'd made up his mind and he wasn't invested anymore. That's his right, but since he had no clients and no ties to the company, we did not want to pay him for work he had told us he wouldn't be doing. So his last day was made on June 30th, and he was told this at 11a.   Since I was still on PTO, I was home when he got home from the office. He spoke no words to me, and instead packed. I thought he was packing to go to Dallas (since he was gone every weekend), but instead he packed all of his things. The only communication came when I called him and told him I needed him to leave his company issued phone. He said he was fixing his personal phone, and that he would be back. I had plans that evening so I told him to leave the phone on the table.  I returned home later and most of his things were gone, and the phone was on the table. He had left his bed frame, mattress, desk, chair, dressers, couch, and TV stand, along with other smaller items. I just had to put two-and-two together and realized that he was not leaving for the weekend, but that he had moved out.  I have not heard from him since, except for when he inquired about his last check. He has not responded to my attempts to contact him via email.  I spoke with our leasing agent about the situation (we signed on a townhome that is individually owned in an HOA community). She said because he walked off, he will not get his half of the deposit back (which was agreed upon in the lease), and that we will need to sign a new lease, but that this will not go on my renter's history or credit.  Now it's also worth mentioning that when I got the company phone back, no messages had been deleted. While there were some hurtful messages not appropriate for this post, He did mention in the texts that he would ""probably leave the furniture if [I'm] ok with it"".  I emailed him two days ago the following:  &gt; Good Evening, &gt;  &gt; I need to know what your plan is for your things, rent, and the light bill in June.  &gt;  &gt; Options: &gt;  &gt; - Come get your things by the 7/26 and pay rent for their storage. Also pay half of electric bill for June. Leave your keys. &gt;  &gt; - Leave your things and consider them paying for rent. Also pay half of electric bill for June. Mail back your keys. &gt;  &gt; I need to have everything squared away by the 26th as I will be out of town from the 27th to the end of the month. I would prefer that you do not come here while I am not here for security reasons. I will have the place armed and have taken your code off of the alarm system.  &gt;  &gt; Please reply back by the end of the day Friday. No response will indicate that you have abandoned the property and will not be paying rent, but instead your items will be collateral for rent.  &gt;  &gt; I do however expect payment for the light bill in June. Nit the past due, that has been paid. The current charges. I am not asking for payment for the internet or cable, although you did use them, which I think is a fair trade off. If you would like to pay for them and square away any debts, I'm open to discussion.  &gt;  &gt; I'm open to other options, but I will not budge on the end date of 7/26. &gt;  &gt; Thank you, &gt;  &gt; - [redacted]  And a follow up email:  &gt; Please respond by 11:59 p.m. July 21 with your intentions, so I can arrange to be in the apartment, should you choose to come for your things.  I have not heard anything, and he has until tomorrow at midnight, but I guess my question or need for advice, is if I don't hear from him, what do I need to do? We didn't sign any agreements, other than the lease.  I have an abusive ex with a standing restraining order, and thus I am very anxious about the security of my place. My roommate is aware of this.  I would like to start finding another roommate, but I am unable to because of his things in the room. His things are hindering my ability to figure out rent and my new living situation, because I don't want to touch them and then be blamed for something.  What should my next step be? Do I have ground to stand on, or am I just screwed in all directions?  Quick Note: The electric bill I'm asking for payment for is for the month of June, while he was here, not for the month of July when he wasn't here."	No
"I'll try to make this short.  A notoriously crooked landlord leased a property to me that was being remodeled for foundation and roofing purposes.  Contract states that the lease started on June 1st which is the day the landlord said the construction would be finished, and we are to pay rent at the first of every month of course. The property has not floor in two of the rooms and some of the roof is missing.  City wrote a notice to landlord to seize all construction for the absence of permits that were require to do construction, which I later found out that the landlord was notified of that about a month prior to leading me the property.  Three days after the lease was to begin I saw absolutely no progress made on the house, and had no way of moving in. He never even gave me keys after he told me the keys would be in a locked compartment in the house. So I called the landlord numerous times with voicemails and of course he never answered. So I knew I was going to have to take legal action.  I sent a certified return receipt letter to his office about a week and a half to two weeks after the lease was suppose to start stating that he breached contract, refuse to communicate with me and that I wanted all of my money back, fully expecting him not to answer or acknowledge anything. Upon doing research at this point, the landlord had been arrested a few times, was notorious for making crooked deals like this with many tenants and then screwing them over, and had been on the news a time or two for the attention he was getting. It was so bad that there is a Facebook group dedicated to putting a stop to this POS since he continues to do this to more people everyday.  I filed a lawsuit about two weeks after that, which was the same day I went to check the property once more seeing that still nothing had been done, and when he was served the process from the court the landlord finally called me. Landlord was shocked and suddenly so accommodating and was offering to settle since he thought it was ""unnecessary"" to bring this matter to court. I told him the parameters on which we were to settle on and then asked me to email him what he owed me. So I did and stated that he should have a check/money order mailed in five to six days by noon on the sixthish day and upon cashing in the check I would gen drop the suit and we would go our separate ways. He never replied of course, so I called him a few times those following days. No answer, but I didn't trust to settle out of court with a crooked guy like this. I texted the landlord lord on the due date of the settlement saying that if he still wants to settle I will be happy to come by his office so he can write me a check or I would see him in court, and he replied with ""busy today"".  So I then had the idea of getting him on record via phone call, knowing he had more crooked dealing to serve me and proceeded to call a few days after he texted me until he answer. I called once a day from three more days and on the third day, he returned my called. So I pressed record.  Landlord told me that I made it difficult to settle with all of my demands and due dates and said that his lawyer looked the email over and said ""we can win this no problem"". I laughed because he was obviously trying to scare me and then asked ""what is there for you to win? You've already taken about 4 thousand dollars from me thus far. What is there left?"" He said if i took 500 dollars off that amount then he would write a check for me and the suit will be dropped. He followed with, ""If the check bounced or anything then you have full recourse. My lawyer will set all of this up, but you have to take 500 dollars off for my lawyer fee."" Of course I said no way in hell knowing that the damages I was suing for were more than what I had already paid and he followed with ""you know this isn't going to be a short process suing me right? It'll take 5-6months, because it isn't just an eviction process. In fact, I can actually file an eviction against you and then put it on your credit record."" That set me off because of course I never lived there. I proceeded to curse him and told him to go ahead and evict me because I never lived in the property and the property itself is proof that no one could have lived there and that he'll have to lawyer up big time if he's going to take it that direction.   He hung up.  So I have that on record now but as far as suing and what to expect, that's my main concern. What am I getting myself into?"	No
Hey Legal Advice! First time poster... This advice isn't for me but for my Sister in Law.   She and her friend rented an apartment. Leased it for a year. Both of their names are on the lease.  Her friend ended up losing her job and could not afford her end of the rent. So my very wise SIL decided she wouldn't pay her half and they just agreed to live it out until they got evicted.   Now they have finally been evicted and both have moved home.   My question is what kind of legal issues will my SIL run into? She seems to think that once she is evicted that's the end of that and life moves on. Front what i've heard from a Co-worker is that the Landlord can sue for the rent owed and potentially get wages garnished.   In all honesty this is for mostly my curiosity, however if there is any actual good advice I will pass it on. I just like to sit back and watch the show  This is in Alberta, Canada.	No
Alright so I've tried googling this but have no guts on my specific situation.  I'm a server and the owner has 3 more restaurants all within a block, so we swap and take things we need from the other 3 if we ever run out of anything. Occasionally we will run out of a certain liquor and they will typically send a server to go grab an unopened bottle and bring it back to the restaurant they work at. Is it legal to walk it if you're under 21 since it is for business and you're on the clock?	No
Quick summary: a move in special concessions was offered when my roommate and I signed our lease. For a 1x1, the offer was 2 free months of rent. For a 2x2, the offer was $1,000 payable towards rent.  When negotiating, the agent made the mistake of offering us 2 free months amounting to about $3,700. This was later reflected in the lease, which was signed by my roommate, myself, and the leasing agent representing the complex.  We've moved in just a few days ago, and the agent has realized their mistake. They'd like us to come in and sign an addendum changing it to $1,000.  Question: we've got no legal obligation to sign this addendum, yes? It was their mistake. They're just as responsible for reading a document they're drafting and signing as we are. Even if it was a mistake, the lease is now binding.  I'll attach some pictures in the comments including the page of the lease concerning the money as well as their request to sign an addendum.	No
Sorry, I accidentally deleted my last post.   Hey, y'all. Any employee law information you can give me, either state (Indiana) or federal (US), as well as any advice on resolving any legal matters as quickly as I possibly can would be greatly appreciated!  So, since I teach during the school year, I have employment over the summer with a summer camp. I signed no contract with my employers after receiving the job offer - only an employment application and information for payroll. I accepted the job on the premise that I would be paid an hourly wage as I did last year for the same job, but I was told after approximately a week of work that I would be paid a flat rate of $450/week.   The new year also came with some new rules for the camp counselors. We cannot leave the campus without permission, and can only leave for 2 hours at night, one-at-a-time between 11PM-1AM. We were also told that we would be getting overtime pay, and if we worked overtime, to log it on the final week of the payroll cycle in which we will only be present on campus for 1 of the 7 days.   On another note, I was offered a better position at this camp initially, and then they took the offer back to give it to another candidate after I had already made living arrangements for the summer. But I'm not sure that I can prove this/it will hold up in court.   ‚Ä¢ Since I am required to be present unless given permission and am only allowed 2 hours per night off campus with that permission, does this mean that I am on call 24 hours? If so, can I be paid for the hours that I am not necessarily actively doing something since I am essentially required to just be around?   ‚Ä¢ Is keeping me here for a month with no release okay? How can I get some time away from here if I want to see family or when I have to move my permanent residence in 2 weeks?   ‚Ä¢ Do I have a case against my employer for not paying overtime and asking us to alter our time sheets even though this was discussed in a private meeting and there is no written record?   ‚Ä¢ Can the camp be liable for my expenses since they took back a job offer after I made living arrangements? Again, I'm not really sure I can prove this part.   ‚Ä¢ Who do I report the above issues to, and how long will it feasibly take to get fixed? Is it possible to resolve some of these issues within a couple of weeks or will I be toughing it out until the end of the camp?	No
Location: Ohio  So I'm buying a mobile home off of my parents. The title is in my father's name. We(Wife and I) gave a check to my him in her name for the payoff and he paid it(with her check). He got the title yesterday and today my mother told me how much the conveyance fee was and I told her it was perectly good(it was like 40 bucks). They went to the auditors office today and my mother decided it would be a bright idea to have my dad sign it over as a gift to avoid the conveyance fee and a transfer fee. We just got to the title office and saw where they put that we paid 0, and there's warnings all over the title saying that lying is a felony.  So I got ahold of mother (even though it's all in my dad's name, he just listens to everything she says) and she basically just said just played it off like it's totally acceptable and people do it all the time. Obviously we are not going into the title office and partaking in a felony. So my question is, can I have this sorted out through the auditors office or is this a really bad situation? I fear my father will get introuble for this and the whole transaction is going to fall apart. Thank you for any advice.	No
Im renting a house with someone I thought was a friend and the lease started in July. I'm not currently living there over summer because I'm a student with a job back home but am still paying rent for the month. My roommate was supposed to mail in our rent check and said he did, but our landlord has not received it. We've all (about 3 of us) have been calling/texting/messaging him for 7 days now asking him to void the check (if he ever even sent it) and to send a new one. Our rent is now almost a week and a half late and I literally cannot do anything unless I get ahold of him. What are my options? The house and my (ex) roommate are in Oregon, by the way.	No
So, I met these guys my first year of college and we got along great and decided to room together the following year. We've had the typical roommate troubles, nothing too major. However, this Summer, I moved back with my parents to work a better paying job for a few months. Well, it turns out that neither of my roommates ever had anyone co-sign for them and my dad is still the only co-signer. I had still been paying my share of all the bills at this point.  Now, I have found out that they were given a 60-day notice to vacate because they did not inform the apartment complex of their intentions to stay. I had already made it very clear to all parties that I was finding my own place. Well, they needed all 3 of our signatures on the piece of paper in order for it to be valid. I was not at that apartment during this time (I have the time cards from work to prove it), so, they did what any sensible adult would do and forged my signature. Upon inspecting the notice when we were packing the rest of my stuff, I told my parents it wasn't my signature and it is VERY clearly not. We compared it to the lease and they are ENTIRELY different. We have not said anything about it to the apartment complex yet.  My roommates have since gotten another co-signer, but are not cooperating in signing the final lease when I asked about it. They don't know that we have seen the notice to vacate. So I guess my question is, what should I do with the forged signature? I'd rather not go to court, but I'm very sick of being dragged around by them about rent and electricity and if they never sign the paper, my dad (me) would be responsible for paying for any damage done to the apartment. Im sorry for poor formatting, I'm still quite heated. I can answer any questions if needed. Thanks in advance	No
So this is happening in Barbados but the company I'm working with is based in GA. Basically we moved in thinking it was monthly to find a new place no lease or anything, now after telling them we are leaving they said its a 6 month lease which we haven't seen since yesterday. Its a school i'm dealing with so they are saying if we don't stay or pay $1200 then we will be kicked out of our classes. There was no set time agreed to at all, so is this legal for them to do? It feels sounds kind extortion but i'm not sure.	No
I live in a house owned by my mother ever since I came back from college. I wanted to get my own place but my mom convinced me to take residence in her one of her homes (she owns three) In lieu of payment, I was to fix the place up and keep it maintained until I got my credit score up. This has worked well for a few years. I paid off a major portion of my student loans and bought a car. The house looks better than it did when I first moved in.   Now, she had remarried and her new husband wants me to start paying rent. I never liked him and I don't him calling the shots. In truth, I had been wanting to leave this place for a while now. My friends have weekend getaways and no responsibilities to fix up their places. I have been offered to move in with one and split the rent on a two bedroom apartment. I can afford the rent.   I haven't brought it up to my mother yet but I want to know if an apartment will turn up their nose if when I tell them I was living rent free for 3 years. What if I put my mom as a reference and she tell them that I was a mooch?	No
"USA / Texas  The person that owns adjoining property to mine is considering selling it.  They say that all the other adjoining owners on other sides have also expressed interest.  I'm especially interested because my home looks out over this adjoining property, and I'm interested in keeping this great view that none of the other adjoining owners have.  I know there is a ""Right of First Refusal"" and ""Right of First Offer"" that I can potentially offer to buy from the adjoining owner.  But, is there such an agreement that would allow me to make a final counteroffer on any offer the adjoining owner is considering?  I really don't want to lose this chance if/when it comes up, but don't want to back myself into a corner either.  Thanks"	No

My partner and I are moving from Illinois to separate states. He will be working in New York and I will be attending grad school in Connecticut. He currently owns a car that is registered in IL which he will be giving to me to use while I'm in school.   I am trying to work through the mess of how/when we need to transfer everything. Can we both be on the title if we live in separate states? Is it easier to transfer title to me while we are still in IL and then register the car in CT? Will there be complications if he is on title still and is not a CT resident? Ideally he would remain on title as he will be paying for insurance, maintenance, and still will drive the car when we see each other.	No

"I'm guessing the answer is most likely ""yes"" but I would like to hear the opinion of someone with experience.    My husband and I recently moved out of our old apartment after renting for 2 years. Approximately one month later (today) we get a bill for $1135 for damages supposedly caused by us. There were 2 charges for carpet cleaning (~$85 each) and one charge of ~$900 for carpet replacement. There were some small charges for miscellaneous damages as well but I know we are responsible for those and I have no issue paying.    My issue is with the ""carpet cleaning/replacement"" charges. The majority of the apartment was vinyl flooring, no carpet, and I cleaned it thoroughly before we left. The only carpeted areas in our home are our office (11'0"" x 10'06"") which we hardly used and showed no signs of damage. The other room is our bedroom (11'06"" x 13'0"") which was mostly kept tidy although our cats did rip up a very small area of the carpet by the bedroom door, just nothing that would warrant replacing the carpet for the entire room.    The only carpeted area that I can think of that was possibly damaged were the stairs (cats liked to lounge there and have probably messed it up a bit). Don't get me wrong, I have no issue with paying for something which is my responsibility but.. they've got our $300 pet deposit, $500 regular deposit *and* they are charging us another $1100? And another two charges for cleaning? It sounds like we're being overcharged here. I also have a hunch that the carpet was quite old before we even moved in, the one in our study room smelled quite literally like cigarette smoke. I believe we mentioned this on the move-in sheet but I don't have a copy to prove it.   I have lived in apartments with full carpeting before and that was back when we were much more careless and our cat had a raging UTI so he peed in one or two places. That apartment cleaned the entire space and still gave us $150 of our deposit back.   I know I'm probably screwed because we don't have any documentation, but can our landlord really charge us this much for an old carpet, when the carpeted areas total about 1/3rd of the 1040 sq ft and were mostly kept in good condition? Are there any steps I can take to avoid this happening with my new apartment?"	No
Both the pool and hot tub broke and the property manager was no help in getting them fixed took me a month or two to get both fully operational (paid out of pocket)  Now there is new property management (the old ones were bad in many ways) and I tried to deduct expenses for fixes from rent check but she says that I should pay the rent in full and she will reimburse us via what the lease says they legally have to reimburse.  Now my question is, if it's not in the lease that they are responsible for keeping it working- does that mean I'm shit out of luck? Because we rented the place because there was a hot tub and pool, cost 3-4 grand to get various parts replaced and working. Why should we be responsible? It was their fault for hiring really bad management who by the way said go ahead we will reimburse you.   Such a headache, such a heartache I'm sick of all this bickering when I'm just a renter I hold no stake in the property long term.	No
My sister went to gas station to put gas. She paid to the guy and when she tried to fuel her car nothing came out. She went to the person and told him about the issue, he refused to give her the money back and he didn't care when she said she would call the cops. She called the cops but they guy had already closed the shop and left.   Isn't this considered sort of stealing? What should she do?	No
So I'm an employee at subway. This particular one is owned by a shady ass dude. He owns many others as well. To preface, this has never happened to me, I don't work enough hours, but there is hard proof this has happened to an old coworker and the regional manager of these subways. To avoid paying either of these people overtime, when they are working 60-80 hour weeks. He has been doing this for some time. He gets around paying them overtime by sending 2 checks, each from a different store. He has also payed many employees in cash/ with a personal check in place of a paycheck in order to keep the taxes that were taken out for himself. I have hard evidence of this too, even though it has never happened to me. The owner, let's call him DT, has been doing this for 5+ years, systematically taking advantage of undereducated employees and people dependent on a job at his subways so that no one has/can challenge him. So my question is this: is DT just shady as all fuck, or could they have a legitimate case against him?	No
My wife and I rent a small one bedroom home from her uncle, which shares a back yard on the same lot or two lots connected. My wife has some mental health issues that prevents her from working currently and last month is brutal and had a lot of things hit us hard and we were late on rent quite a bit. I talked to him and he made everything sound like it was okay.  I was messaged on facebook about the new lease even though our current lease doesn't end til November. He states that we must keep the attic window open from spring till fall or its a 200 fine per month. Anything left on my porch is $25 fine, she must park on the street and not use the three car spot on the lot. If our dog uses the yard to pee or poop its a $25 per incident. all of which end with can lead to eviction. I can't leave the property for more than 2 days with out written notification. Which I assume is part of his insurance clause. Also rent goes up in jan according to the new lease, and each day its late prior to the increase is $5 and $10 after increase per day after the 1st. In the original lease we had until the 5th before it was due. I am sure its all because of last months drama which I was hoping a close family member would have understood what I was going through trying to keep my wife alive.   The attic window is kinda insane to me, I get the theory behind it but we don't have insulation in the attic nor any moisture barrier and it just seems like in bringing an excess of moisture which is bad for electronics and other things. Maybe I am out of line.   I can't afford to move, and I will abide by his requests it just seems far fetched in some areas as if its more of a trap than anything.  Any ideas of this is all legal or is he over reaching in some areas?  Thank you kindly.	No
If I missed this on the Landlord Wiki, I apologize, but I'm pretty lost right now.  My SO and I rent a 1950's house in an up and coming area in our city from a family friend. When we moved in, we agreed to just go month to month, since our landlord intended on fixing up the property in bits and pieces. It's been almost a year and beyond a few issues, it's a situation that's worked out fairly well for us. However, at the beginning of August a friend moved in to rent the back bedroom. Because SO and I are pretty established in our setup, it was determined that roommate would get to claim the basement living room. He had discussed with our landlord his desire to have the flooring in the basement (70's avocado green shag, in case you were wondering) replaced before he moved in, and landlord agreed to fix it. Now, part of the problem is that roommate settled for getting the carpet steamed. I know this. But our landlord has sprung on us (while roommate is on a business trip) that she has decided to completely remodel the entire basement. Our issues are: 1. Had we known this would happen we would've moved most of roommates stuff into storage, but as is our storage capacities at the house are maxed out, in part due to just having a lot of shit, in part because landlord had 4 large appliances stored in our 1 car garage that she keeps saying she'll get rid of. 2. There appears to be no timeline for the completion of this project. When asked about a timeline, I was ignored. We have pets and lives and our landlord seems to think that because she owns the house our quality of life is second, or even third, to whatever she wants.  Do we have any leverage here? I know that without SO and I being on a proper lease it's tricky, but roommate moving in, then being told 7 days later he needs to essentially move all but his bedroom back out seems absurd. Are we allowed to require a timeline? Or request that a storage facility be paid for until it is done?   Any help, even the 'STFU and deal' is appreciated, just so I know where we stand with her and what we should/shouldn't tolerate.	No
I was arrested for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, but I was caught with both plant matter and concentrate (dismeanor amounts), along with 3 pieces of paraphernalia (3 packs of rolling papers). As a result, I had multiple charges for these different items. Is it likely that the judge will drop the redundant charges or will I face harsher consequences for these different illegal items?	No
"I have a boss that intentionally leaves me out of important meetings and assignments (he makes me do all the work, but never includes me in emails or meetings); so I dont get any recognition or limelight in the corporation. To list a few examples:  He has NEVER invited me to a meeting with the head of our dept, when my peers in other depts, all do.  My boss has also said that in order for me to get promoted, I need face time with the head of the dept.  Because he has a 20+ year relationship with this executive, he doesnt want anyone else getting the attention.    My boss has several others that work for him that manage other groups.  When we had target setting meetings with heads of each dept, I asked if I could attend and he said no one on his team would attend other than him (in other words, he would represent all of us in all meetings) - later I found out, the others did in fact attend the meetings.  Have proof of this in email.    There was a company open call for nominees to participate in a task force - my boss sent an email to his team asking if any of us were interested.  I said i was, and he later verbally told me I couldn't because I was looking to change depts.  Which makes ZERO sense, and he is just fishing for excuses.  This task force would be me in touch with major players in the organization and I feel like he doesnt want that.    He has made comments like: ""why is XYZ off today? they want to have a life outside of work?""....""we are glad XYZ left the company, b/c he always had family and kids issues and never worked late""  He has taken his (personal/home related) anger out on me...when I called him out on it, he said he wasn't aware he brought his personal life at work when it was utterly OBVIOUS.  He never agrees with my thoughts in meetings with others; uses sarcasm or interrupts me almost always, when others at the meeting agree with my opinions or thoughts.  Any advice would be highly appreciated.  This man has caused me serious stress. I have frequent heart palpitations resulting in appointments with a cardiologist.  I had huge nodules on my throat that ended up being benign, however doctor says they are caused by stress.  I experienced a bout of serious migraines which  led me to get a brain scan.  I'm at my dream job, but I cant handle this anymore.  Please help."	No
"Hello everyone, please help me out.   My Mom needs to get her insurance done, so I need to report my earnings from Wendy's to her report. The last month I worked at Wendy's was January 2017. Recently, I called and they gave me this site to go to which is called netsecure.adp. This is the site that shows all the times they paid me, and I need it to show it to the insurance people. I put in all my information and when I click ""enter"" it says my account is ""locked"". So I call back my Wendy's place and ask the guy if he can help me. I say, ""Can I have a number to talk to? What can I do to fix this? I really need this for my insurance."" He doesn't give me a number to talk to at all. He says I'm locked out my account because I don't work there anymore. I told him I really need it for my insurance, in which he replies ""I don't care"" with a chuckle. Please, someone help me out. I have contacted the store manager last week but she has not gotten back to me!!!!   Thanks everyone!"	No
"This is a long one:   My boyfriend (of 5 years) &amp; I went down to Miami to vacation with my sister and her husband. Our last weekend night there we decided to have a good time. We went to a few dance clubs and met up with 2 friends we had met in our hotel. My sister &amp; her SO decide to leave, but the other 4 of us stay back. After the club closed the one girl calls a Lyft to get us back to our hotel. The lyft driver some how convinced us we needed one more drink and that we should check out this 24/7 strip joint. We're all quite drunk and we're on vacation so we say hell lets do it.   We get there and drinks / entrance everything is so expensive, but non-the-less we decide to stay. I go to the bathroom and when I come out my boyfriend is no where to be found. He's a stand up guy, a hard worker, and never would have gone to this joint had it not been for me (oops). Anyways, I'm frantically looking for him, but this place is HUGE with multiple stories and various rooms, I cannot find him for a good half hour. Finally I see a stripper walking him somewhere while holding his hand. I run up to them and say what in the world is going on. Anyways, I bolt out, he tried to run after me, but I leave the club. Not thinking clearly, I'm drunk, hes totally wasted, &amp;  also it is 7am. He runs after me but I'm already in my own Lyft going to the hotel.   I finally crash, but wake up around 10 am realizing he never came in. My heart drops, he could be anywhere or dead! I call and text yet get no reply (only to find out that the club had seen all my calls and put his phone on do not disturb!!). I try to call the club (which like I said was 24/7) yet all I could get was automated message saying ""all circuits are busy please try your call again later"". I decide to go back and look for him because the alcohol has faded away and I genuinely was worried for his safety. I get there around 1030/11 am and see him completely passed out face down on a couch, hes not even remotely conscious. He should have never even been served anymore alcohol! The manager and a worker try to give him water but hes just slumped over and cannot even open his eyes. The manager told me he spent 2k on a private room and that he signed off  on it. The poor guy couldn't even spell his name, let alone sign off on anything. He has absolutely zero recollection of what happened and we're an honest couple so he would tell me the truth. I take him back to the hotel room and he passes out until 7pm that evening.  Once he wakes up we try to piece together what happened and decide to enjoy our last evening since its our last night. 2k is a lot of money, but it wasn't the end up the world.  This all happened between 7am-1030am on Sunday morning. Flash forward to Wednesday, and we find that multiple cards have been charged for a total of  over 7k!!! Plus cash was taken out from his bank account. There are no receipts proving anything, and the manager himself had said it was only 2k he spent. We called our credit cards and filled them in so they're going to do an investigation, but we have no idea where to go from here. I called the club and they won't do anything until we sign off on a form, which we don't feel comfortable doing because they obviously are scammers. We've since found this place has reviews online that similar things have happened to many other people. Some people claim they may have even been drugged, which honestly he very well could have been. I've never in 5 years have seem him in the state he was in when I went to pick him up that morning. It was pretty terrifying.  It seems to us after talking things over, that he was absolutely taken advantage of, and quite frankly robbed. This club is well known, so they must have video footage. With me being a witness picking him up I feel we may have some grounds to stand on to get at least SOME money back. We're just nervous to move anything forward, because from what it sounds this club has done some very shady things in the past.  We're just looking for any and all legal advice anyone can give.  What are our rights and how should we handle this? Do we contact the police? Should we fill out this affidavit from the strip club? We really have no idea what the protocol is, and no matter what there is no way he signed off on this many charges. They would have needed his signature over 8 times! The manager told me he had only signed once. So how are there this many charges?  The club will not give us any answers, and we're considering going to a lawyer, so we would appreciate any help we could get! Thanks!  TLDR; went to miami, drunkenly go to 24/7 strip club, lose boyfriend (who is 27 &amp; has never went to a strip club before), come back to said club frantically worried at 1030am, find boyfriend passed out on couch totally drugged/intoxicated, manager tells me he spent 2k, yet he was not even coherent enough to tell me his name, come back from vacation and multiple charges have been made on multiple cards for over 7k. We definitely got majorly scammed &amp; taken advantage of. We want to know what we can legally do.   Thanks everyone!   I don't want any negative or rude comments, we already feel bad enough as it is. We never go to strip clubs, and after doing much research I've found this is a common scam, and we're just looking for any guidance."	No
"Hey! My girlfriend was at fault in a minor car accident about a year ago. What I saw was minor damage to the bumper of the car in front of her. The person she hit was pretty nasty at the scene and was holding her neck saying she might be injured but refused an ambulance.   Girlfriends rates went up and she got a notice from her insurance that the other person is claiming injury.   However this other person happens to have a public Instagram and is a ""fit chick"" so lots of posts of her doing workouts/headstands/skydiving.   Is there anything my girlfriend should be doing about this? Passing along the info to her insurance?   "	No
I used to live in a house with 4 other people and we finally (after 2 months) received a bill from the previous landlord of the damages we owed. I moved in last year and took the room from a friend and when I moved in there was no walkthdough or anything. My former roommates had moved in two years prior and there was no walk through at all when they moved in. The previous tenants before there were friends as well, and they had left a lot of stuff in the house before they had moved in. They landlord actually charged us less rent because the carpets were already so bad and she was going to replace them anyway. Here is some of the damages she is claiming: (this was written on an iPhone sorry for bad formatting, the first number is what the repair was the second number is what we owe, I will put a WO in parenthesis)  Paint                                                                                $ 4,100                                                        (WO $2,000) Drywall Repair                                                                    2,075                                                         (WO 2,075) 9 new interior doors                                                            1,125                                                         (WO 1,125) Clean out garbage and items left                                           500                                                             (WO 500) Carpet\vinyl removal\disposal                                                700                                                            (WO 350) Cleaning(excessive                                                              1,100                                                        (WO 1,100) Plumbing repairs                                                                     475                                                           (WO 250) Misc-handles knobs, toilet seats, towel bars, switches and outlets and plates, power scrubbing of basement back rooms,etc.                                                                    2,525                                                        (WO 1,500) Carpet and vinyl                                                                   3,803.72                                                            (WO 1,800)  Totals                                                                                   $16,403.72                                           $10,700  Less deposit          $1100                                                                                                                  $9,600 Due from tenants  We are from Nebraska if that helps. We expected not to get our deposit back and we she did the final walk through with us before we moved out she did not mention anything major to fix or clean and she said was don't expect your deposit back. This house is a modern house, probably built early 00's but still has seen a lot of wear and tear over the years and we did not cause all this damage. Any help would be appreciated, thank you all in advance!	No
"My father has just declared that I am ""kicked out"" of the house after he started hitting me as a result of an argument we had. We had gone into town a few hours ago and had an argument that resulted in us taking separate cars home. Upon my arrival home, himself arriving shortly after me, he declared that he was cutting everything and said that I need to get out of his house. He tried to call our phone service provider to cut my phone but was unable to, Mom pays for the bills, and proceeded to take his glasses off, get into my face and starting yelling at me to and that he would call the cops. I say I won't leave my moms house so he grabs me by the shoulders and tells me to GTFO so to speak. After I say no he pushed me onto the couch and went away yelling and later came back into the room with my computer and broke it over his knee when I said I wouldn't leave again. He pulled me up by the shirt ripping it and tried to force me out the door at which point one of the dogs jumped up and scratched him so he kicked it in the face and threw me back down. He left again and later came back scanning the couch apparently looking for his phone, which he had thrown sometime during, and told me to give it to him. I told him I did not have his phone so he grabbed me by the hair and pulled me to the other end of he couch so he could look where I was sitting. Thinking it was under the couch he had to take it apart, our couch is 5 segments all hooked together at the bottom so he can't just pull the Middle section out. He moved me to the end sections where the new puppy had moved to cover me during it but he was still shaking from what was happening, and after not moving off the couch my dad pulled him off by the back of his head and rolled me off the couch before saying he would kill me if I didn't leave. After finding his phone he proceeded to start mocking me for being useless and lazy and left to go do yard work for the neighbors saying that I no longer have a home. As much as I want to stay and fight this and take legal action I'm not sure as it would just bring trouble for my mom and younger siblings and I am considering just staying at a hotel in town for the next few weeks til a decision is made amongst them but at the same time I don't want to leave them alone with him so any immediate advice would be greatly appreciated.  tl;dr: Dad and I got into an argument, starting hitting me and dogs when we got home, said I'm kicked out and went to work"	No
I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this	No
I would like to state that I am appealing this ticket with or without a lawyer, and I am asking for advice on my best course of action.  There was a crazy amount of traffic where I had to drive today.  There was the usual Tourist traffic for people heading down to the cape, alongside the typical traffic, and also a funeral procession clogging things up.  I was in a position where to travel at a safe speed of 75 mph (speed limit is 65mph, but the average travelling speed is between 70-80mph) I had to change lanes frequently.  My goal was to get around the funeral procession travelling at 65 mph in the middle lane, and to not get trapped behind the individuals travelling 70mph in both the left and middle lane (the person in the right hand lane was not passing, and was in fact slowing down for some reason).  I had to change lanes numerous times, but did so using my turn indicator and while paying attention to where my vehicle was.  I observed a state trooper fly up the highway with damage to his driver's side front end.  I was currently in the right hand lane, to the right of the two cars travelling at 70 mph.  He had his lights on, and as I pulled over he pulled over VERY close, and I pulled forward another foot or so to avoid being struck.  I pull out my licence, wait for the cop.  He reaches in and takes it without a word from either of us.  He comes back and hands me the ticket without saying anything else, he was positioned in a way where it was hard for me to look at him or see anything.  I say thank you, he gets in his vehicle and leaves, with me stuck in the breakdown lane in heavy traffic for 2 miles.  Tl;dr I was trying to get around really slow and distracted drivers, did so in a way that was a bit rushed, and a state trooper who was obviously having a bad day gave me a ticket without so much as a 'Do you know why I pulled you over?'  ----- The ticket states...  89-4A Weaving x6 $105  89-4A Unsafe Lane Change x3 $105  90/17 95 in a 65 with no boxes checked (Posted, Not Posted, Clocked, Lidar, Radar, Estimated)  I know 100% that I wasn't travelling at 95 miles per hour.  I was at most 80-85, and only so I could pass the traffic that was inconsistently between 60-75.  I do not have the best record, I had a similar ticket 4 years ago (which is the last spot on my record, which goes away in 5 months).  With that said, my record has been improving over time.  My question here is, is a traffic lawyer going to do me any favors, or is it not worth the time?  I was quoted $700 flat from a lawyer earlier today, which would make sense long-term if this entire ticket gets dismissed, but I am not sure if that would even happen.  How much more likely is the case going to be dismissed/reduced with a lawyer present than if I represented myself?  I am capable of looking up laws, cleaning up my appearance, and get to the court on time.  With the information above, if you can offer any insight it would be appreciated.  I have never been to court before (no criminal record, never fought a ticket) and want to do my best.	No
"It has been a drawn out process in which she has been retaliating against me.   Essentially I had been told one thing (attendance point policy was not thoroughly enforced by her) before I reported her for theft, but afterward I ended up receiving disciplinary actions on attendance which no one on my team was receiving prior, or seemed to be after.  I noticed my boss had a ""tell"" when she was caught lying, which was to explain a process or reasoning behind a situation in full detail and seemingly out of the blue. The product that was missing? It was found in an obscure location and we don't know why it was there, but it was there.   I let my boss' questionable behavior and seemingly loose morals slide for a while, until the stress became unbearable. At which point I reported her, it was anonymous at first. A week or so after the report I brought up the fact I was stressed and made a report to the manager above my boss (who is also close friends with my boss) I had falsely believed this would help the situation and I wanted the stress to go away because I knew I was pregnant and I was concerned the stress would negatively effect my pregnancy (and even told my boss' boss as much).   That was all back in February. I spent time in the following months by feeling miserable but also looking to transfer to a different department or store. However I felt concerned and afraid my boss would not allow me to transfer and once she knew I was trying would react negatively against me even more than before. By May the work environment had become so stressful to me that I told my boss I would rather die than go to work so I needed to seek help. I spoke with HR and they brushed my concerns aside. Then I set up a leave of absence to seek help on the issue. As soon as I heard a return to work date from my doctor I notified my boss and said I would like part time hours (I was working full time before leave). My boss made no indication this would be an issue or against policy until two weeks later on the day before I was set to return. On the day before my leave was up I was informed by HR that I needed a doctor's note with restrictions stating I must work part time for my health. If that option was not used I was to apply to any job in the company as part time. Not my job I had, but any job with no guarantee I would be hired.  Being that it was the end of a business day I could not reach my doctor to get a note in time so I was unable to work my first shift back. My doctor was then out of the office for 6 days (although two were weekend days) I had been scheduled to work in quite a few of those days so I emailed HR asking what I needed to do until my doctor returned. HR directed me to the 3rd party leave office but my question pertained to the store operations, so I rephrased my question in another email and finally got an answer.   By the time my doctor responded I decided to quit. I would have loved to stay at that job but the attitudes of the office and management made me feel like a target.   I suppose what I am hoping for from this situation is at least to have my medical bills paid. I am coming to terms with not having a great job (besides my boss) but am disappointed things happened this way despite telling every manager I spoke with about this situation ""I don't want to get fired for being honest"" and being reassured that nothing negative would come from me making a report."

Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	No
I started working for the company over 4 months ago and I have only taken one day off (for my grandmas funeral). My mom thinks I have a staph infection but I want to go to the doctor to make sure that I am ok ( I have been feeling nauseous for the last few days and I have this sore on my foot that itches). The company has about 12 employees including me. My real question really is if there is anything in Texas law about paid time off, vacation days, and sick days, for a small company. I also was wondering about not receiving check stubs when I am being paid. He takes taxes, SS, and health insurance out of my check and that is shown at the bottom of the actual check but I feel like check stubs should be in place. Any thoughts and advice??	No
"Original engine in my car died. I decided to replace the engine with a rebuild engine from a reputable company out of MD (I'm in KS) with great ratings. I also picked up their additional ""No Fault"" warranty because this engine is prone to troubles. Replacement went fine, but 2k miles into the rebuilt engine blows a rod out the bottom of the engine.  This time the rod does an additional ~6,000 worth of damage to other components. Company is willing to replace engine but says the rest of the damage is not on them. New engine is useless without the additional repairs. So basically I spent 4,700 dollars for a engine replacement plus 500 for the no fault warranty additional coverage, and now I need to spend 6,000 more to repair the damage their engine caused?  Seems illegal to me. Thanks in advance!"	No
Before I hire a lawyer, I would like to know what my legal recourse is in this situation, if any. I have never posted on reddit before, so hopefully I'm doing this right.   I got married in 2005. A month prior to our wedding, we bought a condo together. From the time we were married until the time we divorced,  we both worked and paid the bills equally. Our divorce was not particularly messy, but was not exactly amicable either. I gave him everything and signed a quit claim deed to the condo. He was not a kind man, and I just wanted out as quickly as possible. Our divorce was final in 2011 and I went on my way too build a life for myself.   About a year after the divorce, I attempted to get a car loan. Much to my surprise, he never took me off the mortgage of the condo or the home equity line of credit. Due to that, I was unable to get a loan because my debt to income ratio was too high, on paper. When confronted with this, he said he didn't want to refinance to get my name off of everything and he would get it done within  one (more) year.   Well, it's been 6 years and my name is still on the mortgage of a condo that he and his wife rent out and make a profit off of.  My name is still on the home equity line of credit he has maxed out. I am unable to get an apartment, or car loan on my own because of this. I have a pretty great business plan and opportunity to make it happen, buy i can not get a business loan. I pay all my bills and don't have much debt, but this keeps me from moving ahead in life.   I feel this is the one last way he has control over me. Is there anything I can do? Am I entitled to any of the profit from the condo? I was very ill when I signed the divorce papers and believe I should not have legally been able to. He had a very good, expensive lawyer and I didn't have one at all.   Does anyone have any advice?	No
We just moved out of our apartment in FL after doing a walk through and being charged a $75 cleaning fee. They said everything seemed good and we would get our last water bill later on.  Today we got a bill for ($70) for the water. We moved out mid month and usually the water bill was ($40) for the whole month.  They also charged us ($295) for replacing the living room carpet, which they had seen during the walk through.  After doing some research online I found that normal wear and tear does not allow them to ask the tenant to pay for it. I guess it had some stains where the furniture had been sitting. But the carpet was old when we moved in.  We did not take pictures because of the walk through, we assumed everything was fine.  What do we do/say from here?	No
Hey, so the gist of the story is as follows. I have a safe in my house that is key operated that used to contain $11000 as well as a rolex and some other valuables, during a party I had a few weeks ago some friends slept at my house, one of them in my room because it has two beds.  Today, I opened my safe to discover $5700 was missing.  To clear a few things up..  * The safe is in my room  * I never take my money out of the safe and the safe stays in my room so there is no way I would have misplaced the money, I know when I have opened the safe, and the last time I opened it everything was there.  * The only people that knew about the location of my safe was a few of my closest friends   * I have searched my house to see if my money was anywhere just in case  * the key to the safe was on my keychain which was next to me while I slept in my room  *  No one broke into my house or has otherwise had any unsupervised access to my room, the only time when the theft could have happened was while I slept after the party  * Me and my friends are all 17  * The money is all mine and of course I want it back  What steps would you suggest to recover the money, there is only 3 or 4 people it could have been, I have proof in the form of pictures and receipts that I had the money.	No

Location is Kentucky. MSPaint is here [http://imgur.com/a/eyigA](http://imgur.com/a/eyigA).  I've not got all the information I really need yet, I'm stuck at work. A contractor (i assume hired by the county) is laying pipe in my neighbor's yard and will soon make it to ours. I'm worried about a section of the pipe that will have to be laid underneath a section of property covered in decorative river rock large pebbles up to the roadway.   I figure the county has an easement to allow the work to be done but what responsibility does the contractor have to do minimal damage or put the property back as it was? Any?	No
I've run into a bit of an issue with my dishwasher and I would be interested in getting your opinions on how to resolve it.  The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.  After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.  After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options:  -Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher  -40% off a new Bosch replacement.  I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?  The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.  What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this?   A 40% discount would have seemed to be a fair, good faith resolution if it wasn't for the inflated pricing and all of the associated inconveniences.	No
Two weeks ago I found a nice room in a house on craigslist to rent out for a month and went to the location to check it out. The lady was nice and offered me a good deal in a nice house in a nice neighborhood.   I have been living at this new place for a week and I found out yesterday that she was renting his husband's place and apparently they were fighting and not on good terms at all. I was woken up near midnight last night as the owner (the husband) came in and told me to get out immediately (his wife was gone for the weekend). He eased up after I explained my situation and realized it wasn't my fault at all and said I could perhaps stay until I find another place to live. He also said that he is willing to pay me back the remainder of my rent if I don't end up staying there.   I was wondering if I have to leave the house, or could I stay given that I have already paid rent to his wife? What are my rights in this situation??	No
We moved out of an apartment and a couple weeks later received our full security deposit in the mail. About a month after getting our deposit back, we received a hefty bill in the mail for carpet replacement. Can they do that? (This is in the state of Missouri if that helps)	No
The fire probably was electrical but that is not 100% confirmed by the fire investigators. Probably the most stupidest mistake to not get renters insurance but here we are. Red Cross gave us a voucher and we are relying on the generosity of our friends and family but everything is basically ruined. We were month to month after living there for over a year, can we take the landlord to civil court to pay for the costs of our belongings and moving? The fire was not our fault and the cost of living is getting really ridiculous so we are really struggling. Could we get a prorated rent refund for July back? The property mgmt company is giving us the round around so I'm turning to Reddit. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!!	No
"I have over 70hours at work. I work in a restaurant in florida. The owner hasnt paid multiple employees and has also had 2 illegals work for him recently before they got ""married"" to citizens. I am not sure where to go from here. I have a previous paystub and also have the other employees that are frustrated. I quit last night after he refused to pay and he got very confrontational. I called the police and made a little report but they said they cant help me and its a legal matter. Im frustrated and now jobless but thankful i dont have to work for such a low life. How should i approach this matter? I feel like going into the establishment tomorrow and recording conversations between the other employees who havent been paid aswell as me amd getting a lawyer. Good idea? "	No
I have recently been stopped by a CHP in Southern California going 65 on a 55. I explained to the CHP that I've had a chronic series of bladder, prostate, and kidney infections the past few months and was in the middle of an episode on my way to get treatment at a clinic close by. He seemed to chuckle a bit and proceeded to give me a ticket. Do I have any legal standing or way of fighting this ticket in court?	No
The landlord for my house is in another state and is my father. As such, I tend to handle most of the operations for the house. The bills are all in my name (Internet, water, electric), and so I go ahead and pay them and have my roommates pay their share. I have a receipt book, and my roommates who are about to move in are requesting receipts for them paying their share. How do I go about this so that I don't get myself into trouble?	No
The title says it all. My sister's probation officer is as negligible as a law enforcement professional can be.   A bit of a back story on how my sister ended up on probation is needed. My sister at 7 months pregnant decided to drive heavily intoxicated with my 2 nieces. She was arrested, charged with 3 counts of child abuse/endangerment and a DUI. Even after being released from a short stay in jail and giving birth to my nephew, she continued to drink. Her PO gave her an option - 3 months mandatory in rehab or 3 months in jail. She decided to go to rehab and things were going pretty well.   Fast forward to today and she has not done any of her mandatory parenting classes or DUI classes and she is continuing to do drugs and drink. And this is not my opinion. If you took one look at my sister, you would know. Her behavior has caused my nephews and nieces assigned social worker to contact her PO and tell him that he needs to take a closer look at what is going on.   To top it all off, she has committed fraud 2 times already. First time she stole a check from a mailbox, went to a cash checking place and cashed it. The business found out what went on and filed a police report. Just today my dad's accountant made him aware of 3 stolen personal checks that my sister cashed. My dad filed a report with police but they stated that they can issue a warrant because it's hear say even though my dad had images of the stolen checks.   My parents called the PO and let him know they are extremely worried about her and his response was that he is aware of what is going on and that  he's going to give her a week to get it together! It's a joke. My parents response was that she could be dead in a week with how fast she is spiraling out of control. Yet she goes to probation today and nothing happens.   Somehow she has managed to pull one over this guy and it's sickening how oblivious to everything this guy is. He is completely negligent. She has somehow passed her drug/alcohol tests for probation (which are scheduled by the way and only a mouth swab) but she has not done any of her mandatory random drug tests for social services because they are random urine tests that she will fail.   My family and I want to file a grievance because the man is not doing his job. To be honest, I think he's sleeping with her. He doesn't know where she lives and she is lying about having a job. It's mind boggling. What do I do? I'm in Orange county, California.	No
So I will keep this brief. Bought cigs for a friend since she is between paychecks. She told me I would have to buy them as her license was expired and the place we were at has legitimately given her shit for expired license before. She can not get her license renewed until she passes some court mandated course or whatever. I dont have all the details.   Anyways long story short. I Buy them for her and a cop sees me hand them to her after buying them. He checks her ID, sees the date, and then tells her that it is expired and that he would need a valid ID.   She says that is all she has and that I was driving. Cop looks at me and takes my license. He goes into his car and comes back out with a ticket for me to sign. Buying cigs for a minor...   The date clearly says born in 94 on her license but because its expired he apparently can ignore this?   Is there an easy way I can get this dismissed? I do not have the money for a lawyer as I recently had to pay for hernia surgery and I am tapped till the end of the year.   Can I get her to take her birth cert, SS card, and expired license with me up to the courthouse?	No
**Background**   August of 2016, I was ticketed for driving without insurance and for speeding.  I went to court and was given a fine and the ticket was removed from my record  for good behavior.   The speeding ticket was thrown out.      Two weeks ago, I was pulled over for failing to yield at a stop sign. I was also ticketed for driving under a suspended licence.  My car was impounded  due to the traffic stop.   I did not know the reason for my drivers licence being suspended.   I contacted the dmv as soon as I could to find the reason i was suspended.  I found out when I changed insurancce companies I neglected to add the sr-22 to my insurance plan.    I quickly got it corrected.     **Plan**  I dont have any money for a defense attourney. My court day is August 21.  I plan to go Tuesday during open session to get this sorted out,   Here is what I am planning to do  1.  Bring proof that I had no lapse in insurance. 2. Explain that when I got new insurance I neglected to get sr-22 due to thinking it was automatically added by the system. 3. Explain I would have never driven if i knew my licence was suspended.  4.  I was not sure if i should bring this up.  I am going to vietnam to volunteer teaching children English.  This is my biggest concern  that i will no longer be able to go.   How should I handled talking to them? Should I answer only questions presented? Should I ask to explain my situation first? Any tips would be greatful!!	No
"Alright, folks. I am a single mom who was renting a townhouse apartment in Beaverton, Oregon. Trying to cut costs a bit, I decided to get a roommate. I posted an ad on Craigslist and got a hit from a woman (let's call her Ally) who came over to view the place. She seemed relatively normal, passed a criminal background check, and was able to provide me with recent pay stubs. I agreed to let her move in and told her that she just needed to get her name on the lease within two weeks (per my lease agreement).  A week after moving in, I received a call from Child Protective Services, stating that they were concerned for the safety and well being of my three year old daughter. Obviously, I was super confused, so the caseworker explained that she had been informed by Ally's mom that Ally had moved into an apartment providing childcare in exchange for rent and that Ally has a long history with DHS due to child abuse and neglect charges against her own two children that have been removed from her custody. I immediately explained that a) my daughter comes to work with me everyday (I work at a preschool), b) I had NO idea that Ally had that type of history (Ally has never been arrested for the abuse and neglect, so it didn't show up on a background check), and c) that I was under the impression that Ally had a job and could pay rent that way.  Right after that phone call, I sent a text to Ally telling her that she needed to find a new place to live in the next two weeks. In the meantime, my daughter and I stayed with family. Ally wasn't happy about it, but she agreed. The night before Ally was supposed to be out of the apartment, she sent me a text stating that she had rights and that she wasn't going to be leaving anytime soon. I called the police, but they told me that even though she wasn't on the lease, she had ""established residence"" and that I would have to file for a legal eviction notice with the courts (and pay the hefty filing fees). I called my apartment manager and explained the situation to her as well, but she told me that since I had an ""unauthorized tenant"" living in the apartment, I was going to receive a 72-hour eviction notice, but if I broke my lease ($1600 fee), I could save myself from having an eviction on my record and the complex would handle the eviction process of Ally. So, that's what I did and I terminated my lease on April 1st by handing in my keys and giving a written notice of my intent to terminate the lease.  Meanwhile, after I moved my daughter and I out, Ally moved in her boyfriend (whom she has a no-contact order with due to prior domestic abuse issues), her two dogs, a parrot, and her 3 adult bunnies (who quickly multiplied).  Well, after eviction notices, court appearances, and finally changed locks, Ally and her boyfriend moved out on June 30th... nearly 3 months after I moved out. I am now being footed the bill for those three months of rent (1150/month), the apartment's electricity (even though I turned off the electricity from the electric company), storage fees (due to the things that they left behind when they finally moved out), and an estimated $8000 in damages (upstairs carpeting and downstairs kitchen linoleum has to be completely replaced, due to massive amounts of bunny feces and urine, several doors and walls need to be replaced/repaired due to holes, plumbing repair due to them flushing something down the toilet that busted a pipe, and a new refrigerator, since the door was broken off) because she was not on the lease.  I have spoken briefly with an attorney, but he said that since it was my name and I ""violated the lease agreement"" by moving someone in that wasn't on the lease (even though she was supposed to get on it within the two weeks), I probably don't have much of a chance against the apartment complex. He suggested that I could sue Ally, but she doesn't have any money to speak of (apparently she forged the pay stubs she gave me and hasn't worked in over three years) and I don't want to dig my hole deeper by adding on a bunch of court and attorney costs.  What do I do...???"	No
"For ease, I will describe what I understand to be true as fact. I'm happy to clarify anything that seems unlikely, my information comes from various sources including the subject.   A transient (T) was falsely arrested a few months ago. She was already on probation for multiple minor charges (i.e. drunk in public), when she was shopping at a local store and had an altercation with an employee. The police were called, they looked for a reason to arrest her, and the store clerk said T spit on her. T is adamant that any spit that may have come out was accidental because she was talking loudly.   After some time trying to meet probation requirements, T was eventually picked up for missing a court date and has been in jail awaiting trial for months. Her Public Defender was going to take it to trial because the DA wouldn't budge and wanted to throw the book at her, the PD thought that was dumb. For background: T is mentally ill, physically disabled, has cognitive impairments, TBI, has been living on the streets for a decade, in and out of jail for minor offenses and drugs but nothing serious.   T has court this morning, and I found out late last week that it is for sentencing. I spoke to T (who is not always the most reliable source, but tends to be honest with me), and her PD convinced her to plea no contest, otherwise they were going to give her a year and a half because ""the judge doesn't want a trial."" Her PD also told her she'd seen surveillance video, which does *not* show the store clerk reacting as though she'd been spat on.  I'm concerned T doesn't understand that pleading no contest to something she was falsely arrested for means she won't be able to potentially recover damages from the false arrest (she had been trying really hard at that point and there had been some improvement, and she was *on her way to therapy* when this incident happened). I want to send an email to her PD before the sentencing to express my concerns that T isn't fully mentally competent and that she doesn't understand the implications here. I have about an hour.  Also, I know this kind of plea coercion is common, but I hope I don't sound too naive when I say I don't like it being used on a vulnerable member of the population. She has literally no resources in life, it was all too easy for a retail clerk to get annoyed that her authority wasn't respected and have this person incarcerated for months for it, and the police actively helped.   Question is: Anything specific I should/shouldn't say in this letter?"	No
I need some help here. (All events/transactions occurred in CA where I am also living with a valid CA address.)  I purchased a new car on 5/27/17. My credit is poor but my income is high so I qualified for a loan with a high down payment and a trade in. After being approved, I worked a better deal with the dealership to simply put more money down and not use the trade in. We agreed, signed all the paperwork, I drove off the lot with a brand new car.  My first payment is due 7/11/17. I've been trying for the last few days to enroll online and pay my loan but had no luck. Kind of panicked, I emailed my dealership for some help and then called the financeer who tells me that I have two loan open - one that's expired and one that's declined.  I called the dealership immediately who tell me, 'We've been trying to get a hold of you, we need the car back immediately. The financeer sent back the contract when the trade-in was pulled from the table. Bring the car back today or tomorrow. By boss just told me about this this weekend and said we need to get the car back from you.'  I responded with, 'No one has attempted to contact me about this. I have emails from my salesperson asking me how my car is over the last few weeks but no emails, calls, texts, or postal mail regarding the contract or financing. I will not turn in the car until I speak with the Director of Finance.'  They told me the Director will be in in the morning and will call me first thing.  I'm not really sure what to do here. This happened to me last year when trying to purchase a new Mazda and that dealership had mailed certified letter rescinding the contract on the 10th day so I was obligated to return the car. Need some help.  tl;dr - Dealership could not find financing 30 days after signing the contract and is asking for the car to be returned. Do I have any rights?	No
A work colleague is moving here from France in August 2017. He will eventually be purchasing my car, but can not get a state driver's license or registration until he has a social security number. This can apparently take up to 6 weeks. The US midwest in a small town is difficult to navigate without a car.  I want to help him out, but dont want to be liable for any accidents.  What is my best option to stay legally safe but still help him?	No
There‚Äôs a t-shirt company we order from frequently, and back over a year ago they accidentally shipped us 2500 worth of merch in packages with our company name. Products we did not order. We called them to tell them we received some merch in error, and they said they would send someone to pick it up.   Fast forward a few months and long story short, no one ever came to get it, after some fussing back and forth with them about why we weren‚Äôt going to be able to drop the merch off at their nearest location (30 mins away), we received an email that said they would send a carrier to get it, and that the carrier would provide their own labels so there was no need to print one off. Stuck them on the porch, came home the next day, they were gone. (We never have problems with things being stolen at that location).   Now six months later, they are saying they never received them back. The carrier never left any kind of notice of pick up on the porch of any kind of info, but they don‚Äôt usually do that‚Äôs anyways.  They are asking for the tracking info, but we were never provided that. They are saying if we can‚Äôt provide it or proof of delivery, then we will be charged for the products.   Remember, we didn‚Äôt order these. They were shipped to the wrong place, with our name on the boxes. We were never given any tracking info. I told her that whoever initiated the pick up should have the tracking information, but she said it didn‚Äôt work like that. It‚Äôs all just a bunch of bullshit, I really want to just say f it.    Is there any kind of legal precedence for saying businesses cant just send you shit and say you owe for it unless you can prove you sent it back?	No
"The landlord asked my to do an inspection of my new apartment and submit it within 48 hours.  There is language that says that the apartment is in good &amp; clean condition except for what is noted in the form.  I asked for verbal clarification, the leasing agent said I should list ""every scratch"" or else I am responsible for it. And if I fail to submit it in 48 hours, then I forfeit my security deposit. They say they hold my mailbox key (which the lease says I've received) until I submit the form.  Now, I know the part about forfeiting my security deposit is false. Indiana doesn't have great renter's laws, but it does only allow the security deposit to be used for actual damages.  The building was built in the 40's. I find it charming, but it is old. It would be impractical to list every single thing that isn't part of ""good condition."" The wood floors are in terrible shape. There are definitely years of patched holes on the walls.  I did take lots of pictures. (With my phone, so they are time-stamped.) But in my opinion, that should be to protect me. They should have their own records of the condition of the apartment. I shouldn't have to provide it for them and say anything I miss is in good condition at move-in. I don't even know what their standards are.  I feel like they're unfairly shifting the burden of proof onto me. I told them I declined to submit the form and invited them to enter without the notice called for in the lease and conduct their own inspection. They declined and told me that I need to submit the form.  It wouldn't be a big deal, but there was some nonsense in the leasing process that made me question their competence. I don't want to be on the hook for things just because they missed them. I think it's reasonable to expect my records to be for me, not in place of them doing their job. I worry that them knowing exactly what I have evidence of and what I don't might cause them to take less care in comparing inspections before they assess damages.  Should I just suck it up and submit the form to make sure I'm on good terms with the office staff? Or would I be giving up rights to defend myself from unfair taking of my security deposit?"	No
He was served a pay or quit notice and then surrendered the keys. There was a court date he didn't know about and I assume a default judgment against him for $3500 or so.   My question is; was he actually evicted? I can't seem to find an eviction record anywhere, just a court case ending with a writ of possession.  Also I guess it may have expired? But I thought that took 7yrs, it's been 3.	No
"I have been having AC issues for months at my current apartment. They have sent someone over 10 times to ""fix it"" and each time they do it ends up not working again in about a week. Basically my AC unit isn't able to keep up and keep my place lower than 78-80 degrees.  Today they sent out an email (after complaining about my AC yesterday to them) reading ""POWERCOMPANY recommends to keep the thermostat at 78 degrees during the day and 80 degrees while you are away."" to the whole neighborhood, which I feel like is directed towards me.  My question is, are they allowed to use this as an excuse to not fix whatever the issue is in my apartment? I can't even have a 3rd party come out and look because they have the AC unit behind a dead bolt.  Thanks."	No
"I'm still livid from this and I will be speaking to an attorney this week but I just wanted to get this all down in writing because I still can't believe it actually happened.   So I (single male early 30's) bought a house in a neighborhood outside of a large city in TN. I moved in about 6 months ago. I got a job here and after around 2 years of living in an apartment, I wanted to get a house because my employer made a long term path clear to me. However, I think I may have been too quick to buy. My brother in law is from the area and was helping me find a place and he really convinced me to get this house and I pulled the trigger. This is mostly useless info, but some background might be helpful because -  This home was in a HOA. Honestly, the president of the group met with me when I was talking with the realtor and told me how the dues help to keep the communal small park area clean and they also act as a neutral party for neighbor disputes so I thought it sounded great. The dues were low and the house/neighborhood was great. She sent some paperwork when I bought the house, and I signed.  After this, my job got much more busy and I had to work 60-ish hour weeks. On Saturday's I would invite some work friends over and we would have a BBQ in my yard and watch some shows. This was a dream come true for me. I always wanted to own my own place and just be able to be my own landlord.  A few weeks ago I received a letter from the HOA president I spoke to saying that there were multiple complaints of noise ""after a reasonable hour"" from my home. I honestly thought that was fair so I moved my get-togethers inside and thought it was the end of it.  HOWEVER - yesterday. The HOA president sent me an email saying that my home was ready to be sold. As in she said in the email ""Your home has found a buyer and we look forward to you accepting the offer"". She immediately sent a second email from a realty company with the further info about the offer on my home. I checked that realtors website and there are pictures of my home with all of my things inside of it. Someone had been in my home when I was not here and took pictures. What the absolute shit.  I emailed her back immediately because it was obvious she came into my home, but how? And she said this: ""In the HOA agreement you signed, a concerned neighbor may enter your home if there is a risk of harm, or if it might be in the interest of the neighborhood itself"". I wish I was making this up. She then said ""Because of your repeated noise violations it was in our best interest to facilitate selling your home.""  I don't even know where to begin. Did she do something illegal even if it was in the agreement? I know I should have not signed this and it was stupid. But she was obviously just helping herself inside my home for weeks and I just feel like that cannot be right."	No
So our landlord just told us that she is filing for bankruptcy and that she will be foreclosing on the apartment we live in. First she said that we would be able to stay in said apartment after she forecloses until after the bank is done which could take up to 2 years(said it happened to a friend of hers and she didn't have to pay rent. But now she wants us to sign a lease termination fee and is saying that we won't be able to stay. Not really sure what to do I looked around at some chicago laws and some places say that we would be able to live there until the end of our lease either for free or by paying rent just not to her to the bank or someone assigned by the bank. she sent a lease termination form from her lawyer and wants us to sign it Please help I have no idea what to do.	No
I'm a part of the alumni board of my old Fraternity.  Recently, we've had one of the kids break in a couple of interior doors after imbibing a little too much.  Regardless to say, he's being a little s*** about it, and we're having difficulty collecting money for the damages, even though we feel pretty good about the evidence we have against him.  We've gotten to the point where we've gave him one last opportunity to pay, and now the question is whether to take him to collections or to small claims court.  The first door he broke was when he was still a tenant at the house, and there are clauses in the lease regarding damaging property.  The second door was a couple months after he graduated, and after his lease was up.  One other issue is that the guy now lives out of state.  I forget the final cost of the repairs, but we're only asking for $600, which is less than the total.  While we still want the money, we're really at the point right now where we want to set a precedent, and we don't want him to get away with it.  With all this said, what's the best course of action: small claims court or collections?	No
My current landlord isn't great, in fact he's a slumlord. My partner and I are moving out of his building, code enforcement has been contacted, etc...  But I have a bad feeling that he does not actually have our security deposit.   Thankfully, in Maine he legally has to provide me with the account information in which my deposit is held at my request.  When I reached out to the bank with that information today, I was informed that it was not a landlord-tennant account but instead my landlord's personal savings account, meaning I am not able to get any account information from the bank regarding if my money is in it.   I tried looking through our statues and could find nothing about if he is able to keep this money in his personal account and before I make a big deal out of this I want to make sure I'm actually in the right.	No
"I lived in an apartment in Missouri for a year and paid my gas bill for the amount charged each month. Recently, I moved to another apartment in Missouri which uses the same gas company, so I am a continuing costumer. For my first bill at the new apartment I was billed around $600 for something called ""service transfer."" After speaking to a customer service representative the company informed me that they had read the meter wrong (or that the meter had been reporting incorrect numbers--I'm not exactly sure which situation it is) at my old apartment for the entire year. So they reassessed the meter for the past year and charged me the difference: $600. Now this is significant because it's around double what I had paid for the whole year. My final bill (before the $600) was around $40--which I paid in full. In fact I used my heating and gas services differently than I would have because I thought the services were cheap enough that I could afford it.   My question is do I have legal grounds to dispute and to not pay these charges? While I understand that I did technically use those services, I paid what they billed me and it is not my responsibility to check that they are reading the meter correctly each month.   (Sorry if it's the wrong tag, first time posting)"	No
I am trying to move out of my apartment but my roommate is staying. His girlfriend was going to replace me on the lease but she was denied because her credit is only in the mid-low 600s.  She has a full time job and is just leaving another more expensive apartment complex where she lived at for 3 years that is under the same rental management company as this one. She also has a steady full time job and only 6k in student loan debt. She thought that would make approval simple but not so.   I am only told of her denial after apartment hunting and being approved for another apartment out of state and after she moved in all her stuff. They were trying to be slick and just move her in and hope no one cares or notices as long as my half of the rent continues getting paid.   I figure my complex will have the same view so they may not allow us to sign an agreement that my name stays but she'll pay my half or any other kind of deal.   Could we all be evicted because they just did what they wanted? 	No
Hi there and thanks for your help!   So me and my two housemates decided to sublet our apartment over the summer so that we could go home and not have to pay rent for the apartment while it was empty. Enter our three sublettors, the first two are absolutely fine but the third guy has repeatedly made rent late and for the last two months just hasn't paid it at all. I was wondering what our legal grounds for eviction are and how to protect ourselves if tries to sue or something.  Thanks for your help again.	No
I accepted a small gift from a vendor that provides resources to the public company I work for with the gift being worth about $5. This was an informal chance meeting where the vendor was throwing a mixer and I recognized them, we talked for a bit and they then gave me that gift which I took without even thinking about it. Apparently someone reported this to my company because HR is now calling me in for multiple sessions of intense questioning. I have no authority at my job, I'm just a lower level cog with nobody under me and no purchasing power.   Am I looking at jail-time or a felony? That's what they hinted at in the meetings.	No
I was in a car accident a few weeks ago after buying a gram from a dealer.  The cops showed up to help despite both of the cars begin drivable, none of the airbags deployed, and only my car sustained damage.  The accident was my fault, just to be completely transparent. I was also not under the influence of any drugs.  One of the officers said he smelled marijuana in my car and told me he wouldn't bust me if I gave it to him.  I told him I didn't have any but gave in and gave him the gram of weed.  They then asked me to help him bust the dealer who sold me it so that they wouldn't charge me with a misdemeanor which I did, however, I was under the impression it would be a one time thing. He said I wouldn't want a misdemeanor so I should help him bust the dealer. I did that once and was just called back to do it again although I was told it would only be once.  This occurred in my old home town which is an hour or two away. I'm starting school soon and don't have much money so I can't afford to get up there with gas and tolls. I was wondering if I am obligated to do this again or what my rights are within this situation.	No
"Hello,  I recently moved out of an apartment... My lease was not renewed because the complex is renovating each unit, and they wanted me to move into a different unit (along with an $200 increase in rent).   Anyways, when I moved out I left the apartment clean, patched all the paint holes, etc. I didn't do a particularly thorough job cleaning the appliances/cabinets (I left them empty and wiped down, but didn't detail clean them) as they were going to thrown out during the reno.  Yesterday, I received my deposit back. The statement said that my deposit was being deducted by $55 for ""misc. damages."" The 'itemized' statement only had the beginning balance of the deposit, cleaning fee ($0), the misc damages ($55), and the ending balance of the deposit.  I know in Ohio, that landlords have to provide an itemized deposit... But how detailed does it need to be? I called the property manager, and they said it was 'likely' due to broken blinds and a damaged curtain rod, but wasn't sure. When i asked for more detailed information, they said that they weren't required to provide a more detailed statement because the management company is based in New York... I told that even if the parent company is based in NY, they still need to abide by Ohio State Laws, he got mad and hung up.  It's only $55, so I don't know if its worth pursuing, but I'm more curious for future reference. What constitutes an 'itemized statement' under Ohio laws for rental security deposits?  TL;DR: Security deposit deducted by $55 due to 'misc. damages.' Property manager unwilling to tell me the specific reasons for the deduction, due to the management company being based in NY, while property is in OH"	No
I'm just curious if I have any recourse against them. They charged me for blind replacement (cited reason was broken) and i know for a fact it wasn't broken because I never once opened my window or touched my blinds. Do I have any recourse? Anything I could throw at them to make them prove that the stuff was broken before charging me for it? I know it's a long shot but they're trying to rape me for ever dollar I have it seems like and I don't have much. I was very meticulous and diligent about cleaning and checking everything when I left. Nothing was broken and everything was clean. 	No
I have lived my house in downtown San Jose for nearly a year. My friend was the lease holder but is moving out and is helping one of my roommates acquire the new lease. We have a really good deal.  She does not want me living in the house for the next year and wants me gone. Mainly because I have a dog and use the garage (I pay for both). I don't make very much money and cant afford anything close in the area. To make matters worse I am hoping to start a new full time, better pay job very soon. Is there ANYTHING I can do? Please let me know. I no longer have a home base to go back to and don't have very much money.	No
"So the 3 unit building I live in was sold, with my existing lease being transferred to the new owner. However, the new LL is looking to renovate the 3 apartments and turn them into top dollar apartments/condos.   The new LL has contacted me to discuss a buyout of my lease. I'm not necessarily happy about the prospects of moving as I love my location and have spent years here, and it's close to work.  All that being said, I don't want to live in a building with 2 apartments above me being gutted and redone, as we are the last tenants remaining in the building. If we could come to an agreement and both sides come away winners, I would be willing to make a deal.   I guess my question for you guys is what is the ""standard"" buyout in a situation like this? I know there is no ""standard"", but I'm looking to at least go into discussions with a ballpark figure and some type of explanation as to how I came up with that figure.  I have just over 24 months remaining on my lease. I live in a 3 Bdrm an expensive part of Boston. Avg 3 Bdrm is around 2800.  Any advice or past experience is highly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"

"http://i.imgur.com/tfYD2ih.jpg  This is the notice. Like I said, I don't smoke so it doesn't affect me, but I am curious I guess and probably because when this management company took over, they had pushed what ""reasonable notice"" is when dealing with other things that require entering our apartments that are non emergency."	No
So, I entered a 14 month lease June of last year. This is all in Wisconsin. Around December of 2016, family issues required me to move away, and I talked with my landlord about finding someone to replace me on the lease. He said I would have to pay the lease breaking fee and all rent until the new roommate took over. I asked if I could apply my $500 security deposit toward my $600 lease breaking fee, and landlord declined. So I remotely find a replacement guy around February, and he moves in, no problem. I don't ask him to pay the security deposit, as i hadn't listed it as a requirement in my advertisement. I just figured i could get it back when the lease ended at the end of July. No issues until now. I call to check in with my landlord about getting the security deposit returned to me, and he claims that I am no longer on the lease and therefore my replacement roommate has the right to my share of he security deposit despite him never paying the security deposit. Landlord claims I need replacement roommate's consent to release the security deposit back to me. Now, replacement roommate seems like a nice guy, and I think I can ask him to do the right thing and he will. But did I really lose the right to my security deposit when I canceled my lease?   TL;DR  I had to cancel my lease and landlord still has my security deposit. Landlord says my replacement roommate is entitled to the security deposit and I need his consent to get it back. Is this true? I'm in WI.	No
Like the title says, four years ago I was involved a workplace accident that left metal shards in my chest. I had followed all company protocol and they paid for the surgery to have the metal removed. The surgeon said everything was removed and the surgery went well.  Fast forward four years and I have a chest x-ray for some breathing related issues and guess what, the doctor missed one of the shards. What are my options here? Truly, I just want the metal piece removed, I don't think suing them would be a good idea, but I could be wrong. I was laid off from that job 2 years ago, can I get them to pay for surgery to remove the remaining shard?  Thank you in advance for your help.	No
"Hi Reddit,  My mother passed away in Feb during the cleaning of her house my sister-in-law found a will that was signed, dated and notarized. I guess I have a few questions here.   1: Is this a ""legal"" will? What makes it legal and binding?  2: What is the process of selling the house?  3: She mentioned having to go to probate (what is that) and then said we could just not go though probate but did not say how that would work.  I am in the Dallas area my sister in law and the home are located in Austin.  I know this may not be enough info I can provide more if needed."	No
I will have lived in this rental property 1 year as of August 18th. When I moved in last August he prorated my rent for the rest of the month, but my lease agreements of 6 months have always been from the original move in date which falls on the 18th of the month. I've been paying my rent on the 1st of the month since September of last year. This month I paid my rent as per our agreement (agreement says by the 3rd of the month without penalty) on August 1st which covers August 1st through August 31st.  On August 7th (11 days before my lease ends) my landlord emailed me a new lease agreement (without any prior communication about the new rental terms) along with a note that said the rent would increase for the next term (which starts august 19th basically). I told him then that I likely would be moving out.  We have had a few discussions since then where he told me I would get my rent for the month of August back at per day rate, and I also explicitly asked him if I wouldn't get my deposit back if I didn't give him 30 days. His response was that the deposit was based on the condition of the room and nothing else. I began actively looking for a place and quoting potential landlords a move in date of August 18th.  Today August 10th he texted me saying that since I didn't give him 30 days noticed in our lease he would not be refunding my rent for the rest of August. This blew me away and I texted him back and told him that I'm willing to abide by the terms of our lease, but I'm curious where that leaves me?  What happens after the 18th? Do I live here for 13 days with no rental agreement or I move out and forget about the rent money I've already paid for the rest of the month? His character has changed completely and I'm worried this could become a problem with getting my deposit back. If this becomes nasty do I have any rights legally if he takes my deposit out of spite? I have text messages showing my intent to leave on good terms, his responses to that, and then his flip flop 3 days later. Is the lease agreement the only binding thing here?  tl;dr landlord is increasing rent. I decided to move. I've paid through the end of the month, but my lease expires on the 18th. Do i get my money back, am I out of prorated rent, or do I stay for what I've already paid for? If he tries to keep my deposit and prorated rent after he failed to notify me of lease agreement changes in a reasonable time do I have any legal recourse?	No
Hi. So I was charged with one count of felony embezzlement from my previous employer. I stole $429.12 which I know seems oddly specific, but I worked at an animal hospital and tried to make it seem like someone had returned merchandise for this amount and the returned the amount onto my debit card. I was desperate for money (I still am) and used it to pay bills, get my cars oil changed, gas, food...nothing really important at all. Well come the next day, my boss noticed that something was off with the transactions from the day before. She started asking all of us up front a lot of questions and I panicked. I left work right in the middle of my shift and drove away. I then called and texted her asking if we could meet somewhere out of the hospital. I told her I took the money and she seemed surprised actually. She said she would have to tell the owner of the hospital and she would let me know by Monday (8/28) what the owner decided to do. She never got back to me, so I called her the next day which was this morning to ask. She said she filed the report and thought there was a warrant out for my arrest. I freaked out and started sobbing because I've never been in legal trouble before and my record is clean up until now. I called the district attorneys office to see if the warrant was indeed true, and she said yes and to go to the magistrates office. I did, and they all seemed surprised but kind of nice about the whole thing. I was crying this whole time and didn't know the charge was embezzlement until they had me do fingerprints and talk to the magistrate. The magistrate released me on an unsecured bond of $1500, which means I got to walk away without paying anything. He set my preliminary court date for tomorrow at 9am. I am freaking out because I didn't have time nor the money to get an attorney. I called the public defenders office and they said it takes 5-10 days to get my application approved for one and that I can ask for one tomorrow at my hearing. The problem is I wanted a lawyer to help me tomorrow since I have no idea what I'm doing. My grandmother told me to plead not guilty since a felony like this will be on my record indefinitely and basically screw me out of any job prospects which I cannot afford to not work hence the whole embezzlement thing...I just don't know what to do. Any help or advice is appreciated as to what is going to happen tomorrow	No
"Hey /r/legaladvice, I'm a longtime lurker/occasional poster (this is obviously a throwaway) who is finally finding a need for a bit of advice.  Location: Iowa  I'm an out of state student attending an Iowa public land grant university. A representative of our residency department recently informed my roommate group that our dorm is being downgraded from a four person capacity to a three person capacity, and that one of us must find alternate housing. They've offered one of us a different room in the same building, but that room costs almost two grand more per year. Additionally, they will be raising the rates on our current dorm.  They've told us we have two business days to decide who will move. This is basically no notice, and we're only a week away from our move-in date. Because of this absurdly short notice, I do not believe I can schedule a consult with a legal firm in time. We've also already been billed the cost of the dorm.  It is my limited understanding that my university is just as beholden to our legal contract as I am, but not all of the same tenancy laws/protections apply. I'm trying to negotiate a deal where they split us the difference, but given that they seem to be deliberately railroading us, I'm not convinced that will go anywhere.   ***Misc. Notes ***(these details may or may not be necessary to understand this legal situation)  - Our contract stipulates that the contract is for ""space only"" and preferences are not guaranteed. That is understandable, but we've been under the impression we'd be living here and paying X amount for many months. - If we were to cancel our contract this late we'd be paying a lot of penalties. - I cannot afford any substantial change in cost to my dorm situation. - All communication has been done via university email. I've already printed off a copy of the bill in case they they try to change it on us. - We cannot just find non-university housing last minute like this. Unless we take the universities deal one of us is homeless and still stuck paying tuition. - Student legal services is paid by student government directly through student fees, so they might be able to help despite this being an issue with the university but it's the summer.  - I can provide an MS Paint diagram of the dorm, but it isn't especially relevant."

Santa Fe, New Mexico:  My lease ended in May 2017, and I have been expecting my $400 security deposit since then. I recently contacted my old landlord and asked why I hadn't received the deposit, and she started by lying about giving me $200 in cash, which I quickly dismissed. She then said she would be making large deductions based on repairs done to the heater (which was never fully operational during my tenancy), and fees related to a cleaning requested by the tenant who moved in after me. I asked for an itemized invoice of the charges, and received a scribbled mess that added up to $200 in deductions from my deposit, along with a check for $200. This is the first invoice and check I've received since May, long after the 30 days I believe landlords have to deliver either.   Do I have grounds to dismiss the deductions and receive my deposit in full?	No
"One of the stones of an expensive necklace I purchased fell out and broke.  This stone is unique to the manufacturer (because of its cut, I don't think I'll find it anywhere else).  I found the necklace still for sale on the brand's company website.   Ideally, I would purchase a replacement stone from them at a fair price.  In communication with their customer service team, they said ""normally we offer a one year warranty, however since the purchase was made over a year ago, we can't replace it. Also, we are not able to make repairs.""  Also they claim not to have any replacement stones.  I'm just looking to purchase a replacement stone so I don't have to purchase a whole new necklace.  Are there any consumer protection laws applicable?  Company HQ is in TX, I am in GA."	No
"TLDR backstory: So my wife has been offered an anchor/reporter job that's a big break for her in her field.  However, the location is far from ideal (Southern Michigan) and it has limited jobs in my field (BioEng).  Her offer is a two-year contract agreement with 90-day probational period, however we're not sure of her rights to leave there after those 90 days.  The contract states:  ""Your first 90 days of employment is a probationary period.  During this period, the company will evaluate your suitability for your position and it may decide not to continue your employment for no reason or for any reason prohibited by law.  You are free to resign your employment with the Company at any time either during your probationary period or thereafter. **This paragraph does not apply to individuals who have been employed by the Company or affiliate for more than 90 days immediately preceding the date of this offer letter**  You represent that you are not subject to the terms of noncompetition, confidentiality, or similar agreement that would limit your ability to carry out the duties of your position and your offer of employment is based on this representation. If the Company learns that you are currently subject to any such agreement that would limit or prohibit you employment with the Company, your employment may be terminated.""  Based on that, is she able to leave early without penalty a year down the road if she doesnt like it?  Could she accept a different job in the same field without violating her contract?    Thanks"	No
Essentially we moved in and the house is disgusting.  We keep asking him for a mail key and he won't help us. Its been a month into our 12 month lease.  He said he doesn't deal with small things like that and that if we keep bothering him he will break our lease.  I'm pretty sure there's no legal basis for this.  It's just a standard rental contract.    What are my options if he does this?	No
