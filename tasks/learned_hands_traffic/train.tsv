This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	Yes
Hi - I just created this account. I am hoping someone here can help me.  To make a long story short: the police allege I hit a telephone pole and then abandoned the vehicle on the side of the road. There was no collision with any other vehicle, nobody was injured, and there were no witnesses.  The police came to the scene, found my vehicle pulled off to the side of the road with the hazard lights on.  They waited about an hour, then had my vehicle towed - is what they told me.  Note: The vehicle is actually owned by my dad, but he gave me permission to drive it.  Anyway, the next day I called around and found out where my vehicle was towed.  I went there to pick it up, and the towing place said that the police have a 'hold' on it and that they aren't permitted to release it, unless the 'hold' is lifted.  I went to the police and asked them to release the hold, and they said they are investigating it.  I left.  Today, they called and said that they want to speak to my father (since he is the owner of the vehicle) in order to release it.  My father called and asked if he comes in, will they release it. The police said no, because they still have to do investigating.  I was not charged with anything, nor was my father. This happened last week.  As far as I know, the police are saying that 'they have all of this evidence that I hit a telephone pole and committed a hit-and-run'.   Can they keep my vehicle at the tow yard without a search warrant and without having pressed charges? It seems extremely unfair, especially since I am accumulating towing costs each day it sits there.  They won't release it, because they said the vehicle was 'abandoned'. Clearly it wasn't, provided that I called the next day to retrieve it.  Any advice?  Thanks!	Yes
About a year ago, I went on a long international trip and forgot to make payments on my car. Eventually, it got reclaimed by the leasing company.  Before the vehicle was redeemed from the repossession agency, the agency suspected the battery was dead and charged me for a replacement, keeping the original battery. (This was unexpected because the car was only a few months old, and its battery was new.)   Little did I know that the battery they installed was a large aftermarket battery, which blocked the AC hose, preventing moisture from exiting the car. Over the last year, the blocked hose caused the car's floor to accumulate moisture. Last month, the electronics suddenly became fried and the car would no longer leave the first gear.  Repairing this damage is estimated to cost 90-95% of the car's cash value.  When I asked the leasing company about this, they said that the damage was my responsibility, given that almost a year had passed and that I had already signed off for the vehicle upon pickup.  While I understand their argument, I believe the repossession agency ought to be responsible, provided that they installed the large battery, leading to major problems.  I don't understand why the leasing company isn't going after the repossession agency. Is it my job to do hire a lawyer to do that? I don't know where to start. For some reason, the repossession agency won't give me records on service and maintenance performed on the car, only to the leasing company. Also, my insurance is not going to cover the damage because I do not have comprehensive coverage.	Yes
I was driving home from the gym and there was a car parked in the narrow street right outside the gym. I thought he stopped for the red light but he was parked the entire time. As I was waiting there thinking he would move a car hit me from behind going slowly. I was driving at pathfinder whereas he had something along the lines of an accord ? And his license plate was dent whereas nothing really happened to my car. When i went home however I noticed that my rear bumper had a crack on it not really noticeable. Unfortunately I'm an idiot and didn't bother exchanging information with him. Can I still ask him to fix it ?  	Yes
Throwaway account. I am a fully insured driver, was driving to church (honestly) this morning and went to make a right turn. There is a bicycle lane on the road I was turning off of. No light at the intersection, it is a suburban area. I passed the bike rider on my right, and went to make a right turn. There was enough time that if I continued my turn without stopping, I would have been gone before the bicyclist got to the intersection.  As I was turning, there was a female waiting to cross, so I stopped and waved her across the intersection. I was stopped in the bike lane while she crossed, and as she was about halfway across the bicyclist hit me in the rear. He immediately said that I hit him, but I don't think that's in dispute since the lady crossing gave a statement that she saw me wave her across and I was stopped when the guy hit me. He got up and walked to the side walk but said his shoulder was hurting. He thinks he hurt his clavicle, but refused an ambulance trip to the ER.  Cops came and took statements, they gave me a ticket for failing to yield the right of way to the cyclist. I am going to fight it in court because I feel I was yielding the right of way to the pedestrian. I also feel that since the guy hit me when I was stopped, he should be at fault for not stopping or avoiding me as I think there was enough time (he hit me in the rear, not the side, so I didnt cut him off with no chance to react). Is there grounds to fight the ticket? If the insurance companies get involved and he tried to sue me for damages, am I already going to be liable since the cops gave me a ticket? Any advice welcome.	Yes

Hello - I was wondering what would be best to do in this situation. Some guy crashes into my girlfriend's car in front of our house in the middle of the night. A neighbor ended up getting the license plate number. Girlfriend only has liability insurance and her insurance company just told her they can't/won't do anything. The person left a note but ins't answering phone calls. We have his name, phone number, place of work (hopefully), and license plate number. Should we confront him at his work? or would that hurt our case. Should we file a police report or give him more time? Thanks for the help!	Yes
"Bought a used car in Harris county, Houston, Texas, from a small car dealer at his residence.  Before purchasing the car, I did have a call out mechanic inspect the vehicle. After I had thoroughly inspected and driven the car.  Hours after purchasing the car, the IMA (Honda Civic Hybrid battery) and the catalytic converter are showing errors.  We have already paid $3,700 for the car cash in hand and owe him $400 for the cost of registration which was in the paperwork we signed. Also stating we would not sue and buying the vehicle in ""As is"" condition.  The seller states he can transfer the vehicle registration and that he does not need the vehicle for the vehicle inspection report.  I need a car as there is little public transport. What options do I have either for the mechanic or the seller to fix the problems with the car? Or is it possible to get my money back?"	Yes
