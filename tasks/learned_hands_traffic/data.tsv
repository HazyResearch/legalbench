In 1996 I was stopped and ticketed for speeding in Oregon and never paid the fine. Last week when I tried to get a License in Washington, I was told that I couldn't because of this 20 year old citation. Does anyone know what the Statute of limitations on a traffic ticket is in the state of Oregon?	Yes
"Hello,  I was recently stopped in the state of Arizona for not wearing my seatbelt. To be exact, I was on the Salt River Pima reservation. As I was leaving pulling out of the parking lot of my community college (which is on the reservation) I was pulled over. I have read through the Arizona state legislature rules on seatbelt laws and it clearly states that Arizona is a ""secondary state"". My understanding is that you cannot be pulled over for not wearing a seatbelt if that is the primary reason for the stop.   Reference:  ""There are two main types of safety belt laws: primary enforcement and secondary enforcement. Primary enforcement laws allow police officers to stop a vehicle because of a suspected seat belt violation, while secondary enforcement laws allow peace officers to issue a citation for a seat belt violation during a traffic stop for another violation.   Arizona is a secondary enforcement state, except for children under the age of eight who meet a certain height requirement. Arizona requires the use of safety belts where they are installed, by front seat occupants of a motor vehicle. The driver of the vehicle is responsible for the use of safety belts by all passengers under the age of 16, whereas front seat passengers at least 16 years of age may be cited for a safety belt violation. The maximum civil penalty for a person violating this law is $10 for each violation. ""  From the Arizona state legislature.  The citation that I received was 28-909A1 which states that a seatbelt must be worn while the vehicle is in motion.  The police officer was a reservation officer and he made it very clear that my lack of wearing a seatbelt was the primary reason for the stop and for citation.  I have court tomorrow and was wondering if I could reason with the judge on this. Does anyone have any advice or have a better understanding on these laws. If the state legislature states that it is a secondary law, it seems as if I should not have been pulled over solely for not wearing my seatbelt.   I do understand the importance of seatbelts and why they keep us safe. However, I did make a mistake and would greatly appreciate some advice on how to deal with this.   Thanks"	Yes
So to make it short, I was out late driving on the highway and was pulled over while going slightly over 30 the speed limit, resulting in an over $400 ticket.  The ticket is not the issue, however, as I will pay for it.  The thing i'm worrying about is my parents insurance.  I know what I did was stupid and a giant mistake, and i'm wondering if there is anything I can do to reduce the hit on our insurance, or get it cleared off the record.  I am very unfamiliar with all of this so any help is very appreciated.  I'm 18 for anyone wondering, thank you Reddit in advance!  I've talked to a friend who was in a similar situation, and he suggested pleading not guilty and going to court to apologize to the officer and such.  I'm not sure how much this will help but i'm willing to try anything to remedy this mistake.  There's not a class to take in the county, either so I can't do that.	Yes
"I involved a car accident last September 5th. since then I had Dr. visited almost every other week. My auto insurance paid some medical bill, but deny other. I consider hire an attorney to file a lawsuit. I want to clarify the ""1 year anniversary"" thing.  Let's say I have a treatment 12/1/2016 which auto insurance deny the payment, I must file lawsuit before 11/30/2017, or 9/4/2017?  Second question, what's the threshold to hire an attorney. Let's say if unpaid bill is $1000, I probably just go with my medical insurance (I still need to pay about $1000 for the deductible). But if it's $10k, I definitely want to hire an attorney. But how about the figure is in between? Last time I review my bill, it's about $3000.  I wonder if it's wise to go with attorney route?"	Yes
I'm a 21 y/o male from SD just for reference. So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through. Anything at all will help thanks.  (Also sorry for formatting and grammar issues I'm on mobile)	Yes
As it says in the title, I received a ticket for doing 70 in a 55, but I just looked at the ticket and the name and home address were of a complete stranger from another city. The car information on the ticket is correct, and everything else seems to be correct.  My question is this: Does this mean the ticket can be dismissed? Also is the stranger now in legal trouble? What do?	Yes
I was pulled over yesterday while on my way to work. I had just lit a cigarette and I guess I was swerving a little bit while trying to light it. It was my first cigarette of the day so I had a pretty strong buzz from it. Usually I don't get much of a buzz but that morning I overslept and was late so I hadn't had breakfast and had only woken up about 15 minutes prior. The officer asked why I was swerving and I told him it was because I was looking at my lighter while trying to light it and told him that I guess it had given me a small buzz. At that point I had no buzz but he told me to get out of the car. He made me do all the things that you'd expect if you were driving drunk and I know I had absolutely no problem doing them but he claimed that I was stumbling and having trouble and arrested me anyway.  At this point I just got home and I'm wondering if any of this could possibly stick? I've never heard of being charged for DWI for nicotine. Is this even possible? What do I even do now?	Yes
Paid for parking at a college and was mailed a pass, in the meantime I printed a Temp Pass which states I paid for Summer Parking + my vehicle license plate. It expired 2 days ago and I got a ticket ($35) for displaying an expired temp pass and not the one that was mailed to me. {I understand the word of the law is the law, I just feel the cop was unnecessarily being a dick}	Yes
"So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit. So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help.."	Yes
Hi,  I'm just wondering what kind of survey or regulations a city has to follow before installing speed bump on a public road.	Yes
I was backing out of my driveway and I stupid stupid stupidly was distracted and hit my neighbor's van. They were parked across the street. There's a dent in it now and I just drove off (it was around 9 pm). I later saw that they parked the van on their driveway from the street. I don't have insurance yet, and I feel bad making my parents pay for it because we're having a lot of financial troubles. I just feel so so so guilty because they're such good and nice people. :( and my car doesn't have any dents on it - just a scruff. I know I fucked up massively and I know I'm a huge fuckup for doing this.	Yes
Lets's say Driver A rear ends Driver B.  There are no injuries.  Driver A wants to admit fault without inolving police.  Can Driver A somehow let the insurance companies know that he was at fault, just so Driver A does not have to go through the court process by involving police?	Yes
"Good afternoon!  Several weeks ago, I was pulled over.  When the officer had approached my car initially, he said he pulled me over because I was close to the middle dotted line (195, highway with 2 lanes going one way, two the other way, separated by a rather large grassy median) and had pulled me over to make sure I was OK to drive.  I'm assuming as if I was drunk, or under the influence.  The stop continues, the person I was in the car with got picked up on a warrant (irrelevant to me, I'd believe).  He came back to the car after arresting my friend, and notifies me that he has written me a ticket.  He did not explain the ticket, but handed it to me as the final interaction (basically, call the court if you have any questions, here it is, bye).  When I looked at the ticket after leaving the place I was stopped, it had said ""Unsafe Lane Change"".  Which didn't make sense because when he initially pulled out, I was not changing lanes.  Anywho, I got to the court, talked with the prosecutor, and he had told me the ticket was actually for not keeping in the right lane (keep right, pass left).  There was a bit of traffic at the time.  I was in the left lane with a stream of other cars also staying in the left lane, and I didn't have the opportunity to get into the right lane until further down the road when the officer had made his way behind me.  So, all in all, I think I was given the ticket erroneously.    Anyways, I need advice on how to obtain what information that would help support my case.  I would like to avoid hiring a lawyer, as I'm pretty low in the funds department, and if I can represent myself, that would be a very awesome alternative.  Thank you and please let me know if I can provide any other information."	Yes
Got into a car accident with a brand new lease car. I'm at fault and I have no insurance on the car. The leading agreement for my cAr too says I need to have full coverage at all times during the lease. So the contract for the lease has been breached as well and the repairs for the car are too much for me right now. I need help or some type of direction on what to do now. I know I messed up bad	Yes
I'm 20 and am expecting to go to trial. I had to get a police report in before I could have my car get towed after my collision in which I took a breathilizer and managed 2 points below a dwi (0.06). I have to show up in court in a month.  So now I'm wondering what first steps I should take before the court case's consequences such as getting my license suspended, getting a restricted license etc.	Yes
"Driving at the start of May of this year in South Florida, I rear ended another 2017 Toyota at about 25 mph. There were no injuries reported at the scene of the accident, my 2004 Toyota sustained most of the damage, and I received a ticket for careless driving which was dismissed in court. The couple in the car I hit is middle-aged and they repeatedly and emphatically stated their lack of injury for three hours while the police officer was at the scene. About a month after the accident, I was notified that the couple was claiming bodily injury (soft tissue damage) and was seeking money to cover their chiropractic treatment through my insurance. I'm 19 and had my own insurance policy at the time, but the couple (or their lawyer I suppose) also tried to get compensation through my mother's insurance. We just received notice that my mother's insurance ""hereby disclaims and denies any and all liability or obligation to you and to others under policy number ... issued to you."" Does this mean that the couple can now retain their own lawyer to come after me personally? I'm very nervous and stressed about this because I am supposed to be leaving Florida for college up North in a week and I would never be able to afford to pay these people for their supposed injuries. Thank you."	Yes
I have a pending suspension on my NJ license for misstatement of information to obtain a license; I applied for and received an NJ license but was not aware my license was already suspended in FL (my vehicle did not have insurance while it was waiting to get repoed). My move to NJ was sudden so I didn't prepare to have my mail forwarded to me, so I didn't find out about the suspension until later. I'm just now getting my FL license reinstated. I've spoken to a couple lawyers and I'm being told at least 750$, 1,000$ (currently unemployed full-time college student). What are the chances I can prove I didn't know my license was suspended in another state?	Yes
Since then, he got his licence reinstated but has his court date this wednesday. Can his licence get revoked? Best case scenario? Worst case?   Should he hire lawyer who handled his previous case $1500 or a ticket clinic lawyer $750?	Yes
"I am a young girl and I was pulled over today after taking a picture at a red light. After the light turned green I no longer had any contact with my phone. I was soon greeted with blue lights and quickly pulled over. The first thing the police officer said to me was ""I saw you texting on your pink phone"" which was weird considering my phone is not at all pink. I told him I took a picture at the red light and he took my license. He came back after a while and said ""Now we are going to have some fun."" I didn't know what to say so I sat there and he said ""take out your phone and take a picture of my car and post it for everyone to see"" I obliged and he then said, ""Good, now everyone should make fun of you for it."" Then proceeded to hand me my citation where I could see that he wrote as a note that ""driver had both hands on phone typing while head was down looking at screen while vehicle was in motion."" Now this is a complete lie because all I did was take a picture at a red light. What are my options and how do I get out this expensive ticket considering I'm a broke college student!"	Yes
Hello,   I am from Korea where car seat laws are pretty lax. While most people choose to use car seats, there is no law requiring them, so many people will often just hold their babies in their laps while riding in taxis or buses, etc.  I'll be travelling to Boston and staying there for a month this fall, and I'm wondering about car seat rules for my one year old. I will be using a car seat for my everyday rental car, but what about taxis, commuter rail, subway, shuttle buses etc?  From what I read on the internet, it seems like Americans are really strict about car seat laws, so I don't want to do anything to upset CPS or the police.   Will I be in legal trouble if I don't use a car seat on the taxi or shuttle bus at their airport. And what are the standards when travelling with a baby by subway or commuter rail? Is it okay to just hold the baby in my lap?   I did do a quick google search which told me that car seats were not required on taxis, but I wasn't sure if the site was trustworthy.  Thank you so much in advance!	Yes
While delivering at work in my personal car.  I was involved in an accident that was not my fault.  I had the right of way and the other driver was cited at the scene.  Law enforcement came and I went to the hospital for minor  injuries I sustained in the accident.    If the other driver is completely at fault will my ability to accept pay out be at risk since I was delivering in my personal vehicle?	Yes
So I'm from Michigan, insurance is in Michigan also.  Girlfriend was driving my car in Chicago, where she love-tapped someone's front bumper while backing out of a spot.  There was no damage to my car.  He claims his bumper was cracked and basically needs to be replaced.  The post-accident scene was handled badly by both sides.  He took 1 picture of the damage to my car (was actually a pre-existing scratch, but my girlfriend didnt know that), a picture of my licence plate, and a picture of her licence, and they also exchanged phone numbers.  His bumper had very obvious previous damage on it outside of what may have just happened.  Sketchy part No.1: No insurance information was exchanged whatsoever.  Police were not called.  My girlfriend (20) is a nervous wreck while this is all happening, she had never even bumped a car before.  He never said anything about exchanging insurance information.  He was a 30ish year old man driving a car worth at least 10x of what mine is.  I begin to suspect this man doesn't have insurance.  A week or more passes, suspicions seem to be confirmed when...  Sketchy part No.2: He texts said girlfriend about shopping around for a body shop to get estimates for his bumper.  After talking to me, we agree that we should tell him to call his insurance company and send a picture of his damage.  This seems the right thing to do because insurance companies usually know how to handle these things.  He never sends picture.  Again suspicions that he has no insurance and there was no damage caused anyway.  Three weeks pass, suspicions seem to be confirmed again (until today...) Sketchy part No.3: Another text is received, saying that 1. He already sent her a picture of the damage (he didn't), and 2. I should call my insurance company since he was not at fault.  Was I right to be suspicious about his activity, namely not exchanging insurance information, the length of time between communications, the already present damage on his bumper, and his apparent non-willingness to talk to his insurance company?  What the shit is going on here?  Can someone help me untangle this mess?	Yes
I went to Wisconsin in June for the only vacation I could afford in years. On my way back I was passing someone when they decided to speed up so I couldn't, I was running out of room so I too sped up and finished my pass then let off the gas. I came over the hill slowing down and about a quarter mile up the road I saw a state trooper. He claims I was doing 23 over, I wasn't, I was issued a 225 dollar ticket that I can literally not afford to pay. Nor can I afford the increase in my insurance if I pay the ticket admitting guilty. I read on multiple sources that all that will happen is I can't go back to Wisconsin since they will put a warrant out for my unpaid fine. What do I do?	Yes
So I was dropping off uber passengers in the City of Chicago on wrigley field.  They told me to stop on the street on the main light. Cops were there and they started writing a ticket on me and she pulled out a paper and was probably writing my licence plate.  No one was behind me, so I just went off. Could they mail me a ticket with just my licence plate? Or did the cop give up and let me go?	Yes
Hello all, I did something terrible and I hit and run a parked car. What happened was I made a slight dent on someone's bumper while parking. I left a note, parked somewhere else and left. Someone saw me and watched me place the note but didn't make any moves to write my information down or call the police. The next morning, I saw my note on the ground near the car and I made an impulsed decision and decided to trash it. I know what I did was wrong but I'm a poor college student who couldn't afford to fix it right now. The parking area doesn't have any cameras and I believe no one documented the incident at all. Am I okay? If the police somehow found out, how would they contact me?  Location: CA	Yes
"Police saw I had a fake or otherwise not mine, parking pass one day while I wasn't with my car. Long story short They found me a week later in my car about to leave it on the street in a 2hour parking. I didn't give it to them but I may have given them enough information to meet the low standard of probable cause. The officer wanted to meet with me later in the week so I could hand him the pass and, ""aren't in any trouble just want the pass"". I talked to two criminal attorneys that said to not meet or give up the pass to this guy. My thing is, during the initial talk I gave him my license to check and my cell phone #. If he does end up trying to call me my idea is to not answer. Not that the problem will necessarily go away but I don't want to give any more information to this guy. Thoughts?   If i get a criminal complaint, will be hiring a lawyer for the clerk hearing for sure."	Yes
I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended license, and completely spaced the court date. I'm fairly certain that means I will now have a bench warrant for failure to appear, in addition to having to take care of my original charge.   I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker.   I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next? I take care of a parent and kid so it would be really bad to go to jail. (Otherwise I'd just bit the bullet and go for a short period.)   TL;DR: What's the best bet for getting my warrant cleared, without spending time in jail, and can I do it on my own? How likely (approximately) is it that I'll get arrested if I go in on my own?	Yes
"Hello  I am a college student, and this is my first ticket.  I hit somebody's back corner and then I fell into a ditch, totaling my vehicle.  The other driver only had corner damage on his car.  Nobody was injured.  I received a traffic ticket for failing to stop for assured distance.  I had the cops come to the scene to simply prove that the other driver was not at fault.  I was surprised that I received a ticket.  Later, I learned that calling the cops is not necessary, as long as information is exchanged.  The other driver was not jumping to call the police right away.  I regret involving the police.  I feel that I screwed myself over, beyond what was necessary.  I feel that totaling my car and denting the other guy's car does not call for a citation, especially considering the other guy did not offer to call the police.  I have a pre-trial soon.  I have to talk to a prosecutor and make a deal.  I would ideally like to drop the whole case, as my father's insurance is taking care of vehicle damage.  I am educating myself about courts.  I learned that the prosecutors want to spend more time prosecuting midemeanors/felonies and other serious issues.  They just want to get petty tickets out of the way.  Would it benefit me to ask for my case to be dismissed, and if he doesn't budge, say ""I want to learn more about the court process, so I am going to have trials regarding my ticket, so I can explore all of my options.  I have time because I am out of school for the summer.""  Would this make the prosecutor want to back off and not want to deal with me, especially because I am young.  I have had my liscense for about a year.  I know it costs a lot of money to run the courts.  I recognize that it's assumed that people who hit cars from behind are at fault, but the reality is, traffic court is designed to suck money from people.  The other driver wasn't upset when I talked to him.  I just want the insurance to fix the other guy's car, and move on with my life."	Yes
I just got caught going 108 in a 75 on a deserted highway in Colorado; just under the 40mph cutoff. I read that it carries a six point penalty on the license, which is fine, but being unfamiliar with the law in Colorado I was wondering if anyone knew what I could expect at my court date in Burlington; or if there is any way I can avoid traveling back to appear (I'm from the east coast). Are they typically lenient with out of state drivers? Is there anything specific I should say to the judge? Where I'm from the court will virtually always plea it down to something else. Is that how it works out here as well? Do I face jail time? I have some money, but not a lot, and the plane fare both ways is going to kill me this year.	Yes
Hello. A truck hit my car a few months ago and drove off. The car was parked and in the am we found the damage. We were able to find the company by pulling tapes from surrounding buildings, but the time I lost just tracking them down (I am a freelancer) took me over three days. I asked them to compensate me for the time, but they refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Small claims court? I am  in New York City if that helps. Any advice you can offer would be amazing. Thanks Terrie.	Yes
So I got a DUI in Louisiana. They issued me a temp license. I have not had my first court date, so I'm not actually convicted (I'm assuming). I have since moved to Arkansas. Can I get a driver's license here before my court date?	Yes
"I'll try to keep it brief. I was just pulled over (petty traffic, improper signal). No biggie, until cop comes back with license ""you're driving on a suspended, we're writing you $500 in tickets and impounding your car"". Uhhhhhh....what? This was just now.  More info:  I had let a ticket lapse, but two months ago I paid 1/4 of it off and setup a payment plan, this is what I was told I needed to do to reinstate my license. I've made every payment on time and have even paid more than the minimum to pay it off quickly. I have another ticket that is newer that I have not paid off or setup a payment on, but I went to the courthouse and spoke with a clerk before a work trip where I was responsible for driving a company vehicles and I was told I am still within the 60 day ""grace"" window. I am still supposedly in that window.    I know I need to go to the courthouse to figure this out tomorrow, but my question is: will I be able to seek damages from the state for not following their own rules? I'm not going to be able to work this week (need to be able to drive), and the impound fees are always a nightmare. I'm sure a judge will throw out the tickets given this is apparently an administrative glitch...  I'm in Oregon."	Yes
About a year ago, I went on a long international trip and forgot to make payments on my car. Eventually, it got reclaimed by the leasing company.  Before the vehicle was redeemed from the repossession agency, the agency suspected the battery was dead and charged me for a replacement, keeping the original battery. (This was unexpected because the car was only a few months old, and its battery was new.)   Little did I know that the battery they installed was a large aftermarket battery, which blocked the AC hose, preventing moisture from exiting the car. Over the last year, the blocked hose caused the car's floor to accumulate moisture. Last month, the electronics suddenly became fried and the car would no longer leave the first gear.  Repairing this damage is estimated to cost 90-95% of the car's cash value.  When I asked the leasing company about this, they said that the damage was my responsibility, given that almost a year had passed and that I had already signed off for the vehicle upon pickup.  While I understand their argument, I believe the repossession agency ought to be responsible, provided that they installed the large battery, leading to major problems.  I don't understand why the leasing company isn't going after the repossession agency. Is it my job to do hire a lawyer to do that? I don't know where to start. For some reason, the repossession agency won't give me records on service and maintenance performed on the car, only to the leasing company. Also, my insurance is not going to cover the damage because I do not have comprehensive coverage.	Yes
So I was waiting at a stoplight today and got low-speed rear-ended. It wasn't bad, but did give me a fright. My car was still perfectly drivable, even with the dings and scratches. I took pictures of my car, her car, her insurance and license plate and submitted a claim online. I didn't call the police on her because I am certain it wasn't bad enough to cause injury, and accidents are accidents, but she started being a little cagey after all of this and kept repeating that she thought some of the damage was there before, which it wasn't. I don't expect any issues and I'm not trying to get some payout, but was there anything else I could do besides calling the police to prevent me from being screwed over?	Yes
"Would welcome your advice if I need to see a lawyer as well, and if so, what type.   I live in Virginia, and was driving in a construction zone in Washington, DC.  There was a flash and a camera recorded me speeding.  A $100 ticket was mailed to me.  However, due to health issues, I just opened my mail, and I missed the original deadline, so now the fine is $200.     But DC offers this option ""Admit with Explanation"" where I admit liability and explain by mail or in-person. An examiner will review my explanation and consider reducing my fine.     However, I can't tell if my insurance would increase if I admit fault.  This is my first speeding ticket EVER. I can write that I have a clean record and this was unintentional.  Should I mention my medical issues for my delayed response?  How do I find out if my insurance rates will increase if I admit to this ticket?  Thanks."	Yes
Hello! So my girlfriend has received a traffic citation on Friday from an apparently hit and run accident on June 18th. It's a misdemeanor failure to stop property damage citation with no insurance/registration(She has proof of both)  She is very unsure of this whole deal, I'm just trying to find some answers to help ease her uncertainty. I know the basics of never talk to police, get a lawyer etc. but I don't have much knowledge and feel bad I can't help more.  She is claiming not to remember any accident, or damage to her car. I believe there may be a scratch on her mirror that's about 2cm but she says it's been there before.   Anyways I'm wondering what to tell her to do besides getting/talking to lawyers, what's the worst case scenario outcome, no criminal record, first offense, one speeding ticket 6 years ago etc. and since there is only the failure to stop property damage citation(well no insurance and registration C/I's that she has proof of so no biggie), does that mean it's just the only accusation we have to worry about? Reckless/careless driving or other things at a later date from this incident isn't a concern right?    Just want to give her some clarity on everything and what she's facing, thanks so much. Let me know if you need anymore info.	Yes
"Hi guys,  I purchased a 2007 Ford Fusion in Ontario, Canada in May, 2017.  In June I noticed some irregularities at low speed and got the tires balanced ($50). Despite the balancing helping a bit, the car was still a little 'heavy.' Checked all my fluids and realized power steering was low, filled it up and all was good for a bit. July: car still wasn't smooth, so I purchased new tires ($800). This didn't help much... Now power steering fluid goes out faster than I can pour it in and I also notice a leak in the transmission fluid. Before I can even get to the repair shop for a check I drove over a small speedbump at low speed and everything falls apart. Strugglebus it to the mechanic and they take a quick look before telling me I should contact a transmission shop.  Left front wheel barely spins and power steering/transmission fluid is everywhere, so there might be more wrong than what they listed here: *Front right axle is leaking *Transfer case is broken *Driveshaft is broken *Major power steering leak *Major transmission leak  The transmission shop quoted me a repair at $2500 minimum. They asked if I had been in a major accident and ""confirmed"" that it was incredibly unlikely that all these problems were caused by me.  Do I have any rights with regards to probably getting screwed over by the dealership &amp; safety test?  Thank you"	Yes
My father has been involved in a biking accident a few months back. Luckily, he didn't sustain serious injuries, and only had (substantial) damage to his (racing) bike. The other person involved in the crash was a woman who sustained heavy injuries (fractured skull, and cannot recall the accident) and spent 2 days in the hospital. She is now holding my father accountable for the accident, and we are wondering how to respond, as we firmly believe he was not the one at fault.   He (and his friend) describe the situation as follows:  The two of them were heading home after a long tour on their racing bike, and cycling up a hill in the town center. My father is on the left, nearer to the middle of the road, and they approach the cross road where the accident happens. At the side of the road, the view is blocked by a large white van, as there are parking spaces right up to the cross road. BEFORE they reach the cross road, and can see past the van, a woman aproaches from the right, first hits my father's friend (lightly, causing him to fall) and then has a full on collission with my father, causing my father to fly headfirst over his bike, while she falls backwards. My father was protected by his helmet, which has broken in multiple places, she, sadly, has no such protection. Both of them are lying on the ground next to the van, a good distance before the cross roads, on their side of the road. The woman claims that as she was approaching from the right side of the cross roads (Dutch traffic law) she had right of way, and my father is liable. My father says they were not at the crossing yet, hadn't been able to see her because of the van and she 'cut corners', and so she is in fact at fault. Police arrived only after they had already left for the hospital, took their statements, and decided the aftermath was left for the insurance companies to decide. So there is no proper   Today, he received a formal letter, to inform him she will hold him accountable and informed her insurance of this. Now, as we are insured this doesn't really matter, not even affecting his deductible (?word?), but he does resent being blamed for something he feels he is not responsible for. Or at least, not solely, as his friend was also part of the incident. Aside from that, he also has significant damage to his biking equipment (upward of 200 euros) and though nothing compared to her ordeal, it's no small ammount.  He is planning to put this all into a proper letter in reply, and has had contact with his own insurance about what is going on, but I am wondering if you people have any advice how to proceed?  Thanks in advance!	Yes
So to start, my car was towed due to dead tags from my trade in at the dealership I bought my newer car from. Both cheep cars. Either way the cops towed my car and didn't give me a single paper or notice or ticket. Now I got pulled over for the same thing a day or two before and am taking care of the ticket I was issued that day currently. (For the dead tag) my question is shouldn't have I gotten some kind of documentation about the towing at the live stop? And who do I call to get what I need in order to get my car out of what I assume is the impound Lott?? I live in philadelphia in the city.	Yes
In Staten Island, NY asking for a friend. From what I gathered it seems like the first postponement is allowable and every subsequent postponement is up to the discretion of the TVB. Was just curious if that is true, and if it is how much time is allotted to each postponement.	Yes
A few days ago, I was in an accident where the other driver seems to think I could be at fault for this. I was driving with no stop light or stop sign at the intersection and the other driver seems to think it was my fault.  This is the closest thing I could find that shows the type of intersection. http://imgur.com/a/8LE92 I am the blue car and the person that hit me is the white car. The only difference is there were three lanes on each side on the street going east to west.   The white car tried to cut across the lanes and crashed into my passenger side. I was in the far left lane and the white car made it across the two lanes next to me and I guess the driver expected me to let him through? Is there some law that says I should have stopped or any way I could be found even partially at fault?   And sorry if this question is better off being asked in another sub. Thanks!	Yes
"Today I was pulled over.  When the vehicle came to a stop I cracked the window to about 1/2in, enough to hear the officer's commands and hand over my identification.  The officer approached my driver's window and stood there.  Said nothing, then opened my driver's door.  I was flabbergasted, I asked him what right he had to open my door.  He replied, ""You didn't put the window down.""   As I see it, if I had something illegal in the door of my car, he would not have known about it until he opened the door.  Which seems to me like an illegal search.  Could someone weigh in on this?"	Yes
Yesterday I got a speeding ticket going back home to Central Arkansas from a trip to Bentonville with my girlfriend. My car was totalled in a flood a few weeks ago, so we took her car, and she wanted me to drive back home. The officer clocked me going 91 in a 70 (which I don't exactly believe I really don't think I exceeded anything more than 87ish). Im 18 years old. My court date is September 11th in London, Arkansas, but I will be in college at UofA and at the moment I have no transportation to the courthouse. Most importantly, I have not told my parents about the ticket yet. Is there any way that they will find out if I don't tell them? The officer said something about asking the judge about waiving a civil penalty and the ticket won't go on my record. I know this post is a mess and confusing, TL;DR: I'm an 18 year old who was pulled over for going 21 over in girlfriend's car, need to know approximately how much the ticket will be, if my parents will find out, any advice about how to be prepared for my court date and how to make the ticket not go on my record.	Yes
Hello, in my state there is a reduced offense you can plead guilty to, a $500 fine and no points, in exchange for removing a violation with points such as speeding. But you are only able to do it twice in 5 years. I did not realize I reached the limit when I mistakenly plead to it a third time. But as this should not have been available to me I wanted to know if any legal action can be taken against the municipality where the allowed this egregious error on their part.	Yes
I was recently cited on my motorcycle for violating CVC 22530:  &gt;No person shall drive a vehicle upon a highway at a speed greater than is reasonable or prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, the traffic on, and the surface and width of, the highway, and in no event at a speed which endangers the safety of persons or property.   I was on a 2003 Suzuki GSX-R750 which makes about 140hp to move under 600lbs with me on it in full gear.  I pulled away from a red light and leisurely accelerated (the crown vic caught up within about a quarter mile, and I had a head start) to about 70MPH in a 45 zone on a divided expressway with 3 lanes in each direction and no traffic on my side. I was exactly [here](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.391026,-122.0668735,3a,75y,121.29h,75.52t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1sE1gMpLnvlf_lxzWkbcKPJg!2e0!7i13312!8i6656).  The officer wrote down 65+, told me he paced me (no radar) to about 70, and that he had the whole pull on video. The ticket notes that I had just come from CA85 which also has 3 lanes in each direction of a divided highway but a 65mph limit.  The whole pull from the light from the freeway to where I was pulled over was about half a mile or less. I slowed down as soon as any other vehicles were visible in front of me, and at the same time saw the police car coming up behind me. It's hard to look directly behind you and I didn't see the cop til then.  At first I was completely accepting of my mistake and assumed I would plead guilty and ask for traffic school. But after reading CVC22350 I would argue that nothing I did was unreasonable for the conditions.   Any advice before I call a traffic lawyer?	Yes
Hello and thank you!  I recently tried to start driving for Uber/Lyft for some extra income, and they told me no due to my driving record... About 5 years ago I got ticket for driving with no insurance. Car wasn't mine, so I paid the fine and continued on with my life. Unbeknownst to me, the moment I paid the fine, my license was automatically suspended until I got an SR22 on my insurance. Well, a year goes by, and I get pulled over... now I have a driving while suspended. Once i figured out that nonsense, I got the SR22 and they reinstated my licence. I maintained the SR22 for 3 years and haven't had a ticket since. Is there any way to get this crap off my record? Please, I need help! :(	Yes
Throwaway because I don't want this tied to my personal account.   Tonight, I was pulled over for speeding and just given a verbal warning. I was incredibly freaked out and didn't ask the officer any of my questions when he asked if I had any, so now I really need a little peace of mind.   What are the consequences of a verbal warning? Is it possible to receive a ticket after the fact, like the officer changes his mind and decides I should have been ticketed? Does anyone have to find out about this verbal warning (future employers, insurance company, parents)? How will my driving record be affected (I've never been pulled over before)?   Sorry for all the questions that probably seem obvious, I've been trying to do a ton of research but I'm having a hard time figuring out a solid answer. I saw a post on this sub from 2 years ago that someone was pulled over, issued a verbal warning, then got a ticket in the mail later, which has me all kinds of worried.	Yes
Throwaway account. I am a fully insured driver, was driving to church (honestly) this morning and went to make a right turn. There is a bicycle lane on the road I was turning off of. No light at the intersection, it is a suburban area. I passed the bike rider on my right, and went to make a right turn. There was enough time that if I continued my turn without stopping, I would have been gone before the bicyclist got to the intersection.  As I was turning, there was a female waiting to cross, so I stopped and waved her across the intersection. I was stopped in the bike lane while she crossed, and as she was about halfway across the bicyclist hit me in the rear. He immediately said that I hit him, but I don't think that's in dispute since the lady crossing gave a statement that she saw me wave her across and I was stopped when the guy hit me. He got up and walked to the side walk but said his shoulder was hurting. He thinks he hurt his clavicle, but refused an ambulance trip to the ER.  Cops came and took statements, they gave me a ticket for failing to yield the right of way to the cyclist. I am going to fight it in court because I feel I was yielding the right of way to the pedestrian. I also feel that since the guy hit me when I was stopped, he should be at fault for not stopping or avoiding me as I think there was enough time (he hit me in the rear, not the side, so I didnt cut him off with no chance to react). Is there grounds to fight the ticket? If the insurance companies get involved and he tried to sue me for damages, am I already going to be liable since the cops gave me a ticket? Any advice welcome.	Yes
Hello everyone, I just received a letter from the DMV about an accident I was in where I lost my fiancée and where I was injured myself pretty badly. I admit, I was at fault for failing to yield on a left turn. I was in an area I wasn't familiar with and I thought it was a four way stop and it wasn't. To make matters worst the pick-up I hit was speeding and my car went flying and flipped 3-4 times according to witnesses. I was in the hospital for 3-4 days after emergency surgery on my left arm, I was unable to eat the entire time I was in the hospital and I was very weak when I was finally discharged. I was unable to walk on my own for days and was in therapy for months to recover the use of my left arm. In midst of this mess I didn't know I was required to submit MV-104. I am now summoned to court for failure to submit this form and may have my license suspended. I already had my license suspended for 6 months from the ticket I received at the time of the accident. I have no idea what to do, I checked the NY DMV website and apparently neither of us submitted one, there is only a MV-104A on file. The accident was on 8/15/15. What should I do?	Yes
he was in the process of giving a ticket to someone else. He was in his car. I passed him and i moved over a little in my lane without crossing into the next lane. He caught up to me about a mile and a half and said he pulled me over because (unbeknownst to me you cant pass an emergency vehicle) I did not move into the next lane. Gives me a citation and sends me on my way. It 438.00. Is there anything i can do to bring it down or to argue it. I had never heard of the law before, nor do i have any tickets or accidents. Just 1 warning for speeding.	Yes
If I want to get some driving in before a driving test can I drive around a parking-lot or privet property or a dirt road with out a license?	Yes
I recently got my first speeding ticket and called the courthouse from the county I got pulled over in to ask some questions about how and when to pay for it, and the guy on the phone said the biggest mistake people make is not attempting to reduce their speeding ticket fines. Especially if it's their first offense. He was super nice and gave me some advice about writing a letter to the judge. So I was like yeah sure I'll give it a shot.  Some websites say don't admit fault, and some websites say to apologize in the letter. Apologizing is admitting fault.. so what do I do?	Yes
Background: Over the winter I was cited for going 45 in a 25 mph zone. I messed up my first court date and was a day late so I have already been found guilty of my citation. Afterwards I filed a summary appeal and tomorrow is my new court date. My biggest worry is not the fine itself but the 4 points that will be put on my driving record. I am looking for some help/pointers on what to expect for my trial tomorrow, how I should plead, what I should prepare to say to the judge and what steps I should take to get rid of or at least reduce the points in my license.   TD;LR - already found guilty of speeding ticket looking for help/pointers on the process and what to expect.	Yes
is a lawyer needed to get your driving record expunged?  I have several things in my 10 year print out that are preventing me from working many driving jobs.  any help is appreciated.   first timer here,  thank you!	Yes
Hi - I just created this account. I am hoping someone here can help me.  To make a long story short: the police allege I hit a telephone pole and then abandoned the vehicle on the side of the road. There was no collision with any other vehicle, nobody was injured, and there were no witnesses.  The police came to the scene, found my vehicle pulled off to the side of the road with the hazard lights on.  They waited about an hour, then had my vehicle towed - is what they told me.  Note: The vehicle is actually owned by my dad, but he gave me permission to drive it.  Anyway, the next day I called around and found out where my vehicle was towed.  I went there to pick it up, and the towing place said that the police have a 'hold' on it and that they aren't permitted to release it, unless the 'hold' is lifted.  I went to the police and asked them to release the hold, and they said they are investigating it.  I left.  Today, they called and said that they want to speak to my father (since he is the owner of the vehicle) in order to release it.  My father called and asked if he comes in, will they release it. The police said no, because they still have to do investigating.  I was not charged with anything, nor was my father. This happened last week.  As far as I know, the police are saying that 'they have all of this evidence that I hit a telephone pole and committed a hit-and-run'.   Can they keep my vehicle at the tow yard without a search warrant and without having pressed charges? It seems extremely unfair, especially since I am accumulating towing costs each day it sits there.  They won't release it, because they said the vehicle was 'abandoned'. Clearly it wasn't, provided that I called the next day to retrieve it.  Any advice?  Thanks!	Yes
The incident happened because he cut me off and braked instantly. There was only a foot of a distance between my cars front and his trucks rear after he instantly merged into my lane. So when he hit the brakes I only had a split second to brake. I couldn't brake all the way and managed to hit him. My radiator broke and the cars balance is weird do to the impact. I wish I had a dash cam, but I never thought I'd need it... After the hit, he didn't stop, he tried to run away and ended up driving into a dead end street. Where he quickly got out of his truck and yelled that it was fine. And got back into his truck to try and leave. I yelled at him to look at what he did to my car. That's when he pulled beside me with. I told him we didn't have to involve his insurance if he paid me cash, since he looked scared. As I know how his insurance bill would increase. I asked for his number and called it. After they I told him I have to go to class and proceeded to go turn off my car incase the damage to my car was bad. He then gassed it. Idk if he ran or mistook it for a conversation end. I wasn't gonna be late for class. So I quickly hit the gas a couple of times to see if my car sounded well enough to get me to class. It's imperative that I never miss a college class lecture otherwise I will fail. After class I called him multiple times and he wouldn't answer. Until he I told him I would report him to the police. He then said I'm he was at work, which is a lie. Because when I was him he was dressed in trailer trash clothes. The incident happened around 5:30pm and I called him after class at 8pm. So I called him at 10 which is when he said he would 'get out of work'. He said he spoke to his wife and wants me to give him my insurance info as if he was the one who's to make the claim. I then said my insurance was expired. But I read on forums where  lawyers say that if you aren't at fault it shouldn't matter. I told him to give me his info. He said his name was ... and that his insurance was progressive. I said I would call his insurance and then. Told him to text me his policy number. When I called the insurance couldn't pull up anyone with that name or insurance policy. But said an investigator from their insurance company would call me next morning. He did and he asked more details about the incident. They also couldn't get ahold of him as he wouldn't answer his phone. I gave them his number when the fake info he gave me that same night. I then texted him saying to send me a picture of his state ID and insurance info to make a claim to his real insurance and would file a report if he didn't. He then proceeded to avoid it by saying I didn't have any insurance and the police would laugh at me, because no matter what who ever gets rear ended is innocent he said. I filed the report and later that after noon. The investigator said, he finally got ahold of him and that he wouldn't give any info about him other than that his insurance wasn't progressive, he had a ford-150 and that my car already was damaged before the incident. Which is total bs. He lied about everything. And then had the nerve to text me saying his tired of this shit and that his lawyer wouldn't press charges for harassment if I texted him again. I know it's a bluff, because he's a liar and just wants to get away with it. I haven't been called by the police. But if I someone get the calls from my service provider as evidence along with my texts. I should win and have him lay for my cats damages right? I'm a poor college student. And can't drive my car anymore since he broke my radiator. And I have another class lecture this Monday. He never asked me to lay for his damaged rear since he knows he was at fault. But is this Enough info for me to win this case? Thanks	Yes
"Im from out of state and drive through NY regularly. One day I got pulled over and the cop cited me for going 75 mph in a 50 mph zone. I noticed after being pulled over that it was actually a 55 mph zone for cars but 50 for trucks (i have a car). I saw the ticket would be the same price either way though. I didn't want to fight the ticket because I wasn't going to go back to NY just to go to court. So i just paid the ticket. A few months later i get a letter in the mail saying I need to pay another 300 dollars for some sort of ""safety"" act where drivers with 6 or more points in NY need to pay. (We dont have this system in my state so i had no effin clue this was even a thing)  I looked up the point system and saw you get 6 points for going 21-30mph over the speed limit. But only 4 points if you go 11-20.  Long story short, the Cop f**cked me over by saying the speed limit was 50 and not 55. But i already paid the ticket. Having no idea that there was these extra fines based on point systems. WTF GUYS  Anyone have similar experiences or see any recourse i could take?"	Yes
I was recently stopped by an officer who was diving in the opposite direction. He said he clocked me at 15mph over. I don't think I was speeding but had not been looking at my speed until he puled me over. Does anyone have advise on how to dispute the ticket? 	Yes
First I'd like to say how much I hate Atlanta police department and their court.   July 7th got a ticket coming straight off the highway onto a 35mph zone in Atlanta Georgia. It's a speed trap, they had so many ppl pulled over using a lidar gun. It's not fair that we get no time to slow down coming off a ramp, but whatever. I get the ticket and it's only 10days away from court date. Is that even legal? They say even on their website it can take up to 2 weeks (10 business days) to process. That would be passed my court date.   I called the municipal court. This lady insisted I was reading the wrong date. I'm not. Even the cop was like 'call if 10days is too soon'. Uh yeah. So I check every day to see if it's processed. I asked the lady what do I do and she just responds with 'uuh, I guess you're just gonna have to wait til it's processed'   I have a feeling it still won't be processed by the court date. I wanted to sign up for the Pre-Trial Intervention to maybe get the ticket dismissed or lowered, but even that you have to sign up before court. I cant even request to postpone court date without it being processed! I can't even pay it if I wanted to avoid court.  What can or should I do? I'd like this to be dismissed.	Yes
I was driving on the lane beside a school bus when it stopped. I don't remember very clearly (I panicked a little after it happened), but I think I was already beside the bus when it stopped, so I didn't know if I should have braked quickly or passed on. In the moment I decided to pass it, which looking back was not the best idea.             I saw the camera on the side of the bus and I believe that the driver honked at me (it could also have been another car close by either honking at me or someone else). There were no children getting off the bus, it looked like a man was just talking to the bus driver. the bus may or may not have been empty as well since it is summer and it wasn't at the end or beginning of the school day.             My question is, am I definitely getting a ticket? I'm not actually from Maryland so I'm not very familiar with its traffic laws. Should I have stopped if I was right beside the bus and not behind when it stopped?              Thanks for the advice!	Yes
[near Lachine Canal, QC, Canada] So, I fucked up really badly. I don't know what to do or how exactly I should proceed, so I'm turning to good ol' reddit. Disclaimer: I have a very severe anxiety disorder, and panic attacks are a usual occurrence for me. So, I left work 45 minutes earlier than usual today, because I was feeling dizzy, had heart palpitations and a high blood pressure. I needed to lie down, so my boss gave me the OK to leave. Living 45min away from work (traffic), I started heading home at 3:17pm. It is now ~3:45pm, and I'm 10/13min away from home, finally. I start to feel uneasy once again, and decide I really do need to get get my blood pressure under control, considering the possibility of needing to go to the hospital. I get to the stop sight right before the train tracks. It is my turn to proceed, and as I start to accelerate, a grey van perpendicular to where I was decides it's her turn to go as well. I brake suddenly to avoid an potential accident. At that point, I'm beginning a panic attack, and I get flustered. The grey van is now in front of me (don't have the plates, I was too panicky to think of that), so I accelerate along with it. At that point, the lights and sirens of the train tracks are getting louder and stronger... The grey van and I are stranded on the middle or the train tracks and I'm panicking even more. The grey van then accelerates quickly, but just as it passes the tracks, the wooden bar comes down in front of me. I react right away and reverse as quick as possible, only to have the second bar fall right on top of my car's roof (FUCK ME). I'm panicking, scared.. and what comes next? The police comes out of nowhere, sirens and lights blaring. I'm happy they were there, because it calmed me down and they helped me get off the tracks.. however, as a repercussion, I got a 139$ ticket (which is not what I'm upset about). With the ticket, I got a monetary fine, but I also got 4 demerit points. Keep in mind: I have a probationary license, which only has 4 points on it. Bam, licence is lost for 24 months. I fucking lost my license because some guy decided to cut me off at the stop sign. I'm turning 18 in 5 days, so things would've been different. Damage to the car and rail were minimal, thank goodness. Anyhow, the police tells me that both my infractions led up to the ticket I received, and that the guy in front of me was in the wrong, however I was the one who got caught under the bar, and I was the one they caught/had to first help out. I will be contesting the ticket via lawyers from Tickets911, however I want some outside and objective opinions about this. What should I do? What are my chances? What can I do to at least get 1 point back, to possibly be able to keep my license? Any opinions/tips are welcome. Thanks, reddit.	Yes
I was in a car accident and the other driver was at fault. The car was totaled and my insurance is paying ~$6,000 for it and I still owe ~$7,000. I have GAP insurance so that should cover the rest of what I owe, and the insurance said the other guy's insurance will cover the deductible. I have no help for getting a new car though, can I pursue having the other driver pay for the new car?	Yes
Happened in Lima, Ohio. Not denying I was speeding because I was. Just want to know if it's worth going to court and if so do I need a lawyer or will it be simple enough for me to talk for myself? And if I am talking for myself what exactly do I say? (If I'm trying to get the ticket reduced)	Yes
Posting from the scene of the accident. I was driving down the road at ~40mph in a 40mph speed zone. A bus was stopped so I believed that it was letting off passengers. I slowed a little bit and was not in the lane of the bus. A person pulled out of the plaza unable to see my vehicle and hit in to my front fender. There is little damage to his vehicle. We exchanged information and got photos of the damage on both vehicles and license plates and insurance information. Police have not arrived yet and I have already made a claim. What next?  Damages: My vehicle: 99 Accord Coupe LX Broken headlight Tire fell off Bumper fell off  His vehicle: 02 Nissan Frontier Cracked front bumper 	Yes
Hi all! If I was parked in a parking lot and I open my door as another person drives into the spot next to me (fairly quickly) and my door creates a deep dent in his bumper, who is at fault?   We're currently trying to settle this through cash and haven't notified out insurance agencies, but I feel like it might not have been my fault.   I do recognize that I erred in not checking to make sure it was completely clear next to me before opening my door, but I would think that a pedestrian getting out of a car would take precedence over a vehicle driving into a spot, no?   This is my first time in an accident so I could be ignorant.	Yes
18y/o Bergen county, NJ,USA  So I never respond to texts while driving, but I while I was going to get bagels, my mom texted me. I picked up my phone looked at the text and put it down. Got pulled over.  I have a court date in February. It's municipal court. What can I expect there? Do I need a lawyer? or should I just plead guilty and pay the fine? I found online that for the first offense there's no points and it's a $200-$400 fine, is this correct?  Thanks	Yes
So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	Yes
"I'm speaking on behalf of my parents. These past 2 months have been very unfortunate financially. So this is what happened.. (My dad is a trucker) Yesterday my dad was unloading on a companies lot during the day. Just in front of the company the other lot is owned by a restaurant. Later that night after unloading, around 8:00-9:00PM my dad got tired and moved his truck ONTO the other lot (restaurants property) to rest a little bit. The truck was still running, my dad was in the truck. The only sign that was there was ""no overnight parking"" which I'm assuming is after 12 not before. They locked up one of his wheel before coming up and banging on his door to talk. Apparently they didn't have any ID's or anything. My dad called the police and the police couldn't do anything about it. Apparently towing companies in Charlotte won the bill where it seems like they can give a ticket for any amount they want. Seems very unregulated to me. This price is very hefty on my parents and they had to pay with credit. Is there anything we can do? My parents called their lawyer and the price added up to 200$ +200/h. They don't think it's worth it. Help would be much appreciated!"	Yes
I was stopped the other day and was given a court date. The cop allowed me to drive home and was was a very nice guy. I'm just worried about what will happen once I appear in court. If the officer didn't arrest me at the time, can i still go to jail?	Yes
I think i made a big mistake. I saw a firetruck in the distance ( i thought it would come in about 30 seconds so I made the turn . however, it came to be alot faster than i thought and instead it was closer to 10 seconds. When I made the turn, the firetruck turned out to be much closer but by the time i realised, i was already about 1/4 way in the turn. I quickly accelerated making the turn   by that time the firetruck was where i was at the turn, he was 4 seconds away   I thought I really had more time. Do you think Ill get in trouble for not waiting  I havent been pulled over but im scared that someone will report my license	Yes
So I just turned 18 on July 6th. But I got a speeding ticket a few weeks prior. Being underage, he took my license as insurance and gave me a court date of August 2. Now that I'm 18, can I still even be punished for a crime committed as a minor or am I pretty much showing up to be sent home right away? I'm pretty sure that not much will happen to me because he said I might get court ordered supervision or something but I don't even think that will happen. I live in Cook County Illinois by the way. Any help will be appreciated	Yes
My wife was recently involved in a car accident, the first either of us has had in the United States since moving here (state of Washington). She was on a highway with about a 45 mph speed limit, 2 lanes in each direction plus a center bi-directional turn lane. She was in the left lane. An on coming car moved into the center turn lane. The vehicle in front of her (also left lane) made a left turn at speed from the left lane, colliding head on with the car in the turn lane. My wife swerved right to attempt to avoid the collision in front of her, but couldn't quite get over fast enough - causing damage to her drive side front wheel and surrounding body pieces. She also isn't entirely positive but thinks the vehicle in front of her may have just passed her on the right and effectively turned almost from the right lane, but she's not positive. She appears to be mostly physically alright, although will seek some chiropractic care due to some back pain.   She talked to insurance only enough to open a claim and report minimal details. The adjuster assigned isn't in until Monday.   State patrol gave her a ticket for following too close. She also got information via the state patrol officer for the other two drivers. Witnesses at the scene indicated that the driver in front of her making the turn was being wreckless, although she does not have contact info.   We are in the middle of moving and this comes at a terrible time, not that it's ever good. I'm curious to know if there are any things to expect, things to push with our insurance provider (allow drivers have different companies, for what worth), things to not bring up, etc. Also, how important is it to fight he ticket? If the ONLY impact is the cost of the ticket, we'd rather pay than deal with fighting it. If it will hurt insurance or something else, then we have to consider that.   Any thing else I'm not thinking of? What would you do in this scenario?	Yes
My brother was driving at 11:30 at night. I was in the passengers seat and had hopped out to help him pull into a spot when he scrapped the neighboring car with his mirror. I did not hear or see this. After he told me it occurred, I told him to leave a note. He left his car parked but didn't leave a note and is now being charged with a hit and run. Since I was the licensed driver in the car, am I going to be charged?	Yes
"In Dec 2006, I was in the process of making a move across several states. While driving up, I admittedly going WAY too fast, trying to make it to a job interview in my new state. (I previously had never had any traffic tickets.)  Anyways, I got pulled over in Dinwiddie VA, ticketed and cited with ""Reckless Endangerment"" for how fast I was speeding. This was also the last time I drove, as I was in a friend's car (with her egging me on, speedwise. No excuse, but I shouldn't have given in to peer pressure) as I had already sold my own to finance the move.  Because every last dime I had went to a new place to live, I couldn't afford to a.) pay a ticket or b.) even make it back to where I was ticketed to go to court.  It's been nearly 8 years, and having this outstanding ticket has been killing me. I've wanted to set it right, go to court, take my punishment and move on with my life. I've been utilizing public transportation for the last 7+ years, as I'm certain my license was revoked.  I'm still dirt-poor, but finally in a place, financially, where I'm getting close to having enough to afford a lawyer, the trip and hopefully the ticket, so I went back to the VA General District Court website for the first time in a few years, and it appears that it was dismissed last year?  Is that possible?  Under the ""Hearing Information"" it has two dates with different results:  01/28/2010- Continued  05/09/2016- Finalized  And under ""Disposition Information"" it says  Final Disposition: Dismissed  Everything else under ""Disposition Information"" is blank, or set to 0. (Like Sentence/Suspended Sentence/Probation/Operator License Suspension Time...)  I was expecting to pay something to the tune of $2500+ to settle this out. Does that mean it's gone and I don't have to go to court/pay a ticket?  Could I walk into a VA DMV (I reside in VA, just on the other side of the state) and get a new license after so many years, or am I looking at consequences for letting it go this long?"	Yes
"I was on my way into work on the interstate when the car in front of my slammed on the breaks and I couldn't react fast enough and I slammed into the back of his truck leaving a hole in my front bumper and scratches to my hood but nothing to his car.   And as I know, rear ending is always the person in the backs fault but when we pulled off to check our cars that's when things got weird. When the other person got out of the car I realized he was a cop and before I could even say anything he said ""my cars fine"" and hopped back in his truck and sped off. Also, he had a trailer hitch in place and left a hole in my bumper and I believe it is illegal to have a trailer hitch if you aren't towing anything.   Do You think he was helping me by not taking my insurance? Should I call the police? Should I make a claim. Any advice would be awesome. I'm kinda shooken up cuz I'm younger and I've never been in this situation.   TL:DR Rear ended a cop, no damage to his truck because of tow hitch but my front bumper is messed up , cop left before I could even say anything. What should I do?"	Yes
Hello - I was wondering what would be best to do in this situation. Some guy crashes into my girlfriend's car in front of our house in the middle of the night. A neighbor ended up getting the license plate number. Girlfriend only has liability insurance and her insurance company just told her they can't/won't do anything. The person left a note but ins't answering phone calls. We have his name, phone number, place of work (hopefully), and license plate number. Should we confront him at his work? or would that hurt our case. Should we file a police report or give him more time? Thanks for the help!	Yes
So I'm from Missouri, and I went to Alaska for a couple years as a missionary for my church and had to get an Alaska driver's license (DL). Returned home, then went straight to school out of state without giving it a second thought (I mean, I probably actually look at the DL no more than once every 3 months)  My Alaska DL is going to expire in a couple of months, but I have no plans (or money for that matter) to return home just to get a new one, but I'm also not sure that I should get one in my school state, as I'll most likely only be here for another 8ish months.  I really don't like the idea of trying to live off of an expired license, so should I just get one here, even though I won't be here that long? Or is there a way to remotely get one from home (my research so far says no though)?	Yes
"Hi guys.  I went to get my license changed to a new state (TN) and realized I had two outstanding tickets in Vienna, GA. One was for speeding (46/35) and the other for driving with an expired license.  I completely forgot about them because I was on a work trip, I had left my license with my laptop at the office I was working at and the guy said he couldn't find my new state license (KY) but that he would issue a ticket against my old GA license, which was expired, if I didn't go to the police station and present my ID before with left. I ended up getting called to a different location that night, and now, two years later, am having problems.  I know ""Get a lawyer"" will be the first advice, but I was wondering if I called down to the courthouse and asked about my options since I am out of state what might happen."	Yes
Bottom Line:  I bought a used diesel truck from a Volkswagen dealer, and my local mechanic told me that it is fully deleted (catalytic converter, diesel particulate filter, and EGR have all been removed/bypassed).   When I was originally talking to this dealership I made it clear that I need a diesel truck to tow my 5th wheel, but it needs to pass a smog test. I asked the salesman if the truck had stock exhaust, and he said yes. At the time, I hardly knew anything about emissions or tuning modifications so I believed what the dealer told me. I settled on a Ram 3500, and drove it home.  Now, I find out the truck can't pass emissions. The state in which I am registering the truck does not have smog tests, so there won't be an issue getting the vehicle registered. However, I think it is a federal offense to not have a DPF or Catayltic Converter on the truck. Getting a misdemeanor or a felony charge, if I were to get pulled over, could jeapordize my career.  The parts alone are going to cost me over $4k to get the truck within EPA guidelines.  Basically I have two questions:  1. What can I do about the dealer? They told me it was OEM exhaust, but it's not. Now I'm expected to pay several thousand dollars for something that shouldn't have been an issue if the dealer told me the truth (I wouldn't have purchased this truck)  2. When I look up federal EPA guidelines, it talks about being a federal offense to modify or tamper with a vehicle's emission system. I did not tamper or modify them, it came this way from the dealer. Am I still liable in this scenario?	Yes
I sold my first ever car with a broken transmission to some guy who claimed to own a scrap yard and told me he was going to scrap it. This appears to have never happened and now the car I haven't seen in 2+ years has been impounded by the city of Houston. It says I am the REGISTERED owner and also says there is a registered lien holder as well. I do not want to be on the hook for a $20 daily storage fee and the tow. What can I do to help make sure the city knows I am NOT the owner of the car still? I signed this title over to this guy at the scrap yard, who from my understanding was supposed to SCRAP the title but he did not. This is in Houston, Texas. I do not have a copy of the bill of sale right now and I'm currently looking for it	Yes
Recently got my first traffic citation for speeding and for tinted windows. Want to know if i should plead not guilty on both tickets and go to court and when i go to court, remove the tints on my car and plead not guilty and plead guilty and pay the fine for the speeding with the possibility of not having points added to my license. Like i said, this is my first traffic citation. How should i approach this? Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
Okay, so I am staying at a college while I am interning for the summer. I do not attend this particular college, but do have my car registered there for temporarily parking. Last night, I parked my car in a handicap spot, so I could run in and print something. Took me 2 minutes and there were literally 10 open handicap spots ( I know still a horrible decision). Well got a $375 ticket. Do I have to pay this?	Yes
Hello guys. Im a dual diploma student. I was a student in the US, was going to sell my car but i couldnt(couldnt find a customer who didnt look like a weirdo from craigslist), so i gave a friend power of attorney to gift/sell my car. I allowed him to gift it because there was a family friend to arrive that year so he could take it if he wanted it. I forgot to turn the license plates over before i returned to my country.  Turns out the guy i gave power of attorney got pulled over driving it(which i in no way allowed him to do) after the insurance expired. The police took the license plates and towed the car. He took it back after paying some fine.   I immediately made him sell the car for really cheap as i didnt want it giving me any more trouble than it already did.  Now the question. Im still not done with my university in NY. When i return to the US, is there any chance i might not be allowed into the country? :(	Yes
I received a parking ticket in the mail from U of I in Urbana, but I've never been there (I live in Wisconsin). In addition, the ticket was dated 2009 but my plates were issued in 2017 (they had the right plates for me). The number and website on the form seem to be legit University of Illinois parking services. I called them and the ticket is on record for them, but the vehicle description is wrong and they couldn't provide an explanation for the date. Will this negatively impact my credit or anything? How do I fight this? I've already sent a vehicle abstract from the Wisconsin DMV to the U of I parking services website to prove my plates are relatively new.	Yes
An old man backed into my car today. When he got out of he vehicle it became clear he was high. I was able to get his insurance info, but he couldn't tell me his name or phone number due to slurred speech. When I said I was calling the police because he seemed intoxicated, he fled, almost hitting someone.   I called 911 and reported he was on the road that very moment and high, and then went and filed a police report.   I am not injured, though I had a wild panic attack on the phone with 911. What do I do now? I filed a claim with my insurance and I have the accident report I filed with the police. Do I need a lawyer, even though I'm unharmed? My car's bumper will need to be replaced, and I'd like this guy off the road so he doesn't do this again, potentially fatally.	Yes
As the title says I was pulled over for speeding and found that my license had been suspended due to an unpaid ticket, which I thought I had paid. It had been suspended for quite a while, over a year. I've paid my fines and gotten my license reinstate. Colorado laws says I have to have knowledge of the suspension but I'm not sure how I can prove I was unaware. I can't afford an attorney. I can bring bank records to show I used Uber to get to work from the time I was suspended until it was reinstated. I remember receiving notices in the mail about the ticket but got nothing saying I was suspended, when spoke with the credit agency holding the account for my unpaid ticket they had an incorrect address for me, should I mention this? Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know what to do or what to expect. My court date is Thursday. Thank you ahead of time for any advice or encouragement.	Yes
I have a friend who recently got pulled over in VA for speeding on a highway, and since it was over 80mph they also got a reckless driving charge, but rather than just a ticket they have to go to court. Would you recommend getting a lawyer to go with them or are they better off not paying a lawyer and dealing with it themselves?	Yes
Hi everyone! Short and sweet: I’ve never gotten a speeding ticket before. I grew up in VA and I know the driving laws.  The minor violations I’ve incurred are:  Driving too closely (minor fender bender in early 2014) in VA  Red light ticket a few months ago in Illinois  I moved to Chicago recently and drove all the way to Virginia Beach in one day (not that big of a deal but context is important). When I reached Lexington, VA I got pulled over going 90 in a 70.  I had my cruise control on UNDER 80 almost my whole trip; I think I had taken it off due to the twisty nature of the road, I had to brake a lot. Anyway, the road was empty, I was just in the zone driving, and I guess I had pressed too hard down and was pulled over at 90, not realizing I never put my CC back on.  Anyways, I’m devastated. I don’t really know what to do. I know better than to go over 80 in VA (or anywhere, really), yet here we are.  Any advice is much appreciated.	Yes
I got my first speeding ticket in Oregon and was wondering how to go about handling it. Also, my id is from a different state and the officer wrote my id number wrong on my citation, how will that affect things,  in terms on getting it taken care of and with my auto insurance?	Yes
I am in the process of buying a car from my boss.   I will be making payments toward it but it will remain in his name until I pay it off. Everything is going smoothly and we even have a contract drawn up, and have a reciept book set up so there will be a proper paper trail there.   We live near the state line, him in Indiana and I in Ohio so I'm unsure how to go about insurance. It's part of our contract that I have it for the duration of me paying off the car (and legally have it to drive, duh). So, do I need to go through Ohio or Indiana to get it? I have no problem getting it myself, or would it be better for me to be added to his policy and just pay him the difference?  Thanks!	Yes
A couple months ago my friend's car was towed. There was another car, same make and model, in the lot which the tower had a lien for. He sold the lien to my friend for cheap (waived the towing/storage fees because they just wanted to make room in the lot) and towed it to his house since it doesn't run well/have a key.  My friend planned to register the car as non-op and use it for parts but found out at the DMV that it's got $700 in fees and can't be registered non-op until the renewal date which is in a few months. To claim the lien (or whatever proper terminology is here) he needs to get the car to pass smog and pay those fees so he decided to temporarily hold off on the registration.  So he's in this catch: can't register the car as non-op yet but there's no way to pass smog with it not running. Can't scrap it because it's not in his name until renewal date. Also the DMV fees are steep and un-anticipated.  Currently, he'd like to swap out a couple parts on the car and be rid of it if possible (and hopefully without huge expense). Any suggestions to this end are appreciated. A few questions: Since the sale isn't recorded with the DMV is it legit? Does the towing company still own the car technically and is there any way to void the sale? Is there a way to junk the car before the renewal date? Is there any way around DMV fees and this catch with the registration?  Thanks in advance for any advice or info!   tl;dr: bought lien of non-running parts-car, hit with fees and a catch with DMV registration, haven’t registered yet, trying to smoothly and legally exit situation	Yes
First ticket I've ever gotten, traffic slowed down but I was trying to get around the people going 65 in a 70 in the fast lane and I did but then all the sudden there is a giant SUV on my rear the people to my right are going about 80 so I tried to speed up to get out of the giant suvs way and he lit me up gave me a ticket for 90 in a 70 which I would of been going 80 if I wasn't genuinely afraid if I slowed down I'd of gotten rear ended (my little Ford Focus would of lost that fight) because I had no clue it was a cop, I'm probably gonna just have to pay the ticket and go to traffic school but just wanted to explain situation on here and check if forcing me to go faster by tailing me is ok cause it feels like it should be but I'm not a lawyer, I'm located in California.	Yes
So my wife and I took a weekend trip. The highway we took is one of the older highways that has a ton of little towns where speeds go from 65 down to 45 and back up again constantly. At one point there was a speed change that my wife didn't notice and she was also coasting down a hill doing 60-65 we aren't sure in a 45. The cop stops us an writes her a ticket for 70 in a 45. My wife is also in the process of getting a job where a clean driving record is a must. Is there any recourse we can take to ensure this doesn't make it to her record? She got the ticket this weekend and after months of back forth with a company she got the job offer today. It's her only ticket and no prior warnings either. The state is arkansas. 	Yes
So I was extremely stupid and sped in Virginia on I-95 on my way home from North Carolina. I had my cruise control set for 78MPH and didn't realize that the speed limit changed to 55MPH so I messed up big time. Luckily, the officer wrote the ticket as a general speeding ticket rather than wreckless driving, which he said it technically was. I don't know if I should attempt to go to court for it to reduce the speed or not bother because the cop already did me a favor. I am fine with paying the fine as this is a totally legitimate ticket, but I just want to know my best plan of action. This is my first ever ticket	Yes
Today I was driving and got pulled over, I wasn't breaking any traffic laws and going the speed limit in traffic. There was an officer running what I assume was speed radar from the emergency turn-around, who pulled out about 4 cars behind me, and proceeded to pull me over. He confirmed my identity upon coming to my window, and told me the reason he pulled me over was because my license had come up as suspended, which was accurate. I provided him with my work privelages and he let me continue on my drive.  I am not in any legal trouble nor did I receive any ticket, but I am very confused - I did not break any traffic laws, nor was ever followed by this officer for him to run my plates. How was he able to see my license was suspended? Is there technology on officers that lets them automatically scan and flag license plates going by even at those high speeds? Also, is it legal to run plates like that without any suspicious reasoning? I felt very violated that I got pulled over going down the road - I understand my plates run as suspended with privelages, but I didn't break any traffic laws or do anything to give any officer suspicion to that.  Like I said again, I am not in any legal trouble, nor was the officer anything but polite to me, I just had some questions about the entire interaction! I've passed several police like that going to/from work before and this had never happened to me before. Thank you!	Yes
Dunno what's really pertinent here but I have a record in two states living in a third. I'm a pretty stable schizo with two jobs and a BA. I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb. I received ~$200 pair of tickets for operating w/o insurance and driving on a suspended registration. I paid the tickets well ahead of deadline but came home to find info staying that a bench warrant was put out on me but apparently according to the clerk's website I'm good. So what's the deal with this type of situation. I'm not even clear on if these are simple tickets misdemeanors or whatever (WI). 	Yes
I recently got into a fender bender with the other person being at fault. Their car is fine, mine is not, and I have to pay a $500 insurance deductible to get my car fixed. Does anyone have advice or tips for how to get the other person to pay this deductible, or at least pay part of it? I've heard I can take him to small claims court, but how successful would I be in doing so? I'm a poor college student and I can't afford another $500 when I just spent that amount 2 days before on new tires.	Yes
Hi there.  I'm a 26 year old female who just started driving. (Don't judge.) I got into an accident this past Monday, and I don't have my license or permit, Even though I've passed the test. I was just driving my mom's car and found out that she didn't insure the car, and I'm kinda stuck on what I should do next. I don't have insurance at the moment, and I'm not sure what to do. No one was seriously injured, but the cars are damaged for sure. I was found at fault because I had a stop sign, but I didn't see her barrelling down the street. She hit me on the passenger side. This is in Seattle, and I usually don't drive there, but the day off the accident, I was trying to pick up extra shifts for work. I realize what I did was incredibly stupid but honestly, we're moving soon, and this unexpected accident coupled with the other financial strain is starting to get to me.   The person who got hit, is insured, and their claims representative is trying to get proof of insurance, which I don't have. Is it possible to ask for a payment plan of some sort, or how receptive will they be? Also I haven't gone to court yet, it's only been a few days. Should I fight it to get the fine reduced a little?	Yes
I was on my way home from picking my girlfriend up from work about 3 weeks ago. It was just after 11 pm and I had a friend accompany me since we were hanging out anyways and we wanted to grab a bite to eat after. I pull up to a red left turn arrow and waited for it to turn green, the light proceeds to turn green (green, not flashing yellow, to be clear) so I accelerate to get onto the ramp that heads onto the freeway, halfway across the intersection I see headlights to my right side and half a second later an F350 with a pushbar is shearing through the front end of my car and I'm screaming what the fuck. The airbags did not deploy for whatever reason. I go into emergency mode and tell my passengers to get out of the car, and get to safety since my car was smoking and I didn't know if it would start on fire or not. The other driver (who's truck was totally fine) walked over and admitted fault, I proceeded to bitch at him for being a reckless fucking idiot who could have killed all 3 of us while also contacting police. So the cop shows up, takes mine and my passenger's statements, and goes to talk to the guy who had just gotten off the phone with his boss since it was a work truck. This was my first accident so I was totally caught off guard and didn't have much of an idea of what to do. I took pictures of my car and the intersection, and also took a picture of his license plate and insurance information. The past 3 weeks have been a jumble of phone calls and trying to figure out what the hell to do to get what's owed to me. Fast forward yesterday, I finally get a hold of their insurance agent amd she tells me she will send out an adjuster to estimate the damages and whatever else they do so here I am waiting until I get another call from their agent today. Apparently they are denying my claim due to insufficient evidence that it was their drivers fault. I've never been involved in anything like this and I have no idea where to start besides getting a hold of the police report. So I guess my question would be what the hell do I do now?  Sorry for the wall of text, not good at formatting on mobile.	Yes
Hey guys I was in a motorbike crash on the 2nd July, I was going down the motorway in the fast lane and it turned into a merge lane so I merged. About 10 seconds later all I see is brake lights come on so I tried to brake aswell, couldn't slow down fast enough so i had to swerve to the right and clipped the rear right side of the car in front, now comes to my problem. I have decided not to claim and just wanted to fix my bike up myself without getting insurance involved but I have just had a claim made against me by the other party involved. My insurance ran out on the 12th so I wanted to know if I would still be covered and how to handle the claim against me. Any advice would be helpful .	Yes
I would like to state that I am appealing this ticket with or without a lawyer, and I am asking for advice on my best course of action.  There was a crazy amount of traffic where I had to drive today.  There was the usual Tourist traffic for people heading down to the cape, alongside the typical traffic, and also a funeral procession clogging things up.  I was in a position where to travel at a safe speed of 75 mph (speed limit is 65mph, but the average travelling speed is between 70-80mph) I had to change lanes frequently.  My goal was to get around the funeral procession travelling at 65 mph in the middle lane, and to not get trapped behind the individuals travelling 70mph in both the left and middle lane (the person in the right hand lane was not passing, and was in fact slowing down for some reason).  I had to change lanes numerous times, but did so using my turn indicator and while paying attention to where my vehicle was.  I observed a state trooper fly up the highway with damage to his driver's side front end.  I was currently in the right hand lane, to the right of the two cars travelling at 70 mph.  He had his lights on, and as I pulled over he pulled over VERY close, and I pulled forward another foot or so to avoid being struck.  I pull out my licence, wait for the cop.  He reaches in and takes it without a word from either of us.  He comes back and hands me the ticket without saying anything else, he was positioned in a way where it was hard for me to look at him or see anything.  I say thank you, he gets in his vehicle and leaves, with me stuck in the breakdown lane in heavy traffic for 2 miles.  Tl;dr I was trying to get around really slow and distracted drivers, did so in a way that was a bit rushed, and a state trooper who was obviously having a bad day gave me a ticket without so much as a 'Do you know why I pulled you over?'  ----- The ticket states...  89-4A Weaving x6 $105  89-4A Unsafe Lane Change x3 $105  90/17 95 in a 65 with no boxes checked (Posted, Not Posted, Clocked, Lidar, Radar, Estimated)  I know 100% that I wasn't travelling at 95 miles per hour.  I was at most 80-85, and only so I could pass the traffic that was inconsistently between 60-75.  I do not have the best record, I had a similar ticket 4 years ago (which is the last spot on my record, which goes away in 5 months).  With that said, my record has been improving over time.  My question here is, is a traffic lawyer going to do me any favors, or is it not worth the time?  I was quoted $700 flat from a lawyer earlier today, which would make sense long-term if this entire ticket gets dismissed, but I am not sure if that would even happen.  How much more likely is the case going to be dismissed/reduced with a lawyer present than if I represented myself?  I am capable of looking up laws, cleaning up my appearance, and get to the court on time.  With the information above, if you can offer any insight it would be appreciated.  I have never been to court before (no criminal record, never fought a ticket) and want to do my best.	Yes
"So I was driving (using cruise control) which was set at 80mph when I got pulled over. Mind you this is a 70mph speed zone. So I understood the why I was pulled over.  But then he came at me accusing me of going 96 in a 70. So I told him to test his radar because it must not be accurate. He never tested it all he did was come back with a ticket.  So I'm reading over the ticket and he yanks it out of my hand while I'm reading it over and he says ""I don't have time for you to read over your ticket my shift is about to end. If you spent more time reading over the seed signs we wouldn't be in this problem"" so he yanks the ticket out of my hand rips me off my copy without me ever signing it. Walks away and drives off.   The ticket is for a summons in court. I doubt this will hold up in court. What do you guys/girls have to say on this matter. "	Yes
I was caught by a speed gun going 85 mph in a 55 mph zone, after the fine was payed I was told by my fathers legal adviser to plead not guilty and to fight for a lower punishment. What steps can I take to not make myself look like an idiot. Here is what I have noted so far: * I was in a 55 Mph zone * I have driven over 10000 miles since I got my car this fall, driving to soccer practice for the school, for my soccer club that is an hour away, school , work, games, leisure.  * Driving for me is a daily task, and to be able to accomplish the things I need to do at this time in my life (Soccer identification camps, touring colleges, work, odds and ends) I need to drive because of my parents work schedule. * The car I was pulled over in was not my vehicle, it was my ex-girlfriends, it was a newer, better accelerating car.  *I am not saying I had a justified reason for speeding, I am cut and dry guilty, but I had SAT's in the morning and I was driving home from a late soccer game, I wasn't thinking right and I just wanted to get home.  That is all I have for now, can I get advice on whether this useful information, and what else I can add. Any advice is appreciated.	Yes
Recently my girlfriend was hit in the rear of the vehicle by another vehicle changing to her lane. I have no idea how he did not notice her or how this had happened. No big deal right? She calls the police for a report and not knowing the law or good habits after being involved in a motor vehicle collision I think she incriminated herself by saying the wrong thing.    The third party (person who ran into her) had his story straight by saying he was in the same lane as her the entire time and that she had pulled out in front of him.   After spending 15 minutes talking to the third party the police officer asks my girlfriend 1-2 questions and then gives her a citation for failing to yield right of way.  This does not make sense to me looking at pictures because she is all the way in her lane and accelerating at the point of impact. This basically puts her word vs the third party since the cop was not a witness and nobody stepped forward.    The options are basically this. 1. Pay the citation and do a 4 hour course to prevent points on her license.  This is scary because it's basically an admission of guilt.  2. Have a lawyer write a letter explaining how she was in the right and hope he sides with her.  3. Take it to court and hope the judge says that she had the right of way being completely in her lane and not that the third party had the right of way from already being on the road.  The third option would be the best because there is a high chance the citation is dismissed completely through lack of evidence or what not but it is also the most risky and expensive route.  The first option would be great if it is possible but I'm not sure how the insurance companies do their side of things. The main concern is to not get an absurd insurance rate increase. I want to discuss further and see what the best options are. I plan on getting the police report when it is available.  Thanks for reading, Matt	Yes
I understand completely that I am at fault for rear ending somebody.  The insurance is covering the other driver (just their back corner was hit), but my car is being totaled because I fell into a ditch.  Nobody was hurt.  This is my first offense and I am only 18. I do not want any legal implications to ruin my life/my parent's insurance rates for the next few years. My options are 1.admit guilt 2.admit guilt with explanation 3. Deny  From what I researched, Michigan assumes that the driver who hits the car from behind is at fault.  What are the realistic outcomes as to what could happen with each decision?  Do cops really show up to court if I choose to plea not guilty?  Does the prosecutor/judge go easy on first time traffic offenses?  Which one is the best choice, given the context?	Yes
Hi there,  Few days ago, I received a letter from the Commonwealth of Massachusetts stating in that I had used the toll road twice in locations in Massachusetts in which that wasn't me. The requested payment was $2.60. Even though the amount was very little, I do not want to pay for the amount for something I didn't do.   So, I started googling on what I should do because I was afraid this was some sort of scam. I started reading articles about a lady who didn't know she was being charged and ended up owing $49,000 as a result. I started worrying about what I should do to resolve this matter so it doesn't come back to me again.  I apologize if this is not the right post for this subreddit. Could you please guide me to the correct one if that's the case? Thank you for taking your time to read my post. :)	Yes
Recently, a NY friend of mine lost his license and has to pay a huge fine due to driving without car insurance. However, during the time the DMV claims he did not have car insurance, he, in fact, did. He can't drive down to anywhere because of that, which makes it harder to take care of any of that. What should he do?	Yes
"The place where I work has street cleaning from 7:30am to 8am and today I parked my car in front of my workplace and my phone said it was 7:59am so I got out to feed the meter. Now the block where I work is one of those super long blocks and currently there is only one meter which is on the other end for me.  I am putting money in the meter when I notice a traffic cop walking towards my car. I quickly cancel the meter and run to my car and I get there before she can scan my car and I get in to just move my car across the street but she is just standing in front of my car refusing to move. I get out and pleaded with her saying I was about to feed the meter but she wasnt having it. She told me ""Its not a race"" and that she was giving me a street cleaning ticket no matter what.  Frustrated I take the ticket from her and on the ticket it says Street Cleaning violation and time was set to 7:58 which is weird because it was past 8 at that time. Do I have a good shot at disputing this ticket? I know that there can be a 1-2 minute discrepancy when it comes to time and I do have a meter ticket for 8:04am which I got as soon as she left."	Yes
Quick question for everyone here. I just got a speeding ticket via photo enforcement in Washington DC. I was going 16 over so it's a 150 dollar fine.   I have two questions for everyone here.    1) If I go to contest the penalty is there a judge that I speak with or is it a random person behind a desk? I ask this because it looks like the address is just a suite and not a court house.   2) What are the odds that the judge lowers the fine if I've never had a moving violation before? (Been driving for over 6 years) Is it even worth me going in? Or should I just pay it.    I am obviously guilty of speeding. I'm not contesting the ticket itself. I am wondering if the fine can be reduced though.	Yes
Hi sorry if everything is jumbled I'm trying to figure everything out.   I got a call from my husbands phone this morning saying he was just hit by a truck while on his motorcycle. He was on the freeway when this happened and was slammed by a truck and he slammed into the side of a semi. I have no idea what the state of his bike is but chp gave me the number of the wrecker towing company that took his bike.   I called the company who has my husbands motorcycle and they told me the fees was close to 500$ (I'm in such a panic state I almost forgot the exact number they told me). They also informed me that it'll be an extra 70$ past 5pm and everyday so on.   Right now I unfortunately don't have that money due to us having another emergency less then a month ago so we already used our emergency funds we had saved.   I've already called our insurance, I called CHP to get the other drivers insurance information but they said they won't be able to give it to me until tomorrow. What steps do I take from here, my husbands been asleep most of the day due to his pain meds so I'm really a mess trying to figure out what to even do from here. Is there a way to get the other persons insurance to pay for the bike fees to get it out? Our insurance hasn't been helpful because the policy is under my husbands name and they keep telling me that they need to speak to him.   I'm sorry again for the erratic mess, I can't process my thoughts correctly right now.   Edit to add this is in California.	Yes
Hello, I just received driving permit under AB 60 from Stanton DLPC (I'm over 18). I want to make an appointment for driving test, so I called the DMV. Then I was told to call a number that says on my paperwork but I didn't get any paperwork other than my number. They said I have to call a number starting with 805, or DMV will call me but that's uncertain. Is the interview required? (Since stanton dlpc didn't mention anything) or will they call me? (How long then?) Thank you	Yes
"Went to update my address with the DMV, and noticed they still show the car that I scrapped years ago as titled to me.  I remember doing the paperwork with the scrapper and signing the title over to him. In FL, the scrapper is then supposed to ""junk"" the title.  However, I don't remember any details about which scrapper it was, and the paperwork from that sale is who-knows-where.  What steps can I take to get this title off my DMV record?"	Yes
My girlfriend recently got a ticket for having expired vehicle registration and didn't realize that the officer also put down that she failed to show ID even though she did show him her registration, what can she do in this situation?	Yes
She is not 21 yet. She bought a car and had been wanting to in awhile. I did not know about this but I am willing to help family unconditionally.  I just need to know why they need me. I think it's because she is under 21 and since no one else is currently able to sign, I will have to. I leased my own car years ago, so I am murky about the process.  Do I need to watch out for anything when I go to the DMV and sign my name to it? What do I do after she turns 21?	Yes
I bought a truck on Craigslist I tried to do my research looked up the vin and wasn't stolen or damaged. When I made the deal took a picture of the guys license and the license plate of the car he drove, I payed cash. when I went to go register the truck they told me the trucks title was fake as well as the owners license but that since the truck wasn't stolen they could make me a bonded title but would need to contact the police. The police came and told me they needed to take a truck and open an investigation that if everything was fine it would be returned in a weeks top. It has been almost a month and I haven't heard anything back. What can I do ?	Yes
I drove less than a mile to the store, I drove past a downed stop sign (it was literally on the ground because somebody else hit it) and was struck by another car. Nobody was hurt, we were going fairly slow. Damage to my car was worse, he had a scuffed/slightly dented fender. My window was shattered and the door was pushed in.   I freaked out because I know I'm not supposed to be on the road and I saw the sign I drove passed. I said sorry, claimed responsibility and we took pictures.  He seemed nice and agreed not to involve the police, assuming that I'd get into trouble. Said he had no interest in taking advantage of me, however it was a company car and somebody has to pay.   I'm confused, my parents are in the hospital because my mom got injured from something unrelated. I have no idea what to do.   I don't have money, I am disabled and subsist off of SSI. What the hell do I do? My friend guessed it would cost around 1100-1500 for repairs. I have a trashbag on my window.   Why don't I have insurance/license? Long story nobody cares. Why did I risk driving without them? Well, I'm a fucking idiot apparently.   What do I do?	Yes
Hi reddit,   I recently sold a car to someone off craiglist for $700. I filed a report of sale a week later (after the 5 days).   Fast forward a month - two later, I get a call that my car was towed from being abandoned at a mcdonald's parking lot down in kent (i live in edmonds) but now the towing company says **I am liable** for the charges not the buyer of the car. **they are arguing that I filed the report of sale incorrectly**   The charges are up to $800 now including the parking fees at the towing lot.   How should I proceed? Is there a way to get out of this bill? I have proof of my report of sale.	Yes
We both were fined on the basis of violation of title. Is there any angle I can argue in court? He has rented a car in the past and been pulled over with no repercussions. Can I argue that I did enough due diligence? Thanks for the help 	Yes
I live in St. George, Utah, and got pulled over for speeding. The officer noticed that my airbags had been deployed (because of a crash in the past) and wrote me a citation for failure to repair airbags. I went in to the city building and learned that it would be 500$ for the citation and scheduled a meeting with the judge. The meeting ended up with another court date in August.  Is driving without airbags installed illegal? The citation page sounds like it only applies to a person repairing a vehicle and I was just driving, did the cop fuck me over with the wrong citation?  Citation link: https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title41/Chapter6a/41-6a-S1624.html	Yes
Hi guys, so here is the scenario. I took my car to get a free code scan to an autoshop (Goodyear). They gave a sheet with the codes and gave me the car keys back. When I went to my car, I found the car smashed in. I went inside and asked them what happened. The manager and the employee who drove my car denied the car crash. They said they didn't do anything and it was there already. I called the cops and then the manager made a claim through their company corporate. The manager told me that the company doesn't have its own insurance but it has a third party insurance. The manager told me that the car will be inspected and an estimate of the damage will be calculated. Afterwards the company will either have a body shop fix it or pay the amount for the damage depending who is seen to be at fault. He said that their insurance will be contacting my car insurance. He only said that my car's front bumper is damaged, when in fact i disagreed. The car's bumper is dented in; the grill came off; a part of the undercarriage frame is bent; car takes longer to crank up now. UPDATE: Goodyear's insurance denied the car crash and they denied the claim that was requested by the manager. The Goodyear insurance person said that the damage was not caused by the employees but it might have been one of their customers since they claim to have a footage from a nearby store. Here are the problems that I have with this: 1. This cannot go through my insurance, there are way too many claims (all no fault) on there already. I won't be able to afford a further increase for the car insurance. What can I do if they refuse to reimburse me from their insurance company? Would the next step be to go to small claims court?  2. If I take it to small claims court, how does the process work? and how would i get the amount for the damage the manager said there is and also the damage he said there is not?   3. Should I use these estimates as proof to claim there is more damage than the company agree to?   4. This is what i prefer: I want the company to pay for the damage and I want to fix it myself. Is this possible? What do I do to get them to pay me instead of fixing it through their body shop?  5. What should i do if they claim it through my insurance company? I don't want this  I know this is a long post, I am frustrated and confused. I don't know where to start, please give any information you think is helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read my whole post.	Yes
"Hi,   I currently study at a college in Georgia. It used to be a unspoken rule that you couldn't/shouldn't back in to a parking spot. But no one ever actually got a ticket for it. Until today when I pulled in from a run to the store when I noticed a car next to me got a ticket. I read it out of curiosity and it said ""Unauthorized back-in"".   I back in to a parking spot because I consider it safer than trying to back up to pull out since I can see around other cars earlier and some asshole can't get the drop on me if he decides to burn out of the lot like I've seen some of the motorcycles here do.   I understand that there's very few things private property holders can't do when you're on their grounds in the US.   I wanted to bring it up to the administration as a safety issue. I guess I was just wondering if there's any sort of legal ground I could try to stand on to keep from getting laughed out of the room. Could bringing it up even put a target on my back?"	Yes
"1) Is it illegal to pass a vehicle inspection without the vehicle? 2) In a bill of sale, what would ""Title Fee: $400"" legally mean? Would it be seen as the cost of registration, taxes, and fees in the buyers name. Or is it too vague to mean anything? 3) If someone registers the car with a fraudulent VIR, is there a way to prove that?  For all of you people who seem to want to criticize me for buying a used car, and being unhappy that it broke down the next day. I have taken the story out and only left with the questions I need answering. If you need background, I won't give any as you will just insult me."	Yes
I have a NY licences and was pulled over for passing a school buss, it was rather early for me, so I don't recall even seeing the school bus, what are my best options for defending myself in court	Yes
I was involved in an at-fault accident recently.  This is my first accident, and hopefully my last.  The cop told me he needs to prove to the insurance company that it was not the other guy's fault.  He wrote me a ticket for failing to maintain a safe distance.  Couldn't he have acknowledged that this was not the other driver's fault in a police report, but not issue me a ticket?	Yes
I hope this is an OK place to ask this.  I got a ticket in Nov of last year in CA and did a trial by dec. and lost and I just completed online traffic school about 2 days ago.  My insurance is due and is higher due to the ticket. Insurance told me I need to get proof of the ticket is gone from the DMV then send it to them and they will credit me the overage. So whats the typical amount of time for the DMV?	Yes
"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	Yes
So back in Feb 2017 I was very stupid and drove after drinking. I have a lawyer and he has looked at the video and everything and says that while the stop may be challenged that if I loose then I have to go through the trial and I could lose more because I was clearly drunk in the video. I've reviewed the evidence myself and I agree with him completely.  I am mostly just concerned about the First Offenders Program in general. I live in MD and never plan to drink or drive again. I don't mind doing the classes, or getting the evaluations, or joining AA because I was wrong and I could have really hurt someone or myself.  I am just wondering how this is going to look on my record.	Yes
Hey guys. Yesterday my friend hit a woman's car as he was backing out. The damage was extremely minimal and nobody was in the other car at the time of the incident. It was just a scratch and he asked the lady not to report it to the insurance and he would just pay the damage. She decided to notify the insurance anyways and I wanted to know how this will affect him? Is there anything he can do to help him ease through this situation a bit better? Also, is it true that mechanics will charge more for repair if they know insurance is involved? Thanks so much to anyone who helps and I apologize if this is the wrong sub to post this on.	Yes
"Have scoured the internet for this one, but all information only mentions BAC or rolling retest violations being reported or forwarded to VASAP/court system.  Are the ignition start/end times data being analyzed as well for possible restricted license violations? Or can you only ""get caught"" for that by being pulled over? Just want some clarification. Thanks!"	Yes
Have a rockstar attorney ($750 / hr ) could it be tossed out? Refused breathalyzer and nurse couldn’t get any blood from me.	Yes
So, I received a notice from a collection agency regarding a towing on a vehicle that I do not posses or even own in California.  More a year ago I was trying to buy this acura integra for my friend to use. I was unable to title the car in my name due to not being able to pass emissions, therefore I never finished the application for change of ownership and title. The car was sold to someone else by my friend and was eventually stolen and then towed while I was at school in San Deigo.  All I can do now is write a letter to dispute the validity of the charges.  I'm a bit stressed over this and wondering what options I have to use, if any. Thanks.	Yes
"A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.  State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.  The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.  Now this is where it gets really shady. Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.  So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!"	Yes
"Here's the provided evidence, my car is the silver SUV behind the white car.   https://streamable.com/4902w  http://i.imgur.com/bOMhlFb.jpg  http://i.imgur.com/6YWqWsy.jpg  On the citation it says ""Yellow Time: 4.2 sec, Red Time: 0.2 sec"" which from what I can gather means the light had been red .2 seconds at that point when I crossed the line. I am really surprised that they are mailing me about a ticket for .2 seconds and it honestly sounds ridiculous. It's literally fractions of a second. I googled around a bit and found some other state had their law written that nothing less than .3 seconds was ticket-able which I guess is slightly more reasonable.   Do I have a good chance to get rid of this if I dispute it or do you guys think I'm clearly guilty and .2 seconds into red is illegal?"	Yes
Hi, I'm from San Diego. I began receiving tickets for expired registration for a vehicle that could not pass smog and that I could not fix so I sold it. I was just wondering, does releasing liability count as a correction or do I pay the full fine?	Yes
Dealer took the car to emissions for me but a day or two after driving it the check engine like came on. Took it to autozone. Told me it was the catalytic converter how should I approach this?	Yes
So back in April I got a new prescription for my glasses. The doctor tells me that due to my eyes needing two different prescriptions I may feel a little crossed eyed for a few days. I take his advice, go next door to the glasses store to pick out new frames, etc., and I'm told they'd be ready in about two weeks. Two weeks later I pick them up and notice the cross eyed sensation immediately but think nothing of it. A couple more weeks go by and I still feel crossed eyed while wearing my new glasses when I get into a minor accident while backing up my work truck. I honestly didn't put two and two together until I got into yet another almost identical accident soon after. The next day to go back to store  where I got my glasses to have them checked and they say it must be the fault of the eye doctor. Lucky for me both places are next door (I don't think they're affiliated though) and they deny it's their fault saying this store has had this issue before. That being said, I walk back into the store, tell them what my doctor's office said and they say something along the lines of if they had known I went to this particular doctor they wouldn't have sent me away due to this guy being a super hotshot eye doctor or something who's apparently never wrong. This time they actually bother to look at my glasses and it turns out my prescription is focused in the lower corners of my lenses instead of over my pupils. As you would expect they replaced my lenses (another couple of weeks). I recorded the whole ordeal (audio not video) on my phone but didn't mention anything about the accidents to them so not to spook them but now I fear this whole mess may effect my career later on down the line. I had to beg my employers to allow me to keep driving, not to the financial penalties(a whole other story I'm not worrying about right now unless you guys suggest otherwise). My main concern is my driving record. With aspirations of pursuing a new career that also requires me to drive a work vehicle I fear this whole mess may have stunted my professional growth.   TL;DR I got into a couple of of work related accidents within a short period of time of getting a new pair of poorly crafted glasses and have an audio recording of  the company admitting thier mistake. Now I fear this may hurt my career long term due to tarnish driving record.   Do I have any opitions or am I screwed for life?	Yes
A NY State Trooper gave me a citation for failing to shift to the left lane while she was stopped on the side of the road. The only problem is that she mistook me for the person who did it as we had similarly colored vehicles. She caught up to me several miles down the road and since I loosely fit the description (even though both I and the guilty car passed her quickly leaving her little time to both conduct her business and get a good image of who blew past her) she pulled me over.  I tried to explain but she was angry that someone blew by her as she tried to get out of her cruiser and she gave me the citation without hesitation. Any advice as how to fight this?	Yes
So today my gf got a call from a claims agency saying she owes ~$200 for a ticket she received last fall. She never received a ticket and if this is the case, it was when her brother used her car to drive into Queens, NY for work as he was borrowing her car at this time.  So, the crux of the issue is since it is in claims court, she cannot see any of the detail regarding the violation and needs to drive into Jamaica, Queens to pay. We don't know what her other options are. If you never received a ticket or summons and was never able to give any kind of plea because of this, is there any way to fight the ticket?  It seems kind of shady to me that a collection agency is the first to contact her about a ticket from last fall. She hasn't heard anything at all from any law enforcement about this ticket. She can't even see a record of it on her DMV driving record.  Does she have any options other than pay?	Yes
So I got a ticket for parking in a zone that only city vehicles could stand in (Section 4-08(c)(4).   However, the address under 'place of occurrence' is ~300 off (listed '125 w __ street' instead of '425 w __ street').   Additionally, under expiration date they entered 'N/S', despite the expiration date being listed on both the rear license plate and a sticker on the windshield. This is a vehicle with out of state plates.   I have a picture of the vehicle parked at 425 w _ street and pictures of the license plate and registration sticker as evidence.	Yes
"Hello Reddit: I recently received the verdict for a trial by written declaration I submitted regarding a traffic citation I received in California.   On the Decision paper there is an unmarked checkbox that says ""The evidence submitted by defendant is enclosed.""  I guess that they aren't required to show me the officer's evidence.  But, I am filing a Trial de Novo and I would like to see the evidence is possible.  Does anyone have any advice for getting this, and also any general advice for fighting a Traffic Light violation in court?  The light was yellow when I was in the intersection and the officer wrote me a ticket based off of his visual assessment of the situation (no camera).  Thanks for your time."	Yes
I was driving on I95 at about 40-45mph in a 65mph zone. This was due to the weather and road conditions at the time. As I continued to drive in the express lane, I hit a long puddle which pulled the nose of my car towards the middle barrier. I immediately let my foot off the gas and corrected the steering towards the lane. My car corrected and when the rear of the car hit another puddle, it pulled the car the opposite direction. My vehicle then started to hit the plastic pole barriers which no matter how much I tried to correct, pulled the car facing the outside of the highway. My car came to a stop. My front passenger bumper was then clipped by a vehicle in the lane next to me, and spun my car facing the middle barrier. We both pulled off the road, there were no injuries. I was already on the phone with the police, after the officer investigated, he wrote me a citation for careless driving.  All that being said, the officer didn't witness the accident. And I was able to maintain control of the vehicle within my lane up to a complete stop. I was also driving in a safe manner due to road conditions.  I understand that law is black and white. However with extenuating circumstances, I don't feel like I was driving carelessly. That being said, how valid is the citation? With extenuating circumstances is it something I should fight?  Also, my vehicles lease expires on Thursday and I have an $8,000 damage waiver. If I turn the vehicle in, and the insurance company doesn't pay a claim. In addition, if I choose to fight it and the citation gets dismissed will my rates go up in a no-fault state?  TL;DR: Spun out in the rain. Maintained vehicle within lane as much as humanly possible. Got clipped by another vehicle after mine came to a complete stop and received citation for careless driving. Fight or pay it?	Yes
**TL;DR:** Should I go to court over a 1110(a) violation based on the defense that I am an out of town and not regular NYC driver and the sign was not visible to me? Or take the 2 points and pay the fine?  **My problem:**  I received a traffic ticket for violation of 1110(a) (2 points) in November 2015 in Brooklyn. All I can read on the ticket is: Disobeyed...traffic...device. I had an initial court date of September 2017. I was unable to attend, and it was rescheduled to 5/2017. Then, I got a letter in the mail that it was now 8/2017.   I wanted to know my best approach. I am not sure what details matter so I included as many as I could remember.  **Background:**  I turned right after another car on a busy intersection at a green after sitting and waiting for pedestrians to clear. After I completed the turn, I was pulled over (the other car wasn't).  It was a no right turn intersection. I am not a regular city driver. And I had never seen this sign. It was new to me. I am trying to find out the date of install. At the time, it was blocked by a truck, and I was behind a big truck. I followed another car and turned right. The cop was aggressive with me and implied he could do more than ticket me which I felt to be arrest, and I did not challenge him beyond an inquiry.   At the time, I was back and forth in NY and did not drive in state, and I had an out of state license. Now I live in NY, and I have not got a NY license yet because I don't drive and didn't have a SS card and enough ID points (I do have a NYC ID card). Now I have both, and I am not sure if I should retain my out of state license for point reasons or get a NY license this week. This is my first ticket on this license (had a license at 16, let it lapse when I stopped driving, retook the driver's test in my 20s).  **Questions:**  1. Is it worth fighting this ticket on this basis? Or should I just pay the fine?  2. Do I need an attorney?  3. If not, how will this hearing go? What should I be prepared for? This is all new to me.  4. Should I get a NY license (and won't be driving) or will the outcome affect my new license? Or keep the out of state until the court date?  **Secondary questions:**  1. I can find a database about parking signs but not traffic signs. Any idea I can find when a traffic regulation began at a particular intersection?  2. My new hearing time is at 4:30 in the afternoon. Is this typical? The TVB closes at 4:00. I have an evening class, and I wondered how long I could expect to be there.  3. If I go to DMV and request a new date, are they likely to give me one with school conflict?  4. Why would the DMV change the hearing date on their end?  Thank you for any and all help. I appreciate any insight. I have no idea what to do or expect. Have a great week.	Yes
Last week myself and two other employees were riding from one part of our employers property to where our store is located. The drive is less than quarter of a mile. Our work truck is a regular cab Ford F350. My two other employees hopped in the cab. Seeing as though it's a bit cramped with junk in the cab + two employees I decided to hop in the uncovered bed of the truck. On our very short trip back to our store a NYS Trooper saw us and pulled a U-turn. I knew he was coming to stop us, but didn't think it was anything serious. Just a warning. I ended up hopping out of truck and headed inside as did the passenger of the truck. The driver went to park our work truck and the Trooper followed him into our parking lot. Turns out our employee was driving unlicensed(lost due to DUI) and without a seat belt. Originally we were stopped because I was in the bed of the truck. The police officer spoke with me, asked for all of my info and explain why I was stopped, but was not ticketed. He ended up speaking to our other employee for well over 20 minutes and later gave him a ticket for driving without a seat belt and without a license. Am I liable for paying half of this ticket when it has nothing to do with me? I'd understand if he was ticketed due to me being in the bed of the truck, but from what I read about our law I'm above the age where it's illegal and we were traveling less than the illegal distance.	Yes
"Yesterday I received 3 notices of traffic tickets from Florence (Originally perpetrated in March) where I ""was driving within the limited traffic area without authorization"". Two infractions were within 40 minutes, and the other was 2 days later. I don't recall seeing signs, or being on a road that seemed like I shouldn't, but I don't speak Italian either!   I am an American citizen living in the US that was using a rental car. It's important to note that these notices seem to be from the city police directly, and not through the rental company. All 3 notices are for 81 + 37 Euros for procedures.   It ends up being $403 USD. What are my options and what would you recommend? Can I just not pay? Will I not be allowed to go back to Italy?"	Yes
Hey guys, so a few months ago I got a speeding ticket, I went to court and got it reduced to a small fine and traffic schools. I opted to pay the fine in monthly installments since at the time I was preparing for a newborn and didn't account for the extra expense of the ticket. So a few months go by and I thought everything has been settled and having completed traffic school but I get a letter in the mail saying I only made one monthly payment. It turns out I had to manually make the monthly payments and they weren't recurring. I called the courts offices and they said I can't do anything, I need to pay it through a collection agency now which almost tripled the ticket and if I write a letter to the courts they might allow me to retake traffic school since they couldn't accept it the first time due to not having completed payments.  Is there any other option for me?	Yes
I got a speeding ticket about a week ago in Florida. Not my county but next over. Its only $131 and I just want to pay it and get it done with. I called and the lady said give it a few days and told me to check again and I did and its still not there. They use a 3rd party ncourts for payments. They have no record nor the county clerks office! Don't they have to make it available for me to pay? What are my options here? Should I challenge it? I dont mind paying I just need it taken care off to not worry. What should I do, and the officer also did not mention anything about points on my licence, is was doing 79 in a 70. He followed me for 25 min through another county until I entered his just to nail me.	Yes
The initial accident happened ahead of him. People were swerving out of the way. One of the people in the initial accident got out of her car and ran across the freeway. Fate would have it that she ran right in front of my friend's car. She died on the scene.  I have another friend who was a firefighter/first responder on the scene. He said that there was nothing my friend could have done. It was the other person's fault for getting out of the car. He doesn't know my friend, so there's no bias. The family is not pursuing legal action.   Fast forward to last week. He got 2 letters in the mail (or phone calls... I don't remember the exact details.) One was that the insurance company in formed him that there will be no liability on his part. The second one was the DMV saying that they were suspending his license for being involved in a fatal vehicle vs pedestrian accident.  Any advice for him?	Yes
This happened in Tualatin. I crossed the intersection as, according to the photo, the red light had been red for 0.17 seconds. I was going 43 mph in a 45 zone. There is a video online of the crossing, and two cars can be seen crossing the intersection immediately before me, although it was definitely yellow for them.  The presumptive fine is $260. Should i just go ahead and plead no contest at my court appearance and hope to get it cut down to $130? If I were going to plead not guilty, what sort of mitigating factors are admissible in this kind of case? The two main reasons I ran the red light were that I was driving directly into the sun at 11am and I didn't have my sunglasses, so my visor obstructed my view of the light. At the same time, because I was following the speed limit, I had two aggressive drivers jockeying to get around me, creating a stressful driving situation. It's one of those things like, shit, I should have been going 55 like them and I would have made it through the intersection legally. Any advice?	Yes
Hi, Reddit! My brother bought a Prius last year from a local dealer. Within a month, one of the battery cells went out. The dealer fixed it and said the problem was solved. And then it happened again. The dealer fixed it the second time and promised it wouldn't happen again. After the third time, my brother asked to exchange the car or to have someone else fix it because he was tired of being stranded on the freeway. The dealer then blocked his phone number. When my brother tried to call from someone else's phone, the dealer would block that number as well. When he went to the dealer in person, the receptionist would say the dealer was on lunch, in a meeting, etc.  It's been a year of this runaround and the car has been sitting in our garage. My brother stopped making payments since he couldn't use the car. No one from the dealership contacted him about this. The dealership has gone out of business so there's no way to return the car. So now, he'd like to junk it, but the title is still in the dealer's name. He sent a registered letter to the dealer, asking to work out some sort of solution, but it came back as undeliverable. Do we have any options?	Yes
The title says it all. If someone could PM me with help deciphering this thing that would mean the world to me. I really don't want to go to court. I just turned 18 and it'd be really nice to get this out of the way over the weekend, so I don't need to take off work.  Thanks, P03	Yes
So I don't want to pay this ticket because it's my hard earned money and I just found out I'm being transferred to a different state today. I got the ticket yesterday. If I don't pay it will they transfer the ticket to the new state or will it just stay and I shouldn't come back here	Yes
"So I moved into this apartment complex in Anaheim, CA in September and have been parking my car inside since then. This morning, my car was towed because the permit I received from the office was deemed ""invalid"". When I went to speak to the property manager he looked in his system and couldn't find anything about my car being registered to park there (or my roommates for that matter) and refused to believe that I've been parking there since I moved in. He even accused me of falsifying a parking permit. He then refused to have my car released from the towing company and told me there was nothing he could do. The very same day I moved in one of the other property managers made copies of my registration and drivers license and gave us the permits himself. But now since they can't find any proof about it, I get screwed over. What can I do to have them repay me for the tow? It's not fair for me to have to pay for their incompetence."	Yes
Long time lurker, first time poster, so please excuse any formatting mistakes or anything.  Basically, back in June 2015, my dad was tight on money, so to help him out, my gf and I decided to purchase his 2011 Nissan Murano off of him. She got an auto loan to pay the car for approx $15,000. This mean my gf would have a total of two cars, an Infiniti Sedan, and now a Nissan Murano SUV. Every time we approached him to sign over the title and registration, he claimed he was too busy and stuff (we opened a restaurant together). On our off days, he was always wanting to stay home and do his own thing instead of just signing it over, and he would sometimes get mad when we bugged him about it. This all happened in NJ. We currently posses the only copy of the title, but it is in my dad's name.  Fast forward to about Feb 2017, we got into a series or arguments that basically ended in me and gf moving from NJ to CA. As stated before, the 3 of us (Gf, myself, and dad) opened a moderately successful restaurant in NJ, but the my dad was essentially emotionally abusing us throughout the course of the restaurant (calling us worthless/names constantly, yelling at us all the time, throwing things near us to scare us). We could no longer deal with it, so we packed our bags and moved to CA, and took the Infiniti as the car to road trip in. We finally got to CA in April 2017, and we realized we still haven't gotten the title or registration transferred to my gf's name. We are still paying the auto loan for the Nissan (loan under her name), and the Nissan Murano is still with my dad back in NJ. We obviously live in CA now, so we can't just take the car, and we would prefer not to speak to him, but will do so if it benefits us financially.  I sent him an email about a month ago telling him he needs to transfer the title and registration to her name, or he needs to take over the loan payment. He did not respond.   Right now, as it stands, these are the issues:  1.) We are paying for a car that we do not possess (we are in CA and the car is in NJ).  2.) Dad is currently using our car for his own work/personal use (He is in NJ using the car).  3.) We are paying for the auto loan that is under our name. We took out that auto loan to purchase the Nissan Murano from my dad.  The possible solutions that I would like to happen would be:  1.) We are able to bring the car to CA, and preferably sell it just to pay off the auto loan  OR  2.) He takes over the loan payment.  I am not too comfortable on letting him take over the loan payment as he has abused his power in the past, and he is the type of individual to not pay the loan just to ruin my gf's credit.  OTHER INFORMATION:  He currently owns the restaurant that me, my gf, and him worked on together (he financed, we put in sweat equity, no pay for 1.5 years, but that's another issue). He definitely has the money to either purchase the car back OR purchase another car of his own. We just do not want to be stuck with a payment for a car that we do not have. When we finally get the car, we would most likely sell it to pay back the loan.  My questions to the readers are:  1.) What would be the best route to obtain the registration?  2.) How would we transfer the name of the title and registration to my gf's name?  3.) How would we get possession of the car?  4.) Is there anyway to punish my dad for his actions? Will there be any punishment on our end for being unable to transfer the title and registration to our names?  Thank you all so much!	Yes
"My Fiancee and I were on driving back home from Montreal to NJ yesterday morning, July 30. Literally around 10 miles after crossing the border from Canada back into the US, I got pulled over for speeding, 80 mph in a 65 mph highway (I-87). My question is if it's worth it fight the ticket, whether driving back for the court date or hiring an attorney. A few bullets below:  * Last speeding ticket in NY was like August 17, 2014. * Had a speeding ticket in CT in Feb 2015, but it was reduced to a ""traffic violation"" * I live right by NYC, so it would be a 5 hour drive to the local courthouse. * Worried about the fine/points since it would technically be within 3 years of my last conviction. * As stated, it was 80 in a 65. * I was driving with a couple of cars near me on a Sunny, clear morning. * I was driving in the left lane and slowed down once I saw the officer.  So what do you guys think, would it be worth it to fight it, or just pay it and plead guilty?"	Yes
Hey r/legaladvice. I am looking into taking a ticket to court. I have 2 speeding tickets on my record. 1 a couple years back and 1 in april.   Today I got pulled over for running a stop sign based on what the officer saw. I drive a very small car and actually stopped but I believe the officer did not see this as there is a picket fence on the same corner that he was coming from. I usually stop a good distance back because there is a railroad track on the other side that cars fly over.   My issue comes down to the attitude that these small town police have. He set my court date as next Thursday even after I told him that wouldn't be possible and requested that he at least give me a week to request vacation. I have also heard horror stories of people paying court fees for bogus tickets and these police getting their way anyway. I feel like the only way to get out of this ticket is by having the officer not show up but I can't make it on the date he set.  If I call the courthouse and reschedule, won't that put a target on my back for this officer and he will make sure to be there in an even more pissed off state? Should I just make sure I'm there on the third? I wouldn't fight the ticket if I didn't feel I did anything wrong. My previous tickets were paid as soon as I could make the payment. But I don't want to waste my time and money if I'm just going to get screwed either way.	Yes
"Tuesday around 2:30 AM a couple friends and I were leaving a bar. I knew I was drunk and shouldn't drive, but this isn't about me justifying myself. Well, I was heading from one parking lot to the other across the street to take my friends back to their cars, where someone would have taken me home or I would have Uber'd (more on that later). I turned left on a road where I didn't know there was a median, crossed the street, got to my destination, but before I could pull into the lot I had lights on me. Since I already knew I was driving on the wrong side of the road like an idiot, I figured that's what I was being pulled over for. It was. However I just left the bar, I had 3 (and a half) beers between 10:30 PM and 2:30 AM, so I'm sure I smelled, or my non-driver smashed passenger did. Officer has me do field sobriety tests, I probably failed, but while under the impression my sentence would he lighter if I blew, I consented and went along with it.  Blew a 0.121, arrested, and I was allowed to leave the station with my stepdad.  Totally cool with paying the fines and the 90 day suspension and even the classes as I know I shouldn't have been driving drunk, even if it was just to cross the street. Got off lucky that no one was hurt, I acknowledge that. The important part for me is when my court date came, the judge told me I was being charged with 2 counts of DUI, one for driving and one for blowing over the limit, meaning my first offense is counted as my second. He said I'm facing something like 180 days in jail/10k fine/1 year suspension. I wasn't even in the car for 5 minutes. Sidenote: my breaks are broken and I was driving my brother's car. How big of an issue is this? (Again, I know I shouldn't have, even to cross the street, but honest to God I was JUST crossing the street, I was not driving home. I was on the wrong side of the road, so me getting pulled over is justifiable, I just didn't think it through. I would have gotten pulled over sober because I'm just stupid.) Though it's not my place to say, is that ""fair""? I have an attorney who I can hopefully afford, but I can't meet with him until Friday. I just need some peace of mind, and knowing how much trouble I'm in could definitely help me prepare mentally."	Yes
So recently I got a DUI and the lawyer was able to get me an agreement on a suspended imposition. This is only in a couple of states, South Dakota and Missouri I believe. Well my question is, will I still be found guilty under the courts judgement or convicted?	Yes
The other night I was pulled over by a state trooper in Wisconsin and clocked doing 26mph over.  I did some reading and saw that Wisconsin was one of the few states that did not agree to the DLC and thus is not required to share information of driving records with other states.    I'm wondering if this is likely to appear on my Indiana records and increase insurace premiums/add points to my Indiana license.  If the points don't transfer I'll probably just pay the fine and be done with it, however if the points will likely transfer, I might pursue a safe driving course or other options for getting the ticket reduced/dismissed.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
Hello, I'm 17 and in Austin, Texas, today i got pulled over on i-35 for going 86, although my spedometer said 80. I am not trying to say I wasn't being stupid (I was) but I was wondering what the best course of action would be. I can pay the ticket but I am very afraid of the insurance charges added. I have read a couple of posts but mostly by people going 20+ over. I want to know if I should just pay the fine, or if I should contest and hope the officer doesnt show up to court. I am insured, thank you for any advice	Yes
My partner and I are moving from Illinois to separate states. He will be working in New York and I will be attending grad school in Connecticut. He currently owns a car that is registered in IL which he will be giving to me to use while I'm in school.   I am trying to work through the mess of how/when we need to transfer everything. Can we both be on the title if we live in separate states? Is it easier to transfer title to me while we are still in IL and then register the car in CT? Will there be complications if he is on title still and is not a CT resident? Ideally he would remain on title as he will be paying for insurance, maintenance, and still will drive the car when we see each other.	Yes
"Hey! My girlfriend was at fault in a minor car accident about a year ago. What I saw was minor damage to the bumper of the car in front of her. The person she hit was pretty nasty at the scene and was holding her neck saying she might be injured but refused an ambulance.   Girlfriends rates went up and she got a notice from her insurance that the other person is claiming injury.   However this other person happens to have a public Instagram and is a ""fit chick"" so lots of posts of her doing workouts/headstands/skydiving.   Is there anything my girlfriend should be doing about this? Passing along the info to her insurance?   "	Yes
Hello r/legaladvice. I received a traffic ticket last Friday but the courthouse still hasn't received it. They can't give me a definite price until they receive it. Don't I get in trouble if I don't pay it before my court date?	Yes
I was driving through Mississippi and received a speeding ticket because of restless bodily functions and was wondering how it would affect me. They don't use a point system from what I found, at least. I'm almost certain it will affect my rates, but I'd like to know for sure. Also, I've taken a defensive driving in the state of Texas for a Texas speeding two years earlier to knock one off. Am I eligible to take a course again in Mississippi? Just not sure if it's by state. Thanks!	Yes
Hello guys! I have a good one for you today.   So my friends and I were driving M's golf cart around the neighborhood. We're all 16-17 and there's 3 of us total. So I drive into his driveway and drop them off because they wanted to get a ball from the house. T and M hop out and then I pull out of the driveway and a decent speed (5-10mph) and then as I was pulling out I realized that I should straighten out the wheel and BOOM! I hit my friend's uncle's truck.   I'm not asking for pity or anything I was stupid and by my own stupidity I hit the truck. I called him outside and we discussed the damage. He said he wanted to make it easy on me. At first he said it was fine but I kept insisting to pay him a lot of money. So as we were outside observing the damages he said that an estimate would be around $500-$750. My heart sank but I knew I had to pay it. I gave him my number, address, and email. He said he'd contact me after he went back to his home state (he was visiting from across the country)  The next morning I get a follow up from him (IRL) and he tells me the new estimate is $2700. I thought 500-750 was bad you could imagine how I felt about this. I held it all in and with a terrified voice I said alright.   I took some pictures of the damages and I don't see how on earth it could be $2700. The pictures included show the only damage caused to the truck. The reason why I'm here is to ask you guys on your opinion/estimate/what I should do. I'm fine with paying him but the new price tag makes me a little hesitant. I think what I'm going to do is let him go back to his home state, and get a couple of estimates on the car and send them back to me. I'm not sure what the car is.

I was pulled over for doing 98 in a 75 in Arizona, the officer decided to not impound my vehicle and instead write me a ticket. He said because I was out of state I could call the number on the ticket and see if I had to show up to court. I called the number and was told that I didn't have to show up to court and that I would have to e-mail the court e-mail address and ask if I could pay my fine in payments or all at once. I did that and it has been about 2 weeks with no response. I haven't received any communication regarding my ticket. This is my first ever traffic violation, what are my options?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
I just realized I don't have my insurance papers, but I do have insurance, I was curious what would happen if I got pulled over?  Would the police be able to take my insurance number as proof or be able to call my insurance company?  I am in Florida if that effects things.	Yes
Now not reckless driving, but the one point negligent driving. It keeps coming back for job background checks and I disclose it now after the first time I was called out on it because I had no idea it was not a general type of ticket when I was 18 and then forgot the ticket was and never thought twice. I can't get a straight answer on if it is a misdemeanor or not? Also I have a lot of driving tickets (4) from the age 18-21. Will that impact me forever? I am embarrassed of them now especially since all my future employers can see them. I haven't had a ticket in two years (23 now) and drive much more responsibly now. I also live in Florida now with the one ticket at 21 in Florida, rest are in Maryland. Will all these forever show up?	Yes
Essentially title.  I previously posted about a minor fender bender. The other vehicle will cost ~$700 to fix, which is below the reporting requirement of my state ($1,000 or more total property damages).  My vehicle had some minor damage, but I don't plan on getting it fixed and have not gotten the damage valued.  Per my state, I'm required to report accidents above a threshold, but if I don't get the damage to my vehicle valued, and I don't care about repairing it, do I need to factor in my vehicle to the total estimated property damage?	Yes
hello everyone,  My boss co-signed me a car 5 years ago. Its all paid off and I would like to sell it now. The title has both my name and co-signer's name.  I took it to carmax today and they told me that the title needs to have only my name.  My question is how can I remove co-signer's name from my car title? I can't get hold of my old boss.	Yes
"So for those of you who are familiar with Chicago, we have a large amount of speed enforcement cameras and red light cameras throughout the city. While driving down north clybourne, there were alot of young kids and adults jaywalking, causing me to brake suddenly twice in a one mile section.  I ended up only going 25 mph on a 30 mph because I feared it would happen again, and a speed enforcement camera ending up triggering on me  and the car behind me as we passed it and as I was going five under. Would it be possible for me to receive a citation do going too slowly, even given the circumstances? Is it possible the camera triggered due to two cars occupying it's ""zone"" at the same time? Would it be possible to contest the ticket in front of a hearing officer and using the testimony of my passenger? Sorry for what probably seems like a run of the mill post; I'm just afraid and annoyed that I might get ticketed for trying to be safe in an area they want to fine people to drive safely in."	Yes
**Background**   August of 2016, I was ticketed for driving without insurance and for speeding.  I went to court and was given a fine and the ticket was removed from my record  for good behavior.   The speeding ticket was thrown out.      Two weeks ago, I was pulled over for failing to yield at a stop sign. I was also ticketed for driving under a suspended licence.  My car was impounded  due to the traffic stop.   I did not know the reason for my drivers licence being suspended.   I contacted the dmv as soon as I could to find the reason i was suspended.  I found out when I changed insurancce companies I neglected to add the sr-22 to my insurance plan.    I quickly got it corrected.     **Plan**  I dont have any money for a defense attourney. My court day is August 21.  I plan to go Tuesday during open session to get this sorted out,   Here is what I am planning to do  1.  Bring proof that I had no lapse in insurance. 2. Explain that when I got new insurance I neglected to get sr-22 due to thinking it was automatically added by the system. 3. Explain I would have never driven if i knew my licence was suspended.  4.  I was not sure if i should bring this up.  I am going to vietnam to volunteer teaching children English.  This is my biggest concern  that i will no longer be able to go.   How should I handled talking to them? Should I answer only questions presented? Should I ask to explain my situation first? Any tips would be greatful!!	Yes
So I was driving home from my weekly UA and classes as required after last DUI (wouldnt have even been in that town if not for these obligations). Sober all day, and days prior to that.  For some reason I seizured, passed out, etc behind the wheel not 10 minutes after meeting my PO.  Single vehicle accident, hit a curb.  Eneded up goin to the hospital to get checked since I was frightened I may have had a seizure or something Consented that I'd do the state test via blood and UE.  Nothing to hide.  All came back clean for everything.  I wasnt worried, just thought I'd get driving under suspension...Well this cop finds an empty package of Kratom which was not consumed anytime prior to the accident. He writes me a DUi (which I've had a few guilties of but learned my leason)...With this additional charge I could face substantial jail time even though I was not in anyway intoxicated.  I was never given sobriety tests, read rights etc.  This cop may have just ruined my life right as was rebuilding it, so pissed!  Any advice?	Yes
 From what I understand, they go easier on first-time offenders.  Let's say somebody accidentally rear ends another car.  There are no injuries.  A ticket is issued for failing to stop.  The court reduces his offense to impeding traffic, due to his clean driving record.  Four years later, the same driver commits the same offense.  Is he considered a first-time offender, as the points only stay on record for 3 years?	Yes
I have recently been stopped by a CHP in Southern California going 65 on a 55. I explained to the CHP that I've had a chronic series of bladder, prostate, and kidney infections the past few months and was in the middle of an episode on my way to get treatment at a clinic close by. He seemed to chuckle a bit and proceeded to give me a ticket. Do I have any legal standing or way of fighting this ticket in court?	Yes
Okay, so here the post begins.  My case is currently working it's way through the courts. In what I believe is the first stage of the trial. Details: -- Car Accident:  2 cars on back road, head-on collision.  me- plaintiff. Was hit at approx 40-60 mph by defendant in a head-on collision (admitted by defendant)  defendant was ticked in the case. Reckless driving, speeding, ect.  This caused me to impact my stearing wheel and break the steering collomn with my face, as well as it to crack ribs and strain muscles in my neck and forearm. The vehicle I was driving was older with no airbags.  Short term injury sustained: Hospital trip, around 25k medical. (paid by health insurance.) approx 3 weeks bed rest. bruised/cracked ribs. 3-4 doctors trips (time off + cost of services) (paid aprox 50$ out of pocket copays) -no use of eye for around 3 day, full use returning in 2 weeks. -Pain/Suffering ect.   Long term injury substained was a 2-3mm droop in my right upper eye lid. Caused from impact on steering wheel. Will worsen with age, could be treated with injury however will still maintain +-1mm difference from other eye over time.   happened in VA area, have a lawyer for the case. However was wondering what the aprox value for such a case would be. First offer was aprox 26k, however lawyer said in his opinion it should be higher. However not by set amount.	Yes
Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm just looking for some quick advice. Yesterday, I got pulled over in Crownpoint, Indiana for going 104 in a 70.(Yes, I know it was stupid and I learned my lesson). The officer that pulled me over said he was only going to give me a ticket instead of something worse. I'm just wondering how much the ticket would be since I have to wait four to six weeks. Also, since this is my very first offense, does it lower the price or anything? Don't know if this means anything, but I admitted fault to the officer and told him I was in the wrong. (I guess that's why I got off with just a ticket and not a misdemeanor or anything.) Thanks in advance.	Yes
In early May, I got a speeding ticket in Magnolia, Texas. According to the ticket, I'm entitled to the evidence against me. I also could not make my assigned court date due to work conflicts. I sent the Municipal court a letter requesting evidence and a court date conflict. Never heard back. Court says letter never arrived, and now my ticket is in 'default' cause I didn't showed up for my date.      I sent a second letter, certified, via USPS. Tracking number says it made it the Magnolia post office, but after being 'out for delivery' for ten days, the post office opens an investigation. They tell me that because of the huge volume of mail going to the court, not all of it gets scanned.  A clerk at the court cannot locate the letter. They tell me to get a DVD of my ticketing incident, I have to submit a written claim in order for them to send me the form to request the evidence. They cannot accept the request over the phone.       I call a lawyer for help at the end of June. He tells me I may have a warrant out for my arrest now, and that my fines may have gone up. Offers to call the court on my behalf to see what's going on, and to see if they'll accept a fax instead. Is unable to get a hold of them for three days. Oh, and he keeps forgetting to call me back.  I've given up on him.      I sent a third letter via UPS earlier in July, which *was* filed as delivered. I've been calling the Court three-four times a day for four days now, and I cannot get anyone on the phone to confirm they actually have it.       It's now been two months since my ticket. I'm going insane, and I don't know what to do. I haven't received any mail from the Court. I feel the ticket was predatory, and I don't want to spend $250 for allegedly going 51 miles per hour from a stopped position in less than one mile of travel time. I don't live in Texas, which makes my options limited.      Can I file a complaint against the court? Because this is a fairly rural area, ticket lawyers are really hard to find.	Yes
It's been my understanding that when a cop pulls you over and cites you for speeding, he's acting as witness to your offense. Is this still the case if it's on the advice of another?  Didn't actually happen, just saw a bear clocking folks on an overpass on 40 and a few more hiding on the on ramp immediately following.	Yes
"Hello, so like the title suggests, i've received a parking ticket in the city of Ottawa while visiting from the United States (New Hampshire) My Hertz rental car (Florida plates) was correctly ticketed when i forgot to move my car.   Now, the ticket correctly identifies my car via the plate number, but in the Province section it says  ""FL"" for florida.  Not sure if that matters.  I've heard that out of province people don't have to pay the ticket because it's not legally enforceable. I understand that New York has an agreement with Quebec if this happens that it is enforceable.    So here's my question. Is this something I should pay? Will I have any issues entering the country in the future if i don't? And will they notify Hertz? (Hertz is available in Canada) because the car belongs to them (Hertz USA)   It's a $120 fine, or $100 if paid before ""01/08/2017"" which i'm guessing is  DD/MM/YYYY, so August 1st."	Yes
I have had to do some travelling in Texas for business and I had went through some tolls this year and last. I received some letters stating I needed to pay my tolls and meant to do it but unfortunately got busy and forgot. I recently got a letter saying that the toll bill went to a law firm for collections and if I didn't pay they would send it to court. Some of these tolls are for like .50 cents but they tacked on $35 dollar fees.  I wanted to try and call the law firm but every time I call any of their numbers I'm on hold for half an hour and then it goes to a full voicemail box. I feel like this is part of their strategy to get you to pay to full bill.  What are my options? I'm willing to pay the bill and be more responsible with my toll bills in the future but that would really suck in the short term. Ideally I'd like to at least pay on it and work out terms with them. I mean I can't even get a hold of anyone to verify that my account will be cleared. Has anyone else dealt with something similar? 	Yes
*DISCLAIMER* I did not hit/run over/injure anyone. No accident occurred. This post is purely out of curiosity.   Tonight I was driving on a very busy highway in my town. I was going about 5 under the speed limit, but some homeless guy was on the grass median and then walked in the middle of the highway as I was going 60 MPH. Luckily I noticed him from about a mile away so I was already slowing down, I was going about 35 MPH when I honked at him and skidded to a stop. I was probably 10 feet away from him when I stopped. I was not under the influence of any substance. The sun was still out.   Let's say I didn't see him/couldn't slow down enough in time and hit him. Would I be liable? I have full coverage insurance and have no instances on my driving record. I was pretty shook up about almost hitting him. I keep thinking about what would have happened if I injured or even killed him.   Once again, nothing happened (thankfully), I am just wondering how this kind of thing usually goes down.  Thanks for the input.	Yes
This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	Yes
"Back in Oct. 2010 I got a DUI in FL. My license was suspended until the completion of 6mos Interlock and a DUI class. I've spent the past few years using public transportation and have also moved out of FL. Where I've most recently moved in NorCal is very, very rural (I live on 40 acres, and all the plots are 40 acres) and I'm also in the process of getting a small Tech Support business started. So, I knew I'd need to get my license squared away.  FL tells me I need to get the Interlock device on a vehicle (which I have), then go to CA DMV with the paperwork, they will verify and issue a limited license (for work, school, errands, etc.), and once they issue my temporary license to mail a copy of it, along with some paperwork, to the FL DMV and they'll start the 6mos for my Interlock ONLY THEN.  I go to the CA DMV and they told me as long as FL has a hold on my license there's nothing they can do for me, Interlock or no. The DMV worker gives me the Mandatory Actions number, but they tell me the same thing.  It seems I'm stuck in a catch-22- the lasy with Mandatory Actions actually told me ""you may have to move to FL for 6 mos."" :|  Does anyone have any insights? Feel free to ask me any questions to help clarify, etc"	Yes
Hearing was in May and didn't bother going as I didn't know the judge could change the ticket to a lower speeding offense or a non-moving violation.  Is there any way I can have this changed at this point? I'm past the 60 day window for a Motion to Reopen. Could I file one anyhow and hope the judge would rehear the case? My driving record is clean besides this ticket.	Yes
"My friend [early 20s F] lives in the dorms on her job's campus. Monday night, she was at an employee social until early in the morning, but ended up getting a fairly good parking spot near her dorm. She was the designated driver for a few of her coworkers. Later on Tuesday morning (around 11am) she discovered damage to the back corner or her vehicle. Deep scratches and a missing reflector. She was unable to find the reflector anywhere in the lot, and assumed cleaners had picked it up. Of course we were both upset, but there isn't much to do when the parking lot has no cameras.   Cue Saturday morning. At my advisement, she finally tells her mother about the damage to the vehicle since the car is not titled in her name. Her mother is a bit of a hardass, so she told a white lie and said she was unaware of the damage until today (since she had waited so long. Strike one against her).   Saturday afternoon, she's summoned to the local police station and is questioned by officers. She called me right after the questioning, but I have little details as to the tone of the interaction. Whoever had hit her car originally had taken the reflector and given it to the police, stating she caused the accident. STRIKE TWO: she told the police she was unaware of the damage until today so her story would remain straight in the eyes of her mother. I disagree, but I'm currently too far away to take action about it. I believe I can pull text messages from five days ago where she told me she discovered the damage.   While I'm furious with her over that, there isn't much she can do about it at this point. What steps should she take now? My late grandparents were retired police officers when I was growing up, and I wouldn't dream of lying to an officer. I have no advice for her now. I met this girl in college and we have been close for awhile now-I would love to find a solution for her. Is there anyone who knows what to do in this situation?   (There is also not a doubt in my mind that she is innocent. The fact that it took the other person four days to present this ""evidence"" to the officer should also be of credit to her.)  TLDR: Friend is being framed for a hit and run by the actual perpetrator days after the accident. There are no cameras or witnesses. How should she proceed?"	Yes
A little back story here. I was given two tickets, a ticket for stunt driving and ticket for driving without consideration. Me and some friends were out in the industrial area of our town late at night(no houses in the next 10km). It's a pretty well known area of our town for people to come down and drift or race there cars . Cops have come there before and usually just make sure no one is drinking and driving, or say to go home, I've never seen a ticket issued. So at about midnight I was doing some doughnuts. We saw some head lights coming down the road, I moved into the parking lot and shut my car off. The officer drove behind me and turned his lights on saying he saw me burning out my tires ( there was over 10 people there all drifting in the same colour of car, could have been anyone of us but I'm owning the situation here). It was also raining so sound of tire squeal would be minimal. I got my car impounded for ten days, $200 driving without consideration ticket (which I disputed), a stunting ticket which I was unable to dispute, had to pay $600 in impound fees, and lost my license for 60 days. I feel I was treated excessively as this was my first ever ticket, no one was in danger or at risk, we've been verbally told to come down there if we want to do things like this by one officer instead of harming people on the streets. There's my spiel any help would be great .	Yes
I’ve tried to find information about this online, but everything I’ve found assumes that I’m bringing a car with me.  I currently have a NC drivers license and a car with liability and collision insurance. However, when I move to Chicago I will not be bringing the car with me. I am going to have it put in my brother’s name and have him keep it for about a month to make sure I will not need it, at which point he has agreed to sell it for me.  My license doesn’t expire for another four years, and I don’t want it to expire. I want to have it transferred to Illinois when I move to Chicago and establish residency there, but I don’t know if I have to have a car or car insurance to transfer my license from NC to IL. I am planning on cancelling my car insurance before I go also, but I would like to be able to rent a car in the city whenever I need one, and am not sure if I have to have insurance before I can drive at all, even if I do not have a car.  So my question is, can I transfer my NC license to IL without a car or insurance?	Yes
I'm currently about to purchase a vehicle off of a man who lives in NC. I live in TN. Here in TN we do not have electronic titles but in NC they do. After I purchase the car from the guy he will have the responsibility to send me the title in the mail (I live 5.5 hours away). It will take about 2 days to get the paper title from NC. What documents do I need to have him sign so I don't get scammed? I am going to have a notarized bill of sale. Is there any other documents I will need so he doesn't try to say the car is still his? I will be meeting him at his bank to pay off his lien on the car.	Yes
I was riding down a street in the bike lane. There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while. My bike kept going and it got run over by their car being completely destroyed. The driver was immediately apologetic and claimed responsibility. They provided me with their contact and insurance information.   So my problem here is I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I'd prefer not to get lawyers involved because she was extremely nice and wanted to work with me on this. I do want her to pay for my hospital visit and a replacement to my bike. My bike I bought new and got it in a rare situation of the bike needing to be sold because it was a year old model and got it for about half the msrp with also haggling. I'm pretty sure I can't get a bike like that again for the price I paid for it.  My main questions: 1. I have not been in a situation like this before. Do I call her insurance right away and report the situation? 2. What do I tell them? (Might sound silly but I don't to say anything wrong that will prevent me from getting covered) 3. Can I provide them with the make and model of my bike to get the msrp value for it instead of receipt value?  Thanks in advance for any advice.	Yes
"I received a citation on Northern Cheyenne tribal land in Montana (WA resident), on US 212. [48 in a 45](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg). I don't want to give these people any money, but I also don't want a mark on my credit.   She claimed I was going 49 in a 40. Then when she came back with the ticket, it was 48 in a 40. I said it was 45 mph zone. She changed the speed zone to 45 (as you can see on [the front](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg)) and said ""there I changed the zone, but it doesn't matter, you were still speeding"" I said the speed zone is what it is, which is 45 and why would she think she can change it on the ticket if she was insisting it was 40. She shrugged. Normally when a cop gives you ""a break"" they lower the observed speed, not raise the zone. Odd.   She then got a big fake smile on her face and said **""you haven't even heard the good news!. Since this is tribal land, this doesn't go on your record, isn't reported to your insurance, and the *fee* is only around $25!""**  I asked ""And how do I pay this fee? Is there a website or something"" After she laughed about how they are in the middle of MT, they don't have online payments, she flipped the paper over and showed me [the back](https://i.imgur.com/7kBRC5h.jpg).   She said **""call this number at the bottom (I covered in black for privacy) and give them your citation number and your name. They will tell you how much the fee is, it should be around $25, and tell you where and how to send it in.""** I asked what happens if I don't pay, and she said they will send it to collections. I said ""I think I know how this will play out, I will end up paying this, and you guys will still send this to collections anyway."" she shrugged and gave me a ""what ya gonna do about it"" look.  She then said, while laughing, ""if you want to fight this, you will have to come all the way back here and im sure you dont want to do that. It's only $25, just pay it. It's not a big deal for you. It doesn't go on your record. Your insurance wont know. Just pay it."" I was about to tell her I will pay her right there and then if she rips it all up and lets me go. But I didn't.   This all seemed very sketchy to me.   I asked for her calibration records and she claimed she could not show them to me as they have personal information in them. She did have me lean into her truck, over passenger seat to see her radar system readout. It did say 48. I asked for the time this reading was taken, she said there is no time. I asked what the consequences are if I do not sign, she said ""nothing"". I told her I can not sign this citation and she wrote ""refuse to sign"".   If you look at the [back of the citation](https://i.imgur.com/7kBRC5h.jpg), it specifically says ""Send a **money order** in **the envelope provided** for the **amount of the fine** listed on the citation."" There was no envelope, which I assume has the address I should send this to, and there is no fee amount listed anywhere on [the front](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg). When I see the words ""money order"", it screams scam to me.   From what I have read, tribal police have no jurisdiction over non-tribal people except to detain you for a state or federal officer to arrive. So this citation is pretty odd to me...**does this mean that any person can issue citations to anyone, demand a payment, and if they don't pay, send to collections?** If only a portion of those people pay, you can make a good bit of money...which is what I think is going on here.   I have spent far more than $25 thinking about this and typing this out. *I don't want to give these people a dime for something so shady.* But I also do not want the headache of a collections agency going after me. I am hoping that someone has experience with tickets on this specific tribal land and can tell me if they do in fact send these to collections. I also want future people to be able to search for this story and have something to take away from it, because I could not find anything myself that satisfied me when googling around. This has already been a huge waste of my time and I don't want others to waste theirs. I am leaning towards just paying it so any doubt about it being sent to collections is moot. If I do not pay this, I am not sure how a collections agency would find me. Perhaps they can just search my name at the credit reporting agencies and send a letter to my current address that is on file with them? If they can not find me, perhaps that makes the situation worse and it goes right on my report without having a chance to send a letter demanding proof of debt.   Some additional facts:  * I have not contacted them yet. * They don't have my current address, as my state doesn't require me to get a new license with an address change. And she did not ask me for my current address. * They don't have my phone number  * They DO have the license plate number of my out of state vehicle. Which is registered to me. * I have experience with a small amount of $20 going to collections, where a shady newspaper guy signed me up for a year subscription of the local paper which I never paid the renewal for. This was for $20, and I sent in a certified letter to the collections agency and demanded proof of the valid debt. Nothing came of it. * I do not know when this is due and they would send to collections. But it has been 31 days since the citation and 16 days since the court date. * My dash cam does in fact indicate I was going 48 in 45. I reviewed this footage later. There are no landmarks near the road for me to get a VASCAR-like computation via google maps to check if my camera and her radar system were accurate. But if they are both the same, they are likely correct. My dashcam has the mic disabled, so no audio of the conversation was recorded. * Their [fee schedule](https://i.imgur.com/sOgNziM.png) on their website indicates a civil complaint would be $25   **Are the chances of a mark on my credit low enough that I can get away with not paying this?**   **Can any one just give out citations and demand payment and send to collections?**   https://imgur.com/a/fi7w6"	Yes
y friend has been caught driving on a suspended license 7 times so when she got pulled over this time, she gave my name because she didn't mine is suspended as well. They didn't check for an ID so she got me a couple of tickets and now I have to go to court. I don't want to get her in trouble for driving on a suspended and giving false information but I don't want to go to court and have the officer recognize that I'm not the woman he pulled over and get myself in trouble either. I have no idea what to do.	Yes
My mom had parked my car on her driveway because it's broken as a way to help me. we haven't been talking due to personal reasons and at some point in the past two months she had my car towed from her driveway onto the street outside of her house. It's been getting ticketed I believe every night for almost a month.  She never told me she was having it moved onto the streets. Can I take her to court for these tickets? Is there anything else I can possibly do? 	Yes
I'm finding a lot of different answers when searching for a definitive answer through google. My best guess is that it is legal unless they are under 16, in which case the vehicle must be going 25 mph or slower. Besides the overall legality of it, are their stipulations? Like a maximum speed limit, number of passengers, etc?	Yes
"I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...  tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.  Full story: I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail).   The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.  I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.  A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.  I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.  So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.  So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily."	Yes
So early last week in Minneapolis, MN, I had an accident on the interstate involving two other vehicles, in which I hit one in to the other (I will mostly focus on the car I hit.) Traffic was moving under the speed limit (55 mph) but was steady. I was thinking I needed to be in the next lane, so I had looked over my shoulder to check my blind spot, and when I turned around, the vehicle in front of me appeared to have virtually stopped, leading me to be unable to stop in time.   No one was hurt, and the air bags did not deploy in either vehicle. I am unsure of my speed, as I was just keeping up with traffic, but I did know that it was under the speed limit. I told the state trooper that I was unsure of my speed, but it couldn't have been over 45 mph. The officer cited me for failure to drive with due care (MN Statute [169.14.1](https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/statutes/?id=169.14)). He voiced being unable to print off my citation due to computer troubles, which I found weird as he was able to print off the crash report, but whatever, frankly I was too frazzled to care. So once I receive the citation, I learn that I have a mandatory court appearance in Minneapolis.   So, now I'm sort of freaking out. First of all, I have never appeared in court before, and Minneapolis is 3-4 hours from where I live. Secondly, while I see how I'd be found at fault of the accident, I do not understand the citation nor why I'd have to appear in court for it. Insurance has already decided that it was my fault and my car was a total loss.  I'd really appreciate any advice, as I don't even know what to expect.	Yes
I leased a car, and then moved states and registered my car in MD. I got a letter from Honda Financial that said by error I have received the original Certificate of Title for the vehicle and I should send it to Honda FInancial (they enclosed a pre-marked return envelope). Do I own the car now? If I don't send back the Title, and claim the car is mine now, will they just sue me for it or request an updated Certificate from the state?	Yes
"So this is my first ever speeding ticket - I honestly have no idea how to approach this. I got the ticket about a week ago in Bishop, CA while driving on a road trip. From about a mile away, I saw a black SUV and knowing my brother was nearby, I sped up to see if it was him. Once I got close enough to realize it was actually a patrol SUV with the words ""highway patrol"" on the rear, I immediately slowed down. But by then, I'm assuming, the cop had already matched my speed. He pulled to the side, allowing me to get ahead of him - then he proceeded to pull me over.   The court appearance that I have is about 300 miles away from my house. I'm willing to show up if it means I can get out of the ticket - but is there anything at all that I can do or say to make this ticket go away? I know it's a long shot, but I have to try!"	Yes
I've already got the ticket dismissed. Just want to know if there's anything the law can do ? 	Yes
My parked motorcycle was totaled  by a woman last year on July 17th, and the insurance company didn't cut me a check until September 6th. I agreed by phone to the number quoted by the agent and he said he would also be paying the estimate and storage fees at the garage so I could pick the bike up. The check was smaller than the number he originally quoted me (he didn't say on the phone that various deductions would be made), I later saw he greatly undervalued the bike (didn't account for almost $5K in after market parts), and he only paid the $200 estimate but not the $1000 storage fee. I'm still in dispute with the woman's insurance company over the remaining balance.   My question is- seeing as (I've been told) it's the law here that I'm owed loss of use on my vehicle from when it is disabled until I receive a check, but the check didn't reflect the correct value the bike OR to have it released from the garage, am I still only entitled to the cost of a comparable rental between those two dates?	Yes
"Specifically Little Flock, AR which might as well be Bentonville. First things first, the failure to appear. He has open court on the 24th of this month. I would like to get that dropped for him. What is the best method there. The truth seems best but I am open to suggestions. He wrote the wrong date in his calendar and missed the actual date. In the interim he lost his job and his mom moved two states away. He freaked out and didn't do anything. (He's 18) Explains it all right? I was thinking go early to court and try to talk to the prosecutor, tell him the story and hope for the best. Any other suggestions?  Second question. He was going 40 in a 25 and the officer wrote him for ""more that 15 miles over the speed limit"". Do that math! If we plead not guilty to ""more than 15 miles over"" does the officer just write a new ticket or does the judge dismiss it or what?Any and all advice would be appreciated. I am just a dad trying to help his kid and maybe save him some money."	Yes
"California  Earlier this month, a drunk driver crashed into my parked car. My car was towed and later deemed a total loss. During the entire ordeal I was studying abroad.  It's been taking quite a while to get this sorted out. The claim has just been sent to a settlement adjustor who is hunting down the responsible party's insurance. My question is, since this is not a personal injury issue on my part, is the settlement only limited to the value of the car? Or is it possible to argue for a settlement that considers the stress of dealing with the problem while abroad, the emotional ""pain"" (for lack of a less dramatic word) of losing a prized possession, and the inconvenience of not having a car for over a month (I need to get a job for the summer, but not having a car is making that more difficult than it would have been)?   Must these negotiations take place solely through insurance, or is it possible for me to file a separate claim outside of insurance? And would I need to hire a lawyer for that?  Some supplemental information: if not already obvious, it's my first time dealing with anything car accident or insurance related. I'm a student that classifies as low income by most measures in my area.   A quick Google search indicates the responsible party comes from the family of a wealthy and powerful former city council member, so I have some trepidation in trying to negotiate as good a settlement as possible."	Yes
Last month I got into a car accident. I was turning left from one direction, the other car was turning right onto the same street from another direction. My car was completely totaled. Theirs was damaged but taken care of by insurance. No one was injured. That said, I have a required court date tomorrow. As far as I know, the other driver does not. i realized too late that I was supposed to submit a 10 day notice if I wanted to plead not guilty if I wanted to avoid multiple appearances. I can't seem to find any information at all on how much I would be paying if I pleaded guilty.  This is my first offense and I don't have any idea what I should do. Please help.	Yes
I own a VW that is part of the whole Dieselgate scandal. I have not yet received any compensation from the lawsuit.  I was hit by someone running a red light. Although I live in a 'no-fault' state, he was ticketed for running the red light as there were three witnesses to the accident. Insurance is saying that their preliminary evaluation is a total loss on my vehicle.  My question is what to do to fight for proper valuation of my car. Dieselgate caused the value to drop- am I going to get screwed by the reckless behavior of VW execs? I owe more than KBB is saying it is worth.  I'm also told that I don't have rental coverage through my policy (made sense at the time due to access to another vehicle), but the officer told me I can get it through his policy? Is this true?  Getting a full medical work up now. Have had a lingering headache and low back pain.  Thanks in advance for your time and advice- I've never been in an accident before, so this is all new to me!	Yes
I received by email a speeding ticket for 17mph in a 10mph from my HOA. The speed limits are 15mph outside parking structures, and 10mph inside parking structures. I remember the day I got clocked since the patrol (which is HOA security, not police) was standing from the opposite end of the parking entrance aiming towards the parking entrance (transition between 15mph to 10mph). I didn't get stopped by security that day (thus the email). What irritates me is that I recall checking my speed and being good. The radar gun looked old and I doubt they calibrate it.. but I doubt they'll care since it's HOA. Please help? What are my options? (And I'm already moving out so I don't care of burning bridges)	Yes
In my area you can fight a ticket online. I admitted responsibility and asked for mercy. They lowered it, but it still has points on it.  I don't want to appear in court because I feel like it could backfire, and it would also balance out my time in terms of paying the $140 if I have to miss a full day of work.  Opinions? Thank you.	Yes
Posting from Virginia, residing in Norfolk. I got a reckless driving ticket in Lexington/Rockbridge where I went to court and was found guilty and got my license suspended for 3 months. This was on 6/28. I went to the DMV today (7/18) in Norfolk to apply for an ID card since after my court date they took my physical ID and I needed something to show when asked for ID. I go up to the window and I'm told my license isn't suspended and that there aren't any unusual notes or anything. I ask for my point balance, and the points from the ticket were not added either. At this point, the DMV attendant asked if I still wanted an ID card or just a license replacement card since I can't have both. I went ahead and just asked for the replacement license.   My question is, is this some sort of glitch? Is it possible that the system has not updated yet? It has already been 20 days so I feel like it would have been updated by now. Also, I'm not sure if I want to report this or call the court. I don't know what the procedure is if they did in fact in error did not apply the points/suspend my license. Would they just notice the error and go ahead and apply it, or would their error go in my favor?	Yes
I got a speeding ticket going 49 in a 40. I tried pay it a week ago through a link from my Clerk of Court's website (myfloridacounty.com) There was no citation found. I called my Clerk of Court and asked them why I wasn't able to pay it online. They couldn't find it in their system either. It's been about two and a half weeks and it still isn't there.  What does that mean? What should I do?	Yes
We hit each other on our back drivers sides.   It was a 20mph zone. And I was pulling out of a junction turning right.   The other driver came from the right and went around a parked car about 100 yards from the junction. Instead of returning back to his side of the road he continued the 100 yards to the junction on the wrong side of the road and we scraped each other. I had already pulled out.   He was speeding but I cannot prove this. So he did not stop in time.   He said he was continuing to drive on the other side of the road because there were cars parked further up the road and there's was no point pulling back in because 'everyone does it'.   Legally, I feel like I am at fault because I was pulling out of a junction, however he was 100% on the wrong side of the road. I didn't see him as I pulled out (creeping and peeping) because he appeared at the last second going maybe 40mph in a 20mph zone.   Who is at fault?   [A picture of the accident ](http://imgur.com/a/NrdxG) the back dots on the cars are where we scraped.	Yes
Just recently transferred a car from my dad to me and they copied my address down wrong and my new title should be 2700 my street address but it is 2706 my street address. Does this really matter, and if so are they going to try and charge me for their mistake?   Don't know if it makes a difference but the address they put on it does not technically exist.	Yes
I'm in Indiana. I was in the car with him (he's 18 I'm 20) and I'm 90% sure it was yellow. There was a guy in the other intersection that turned on red into our lane and i think the officer saw that and thought we ran a red light. However he still gave my brother a ticket for $300. Also it was his first time being pulled over. About a week later another officer gave him a ticket for not having his seatbelt on even though he had it on. The officer sped though almost 1/2 the town during construction to catch up to him and give him a $25 ticket. Would it be worth fighting the tickets in court or should he just pay the $325 worth of tickets and move on?  Also, how would he go about fighting it in court? Do we need a lawyer for that?	Yes
"Currently, I live with my bf who owns 2 vehicles. Unfortunately, our apartment complex only allows one parking spot per person living in the apartment. I have 1 car and my boyfriend has 2 which obviously leaves us one space short. The next part of the story is super important, at the time of move in and multiple times afterwards (via email as well as verbal) the apartment complex I currently live in told us that the street across from our apartment is a public street meaning that we could park our extra vehicle on that street without paying for an additional spot. That was what we thought was the end of that. Additionally, at least 20-30 cars park on this street daily as spill over from our complex.  My boyfriend primarily uses one car over the other; however, both cars have been used throughout the 8 months we have lived there and we have never had issues up until this point.   A little bit of background on a separate incident but related in the sense that the same officer has issued all the tickets to the vehicle in question:  On 12/16/2016 my boyfriend received a parking ticket for being ""more than 12 inches away from the curb"". Not really thinking to take a picture of the vehicle before moving it, accepted the ticket and paid the appropriate fee.  Back to the current story:  After running into my neighbors and talking to them about what happened everyone I talked to had similar stories! I figured ""I guess this is how the police deal with their time in a sleepy town and while annoying parking tickets are apart of life"". I sent an email to my leasing office explaining the situation and the leasing office sent a reply saying their policies are their policies and to their understanding we are legally allowed to park on that street. I still have a copy of this email for my own records.  On 06/08/2017 we received a warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location (I do have this warning but it is not with me. I can upload this ticket late if need be). So not thinking much of it, my boyfriend moved the vehicle a couple of streets over with additional public parking(which I pass on my way to work everyday and can visually see the windshield and would noticed any ticket or warning).  On 06/29/2017 on my way to work I noticed that the car was not in it's normal ""spot"" which I check daily on my way to work. I sincerely make it a point to check everyday as we almost missed the deadline to pay for the first ticket due not seeing the ticket. I frantically call my boyfriend and explain whats going on. At first we thought the car had been stolen but after looking online realized it could have been towed. We contacted the local tow company and sure enough that was the case.  We promptly went to go retrieve the car; however; because the police department was the one who issued the tow, we could not retrieve the car until we have payed the associated fees with the police department. Great. At this point we were livid as we had never received any notification that car was going to be towed.   We go to the police department and to our utter shock there were apparently 2 outstanding parking tickets for ""parking without permission on public property"" (WTF does that even mean?!?!) and that we had received ANOTHER warning stating a ""dead"" vehicle has been left on public property and to avoid the tow we needed to move the vehicle to a different location. Outraged we said we were never notified of the tickets or the second warning to move the vehicle (The tickets are bright pink and I visually check the windshield daily and would have noticed these tickets/warning) and would be appealing them but unfortunately we were told we had to pay the additional associated fees if we wanted to retrieve the car from the impound lot. Additionally, we stated we had moved the vehicle after the first ""dead"" vehicle warning so clearly it was not a dead vehicle. The clerk stated all she could do was give us the tickets and pay the fee but if we wanted to appeal the tickets we would have to submit additional paperwork (we have the paperwork and are currently filling it out).   We then retrieved the car which had NO PARKING TICKETS ON THE WINDSHEILD and after getting home a reviewing the tickets realized ALL THE TICKETS WERE ISSUED BY THE SAME OFFICER!!! Including the first parking tickets we received in December.  I have no clue if what is going on is illegal or not and I am just really looking for advice on how to move forward. This situation does not read right to me and after everything is all said and done (and if we end up having to pay the tickets) we will have sunk 1k into this whole ordeal.  I can't help but to feel we were specifically targeted as about 20-30 people park on the street across from our complex all the time and never get towed. My head is spinning and the idea that a police officer can get away with what has happened sickens. I'm also having a hard time stomaching a 1k loss without any idea on how to prevent it in the future as my bf was about to go to college and we had to dip into that money to cover this expense.   /r/legaladvice please help. What can I do? Is this legal? Should I file a complaint against the police officer?"	Yes
While in a parking lot, a guy reversed and hit my car (I was in my car). He tapped me very lightly but he just ignored me and just left the parking lot. Normally I wouldn't care, but I was mad he just ran and I don't want him to do this to anyone else either. I got video evidence and his license plate. Should I report him to the police?	Yes
I've been working to get all holds on my license taken off. I was told I owed $1,300 to a county in Louisiana (I currently reside in Arizona). I paid the money, but realized the hold never came off my license. Turns out I have a seperate ticket in the City Court that has a bench warrant attached to it. They said I owe $710, must be paid in full (No payment options) or I can get my butt to the court where I will be jailed for 45 days as retribution to the ticket. I don't have 710 bucks and honestly I would do the time if i could get to Louisiana but that's not an option, either. Is there any other way I can go about getting on a payment plan or fines reduced?!? I just had to take out a damn loan for the first 1300 bucks and am paying on that, so another loan isn't really an option for me.	Yes
Background: I got pulled over on Christmas evening in NY for going 70 in a 55 on I-95 North (I didn't even know there was a speed limit that low on I-95).  I'm going to traffic court later today, I don't really care about the fine but the ticket carries 6 points with it which I'd like to avoid at all costs. How do I go about doing this? I am bringing a copy of my driving record that shows I am in good standing with 0 points on my license currently. Do I admit to speeding and straight up ask for the fine but no points? Do I just present the fact that I'm normally a safe driver and hope the whole ticket gets dismissed? Should I tell him I was trying to be safe and keep up with the flow of traffic (which was technically the case) or should I say something else? Please help me beat this ticket, thank you!	Yes
Wells Fargo did this nefarious insurance nonsense to me last fall and I refused to pay until if was rectified. They called 10-12 times a day then repoed my car. I was going through some personal stuff and depressed so never took it anywhere. I just paid cash for a new car and told them to f?!$ off since my attempt to build credit through this loan was screwed. I just did not have the energy to fight. Now I do. What do I do? Call WF and work out settlement? Call attorney? What type of attorney?  What should I ask for?  IE $2000+ rental bill until I found new car. Harassment. Credit screwed. Insurance issues.   https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/business/wells-fargo-unwanted-auto-insurance.html?mtrref=undefined&amp;referer=http://thefreethoughtproject.com/wells-fargo-charges-800000-customers-for-fake-car-insurance-steals-25000-cars/	Yes
"This happened in Dallas. I got cited for out of date registration in Dallas Thursday of last week. I took my car to get it inspected on Friday and plan to get the registration handled today.   However this morning a DPD police officer gave me another citation for the out of date registration. I showed him the earlier citation from the same police department and showed him how I was doing my due diligence on getting the inspection done so that I could get it registered.   He did not care. He told me that he ""Had no choice but to cite me.""   Now I am looking at 2 23.50 dollar fees at the dallas municipal courthouse. Its a 20 dollar dismissal fee plus 3.50 for using a card.   Does this not fall under double jeopardy since this is the same PD for the same violation?"	Yes
Pulled over yesterday and told I was swerving. I was not drunk, but was pretty tired because it was the end of a long drive. I had a major panic attack during the field sobriety tests, I was shaking too hard to stand, and when the officer did the visual test I almost passed out from locking my legs. There is no way I passed those tests. The attack passed by the 3rd test (balance test) which I was able to do fine, but I was not allowed to retake the previous two.   Officer thought I was on some kind of narcotic, and brought me into the station. The did take a urine sample, which I'm positive will come back clean, I don't do drugs. I did have a few beers earlier that afternoon but this stop happened over 4 hours after I had drinks, and I did not have enough to even get buzzed. I did tell the officer when I had the drinks, and complied with all testing and requests, and I was incredibly polite through the whole ordeal.  This is my first OBI, I have no priors, and I have already spoken to a lawyer and have things in motion to meet before my arraignment hearing. What should I be expecting to happen here? Is it normal for a first time offense to be downgraded into a reckless driving charge? Should I expect the book to get thrown at me and to receive the manditory 72 hours in jail? These questions will obviously be asked to my lawyer, but I was hoping to hear some positives to this before going in because I'm freaking out right now.	Yes
"I'm in Virginia.  My ex and I purchased a car together in 2008. We broke up in 2011. No divorce, because we weren't legally married, but we agreed that my ex would keep the car and pay for it. Both of our names were on the loan, which put both of our names on the title.   Due to the following circumstances, my name remains on the title. I want to get it off the title and my ex - who wants no contact with me - told me that I have to take care of it. This is an issue because my ex doesn't pay his car tax (he owes three years' worth), and the state of VA could come after me for it since I'm listed on the title. And the kicker: The tax bills come to me since my name is the first one on the title. I text photos of the bills to my ex and he acknowledges them. (I have all the texts in my phone.) He told me that his therapist told him not to talk to me, so that means I have to handle this. (Yes, I'm angry.)  The circumstances:  1. My ex paid off the loan in 2014, but the credit union is still holding the car title because he owes them money for a defaulted credit card.  2. I declared bankruptcy in 2012, the year after we split, which discharged my responsibility for the loan. My ex told me that I could no longer talk to the bank about the loan since my bankruptcy placed it into collections and he was the owner of the loan.  3. In 2014, my bankruptcy lawyer arranged for the bank to allow me and my ex to sign the title and pay them $12.50 to get my name removed. My ex said he would do it but ultimately didn't.  4. In the meantime, my ex has not contacted the bank about the debt or the car title.  How can I get the title from the bank? My understanding is that I have ownership but not possession of the vehicle. Do I have standing to contact the bank? Should I try to work through a lawyer? The last time I contacted a lawyer, he was baffled by my case and recommended that I gather DMV paperwork to show my ownership to have him write a ""strongly worded"" letter to the bank. Is this the best option?"	Yes
So my town does angled parking spots on some streets. Town ordinance (though it's not actually posted on any signs on the streets) states you have to park head-in in the angled spots.  I was pulling out of a lot onto a 2-way street with angled spots on the right side. Before I did, the person in the angled spot immediately to the right of the lot exit I was using left the spot.   The proximity of the spot to the lot exit was such that, instead of turning right onto the street, reversing, then pulling forward head-first into the spot, it was faster/easier/safer to just pull forward and back right into the spot.  When I got out of lunch, I had 2 tickets. One for $30 for violating the head-in ordinance - that one I understand. Ignorance is no excuse, etc. However, I also had a $54 ticket for a Section 39:4-135 violation. Here's that text:  39:4-135. Parking; direction and side of street; angle parking; one-way street The operator of a vehicle shall not stop, stand or park the vehicle in a roadway other than parallel with the edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the right-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway, except as follows:  a. Upon those streets which have been designated by ordinance and have been marked or signed for angle parking, vehicles shall be parked at the angle to the curb designated and indicated by the ordinance and marks or signs.  b. Upon one-way streets, local authorities may permit parking of vehicles parallel with the left-hand edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the left-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway.  I think that violation is in error. In (a) it states only the angle of parking in reference to angled-parking ordinances. I took photos of my car, it's at the correct angle and between the space markers, it's just backed in.  What do I do here? I doubt it's worth it to fight the head-in violation since that one's pretty cut-and-dry, but the 2nd violation really seems like it's not valid. I've literally had 2 non-parking tickets in my life, one was speeding that I hired a lawyer for when I was like 17, and 1 was driving without an inspection sticker on a car I bought on eBay that same day, so I'm pretty green to this. If I plead not guilty, am I gonna have to go word-against-word with some douche traffic cop? This is also the town I live in, and it's a very quiet town with a ton of bored cops, so I'm worried that making any sort of waves is gonna mark me and my car to every cop in town forever. $54 isn't going to break my bank account or anything, but it really steams me. We literally went out for lunch, and it went from a $50 meal to a $134 meal.	Yes
Allegheny and beaver courts, PA. So I've finished my dui suspension length and have satisfied all my requirements, aside from paying off all my court fines. Under act 122 the court will not release my completion of treatment to the DMV until I have paid all court cost/restitution. I went back to school shortly after my duis (3 almost 4 years ago). Since then I haven't been in any trouble legally but I haven't been working because of school. So my license would be very helpful with travel requirements for work/internship. I've made regular payments over this time, but they aren't enough to cover all of my costs. Is there a way to petition for certification of my completion to be transferred to the DMV from courts, without paying all of my fines?? Thanks for any advice!	Yes
I'm 16 about to get my drivers license in Florida if I have a bench warrant in Texas for not appearing in court ( I took something that wasn't mine and got caught it was under $30 and got a citation but didn't show up to court because I left the day later I got the citation) am I able to get my drivers license with no worry ? 	Yes
I remember when it happened. I was in Hermosa Beach doing uber and I was waiting outside a bar late at night with other uber drivers with lights on parked in red. I know I'm not supposed to.   I saw a parking meter worker pull up behind me but didn't turn on any lights or anything. About 30 seconds later my riders came out and got in. I looked in the mirror to see if the attendant was flagging me down but she didn't. I put my car in drive and slowly drove away. She made no attempt at stopping me. She never issued me anything.   	Yes
I got a speeding ticket that I did not deserve (there were circumstantial factors at play, not going to get into it) while passing by a small county in Colorado 3 hours from where I live. I would contest it but I don't want to make the drive and deal with going to court in general. I looked up the ticket number and it says it's not in the system. Today I finally got around to calling the court and they said there is no record of it anywhere and had me call the Denver DMV. The DMV said there is no record of the ticket at all; the lady thought that maybe I received a summons and I was past my court date (which would explain nothing showing up), but it's a speeding ticket with a court date set for 8/4 (I think). She told me to call the police station to look into it. Legally, am I supposed to call the police station? I spent a bunch of my time dealing with this and doing everything I can to pay it and I don't really think calling the police station and sorting out whatever paperwork is my responsibility. Is it? What happens if I don't do anything?	Yes
Hey, r/legaladvice,   As the title says, I was in a car accident where a drunk uber driver hit me, and I later found out that he had a suspended license. What are the chances that I could successfully sue uber?	Yes
"Well, there were no responses to this but I wanted to submit one in case somebody came here looking for something similar.  I did *not* have a bench warrant. The lady that initially told me there was a problem with my license was saying that I probably had one, but, as it turns out, they just communicated my unpaid traffic fines to the Georgia DDS.   I called first thing this morning, and the folks at the courthouse told me how much I owed and allowed me to pay over the phone. They then told me it would be immediately removed from the system, BUT in order for there to not be an issue getting a new license, I can call their courthouse with the DMV office I'm going to tomorrow, and they will contact the office directly and let them know of the status.  Basically, I can get my license again and be legal now that I paid my fines, and I only had to Uber to work one day. :) Yay. I'm by no means saying that this was a good situation to be in, but I was absolutely terrified of what this meant when I initially realized what was going on. Google searching ""Didn't show up for traffic tickets in Georgia"" yields terrifying results. I was surprised I wasn't arrested right then and there at the DMV after googling all night.  But, this is a lesson learned."	Yes
I got a phone call an hour ago from my son, who is 26. My son lives in the state of Texas with his mother. His mother and I have been divorced since he was two years old. I have always strived to have a connection with my son; although it has ever been easy (he suffers from Asperger's syndrome, suffers from intense anxiety, has difficulty making friends, his mother loved being passive aggressive and generally make my life a living hell, etc) I have always loved my son and supported him when I could. If the fine folks of /r/legaladvice could advise me on the following dilemma my son has moronically gotten himself into, it would be greatly appreciated.  A few things about my son: he lives with his mother. He makes about $1,400 a month (after taxes). He dropped out of college his freshmen year and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social phobia shortly afterwards, hence the low paying job and general lack of motivation he suffers from. Because my son can be sometimes be very thick and obstinate, as well as terrified of speaking to people, he neglected to get insurance for his car for a whole month. I know; I chastised him for his gross irresponsibility, but I have long ago accepted that I cannot hold myself responsible for his decisions, however misguided as they can be. I love my son. He told me on the phone that he had been in a car crash a few months ago (on a car he had just bought) without having insurance. He received a ticket for failure to yield (resulting in the accident; according to him, he had just gotten off a 12 hour shift, he hadn't slept well in days due to his anxiety caused insomnia, and he had thought he had the right of way when a car slammed into him. Afraid of the financial difficulties of paying a fine for both things, he consulted his best friend, who happens to be a cop, and his friend advised him to get insurance for the car involved in the accident that same day, so he could present proof of insurance to court in front of the judge and have the fine removed.   It appeared to have worked. He dropped the insurance for the same car after paying his failure to yield fine. However, today (months after the car crash in question) he began to receive phone calls from his car insurance company about a claim placed on behalf of the other party involved. My son's car wasn't covered by his insurance at the time.   How can I best advise my son? Should he confess to the insurance company that he did not have insurance at the time of the crash? Would that make him liable to be sued? What are some repercussions he could face? He pays for his credit card, phone bill, car, rent, and groceries, so despite his gross negligence he tries to be good. He has fucked up enormously, but he is my son.  Please. I am desperate.   -concernedfatherofmoron	Yes
Excuse my naive question...    My car was parked in front of my house when I was hit. I wasn't wearing a seatbelt so I got thrown around. The other driver and I went to the ER. Medically, I'm fine and will follow up with my primary doctor to be safe. My 2013 Civic was destroyed. Today I learned the driver doesn't have insurance. My question is how will she be punished for this? I know she will have to cover her own medical bills and her car is likely totaled as well, but I looked up her name in our state's database and it seems like she wasn't taken to jail or given a citation.   To clarify I have comprehensive/collision/underinsured/uninsured coverage.    My questions are as follows:  1. I will have to pay a $1000 deductible for everything to be covered by my insurance . Will I ever see that money again?  2. How does totaling a car without insurance impact someone's driving/legal record? In other words, how does driving recklessly without insurance impact people down the line?   3. Does it make any sense to sue the driver? I *currently* have no medical issues other than soreness...and my ER bills are being covered by my uninsured bodily injury coverage.   4. Any other general advice for this situation would be great. I'm so happy to be walking after such a bad wreck but I'm frustrated that it happened and would like to handle it properly.    Thanks!	Yes
The second woman that hit me made it clear she would rather pay out of pocket than have a claim on her insurance.  I realize it may not be the most ethical thing to do, but would I be breaking any laws to accept a cash payment from her, and make a claim with the other rear-enders insurance?  I realize it's a bit shady, I just need to be clear on whether or not I would be breaking any laws.	Yes
The adult son of the neighbor across the street backed into my husband's truck at midnight and took off. He hit in in such a way that the suspension was thrown off and we ended up with a body shop repair estimate of $3500 :/  Here's where it gets fun: the son had recently gotten his car back from the shop after damaging it in a DUI. His license was suspended. According to him, his girlfriend was driving (we suspect that she wasn't) when our truck got hit. The police came and took a report in which it identifies that she was driving. The car is registered to the son's mom (his dad's ex-wife) and is also insured by her. According to her insurance, they will not pay our damages because they cannot get in contact with their client.  The insurance says that all insurance companies will not pay out on a claim unless they can confirm with their insured that the vehicle involved was in an accident while being driven by an authorized person.  All she has to do is literally NOT answer her phone and that's that. Now, we have no idea what to do! NO ONE is cooperating nor taking responsibility for the damages to our truck and we are out a vehicle!  Can we continue pushing the insurance? Can we sue the insurance or the kid's mom? Do we sue the girl that was supposedly driving? Do we call the propety owners across the street and let them know that they have 6 people living in their 2 bed/1bath house? What can we do? What recourse do we have in a situation like this?	Yes
"I was in an accident a few months ago. I was on a provincial highway and I entered a 2 lane roundabout. This was my first time driving in one as I have only had my license for 3 years and I just never came across one. I accidentally entered in the outside lane not realizing I needed to be on the inside lane. I intended to go all the way around the roundabout and there was a large truck (I drive a mini hatchback) to my left on the inner lane of the roundabout who decided to exit. He saw me and still decided to just exit and slammed directly into my driver side.  Police arrived on scene and because I was in the wrong lane (unknowingly) even though he was supposed to be looking out for other vehicles I was the only one who got a ticket for an ""unsafe lane change"" because technically I was in the lane that was supposed to exit. So although I didn't actually change lanes I remained in the roundabout when I should have exited.   Its all very confusing. But I know on the accident report it says that I say I did NOT see the truck and the guy driving the truck says he DID see me. So I feel like he has some culpability and in fact he is the one who made an unsafe lane change because he didn't bother to check for other vehicles around him before exiting the roundabout.   I understand I was in the wrong lane and that's totally my fault but at the same time I wasn't intentionally being unsafe and I didn't make a lane change unsafely I just didn't realize I was supposed to exit if I was in the outside lane.   My early resolution meeting is today and honestly I cannot afford a ticket like this. I'm a single mom, I work 3 jobs, and attend school. I have been told that they cannot convict me if they can't prove the exact offense on the ticket. But I'm not sure what to say at this early resolution meeting I have today.  Also want to make mention that this is a ticket for a provincial highway under the highway traffic act.   Any advice is very much appreciated. Thank you."	Yes
Title is pretty self-explanatory, I got into an accident, my rear bumper got ripped off 2 weeks ago and I just got a ticket in the mail for careless driving. The cop did NOT see the accident and the entire encounter was overall friendly. Now I know I can just talk to the prosecutor before court and have it knocked down to unsafe driving but that's a $400 fine that I'd rather not pay if I didn't have to. Since the cop didn't see the accident and the other driver isn't gona show up to court to testify against me if that were the case, so what are my options? Any advice would be greatly appreciated	Yes
My friends car was stolen out of my driveway last week and the cops found it 2 days ago and towed it to a local impoundment. My friend is in Europe for the next 2 weeks (from US) and will obviously not be able to pick up. The impoundment is charging $30 per day which will add up to about $400 plus the cost of towing. Is there any way that he can give me permission to get his car out? The impoundment is claiming there is no way anyone can retrieve it besides my friend.	Yes
"A few months ago I was pulled over for a failure to stop at a stop sign in Wisconsin. Not a huge deal, but long story short I don't think I actually did it.   Written plea of not guilty goes through fine. I show up for the meeting with (I believe) the DA and say that I don't think I did it and she keeps trying to lead me to accepting the no point no contest she has as an option. I say no I want to take it to court. Fine.   I get the date in the mail and everything's great. Two days before the date work needs me to go out of town for a client, and I look at my ticket and it has a ""requests to reschedule must be made 48 hours or more before scheduled date and time"" so I let work know I can go and call and leave the message.   Cut to two days later, an hour before court was scheduled and it's the clerk letting me know that I didn't give enough notice and everyone involved is there. The clerk asks if they are willing to reschedule and I'm told they are not willing to ""put up with this"" anymore, and I'm just guilty of it.   I did follow the procedure I was given, but I realize I likely have no recourse. Can I appeal the judgment or should I just deal with the points and fine?"	Yes
At the beginning of June, I was in stop-and-go traffic and a woman in her car flagged me over to the side of the road. She claims I rear-ended her. I didn't think I did, and saw no evidence of damage to my car. I asked her if she wanted to file a police report, she said no. I gave her my information, never admitting fault, but not wanting to be accused of fleeing the scene of an accident. I let her take a picture of my insurance and my license, but it had my old address (I had literally just moved that day). I did not provide my new address or phone/email. When my insurance agency called, I disputed the claim and gave my version of events to the best of my ability. A few days later they called and said they were not claiming liability on the accident. Hooray, I thought I was done with this. Today, I received a letter from the state police. It has a driver Information Exchange and an Illinois Motorist Report enclosed, asking me to mail it to the department of transportation.  The reason that I'm worried is because, due to an issue with an emission test, my car's registration was expired on the date of the alleged collision. Because of that, I have a few outstanding tickets for registration violation that are currently sitting on seizure (they will boot me if they find the car). My car is currently parked in my garage until I can save enough to pay the tickets and re-register. I also have not yet reported my change of address to the DMV. I'm worried that this lady's meddling is going to get me in trouble with the DOT.  I know there's a lot there. What is my best course of action for responding to this letter? What can I do to strengthen my case that I did not collide with this woman's car? What actions should I take with the city to avoid getting an arrest warrant or something? Do I need to inform the DMV of my changed address immediately? Sorry to be so uninformed.	Yes
A work colleague is moving here from France in August 2017. He will eventually be purchasing my car, but can not get a state driver's license or registration until he has a social security number. This can apparently take up to 6 weeks. The US midwest in a small town is difficult to navigate without a car.  I want to help him out, but dont want to be liable for any accidents.  What is my best option to stay legally safe but still help him?	Yes
"I was in a minor car accident where my car reversed into another car who also reversing.  The damage to my car was much more severe, and the opposing driver had light damage. I was parked legally, while the other driver was parked in a spot that clearly stated ""no parking"".  Who is considered liable in your opinion? Do I have any defense?  Thanks!"	Yes
So couple days ago, someone hit and run my parked car. I called the police and filed a report. So I spend the next few days looking around my neighborhood looking for security camera. Lucky I was able to find a footage of the truck hitting my car and was also able to get the U.S. DOT number of the truck(which turn out to be a small trucking company). Unfortunately, the license plate was a blurry and couldnt make out the complete plate. Tomorrow my insurance company is coming down to take a look at my car and the footage. Should i contiune looking around to see if i can find the license plate of the truck or is the US Dot Number enough to make the case?    Many Thanks	Yes
"As a preface to this story I drive a truck for the nation's largest retailer and they pay me very good (six figures good).   I was on my off day and took an out of town trip with my wife and kids in the family minivan. We started to approach the small town of Uniontown AL and I was immediately pulled over by a police officer (he passed me going the opposite direction then proceeded to do a unturn to get behind me). I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam.   I know the obvious answer is to ""lawyer up"" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well?   And to revisit my beginning statement where I drive truck for the nation's largest retailer... They will not tolerate a serious violation on my mvr. So I'm possibly facing a $100,000/yr job loss. Who knows, they might be understanding and give me a slap on the wrist but either way I'm scared!   Where do I go from here?"	Yes
"So I got a ticket for driving my 16+ year old mini van which didn't pass the smog test. Since the smog didn't pass I couldn't re-register my car and was driving it for 9 months without registration when I got pulled over. I already have a moving violation and have taken traffic school for in within the last 18 months so it is not worth it to just pay the ticket and get a point on my license especially since I'll be heading off to college and have no use for a car. If I sell/donate my car before the required date that I need to re-register without getting a points on my license will I still get a point on my license? If I do decide to sell/donate the car, what would the process be to make sure everything is done right? I'm leaning toward donating the car at this point. This is in the State of California and the CVC violation is 4000(a)(1)  The ticket is also a correctable ""fix-it"" ticket. Not sure if that matters or not."	Yes
I stopped at a stop sign and checked to see if there was any incoming traffic from the left. After checking, i proceeded to turn right but then I saw a person in front my car, crossing the street. So I quickly pulled over my brake and the person saw me coming at her and she quickly back paddled. Then she walked over to the driver's seat and when I pulled over my window to ask if she was alright, she said she WASN'T alright and asked for my information. So i gave her my phone number and my name and she just walked away after verifying my phone number... She was not on the ground, and from my perspective at the time, the only contact that my car had with her was with her hand at the front hood of my car trying to maybe.. prevent the car from lunging at her?   Is there any charges that I can get from this incident?  I am residing in Washington State.	Yes
PREFACE - I am in Ohio. The I-70 incident occurred in Columbus, and the I-75 incident occurred in Cincinnati.  Ill start from the beginning to lay out all the facts. Thank you in advance for reading.  Feb '17 - I hit a large pothole in a construction zone on I-70, causing a sidewall bubble on my front right.  May '17 - I learn of ODOT claims, and filed a damage report. They defer me to the construction contractor who, for all intents and purposes, laughs at me. I am out +$100 for an alignment and now have a sidewall bubble.  July '17 - I hit another massive pothole on I-75 which blows my right front tire. I make it to a tire shop, and paid $618 for 2 new front tires and an alignment.  Today - I have filed another ODOT damage report, and attempted to file a claim but realized I was in over my head.  **I am looking for some advice on how to move forward. Here are my questions:**  What are my chances of repayment? This is the 2nd time in 2017 an ODOT liable interstate caused damage to my car.  What else can I do to accomplish repayment? Does this involve a claim?  Since my car did not need to be towed, and there was no police contact, there is little official documentation of the incident. Will they believe me?  I drive a performance car which has all wheel drive. This stipulates that all four tread depths must be similar. Now, my front 2 tires are new and my back two are 1 year old. I did not have the money to cover all 4 tires when replacing, so I did what I could. Since my car requires all four tires to have similar tread, is it reasonable to claim that the state pay for all four tires?  Thank you again for reading.	Yes
A vehicle was stopped in the road. He then began driving very slowly. I decided to cross the double yellow line and pass him. Lucky for me a cop saw me and ticketed me. I explained he was driving like an asshole but she said it was a no passing zone. I want to plead not guilty as I can just barely afford the $170 ticket. Any professional input is much appreciated!	Yes
"Hello friends, i hope everyone is having a nice day.  On 05/15/2017 i received a ticket for ""Reckless Driving 20+ MPH over the speed limit. 78/55mph zone/Distance 1341 47"" (Law Section 2.46.2.862). This happened in Virginia while i was driving from New Jersey to Myrtle Beach. I was speeding, there is no denying that. However, i spoke to a lawyer and he basically told me i was screwed and that its going to go to a criminal case. I cant go to jail for 180 days for a speeding ticket. I have my last semester of college coming up and i wouldn't be able to graduate. Is there anything i can do? i can provide more information if needed. Thanks all."	Yes
"I've been trying to find what the law is on this. I saw something written about obtaining a permit for yellow strobe lights (red and blue are reserved for official emergency vehicles) but I haven't been able to find anything about whether they're allowed to exceed the speed limits...   Story:  Today I was stopped at a red light, a white van pulled up behind me. I noticed that it had yellow strobe lights built into its side mirrors which it didn't have on when it pulled up behind me but at some point it turned on. The light turned green, I guess I was 2 seconds slow to notice because the van behind me honked at me (the car in front of my had just started to move as the horn sounded).  So I proceeded to drive in this two lane road, there were cars next to me.  I noticed that the white van was following me very very closely. I increased speed a little (5 above the limit) but I was able to maintain a safe distance with the car in front of me.  After some point, there was a break and the white van moved to pass me on the left. He exceeded the speed limit by at least 10mph to do so and then quickly merged right in front of me without using his turn signal.  It was at this point that I noticed a sticker on the back of his (very dirty) van that said ""Emergency Roadside Assistance, 24 hours"".  Shortly after this, the speed limit dropped by 10mph as we were passing a fire station with somewhat poor visibility and this van was now driving 20mph above the limit as he tore away from me.   I didn't have the presence of mind to try to memorize his license plate but I didn't see any kind of other identification number I could use to report him.  My questions: In my state, what exactly is the legality of yellow strobe lights? Do they require a permit? Are there specific circumstances when they can be used? Do they allow a vehicle to exceed the speed limit or drive in any other dangerous/aggressive ways? If so, under what circumstances?  I will add, that in the bright daylight when this happened, his yellow lights were not very noticeable. If I hadn't thought to check my rear view at the stoplight, I don't think I would have noticed them at all. Additionally he did not keep the lights on the entire time he was driving. He turned them off at some point while following me, then turned them back on when he passed me, then back off when he was in front of me and going 20mph above the limit.  This is a little different from the types of questions I usually see here... I'm not looking to take any kind of legal action or anything I just want to know, did I screw up? Was I obstructing a legal emergency vehicle in some way? He only used his horn once at the stoplight, never to indicate that I should move over for him or something like that..."	Yes
"I have a 22ft Grumman Olsen Curbmaster bread truck with two axels and six wheels that as registered as a personal vehicle and used like one. I don't use it everyday, but frequently enough for it not to be abandoned. I park it along a back alley near my work. There is a graveyard blocked by hedges on one side, and a storage place on the other. The closest residential building is over 200 feet away and around the corner.   Today I was confronted by that homeowner 200 feet away and told me that he had called the police, twice, and that Monday, my truck would be towed. I asked him if it was against the law. He said yes, that it was illegal to park anywhere for more than 24 hours,  and then it had two be moved at least 4 blocks away. Before leaving he said, ""I'll let you know, I am an expert on parking laws. I'm not asking you to move it, I'm telling you."" which, of course makes me want to leave it there much more because I like to watch rude people squirm...  Anyway, personal matters aside, it is going to be a real pain to move it 4 blocks every day into real residential territory where people have a real right to be upset (like right in front of their house). The only laws I could find on the internet was that you cannot park a truck in front of across from a residence for more than 8 hours.   I see Laurelhurst park surrounded with full time RV livers and I doubt I'm that high on the to do list for the police even if I am parked illegally.   So my questions are,  1) am I parked illegally  2) will it really be Monday when I am towed? Isn't this city overflowing with RVers who are obviously lived in and illegally parked? (I'm thinking Laurelhurst Park) Will they have to give me some kind of warning sticker?  3) where can I park this thing if I have to move?  I am completely ignorant of all things law, and don't know even where to look for myself so I really appreciate your advice."	Yes
So about a year ago I, at the time, a 22 year old Texas resident was in oklahoma and recieved a speeding ticket.  I only paid about half of it, which of course I knew would turn into a warrant but I rarely go to Oklahoma so i don't care.  I have since moved to Colorado. Which brings us to thursday, I get a message from a private debt collection agency on behalf of this Oklahoma county with a lady telling me I have a warrant, which I already knew about.  I was just surprised it soundes like a collections agency, so I called them back and spoke to the lady who left me her extension.  When i state who I am and why Im calling she chuckled and said, oh yes Ive talked to your mother.  Excuse me what? Im 23. I go off on the lady and eventually hang up because she said she was not part of a police department. I then called my mother.  My mom claims the debt collector had called both hers and my dads cell phone looking for me and I assume telling them of my warrant ( which they already knew about.)   So my question is this, is it legal for debt collectors to call my parents about a debt not belonging to them? Also is it even legal for police to send info about warrants or debts to private debt collectors? Can I get arrested in colorado or Texas if im in the state, and lastly, is it legal for the said private debt collector to give out information about my warrent to others?  This is why I stay out of Oklahoma.	Yes
Long shot here. I was going 15mph over the speed limit in a construction zone with no workers present when a sheriff pulled me over. The sheriff was actually sitting inside the cones. This was during the period where all construction projects statewide were frozen due to a budget impasse. Is it still considered a work zone, and do I have a chance at getting the fine lowered?  Lake County, Illinois.	Yes
I bought a 2015 Jeep and I don't think it's all I wanted. All I've done so far is just put down a deposit and signed a few papers and then they let me drive off with it to come back tomorrow for finalization. I don't think I want the car anymore though - I just feel it was too hasty. Can I return it? Im fine without getting the deposit back.	Yes
I got a ticket that cost 500. I didn't stop to turn right on a red light.   I got the notice back and it said a traffic school is an option. My question is does going to traffic school allow me to avoid the $500 fine? or it's just avoiding point deducted so my insurance will be cheaper?  	Yes
What should i do about this?  I got pulled over doing 100 mph in a 65 mph zone in New jersey.   I'm 17 years old.   I have court in 6 days ON MY BIRTHDAY. Fuck my life.	Yes
I recently got a bike citation for failing to stop at a stop sign while riding my bike. The fine is $257 &amp; after reading up on some other posts on reddit about other citations and fine amounts, I find this a bit excessive??? I do not have the money to pay at the moment. I requested a 30 day extension, but what are my options? Is it possible to get the fine reduced? Do I have to show up to court?	Yes
I was driving home from the gym and there was a car parked in the narrow street right outside the gym. I thought he stopped for the red light but he was parked the entire time. As I was waiting there thinking he would move a car hit me from behind going slowly. I was driving at pathfinder whereas he had something along the lines of an accord ? And his license plate was dent whereas nothing really happened to my car. When i went home however I noticed that my rear bumper had a crack on it not really noticeable. Unfortunately I'm an idiot and didn't bother exchanging information with him. Can I still ask him to fix it ?  	Yes
"Hey, Guys! It's my first time posting here but I've been a long time lurker of this Sub.  I'm at a bit of a loss on what to do here so I figured I would ask.. Back in mid June my fiancé and I went to see a movie at the local theater. We were leaving and back on the main road that has a few exits onto a main highway. It was very busy and the traffic was stop and go. While trying to change lanes into the lane to our left the traffic again paused very quickly and we hit the back of the car in front of us. It was a low speed collision and there was absolutely no damage to the other car, not even a dent. We took pictures. We have been in contact with the other drive since and there have been no issues with her car. Our vehicle took some damage but we later found out it was cosmetic only and only because our inner rebar had rusted. The damage was minimal enough that we did not go through our insurance.  Cops were called, everyone gave statements.. As far as car accidents go it was pleasant. I was not driving (I currently have an injury that prevents me from doing so but didn't drive previously either). My fiancé was. He has been driving for over 10 years and had never been in an accident before. This was his first. We get a ticket to appear in court.  We get there at the court date and are given a packet of info pertaining to the case. Included is the full police report as well as a plea deal. His plea deal was for a $85 fine and 2 demerit points. We were shocked... Both of us had assumed it would be a fine only. We considered taking the plea but then started looking through the report. The summery that the Cops wrote does not match what actually happened at all, nor does it match the statements from either of us or the other driver.  In the report it states that we were turning onto the road we were already on from a completely different road and literally turned into her from there. This sounds much worse than what actually took place and there is a diagram to match this false account. At the court was the first time we had seen this report. It also states that the other car had a dent and took damage which is untrue and we have pictures to prove that. I am able to take pictures of this if it would help for advice on here.  I'm at a loss. When we got to the judge he tried to explain that the report wasn't correct but all we got was a new date to appear, which is this coming Wednesday. This is new territory for both of us and I'm not sure what to do next or what he may need to say to get this dealt with. The original plea is still on the table. The technical charge is ""Changing Lanes Not in Safety"". There was a woman ahead of us in court who was there for ""Wreckless Driving"" which originally held a charge of 6 demerit points and her plea was for 2 and a fine.  Neither of us think his plea accurately reflects the accident. We're just really shocked at how all of this went down considering he has such a clean record (like, not even a speeding ticket!).  Really, we just need advice on how to move forward. Thanks in advance. :)"	Yes
I applied for my drivers license and have a scheduled appointment for the driving test, and everything seems to be in order, no hold ups or issues. After getting back home and looking over the huge packet that came with my parent taught drivers ed I realized that I did not complete all the classroom hours required for the license, I noticed my mistake but the DMV doesn't seem to notice the problem. What do I do? For more info, I turned 18 this April.	Yes
I got pulled over for speeding.  The wiki says to hire a lawyer and not too much else.  What should I be asking aforementioned lawyer in order to minimize insurance premium hikes?	Yes
A pedestrian island on a very heavy and busy area of Arlington, tx (Collins and Abrams) is protruding  into the lane and during heavy rains is in seeable. I was driving past the area and was unable to see the curb. My right tire hit the curb causing a blowout of the tire, I was able to maintain control and the tire held up for the mile I had to drive to get home.   Is there any legal recourse to the city I have since this curb is so far into the lane and is not clearly marked?	Yes
[TX] I was driving in the left lane of traffic on highway 361 preparing to pass another car that was 1000 feet in front of me, I realize that I might have gotten into the left lane a little early but they were going slow and we were the only people on the road. As I'm coming up on the car I see a black SUV sitting in the median facing the wrong way and I slow down kind of panicking that they're going to pull out in front of me. I do not change lanes because I'm watching the SUV to see if they pull out in front of me. As I pass the SUV they turn their lights on and I realize it was a cop, I was not speeding at any point. I get pulled over and issued a ticket for driving in the left lane, the cop will not listen to the fact that I was preparing to pass a car until I saw him facing the wrong way in traffic and slowed down. What are my chances of fighting this? It's a $500 ticket and as I wasn't impeding the flow of traffic I don't really see what I did to warrant a ticket. The law is so ambiguous, and there is not place (that I can tell) that tells you when you can officially get into the left lane to pass.    Also worth noting, I have a Conceal Carry License but I've never owned a gun or really had anything to do with guns. Got it because my boyfriend is in the military and wanted me to get a gun and I kinda forgot I had it. The cop ran my DL and saw that I have a CCL and came back screaming that he could arrest me for not giving him my CCL with my DL but when I took the class they told is that we're under no obligation to give the officer our CLL granted we do not have a gun on our person, which I most definitely did not. I would really like to file an official complaint for this because as far as I can tell, he's just making up law to suit himself but I want to be sure that this is correct before I raise hell at the police station.	Yes
Hey! Long time lurker, first time poster.  I got pulled over tonight because my headlight and tag light are out. Fair enough, I knew my headlight was out and my fiancé was planning to help me fix it tomorrow. Unfortunately, I forgot my wallet at home this morning, so I didn’t have my license on me.  The officer cited me for not having my license because it’s “easy to deal with” - however, I’m a teacher and I’m at work all of the times the courthouse is open. I’d have to take a full day off (nigh impossible during testing season) to go to the courthouse and pay 10 dollars.   I don’t want my kids to miss any instruction - my days are thoroughly planned to make sure they get what they need before the state tests. If I just pay the 116 dollar fine without going to the courthouse, does it look any different on my record?	Yes
I know this is small potatoes for all y'all, but I'm curious.   I got a parking ticket that I deserved by forgetting to move my truck off the street during street sweeper night. I attempted to pay it tonight, and both the online and phone methods of doing so say it's been dismissed and I owe nothing. No payment was ever made on the citation.  My 13 year old was looking at the printed ticket w me tonight and noticed that the cop indicated our vehicle was a Chevy (it's not) - but all other info on the ticket is correct. Is that enough to dismiss a parking ticket in Ramsey County? Everything I've read says it shouldn't be. Did I just get lucky? Thanks.	Yes
I just got a phone call from my girlfriend who is currently moving into her apartment with her mother in New York, all the information I have about the situation is through her and the accuracy may not be 100%. She received a phone call from her brother (16), who does not have his license, took their mother's car out on the highway, with multiple passengers, and caused a crash which totaled both his car and another.   From my understanding he is at fault, but all parties involved survived the accident, though I do not know the extent of any injuries.   What should they do? Would it be considered theft that he took the car without permission or supervision, with the owner halfway across the country? Depending on their insurance provider could their mother maintain her rates due to the accident being caused by someone not covered by insurance?  With a single mother putting one child through college and another going into his final year of high school, they don't have much money-mainly what is the best way to minimize financial damages? Thank you.	Yes
I try to make this quick. My friend's car got towed, she called both the police and the local tow agencies and could not find it. Reported it stolen. And about a month later got a letter from the tow company saying that they were in possession of her vehicle. They are now trying to charge for almost $2,000 in fees for a vehicle that's not even worth that much... Anything we can do? The timeline is towed early June. Called the day after to find it, told by police and tow company they didn't have. Received a letter June 23. Called to recover vehicle, and hit with fees dating back to early June.   Located in Southern california fyi.	Yes
I received a ticket with court appearance over the weekend for Driving While Suspended. I was 81 days into serving a 90 day suspension for a DUI.   There was a cop on the road, ran my plates and I was pulled over. The rest is history, I'm a complete idiot and I regret driving. I was 9 days away from getting my license reinstated.   Wanted to know if r/legaladvice can give me any guidance	Yes
Hello all  Tomorrow I have a pre trial conference for a headlight that was out. I was given a fix it ticket but apparently it was not received in time. ( I have a credit card statement of an auto zone visit the day it was fixed). This is not my car and I was physically un able to fix it or sign the ticket myself. It was fixed in due time tho. I am bringing a copy of the statement and a video of the headlights working.  Would this be enough to possibly get it thrown out? If I'm offered a deal should I just take it?  Thanks for the help.	Yes
Okay let me start this off by saying I was 100% in the wrong. I could have gotten a reckless driving ticket but didn't. Instead I got a Speeding Ticket (2 Points/$160) and a Failure to Observe Lanes Ticket (2 Points/$165). This was my first offense and I know I'm in the wrong. My question is it worth it to go to court to try and reduce/remove the points or should I just take the blessing of not getting a reckless driving ticket/losing my license. Thank you in advance.	Yes
New York STATE. So I purchased a vehicle on may 2, the temporary tags expired on the 31st. I called the dealer and notified him that the temp registration had expired and he said that he would extend the date in his computer, I spoke with him last week about not recieving any registration from the dmv still and he said that he would extend it again until we know whats going on. Well today I got pulled over and given a ticket for expired registration that expired on the original date of may 31st. I called the dealer and he said to email him the ticket and that he would get it taken care of. Not sure what I am supposed to do in this situation, is this something the dealer can take care of or am I going to be forced to go to court for this?	Yes
Around 11 pm last night I was caught going 100 on a 55 mph highway (way too fast, I know), given a misdemeanor and a court date.   I've never been to court before and I am freaking out. I have a job and commute to two colleges, so more than anything I'm afraid of having my license suspended for 30 days.   What are the chances of a suspended license and should I get an lawyer?   Thank you for the help.	Yes
Hey all,  Did not see this in the list of threads or with a search, but forgive me if something similar has been posted....  I was recently involved in an at-fault accident when I backed into a coworker's car. I am hoping to resolve this out-of-pocket and want to ensure that I am taking the correct steps. Below is some information:  * State: MA * Total damage to other car: $1,500 (dent in BMW so bit more $$$ than I hoped for) * Other party was not in the vehicle * Insurance deductible is $500 but filing a claim will add 3 pts to my driving record, which already includes a speeding ticket from last May  Ultimately I am worried about my rates going up and I would rather take the hit to my bank account now than deal with the headache on my insurance record.   After doing some research, I am looking to have my coworker sign a *Release of Claims* and was hoping someone might be able to tell me if this is the correct step to take to close out the incident once payment is given. If so, is there a particularly well-formatted template to use, and does it vary by state?  Also, if there is anything else that I should be getting in terms of documentation please feel free to suggest. I do not expect the other party to swindle me into more money, but I also would rather be safe than sorry. I appreciate the help!   **TL;DR** - Had an at-fault car accident, will pay out-of-pocket but want to ensure that the incident is finalized with a Release of Claims.	Yes
I was in a collision on my motorcycle a few weeks ago and the police report stated that the other party was at fault. My left index finger was broken and I needed surgery because there was a piece broken off in my middle joint. The surgery went well but i may not be able to fully flex or extend my left index finger for the rest of my life. Therein lies the main issue: I'm a professional musician and my surgeon says I may not be able to play again. I'll also have to take 6-8 weeks off of work due to my injuries. So with her being fully at fault, should I get a lawyer?	Yes
I live in an apartment complex in Ohio and my car was towed on the grounds that it is a private lot and that a permit is needed to park there (which I have, it hangs from the rear view mirror like it should be) you should also know that there was a no parking sign nearby (which I didn't notice at the time, just worked a 13 hour shift, I was tired) but that wasn't the reason for being towed on the report (I called the city and asked, it was just because of the supposed lack of permit). Now, there have been several issues with my apt complex before where they have changed things to fine people more, screw people over, etc which is why I'm asking this question. According to ORC 4513.601 (A) The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied: (1) The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign, that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:  (I am not listing a-c, as they do not apply here)  (d) The telephone number and the address of the place from which a towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;  (e) A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of section 4505.101 of the Revised Code.  In order to comply with the requirements of division (A)(1) of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.  The no parking sign is not 18x24 inches, it does not provide the telephone number and address where the vehicle is located, it does not state that failure to recover vehicle can result in loss of title, and it has not been modified at all via stickers or addendum. Is this sign still legal? Is there any validity at all to it?	Yes
Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
"First time posting here, so please let me know if there's more info you need from me.   I'm 23, a NC resident, and just got my first speeding ticket ever in Virginia for going 76 in a 60mph zone. The charge was speeding, and the fine is $157 total.  I went to the North Carolina DMV website to look at what points I should expect on my license, and saw this:  ""Regardless of the number of points on your record, the NC Division of Motor Vehicles will automatically suspend your driving privileges if you're ticketed for offenses like: Speeding over the limit by 15 MPH while already driving faster than 55 MPH.""   That obviously applies to my circumstance, and now I'm not sure what to do and am frankly pretty panicked. I had been planning on just paying the ticket, thinking I would just have to deal with points on my license and increased insurance rates, but I absolutely can't get my license suspended--I am a graduate student with two jobs, and that's just not an option for me if it's at all avoidable.  Is my bet bet to go to my court date in VA? If so, what does that process look like, and what would I need to say/do to avoid getting my license suspended?  Is hiring a traffic lawyer a better option? What would this process look like, what results would I be able to expect from getting a lawyer?   Thanks in advance for any help or guidance anyone can offer."	Yes
I know, I know. We (my boyfriend and I)should have called the police. We took his information and thought that was enough. We called the police and they told us that since we both left there scene there is little we can do now. They informed us that if there is an agreement made on site it becomes a civil matter.  We have pictures of the damage, of him in the driver's seat of a car that doesn't belong to him without a license. We took his information but he didn't take ours.  It seems like this is a fairly common thing to do, just take the other person's information and charge them with the bill, I've done it before. There has to be something we can do in the case of him backing out of this verbal agreement. Any advice is appreciated.	Yes
I received a speeding ticket today driving 57 in a 35. I received the ticketed driving from Kentucky to Knoxville Tennessee. I was pulled over in Oneida Tennessee where the speed limit dropped from 55 to 35. The sign can not be seen until crossing over a hill, which gives you roughly 50 yards to slow down. Naturally, I did not see the sign and was pulled over immediately. I know that this was obviously a speed trap, characteristic of small towns on states borders, but I am extremely about this. Do I have any means of getting the case thrown out, and if so, what approach should I take?  I am 22, work a low paying job in a town 3 hours away.	Yes
My question involves a traffic ticket from the state of: Washington  Hey guys, seriously appreciate any advice here.   My car was parked in my apartment complex's lot and had a resident sticker in the windshield after I registered it with management 2 years earlier. I had left for about 2 months to take car of my father who had a stroke, I didn't let management know I was leaving, paid bills on time while away. Looks like 30 days after I had left they decided they wanted to give everyone assigned parking spots, and if you didn't move your car for painting within a specific date, they would tow you. Obviously didn't move my car cause I wasn't there so car got towed and sold at an auction. I understand it’s my fault for not letting management know I was leaving but I never received any phone calls, emails, or anything from them that my car would be towed, or that we needed to move our cars for the parking assignments. I did receive a letter in the mail from the tow company though, which I only saw 30 days later when I returned home.   I haven't had a chance to speak with management yet because I just got back.   This is over a $10k loss for me if I can’t be reimbursed for my car...  Reading around on google looks like I have to take it up with small claims court.   What do you guys think?  Any feedback is greatly appreciated!!!!	Yes
I got a ticket a month back for not stopping at a stop sign and driving 1-10 mph over the speed limit. I did not commit either of these. The information on the ticket in wrong. Although my licence information is correct, the police wrote down the wrong year, make, model, and license plate of the car. I went to court to fight the ticket but the police officer did not show up so the judge dismissed the ticket. I did not disclose to the court or police department that the ticket contained the wrong information. I received a letter in the mail saying the officer that did not show up to the informal hearing in front of the magistrate is appealing the ruling and that I am required to come to a formal hearing in front of a judge. What are the chances that the judge will rule in my favor? Does the fact that the ticket was originally dismissed influence the decision of the judge? What should I look out for during the formal hearing? I will hire a lawyer tomorrow.	Yes
Hi, I am not entirely sure where to post this but I have a question about insurance.  6 years ago when I was a drinking alcoholic (since in recovery, 4 years sober!) I got a DUI. My insurance rates have been high because of this. I was recently married and my mother suggested I get my car fully insured under my husbands name and the rate would go down. We called and it would, by about $2500 a year, even at completely full and comprehensive coverage.  But is this legal? Does the car technically have to be insured by the primary driver or is it different because we are married? The car is under my name, but we can always transfer it.  His agent said it should be fine but I feel like if it were that easy everyone would do it... Does anyone have any advice on this?	Yes
So i was out the other night with a couple friends and not so wisely decided to bang out a couple doughnuts in an empty parking lot. Shortly after a cop rolled up and wrote me up for reckless driving. I am not sure weather or not i should hire a lawyer to fight this and court or what the cost would be to do so. Any help would be great, -Ryan	Yes
"Hello all,  I read the FAQs and still had a brief question. As the title states, I'm a Wisconsin driver that got a speeding ticket in Georgia.   The ticket is for 20 over the posted limit on an interstate, which qualifies for the ""Super Speeder"" classification in GA, according to the cop. I was not driving a vehicle that I own. I've already learned my lesson and am prepared to deal with the consequences. I have 3 main questions here:  -WI DMV site says ""No points are assessed for convictions from other states, however, the conviction is entered on the Wisconsin driver record."" I already know about the DLC and NRVC (both of which WI is not a part of), but can anyone put into simple terms what this means, mainly in reference to insurance? If it means that my insurance may be able to see this and raise the rates, it may be something that I want to work to get reduced.  -When I go to the website listed to pay and enter the information, I can see the fee. However, it says nothing about the ""Super Speeder"" fee of [I read $200, but that could be incorrect]. It's not really clear whether the additional fee is something that I'll hear about after the fact, or if that's included. Can anyone clarify that by chance?  -Has anyone else from WI gotten an out of state speeding ticket that can comment on whether it was/wasn't worth taking time off from work to go to court in hopes of getting the charge reduced?  I'm leaning towards just paying everything and being done with it, but I want to be sure I'm not setting myself up for other consequences further down the line by doing so. Any *advice* is appreciated, and I fully understand that I am only seeking advice.  Thanks!"	Yes
My mom is 66, on disability for multiple sclerosis. She's been unable to work for about a decade. She has cataracts. She has neuropathy. She has 0 reaction time. She has had a fender bender on every single corner of her last car, which my brother then totaled. She also has no night vision. She also falls asleep all the time. ALMOST like like narcolepsy. It's mostly her overextending herself, but she will nod off driving or sleep in parking lots til she feels ok. She also has lymphedema in her legs which are swollen enough to impede driving. The last year she was driving she received 19 red light tickets.  She agreed not to drive. And the insurance paid for her car. Now she's bought a new one, about 6 months later. Our relationship is terrible. I hate her. But I want her licence taken away before she kills or cripples someone(s). I'm no contact with her, but my brother still tries and he cares about this a lot.  I've spoken with the DMV IN MY state, not very helpful.  Can i contact her insurance? Do I contact the police? Has this happened to anyone else?	Yes
This happened on Wednesday, I'm pretty much not injured, my motorcycle hasn't been towed to the shop yet, I don't know the damage figures (I just hope it won't be totaled, my dumbass 23 year old self didn't get GAP insurance)  According to Russ Brown (or at least someone from them) since I wasn't majorly injured, there's nothing they can really help me with. I haven't received a copy of the collision report by the police, either.   As for the accident itself, I was riding down the freeway, going about 20mph between lanes (HOV and fast lane) when a Toyota Camry that I was either about to pass or already passing, turned into the next lane(one of those, gotta get in that lane, theres space, quick turns without looking) and hit me, I went down. I only remember the impact, then rolling. Then 2 gracious men, helped me get from the middle of the freeway to the far right side, along with my bike. After they checked if I was ok of course, they also called the ambulance for me.    I did not rear end the Camry, all the damage is right behind her passenger side rear tire.   I'm just afraid I won't be able to get my motorcycle back, that motorcycle is all I really own and I don't know what to do.   I won't be able to go to work until it's fixed, Interviews are iffy, I'd have to borrow my parents truck but it's a salvaged truck that isn't working right a lot of the time. I commute from Fontana to LA, uber would be too expensive. Plus because of this I missed out on the last two days of my contract with an agency.   What can I even do? I'm just rambling at this point.	Yes
"The accident happened in Irvine, CA. I was giving my girlfriend a ride to work on my motorcycle in the far left lane before HOV. With the intent of using the HOV lane, I waited for a break in the yellow lines, hit the turn signals, looked over my shoulder and then mirror, saw that there were no vehicles in the HOV, and made the lane change. Maybe ~10ft from the point where I changed lanes, I heard another motorcycle's tires screeching (assuming he locked up his tires), and the rider going down in my rear mirror. Pulled over and did a police report. He and his bike suffered some rashes; neither my gf, my bike and I were harmed. I received a warning letter from the DMV saying that I will be receiving a point on my license from that accident for ""failing to notice (the rider) approaching from the left rear"".  I got a copy of the report today and found out that in his statement, he said he was ""driving (his motorcycle) on I-5 s/b splitting lanes between the HOV and #1 lane (far left)..."". Is it legal to be splitting lanes in between four solid yellow lines? If legal, what can I do next time to prevent a similar accident?"	Yes
What's the best way to fight the ticket?	Yes
A while back I (car driver) got into an accident with a bicyclist and had a police officer come and file a report. The police report pretty much stated that the biker was at fault (because he was biking in the opposite direction in the bike lane) and I filed a claim to my insurance company afterwards. My insurance company also said that he was 90% at fault for this accident and agreed to send me a check for my cars repair. The said they would send me a check for the total amount minus the deductible; meaning that I would have to still pay my deductible. My insurance company said they would reimburse my deductible if they were able to successfully pursue and obtain money from the biker but they said it was unlikely because he is not insured for this accident.  I feel like I shouldn't be paying the deductible if I'm not really at fault so what would be my best option here? Is my insurance company really not capable of obtaining money from the biker? Should I go to a small claims court? Should I take the loss and just pay my deductible?  Any information/advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.	Yes
"Bought a used car in Harris county, Houston, Texas, from a small car dealer at his residence.  Before purchasing the car, I did have a call out mechanic inspect the vehicle. After I had thoroughly inspected and driven the car.  Hours after purchasing the car, the IMA (Honda Civic Hybrid battery) and the catalytic converter are showing errors.  We have already paid $3,700 for the car cash in hand and owe him $400 for the cost of registration which was in the paperwork we signed. Also stating we would not sue and buying the vehicle in ""As is"" condition.  The seller states he can transfer the vehicle registration and that he does not need the vehicle for the vehicle inspection report.  I need a car as there is little public transport. What options do I have either for the mechanic or the seller to fix the problems with the car? Or is it possible to get my money back?"	Yes
"Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18.  - What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?  According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case. - Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?  So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
"So I received a parking citation at 12:30 AM for parking in a residential neighborhood without a permit. I'm guessing there were no pictures taken as it was pitch black out. The person who issued the ticket put the wrong license plate, and wrote that the VIN is ""not readable"". I checked the status of my ticket online and put in my actual license plate and nothing showed up, however I can access it with the citation number. Should I wait this out and hope for no further consequences or should I just pay it?"	Yes

I was driving home in my work truck when the brakes suddenly gave out. I have a feeling the brake line burst, but still waiting to hear back from the mechanic. I felt fine yesterday but today I'm feeling sore in my lower back and my neck. Is there any legal action I can take towards my company for the accident?	Yes
My father gave me an old car when I was 16-ish. Had different issues where I couldn't drive it. Father gave me a different car that was drivable and I signed the title back over to the one I had no use of. Now 10 years down the Rd my sister's moved my dad to a senior care center in Miami and his old house was foreclosed on by the bank and purchased by someone else. The new owner of the home reported several abandoned vehicles on the property to the police department. One of them being the one I signed over to my father but he never changed the title. The police department then contacted me to notify me. What should I do? They said my sister's refused to act on the other vehicles. I don't live near there and the one car isn't technically mine. I'm afraid of being fined or sued because the car is still in my name legally, but on the other hand if I do something to it, like sell or have it junked, I don't want it to turn into a possible theft situation from the perspective of my family). (My father isn't there mentally and my sister's don't care for me in the least).	Yes
I'm a college student in Florida and hit a parked car in my neighborhood while I myself was parking. I've only been driving for around a year now but have always been a safe driver. I immediately parked, went up close to asses the damage and then left a note on the dented backseat passenger door telling the driver to call me. So later in the day she texts me and is very understanding and even asks if I rather not get insurance involved. We both call our parents and I'm ready to go get a quote on the damage but she doesn't text me for 2 and half months so I'm thinking she's forgotten about the whole thing or gotten it fixed herself or something.  Now she's texted me back asking if we can get her car fixed by the weekend. Just looking at the price estimates for fixing dented doors + chipped paint looks like it'll be at least a grand, I really only have a 300$ limit right now so i'm kind of screwed. What would be the consequences if we got insurance involved? (It's my dad's insurance as the car is still under my father's ownership)  Thanks in advanced for helping the nervous college kid out	Yes
"Yesterday I received 3 notices of traffic tickets from Florence (Originally perpetrated in March) where I ""was driving within the limited traffic area without authorization"". Two infractions were within 40 minutes, and the other was 2 days later. I don't recall seeing signs, or being on a road that seemed like I shouldn't, but I don't speak Italian either!  I am an American citizen that was using a rental car. It's important to note that these notices seem to be from the city police directly, and not through the rental company.  All 3 notices are for 81 + 37 Euros for procedures. It ends up being $403 USD.  What are my options and what would you recommend?"	Yes
A teenager saw, but I don't think he saw my plates let alone cared enough to remember them somehow. I don't know what the neighbors are like there but the car looked new (at most five years old), and seems like the neighbors might know one another. What legal repurcussions do I face if ever caught? Going forward what would be my ideal actions? I don't think I can ask my friend about this.	Yes
I am not from Virginia but I was pulled over while moving from Philadelphia to Atlanta. The officer said I was clocked at going 93 in a 70 zone so it was automatically a reckless driving charge and I had to appear in court. I didn't realize at the time but apparently Virginia is the worst place to get pulled over for speeding. This is my first offense, Ive never even gotten a ticket before. So my question is how do I prepare for this? Do I need to hire a lawyer? I do not have a lot of money but law offices have been sending me letters saying they could represent me. I looked online and apparently you can do jail time for this and I'm pretty young and don't want this to ruin my life. I tried to do some research but it seemed like a lot of lawyers trying to scare people into hiring them and it worked a little on me. Pretty much I have no idea what to do please help!	Yes
"I live in an area of Los Angeles where parking is extremely tight and limited. My complex has 100+ units and 10 private parking spots. It looks like some people have taken to spray painting red zones to create additional parking spots that look like other zones which are painted white. In addition, I was operating under the belief that your front tire has to be within the boundaries of a parking spot when a red zone is involved.  I received a ticket for an LAMC 80.56E4 violation, which reads:  &gt; 4.   No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle at any time in any red ""No Stopping"" zone or portion of street posted with signs reading ""No Stopping Any Time"", except that a bus may stop in such zone or portion of street marked or sign posted as a bus stop.  Such ""No Stopping"" zones shall be in effect during all times unless limited to specified hours and/or days by posted signs.

Here was how I was parked. I was right up against the boundary because the car behind me created very little space in the front while they had plenty in the back to get out.

"Hi!  Need a little bit of advice here. I was living with 3 girls for 1.5 years. All of our names are on the signed lease and for the first 9 months there was little to no conflict. After a couple incidents with one of the roommates we quickly became a 2 v 1 situation in which we did not like the 3rd girl (she honestly showed some pathological liar tendencies and tries to get money for everything in prior incidents but I didn't become alarmed right away). We finally arrive to the last 2 months of our lease and ended up purchasing a home. Back story of rent/bills was that I would pay rent/cable prior to the 1st of every month, and this girl would pay for electricity and gas. We would deduct her amount and she would Venmo me the remaining (usually around $515-$580 per month) and the other roommate would pay us accordingly. The last month she decided to move out 25 days early. I asked her repeatedly for rent money and at first she said after she paid her final utilities but then she stated on my 4th try of getting her to pay that she would not be paying rent or cable ($604 in total) and that we ""bullied"" her and ruined her table and grill. The table has normal wear and tear from pictures she sent and the grill was never cleaned by her either. I am wondering my chances in small claims. To me it's a simple her name is on a signed document and I can prove she repeatedly paid me every month for the past 1.5 years until this date. I have texts showing she was a bully to me in all actuality as well as agreed upon payments for each month. Would this be enough to get my money out of her? I am only seeking the $566 for her portion of rent since this is the only payment in writing between the 3 of us. I also have full support from the 3rd roommate and additional people that have witnessed this girls behavior. Just want to understand my chances before I waste time. I think she has money saved but its feeling the pain of buying her first home and decided she would just with hold money. Feel free to ask any additional questions!"	No
So, my girlfriend's ex was abusive and manipulative both emotionally and monetarily.  He is now sending her unsolicited text messages and generally harassing her.  She also needs to pick up some things from his apartment.  What is the best course of action for her?	No
Paid application fee, first month's rent, security deposit/fee/nonrefundable. Do I still have to accept the unit? First one was on a great floor at the front of the complex. This one isn't and at the back and pretty shady. They are sending over a new contract with the new unit #. At what point is my money gone if I don't want this unit if I can break the lease?	No
My wife's ex-husband took out a $20k student loan in her name back when they were married. It was a physically and verbally abusive relationship so she did nothing about it at the time or during the divorce and since the loans were under her name he said he was not responsible for any of them. Fast forward to current time, I'm helping her pay them off but sick of it and wondering if there's any legal ground for us to sue to make him pay it. He opened them up under her name but they were married at the time so in my mind should both be responsible, at worst case for half of it. Any advice you guys can give would be super helpful, or just let me know if I'm boned here and can't do anything about it.	No
My wife and I are applying for sponsorship. I am a Canadian citizen and she is not but would like to come live in Canada with me when I move back.   I am 27 and she is 24. She is a CNA and nursing student while I am a tenure-track professor. The issue is, that when she was 19 she was charged with shoplifting a shirt from the mall. She went to court, was given a misdemeanor, and had to pay a fine. Can I still sponsor her given the situation?   She has not reoffended since and does not have any other charges on her record.	No
Santa Fe, New Mexico:  My lease ended in May 2017, and I have been expecting my $400 security deposit since then. I recently contacted my old landlord and asked why I hadn't received the deposit, and she started by lying about giving me $200 in cash, which I quickly dismissed. She then said she would be making large deductions based on repairs done to the heater (which was never fully operational during my tenancy), and fees related to a cleaning requested by the tenant who moved in after me. I asked for an itemized invoice of the charges, and received a scribbled mess that added up to $200 in deductions from my deposit, along with a check for $200. This is the first invoice and check I've received since May, long after the 30 days I believe landlords have to deliver either.   Do I have grounds to dismiss the deductions and receive my deposit in full?	No
"here is an update to anyone who is curious link (here) [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6mckz3/girlfriend_had_her_butt_grabed_by_a_mcdonalds/]. So today we filed a police report, the officer said that they would not go for any sexual battery type charge but rather a class C misdemeanor assault charge. That is honestly fine by me, i just want some form of punishment for ""Tyrone"" so he knows that it's not okay to grab women who don't want to be grabbed. They said they would review the tapes and im hoping to god that the cameras caught it, there is two cameras in the lobby but this was over at the drink station so they might not be able to see the physical contact that occurred. I also called the Mcdonalds corporate office and the lady seemed very understanding and polite and said that her supervisor would launch an investigation and review the tapes and contact the Franchise owner immediately. I told her that the police were already investigating and all that happened. We have no interest in sueing mcdonalds or the guy who did this, i just want him to maybe get a fine and lose his job.With that said i am tempted to call the DA's office once he is charged with the Class C assult to see if they could possibly bump it up to class B or something. Feel free to give any advice or ask questions, once this is all over i will post a final update."	No
"SWIM is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this."	No
"A young friend of mine is 19 and has been bouncing around from house to house since she was around 17 because of her father and brother abusing her. She's constantly worried he'll find her and force her to come back like he did when she'd run away as a young teen. I've let her know that as she's an adult, he now has very little legal control over her. That was a relief to her, but her big fear now is he'll find a way to change that. I know that an adult can take the actions to legally have ""custody"" so to speak and control over another adult if that adult is mentally disabled and unable to make their own decisions and care for themselves. That's where the problem is. Part of his abuse was convincing everyone she's crazy. He would talk to her friends behind her back to tell them she's crazy, talk to all the adults she might report to with a sob story about her manipulative nature and tendency to lie, even talk to the therapist he got her after each session and tell her ""his"" side of everything and how it ""really"" happened. He had her on tons of meds with tons of diagnoses and going to a bunch of doctors. He covered it up when her brother sexually abused her and told everyone she made it up/ asked him to do it. Bottom line, she's got a VERY small circle of people who believe that she's NOT completely unstable. Right now she's lives with her boyfriend and is safe. Her fear is that he's going to convince everyone that she's so unstable that she can't care for herself and needs him to still be her guardian even as an adult. Is this legally possible and if so what should she do? She currently has very little money as she's been on the run and does not have a license (her dad wouldn't let her get one - he told her years ago she was going blind and could never drive because of it and that one day she'd loose her vision entirely. She only discovered she isn't going blind a year ago after an eye doctors appointment as an adult)."	No
My boyfriend is the person in question. His parents had an extremely messy divorce 8 years ago; they have had joint custody (physical and legal) since then, with the kids switching houses every week. The legal battle has been going on all of the past 8 years. The parents are very hostile, and they hardly speak to each other.  His dad is a hedonistic, power-obsessed monster, and he's been consistently emotionally abusive. He is also an attorney, which is what worries me. His mom didn't work during the marriage, but she's since started her own business helping autistic children. She's not without her faults, but she truly cares and wants the best for him.  Recently, things have escalated greatly. My boyfriend is transgender, and he came out to his parents very recently. His mom is very supportive. His dad is not.  His mom had a major lung surgery earlier today in Boston (we live in North Carolina). My boyfriend is staying with his dad. His dad has taken away his phone, computer, and car, and he's not allowing him to leave the house.  I've talked to him on the house phone, and he's very scared and doesn't feel safe. He talked to his mom who said that they could fly him up to Boston tomorrow, but his dad has said he can't go. He doesn't want to live with his dad; he's repeatedly said that it's not healthy for him to be in that house anymore.  I'm seventeen years old. I have no idea what to do. First step is getting him to Boston. It's his mom's week, so I don't think his dad can stop him. Then there's the custody piece. This might have an easy answer, but I have no idea. Please any help is enormously appreciated; thank you so much.	No
Hi Reddit,  My wife and I have decided to separate due to unforeseen circumstances. (She left me for another fellow).  Anyways, I need help.   So I've spoken with a family lawyer and she gave me a bunch of papers for both of us to fill out regarding our financial situations. Including the last 3 years of tax returns.   We are going to both sign an unofficial separation agreement that I've drawn up. Once done I'll hand that to my lawyer to draw up an official agreement.   We are being surprisingly rational to each other and I want to know if this financial paper BS can be waived and we can just simply sign an official separation agreement and be on our ways.   We both think it's a waste of time and I was told once the official agreement was drawn up, she will still have to retain a lawyer of a different firm to explain it to her.   We just have the desire to end this as quickly and painlessly as possible.  Lawyers ain't cheap.   If you need more information let me know.   All responses are appreciated.	No
"The branch was closed. I called them while I was still at the ATM to try to get the solution going. She told me 10 business days and I'll just see the money posted. I went into the bank first thing next morning and they told me that they have nothing to do with the ATMs outside and if I did it inside, they could help me. (COOL BECAUSE EVERY TIME I DO, SOMEONE SAYS ""Hey, you know you can just do this at an ATM, right?"")   One week later, I called on Monday. There was no history of my situation AT ALL recorded. The problem has not been researched, so I was told it would be escalated and that the latest I'll see it posted if Friday. Hi. Tuesday. Turns out the escalation team needed the info on which ATM and the requested it from me VIA MAIL. I told EVERYONE I'VE TALKED TO (3 different teams of an associate&amp;manager) it. But the person putting it in my costumer notes FORGOT A FUCKING LETTER. I was even told at one point my check was shredded and I need to get a new one.  I guess what I'm looking for is.. there can't be ANY way that this is okay. How can they just take my check, shred it, and spit out a small receipt that says sorry with a costumer service number on it and tell me that I just have to get a new one a week later.  How is this okay? Do I have any options here because they've basically been forcing me to live without my food money for over two weeks and I can't believe that they have no re precautions"	No
The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	No
My mother-in-law is about to visit my wife and I for 3 days (Thursday night, leaving Sunday evening.)  We have strong reasons to believe that MiL's spouse will attempt to have her served for divorce, while she's staying with us.  (His motivations would likely be: (1) doesn't have to deal with her in the immediate aftermath, since she'll be 200 miles away (2) snubbing my wife and I for perceived past transgressions, and (3) MiL might be inclined to ask to stay with us, rather than return to a tension-filled situation at her domicile  (a request that my wife and I would unanimously deny.)  While we don't want to interfere with the court, we also don't want to be used as pawns in MiL's current-husband's game.  Asking her not to come is not an option that I am allowed to consider.  So I want to know where the legal limits are on how I can delay service until after we have returned her home.  * Are we allowed to lie to a process server, and claim that she is not present at our house, when she is? * If we decide to just put her up in a hotel room &amp; visit her there-- taking other precautions to not be followed-- can the court's process server just hand the documents over to another adult at my residence, and consider her properly served?	No
For example, a former 3 bedroom apartment is being rented to separate individuals for say $1800/each, and not to three roommates (or a family) who rent it together. I am not sure, but I believe this is illegal since non of the landlords are operating hotels but rental apartment buildings. So I guess my question is: is this now somehow legal and if not how to proceed to make landlord abide by the law?	No
My parents have just recently started the process of selling their home that they've owned for 30+ yrs. My grandfather owned the adjacent property in which their septic system lies. It was sold in the last year and now the current owner states that they cannot sell their home without first putting in a new septic system on their property. They've offered the guy a few thousand dollars to get around this extra work, but alas he is a major doucebag and likes to see the world burn. Do they have any legal rights to fight this?	No
"There's a local obstacle gym that we pay a monthly fee for our son to attend.  He's 11.  There are trainers on staff for structured play time as well as ""free play"" where the kids can do the various obstacles at their leisure.  During free play, the trainers are suppose to wander through the obstacles observing the kids and making sure no one gets hurt. During free play time, my son fell from about 10 feet up and landed on the safety mat.  The way he landed shattered his elbow and broke his arm in two places.  This injury required immediate surgery to correct.  He now has wires holding his elbow together.  Another surgery will be necessary in a few months to remove the wires because his bones need to be able to continue to grow.  We have insurance but have had to pay the co pay on two emergency room visits as well as the surgery and follow up doctors appointments.  I've contacted their insurance company but the rep has been infuriatingly difficult to get in touch with.  I've spoken to him once out of 7 attempts.  I've spoken to a local attorney but they declined to represent me.  I'm not looking for a million dollar payout, but would appreciate help with the expenses I've incurred.  What are my options?  Will it just be classified as an accident and I eat the cost and move on?  Do I contact my insurance company and let them fight it out with the other?  We payed a premium for an inside gym with the proper safety equipment and a dedicated staff.  Both failed in this situation.  Just looking for a solid direction to move forward in. Thanks for any advice in advance."	No
"I'll try to keep this short since as probably all marriage endings go, this is complicated.   My wife and i (of three years, together 9) have had problems for a while but I thought things were getting better. End of June we had a fight and she left to stay with her family in TN for ""space."" We talked every day and things were getting better. The 30th of July she came home. I thought things were good. Long story short she said she needed more time. She left August 2nd. I tried to talk and message but she was kind of distant. August 5th she told me there  was someone else. Cue start of drama.  Since then, I've tried to reconcile, now on to divorce. Now I just want this to be over as quickly as possible. There are no assets. We lived together in my mom's house at the time, so no house. No kids together. The only thing we shared was a car loan. She has the car in TN. The car is upside down on the loan so no value. All our credit cards are individual. We have health insurance under ACA but I'm paying the bill.   I packed her belongings and asked what she wanted of our shared things from a previous apartment. She said nothing except one of our TV's which is fine by me. She wants to trade the car in but its upside down and I'm the primary on the loan. Anything that happens with the car has to happen here and she and it are still in TN.  I tried to get some info for the lawyer, she stopped responding to texts the night before last. I texted her this morning and now she wont speak to me directly. Her new ""boyfriend"" responded in her place saying now they are hiring a lawyer as well and to not try to contact her again.   I thought I could get her to sign an Appearance, Entry, and Waiver so we could move this along fast and each be on with our lives. I have no idea what they expect to gain from making this more complicated. Like I said, there are no assets and we haven't been married long enough to warrant her really getting anything from me, besides the fact I don't really have anything to give her. Plus well, she's the one that cheated.   [TL;DR] Wife left for ""space"", cheated, divorce, now won't speak to even communicate what she wants out of divorce. There are no real assets and debts are individual. How does this work beyond just letting lawyers take time (equals money I don't have) to fight over stuff that's worthless? What can I expect from the process? Any insight or advice is appreciated."	No
The deed is still in my grandfathers name but he died 8 years ago and my grandmother took charge of the house. A few months ago  she passed away also. I lived with my grandmother all of this time and she never put in her will, nor my Grandfather, to pass the deed over to the child if they died(my Mom). We have been able to get money/estate and car transferred over to us.   my question is do we need a lawyer to transfer over the deed of the house? and if not where do we go? the clerk of courts? if any of you had to do this before, how did you handle it?  Thank you for taking time to look at this.	No
Hi all,  I've recently renewed my lease read over it several times and saw that the management increased the rent from what was previously discussed. They argued price includes utilities the lease however only said it included pest control. I told the entire office this(4 people) this and all of said that the total lease amount is all I'd pay. I was dumb, too trusting and signed the lease electronically. Today I got an email that said that my lease did not include any of the utilities including pest control.   Can I legally break the lease without financial penalty for them charging me a dollar a month for pest control when it was explicitly said in the lease that it was included?  I live in Florida.	No
So my friend is currently in a holding cell awaiting court at 1:30, she was caught with 3.7 grams of Molly, an ounce of shrooms, 3 ecastcy pills and under 30 grams of weed.

I work for a large big box retailer and have for over 10 years. I have an upper management position which is salaried. Prior to having the position I was a lower manager that was hourly. I was not allowed to take lunches on multiple occasions but expected to do “fake punches” so I didn’t get paid for that work. The only proof I have is that I can print them all out but there’s no way to show that I was required to do so. The same individual who did that was my HR at the time. He had since promoted just like I have meaning he is still my HR. Just a higher up HR. He has yelled at me and other employees, he laughed in my face and admitted to never reading a doctors note I gave him while I was at the end of my pregnancy, and he has an overall abusive personality. I recently found out from my boss that he stopped me from getting a promotion I was very qualified for and recommended for. I emailed even higher up leadership/hr with my concern almost 2 months ago. I received a reply stating that they took it very seriously and would be looking into it. They have not actually spoken with me and I feel I am getting pushed out. What is the best way to go about this? I have no physical proof that my boss admitted to the retaliation and he will side with the company in order to keep his job. Can a few texts showing his character, a letter I wrote him about his abusive behavior, and print outs of my punches get me anywhere? It doesn’t seem like enough to prove my claims despite them being very true.	No
Hi Everyone,  I'm looking for some advice because I am a first time home buyer and don't fully understand if I have any chance getting some help from the seller. We purchased a home six months ago and have made many repairs and upgrades based on the feedback from the home inspection. However, the home inspection did not uncover a few major issues.   Pool- large in ground pool in the back yard. We were unable to get the pool inspected before closing because it was covered for winter. We found out that the pool was not properly winterized when we attempted to open it and had to pay about $1500 for a new motor and pump. We were able to use the pool for a month before we started leaking water. Cost of new liner and new inground stairs lowest quote we received was $6250.   Roof- leaking from around a sewer gas outlet pipe caused wood rot in a section of the roof. From the inside of the attic we can see shingles in the area. This wasn't caught on the home inspection because the damage was behind a plastic sheet vent stapled to the inside of the roof. The skylight is also leaking due to flashing issues. Quoted estimate for repair $2600.   As I mentioned, these were not caught during the home inspection and the seller did not mention them on the seller disclosure. The seller had not been living in the house for the past 8 years; rented it to a family member.   Is there any possibility that we can work with the seller to help with these repairs or are we on our own? I was thinking about sending them an email explaining this but I am hesitant that I could say something that could ruin our chances in court (if that's even an option).  Thank you in advance!	No
Since the failing health and death of my great grandma, my family has been very divided and communication has been spilt between my  grandma and uncle on one side and my mom on the other. My uncle is the executor of the will and my mom does not know if he has executed the will. She is also afraid that the will may be altered to the benefit of my uncle and grandma.  Is there anyway to check to see if he has already started to execute the will through probate court? My mom is unsure if it is apathy or devious motives that he has not executed the will or communicated with her. How can she approach the situation legally to make sure the will is executed so that this ugly situation can be resolved and moved on from?	No
I am starting a business with my friend who currently is renting a place. He already mentioned to the owner that he will start-up a business at the place and the owner was hesitant at first but then agreed after.  Now they have a contract of lease.  Here comes my problem. I am the one who will be managing the business and It'll be registered to my name as the sole proprietor. I need a contract of lease to get my necessary permit. I did some research and I found out that I could be a sublet or sublessee.  However in the Article 17 of the contract states:  17. ASSIGNMENT OF LEASE: The LESSEE will not use or occupy the Leased Premises for any other purpose that are herein provided for and will not assign or transfer this lease or sublet any part of the premises to any other person, firm or corporation without the prior written notice of the LESSOR.  As stated we need to have a written notice of the lessor so I could be a sublet. Now it's kinda hard to talk to the lessor and he seems a bit lazy on creating such documents so he might not agree. So what I'll do is I will create the written notice for him allowing me to be a sublet so that it will not create hassle on him since he will just sign.  Btw the business I am starting is an Internet Cafe if that's relevant.  Thank you!!	No
"Location: South Carolina  Okay, to understand what's happening, you need to know a little bit about my living situation. So here it goes;  I'm 20 years old and live with my parents - two women who I'll be referring to them as Ma (Step Parent) and Mum (Bio) respectively. We've lived in this house for years, it'll be six years next Spring. Anyways, when we began renting this house, we set up all the necessary payments with various companies - Electric, Water &amp; Sewer, Trash, ect. - we ever asked all of these companies if their was ANY extra steps or processes we had to go through to get their services and they all said no, more specifically Water &amp; Sewer said something along the lines of ""No, ma'am your water and sewer is all ready to go"". We confirmed with our Landlord and he even said that everything was good to go.  Anyways, almost 6 years down the line, my Ma gets a call (in the middle of her workday), and is told that if we don't start an account with them TODAY that they will shut down our sewer services. Before today this company has NEVER contacted us - not through calls, emails, or mail. So because they close at four - which is ridiculous, by the way - Ma has to leave work two days earlier, which she get in trouble for, and has to rush to get all these documents that the sewer company claims they need to start an account.  As she's getting everything together, she calls the Sewer company several different times (six to be exact) to confirm what she needs and they tell her this; 100$ Account start-up fee, a signed copy of the lease, proof of residency, and an ID. However on her last call into the company, as the girl goes to tell Ma that she's got everything, my Ma hears in the background ""GIRL, that's not all she needs. She needs to pay the last two years worth of service!"" from the girl's boss.  When my Ma went into the Sewer company to start the account and pay the fee, they told her that they can legally charge us the past two years of service even though they never once told us that we needed to pay them or start an account with them. We can't afford to pay that, however when we told the Sewer company that, they told us that they'll just split up the full six years charge on our sewer bill until it's eventually paid off.  We have never had to contact this sewer company before, in fact any time we've ever had problems with our sewer, we've always called the water company and they've been the ones to fix it. The sewer company has had our house listed as ""VACANT"" in their systems for almost seven years and just never bothered to actually shut off the sewer system to the vacant house - which the girl on the phone admitted was the company's fault since their employees never shut it off.   And that's not all, we my Mum called the water company to ask them if this a legitimate company trying to charge them, the lady speaking with her told her that we weren't the only ones this was happening to. Apparently a lot of people are having this done to them by this Sewer company.  My question is; Can they legally force us to pay for those six years when THEY were the ones who screwed up? Especially when it's on such a large scale AND the company admitted it was their own fault?"	No
I'm married to someone with a phd, 2 Masters degrees, and who also is a CPA candidate. She refuses to look for work or work. She doesn't do anything at home either in terms of taking care of the home or taking care of me.      In a divorce I'd have to give her half which basically would leave us both with not enough to live on. We have a mortgage and debt.      I want to divorce her and her get a job so I don't have to pay forever. I made it clear to her from the beginning that she needed to contribute.      How can I get the court to force her to get a job?	No
I rent a room/bathroom in company housing. I have a month-to-month rental agreement which specifies the room I'm staying in, and indicates that they must give 30-days notice to terminate the agreement (unless I fail to pay rent, in which case 14-days).  In a couple weeks, my company is having a big meeting with people from other offices, and needs to provide housing for these people. I've been informed that they want me to move to a smaller room, so they can provide my room for someone. I have one week to move. It's a hassle, as all my belongings are here, and I'd have to make a project of moving twice in as many weeks.  I believe they are not legally required to force me to leave, but I'm concerned that they could terminate my housing contract (or my employment) if I refused. I'm not sure what to do.  My state is one-party consent for recording, so I'm considering recording any future talk I have about this.	No
"About a year ago there was a fire at the house I rented. I smoke and I was honest with the fire department when they asked. The damage was mainly on the facade of the home with minimal damages inside- just mild smoke damage in one room. The neighbor reported hearing an ""explosion"" before noticing the fire outside. I was in the other part of the house when the fire started and I heard what I assumed was someone knocking on the door. When I went to open the door, my porch was on fire.  I did not have rental insurance. I had never rented before and I was not aware there was such a thing. Please do not tell me how stupid I am for not having insurance. I even asked my parents at one point in the moving process what to do if the area flooded (it is an area that floods every few years) and they said the homeowner's insurance covered my loss. I have since moved and I have rental insurance in my current place.  Anyway, I just checked my mail and there is a collections bill in the amount of almost $15,000. The bill says I was found responsible for the fire and that I need to pay the bill in full, immediately. I am a college student working 20 hours a week making barely enough to cover rent and food. I have no way to pay this and no way to afford a lawyer. My family isn't able to help me out either.   After the fire the person I rented from had me evicted to terminate my lease and stated the reason for eviction as I refused to give her back the property when she requested. This wasn't true, as the eviction was filed the day after the fire and I was staying with friends. It's not relevant, but I was never informed of anything that would cause me to be held responsible for the fire. I never spoke with anyone and I never stated I caused the fire. A fire fighter asked me what happened, I told him I was in the other side of the house when I heard someone knocking at the door and when I opened the door I saw flames and called 911. He then asked if I was using a grill or other source of fire and I said no. Then he asked if I smoked. I said I did.   I don't know what, if anything I can do at this point. It seems like there has already been a judgement against me even though I was never informed of it.   What are my options here?"	No
"Hi r/legaladvice,   This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.   I'm gathering preliminary sources and images for a book idea that I have. This book would consist mainly of images, illustrations, and hand-drawings that _mostly_ come by way of the Library of Congress or government agencies. The Library of Congress states that the government works hosted on their site *""are also available for worldwide use and reuse under CC0 1.0 Universal.""* However, they also state *""you should determine for yourself whether or not an item is protected by copyright or in the public domain, and then satisfy any copyright or use restrictions when publishing or distributing materials from our collections.""*   My concern is that second snippet.   - How can I verify that a work is truly in the public domain (or equivalent license)?    - If I do publish an image that I find out is not in the public domain after publication, what options do I (and the copyright holder) have?    - What sites or services can you recommend that will ensure I only use works that are in the public domain?   Thanks for any and all information."	No
"Is there anything I could do if someone repetitively ignores a prominently placed ""No Solicitation"" sign? I have a smart door bell (camera/mic/speaker) and have asked the person putting it on to not put it in the future. I have even called the business and spoke with managers/owners and requested they stop putting flyers on my door.  I travel for work, upwards of 3 weeks at a time, and I know advertisements at the front door is a sign to thieves that no one is home. My previous neighbor used to trash them for me however they have since moved and the new neighbors arent too friendly.   Could I add a sign that say violator contact information will be entered on junk mailing/telemarketer contact lists?"	No
He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.   He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there.   Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday.   What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.   TL:DR; Will trying for a green card marriage as a US citizen hurt the fact that I haven't been working legally (according to the IRS)?	No
How can I be treated as if I'm on probation, have to report every 2 weeks, and take random drug tests, If I haven't even been convicted of a crime or sentenced probation?  Also does an adac assessment count as a drug test? My probation officer said in court under oath that I received and failed a drug test, when in fact I've never received one and could have passed one at any point. When I asked him about it he said that since I said I had smoked weed in my adac assessment it's the same thing. I call bullshit. If he commited perjury by saying I failed a drug test, I'd really need/like to know.	No
To start ... this isn't easy. It took me several days to gather the nerves to post this... please be forgiving. I'm a stupid teenager...   In October of 2016 I met a very friendly foreign exchange student. She came from southern Beijing and we really hit it off. She had never had a long term relationship and we dated until January. I was her first boyfriend, and it was her first year in America. We basically met the week she arrived. Eventually we broke up she was mean at times and it was hard for me to keep going. By march I had to go to the hospital. It was later said I had hepatitis b.   This girl comes from a region of China where many people are born with or contract this disease at a young age. They may be immune to its affects but they are carriers themselves. I've tried to hold many conversations with this person and she has stated that there is nothing wrong with her and that I was sick with strep most likely .... she's not the brightest. I still have her on Snapchat. Ever since I broke up with her she will snap herself with other presumably lovers. To spite me.   I know she's having sex, and I know she's most likely spreading disease. Is there anything I can do to stop her? I truly believe she is harming society.	No
Edit: Please read the entire thing before passing judgement  Hello, yesterday I was arrested for child endangerment because I took the keys out of the vehicle so we could stop arguing and to make sure I didn't go to jail for domestic abuse. (I was really pissed, it's a long story) yes, it was hot, but my wife was in the vehicle supervising my son. There was no harm to my son, this all happened in 5 minutes give or take. I got back in the vehicle, and offered her the keys, she told me to get out, so I got back out, and was then arrested for child endangerment. I looked at what the statutes are and my son was never unsupervised, and wasn't hurt in any way. (Less than 5 minutes in a vehicle, the AC had been going for a while, and at any time my wife could have taken my son out of the car) and I'm curious why I was arrested?	No
W.V.  The cops called me completely out of the blue, saying that my ex-girlfriend is wanting to press charges for phone harassment. I leased a vehicle for her before we split and she stiffed me on the bill. I did try to contact her a few times about the bill (nothing heated) but eventually gave up.  The cops want me to bring my cellphone in so they can hook it up to their comp and get all the data off of it. What should I do?  Also, what data are they going to get? I don't want them having access to all of my conversations on all platforms and stuff. I also hear they can get all keystrokes that have ever been typed on your phone, which would give them my passwords.  The cop told me she didn't have much, but I'm assuming they tell everyone that just to get their phone.	No
Hey guys.   I'm hoping to get steered in the right direction. I love in CO. I signed a lease with a guy but initially didn't qualify based on income so I had a cosigner. Now, with three months on the lease, I've had to move cities to attend school and have leases overlapping by three months. I found out he's trying to move his gf in after I leave and have them split his half of rent and still make me pay for my full half. Our lease states non residents cannot stay for more than 16 days (and that's not even consecutive). He's threatening if I don't pay hell screw over my cosigner. What should I do?	No
"Hi everyone, thank you in advance for any help you can provide.  My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.  She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was ""acting like a slut"" and ""dressing inappropriately"" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent ""promiscuity"". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.  I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because ""[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.""  I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a ""you're starting high school"" gift, and thought it best to wait.  I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again. I'm so angry right now I cannot think straight, and she's taking a nap. What do I need to do? Who do I need to call?"	No
"I live in Seattle Wa.  Our current landlord has a few units but is a pretty small rentor.  She says she is evicting us to do construction on the unit.  She now is asking for more money for our already paid last month rent.  When we started living here 6 years ago the rent was 2,050.  It has gone up to 2,500.  We had a lease for the first year, but were month to month afterwards.  She is asking for the difference.  The contract seems pretty clear to me.  The rent section in the contract states 'The Lessor acknowledges reciept of xxxx as the first and last mont's rent.""  There is no extra text~ [heres the part of the contract](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/186713854972002304/343217158169296896/rent_reddit.jpg)  Every rent increase has come with fair written warning, but no signiture or mention of increased deposit or last month.  I got a text a few days ago mentioning she wants the 450 dollar difference this month.  I really don't want to give her the money, and feel we already came to a written agreement about the matter.  THe information online is somewhat conflicting, and/or somewhat not local.  I have failed to get a hold of the Tennants Union durring there hours (I tried 30+ times durring hours this week, they must be so overworked).  My one lawyer friend isnt involved in anything like this and was nervous about commenting.  The fifth is tommorow (rents due) and im lost on where to turn. Can anyone illuminate me on if this kind of thing?"	No
I rent an ensuite in the attic of a student house In the UK. It was discovered the shower was leaking, the landlords 'fixed it', however forgot to reattach any of the pipes. This meant that evening when I used it water went through the floor and the carpet soaked up a lot.  A few days ago I was vacuuming the room (I usually use a car vacuum as its smaller and easier to carry up the stairs) with a Dyson and where it's more powerful, the part of carpet that got soaked (I did tell them about the damage) has unraveled in about a 2 cm by 10 cm patch. As it was damaged through vacuuming will I be liable for the damage? Thank you!	No
So in my lease for an apartment, there was a clause that stated if I didn't check out after my lease ends, they would apply a 300$ holdover fee per day. However, I vacated the apartment a week before the lease end date, and was unaware of any check out procedures. 1 day after the lease ended, I received a call telling me that I had a check-out procedure I needed to follow. I was not technically living in the home, and everything was vacated and ready to lease to the next tenant. Is there any way I can fight this fee?	No
"My sister M is currently 13. Earlier this year, she started self harming and one of her friends reported it to the school. M talked to a school counselor and confessed that she had been molested as a child by one of my cousins. The counselor then shared this information with my family (and the police I assume? Aren't school counselors mandated reporters?). None of us had even suspected a thing and it was horrible for pretty much everyone in my immediate family (no one outside my parents and siblings knew or even suspected). Now here's the part where I want legal advice:  My sister M was 7 when my 16 year old cousin molested her on 3 different occasions. She is now 13, like I said. Even if M does decide she wants to press charges (and I don't think she is currently in a place to feel comfortable doing so), is there like any chance in hell that something will come of it? The cousin who molested her was a minor at the time, no one witnessed it, and while I and my family of course believe M, it happened 6 years ago so I'm afraid there's not any ""proof."" Note: this cousin joined the military out of high school and we have not seen him in years. Does being in the military affect this at all, if charges were to be brought against him? I'm mostly terrified that he will be able to hurt (or has already hurt) other children and, of course, I also want him to rot in hell/jail for what he did to my sister. Pressing charges is ultimately going to be M's decision (with support from her therapist and all of us), but what are the odds that it's even worth our time (ie, will actually go somewhere legally) and her possibly having to see him again in court to press charges?"	No
A friends grandmother has split her will among her four children. However, her daughter (my friends mother) died before she did. By this point the grandmother was senile and could no longer change her will so she died with her will unchanged. My friend would like to know whether she inherits the money willed to her mother or the remaining three children split the money between them.   Thank you for your help	No
My grandmother is currently in the struggle of becoming the new executor of her family's property. The property was left to all five of her siblings, only three remain alive. This is not the main issue here however. While she has been working to get the situation resolved, there has been a man living on the property taking care of it as a favor to her now deceased sister's daughter. My grandmother does not live in the state anymore so she can not live on the property herself.   Ive heard that after 7 years of living on a property in California, a squatter can legally claim ownership of the property. Is this true? From what I've gathered from my grandparents (they are getting old and hard to talk to) he has been living there for 5 years now almost. What can she do to remove said squatter? What can be done to get someone to take care of the property without them claiming it?	No
I signed a lease with my Owner. It's a 4 bedroom with 3 other girls. However, a few months later a medical emergency came up and Im no longer able to move into the apartment. The owner stated that I can find someone to take over my lease, as stated in the housing agreement. The apartment has 3 other girls, so I tried to find a girl to take over my lease. However, a guy responded to my ad and said he would take over my lease. I didnt know he was a guy at the time, but he still completed an application with the company. It doesnt state in the housing agreement that it has to be the same gender. I emailed the owner to ask for clarification. If they say, that it cannot be transferred due to his gender, is that illegal. In the housing agreement under Subletting it doesn't state anything about the gender of the person. Only the fee that must be paid after the termination letter is sent. Am I good to go or...?	No
So, this is about my grandfather in New Jersey. about two years ago, we were browsing on amazon when we found something strange. A book my grandfather had published... kind of. You see, he was going to run a business a few years ago republishing old books, however the initial cost proved to high so the idea was shelved. that said, before he stopped, he sent one of those books to the PoD service lightningsource to do a small run of a few test copies (iirc, the count numbered less than 10). so, imagine our supprise to find this: https://www.amazon.com/New-Yorks-Awful-Steamboat-Horror/dp/097150590X on amazon one day.  Out of curiosity, I ordered it, and the book that arrived was a perfect match to the test-print he had. somehow, it had gotten printed and sold without his knowledge. Its been two years since then (and who knows when they started and stopped printing the thing), yet even now copies are floating around. Amazon was very unhelpful as we couldn't find a good way to contact somebody outside the customer service department, and obviously Lightningsource never replied to our questions. Was there anything we could have done? his name is even on the book as the editor, as is his company name. it has all the edits he made too.	No
So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
So I'm hoping someone here has some advice for me in regards to renting a room. I will be attending school in Toronto in September and due to my low budget ( 500 - 850 ) I'm going to have to rent a room in a shared unit instead of a apartment. I'm having a really hard time finding something as I have poor credit, no references as I've always lived at home and I'm patting with OSAP so I currently don't have employment in Toronto. The only thing I can think of that would help me to get a room is to offer to pay all 4 months rent up front. My concern is that if I'm just renting a room from in a shared house then I don't think I'm covered by the LTB and could be licked out any time without reason and could then be out 4 months rent. Could I get a contract or somthing stating the money is for rent and if I'm kicked out I get it back?   Not sure what my options are so if anyone has any suggestions on a contract or even advice on how to find a room in my situation I'd really appreciate it.	No
I’m in some deep shit.   I asked someone for a rental application. They sent a document which I filled out and signed. This turned out to be a lease agreement which I’m now on the hook for. I just signed a sublease agreement with someone else. Now I’m on the hook at two places. What can I do? 	No
I tried to work on a floor at my past rental, but botched it up.  I own up to that.  But the way the landowner/real estate guy is handling problem is the problem. I am in Orange County, NY.  1. Owner isn't close so I have text messages of real estate agent saying he will tell the owner place is in good shape.  He said this twice without checking anything off.  We left keys June 15. 2. Owner says the floors were sanded and stained bad-I admit to-but a week after realtor said all was fine.   3. He had someone try to come and sand and stain floors 4. It has now been fourty days since being out and no deposit minus fixes or detailed sheet saying what needs to be done.  Question: 1. It is later than 21 days, a local law says, either money back or details of repairs is he wrong? 2. Was the owner or realtor supposed to do good walk thru and let me know any fixes, before leaving keys? 3. Does these two wrong doings, if they were, trump the messing of the floor legally? 4. Does the realtor's word, being the agent, mean alot when he said that he will tell the owner place is good? 5. Will my text trail that has all of this in there help me in  a case?  Any advice would be helpful.	No
I caught my husband cheating today. I'm still in shock so please excuse my grammar and other mistakes. We have a 2.5 yo son and I'm afraid of how this could affect him. My husband has been carrying on an affair with a coworker who is also married. I do not work and have no skills or means of supporting myself or my son. My husband is threatening that he can take full custody and deny me rights to my son for this reason. He is using this as leverage to prevent me leaving the state to seek comfort in the company of my family. Or to even leave the home we share because he insists he should get to see his son every night.  My little boy means everything to me and is all I have now. I can't lose him. My husband would likely lose his job if I made this public but would also beat me to death. (He has beaten me before but I have never had the courage to report it or save photos). I don't know what to do or how to get away without risking my life and my son's. I want to leave but I'm so  afraid. Please help. 	No
Hey, this may be a dumb question and if I'm putting it in the wrong place please let me know.  I went to a new doctor who started me on a prescription for a new medicine to counter some side effects of another medicine I take. The new stuff actually started to help, a lot. For the first time in a long time it didn't feel like my stomach was trying to eat itself constantly. However, they put a typo on the prescription--they prescribed 15 pills at one dosage, and 15 pills at a second, but the second half had the typo and the pharmacy couldn't fill it. No big deal, they have 15 days to correct it, right? Totally wrong. The pharmacy called them 2-3 times in the first week, and faxed the request over as many times. I spent all of the next week calling, leaving voicemails, and never hearing back. Finally Thursday, the pharmacist got a verbal confirmation it was being sent over that day. I called Thursday and got the same confirmation. Nothing. Then Friday morning I called and told them that it needed to be in ASAP so I could pick up that afternoon, because I only had one pill left. They assured me it would be sent to the pharmacy within the hour.  Pharmacy again got nothing. I tried repeatedly to get through to them again and when I finally got someone on the phone, was told that it was still waiting for the doctor to sign off on it (the girl from the morning had told me she'd messaged the doctor but either she didn't do that, or the doc just didn't bother) and she'd gone home for the day. It's a controlled substance psych med, so the pharmacist wasn't able to even give the one pill to bridge the gap, even though they had the original prescription with that stupid typo.  So today has been an absolutely awful day of being sick, having stomach pains way worse than they were before I started this miracle medicine, and just generally wanting to curl up and cry.   I'm already looking for another doctor, and gave them honest reviews on Yelp and Google, but honestly with their other low reviews (I didn't even check first, was referred by a friend who didn't have as bad a time) I don't think they care to make improvements. Is there something that can be done to fine them, or somehow bring to their attention how badly they communicate? At this point I just don't want them to screw anyone else over like they did me.   Thanks everyone, and have a great night.  TL;DR doctor jerked me and pharmacy around for 2 weeks and messed up on a prescription for a psych med, caused massive frustration and a day and a half of feeling awful. Can anything be done to make sure they don't keep doing this to patients?	No
I am asking about nonprofit organizations that arent registered in the state of WA, I giggled the name of their org and found nothing. I know someone who just started a Facebook page claiming to be a non profit organization and is accepting donations, the donations are toys and kids clothing and items for children, I do not think any money is involved but am not sure. They claim none of the things they get are new, but the basically take donations and give them out to people, but for free and some pictures look like new in box toys. My question is they aren't registered, is this legal? Are they supposed to keep books of the items they receive for tax purposes and such? I don't understand and want to know if anyone can help me understand and answer my questions and if they are violating any codes or laws. Thank you for your time and if you need any more information please ask!	No
Was recently attacked by two dogs who broke through a door while walking in my subdivision; total of 12 stitches to my upper right arm.  Report was filled with the police and animal control and the owner is being investigated. Dogs are still in the home.   I contacted my HOA president and suggested she notify the neighborhood residents of two dogs and the attack; especially since they broke down the front door to get after me. She stated that she will not notify the residents, for fear of being sued if she mentions his address. Rather send an email out reminding people of our HOA rules. Everyday since the attack, I watch families and children walk in front of the same house and cringe thinking it will happen again. Should my HOA notify the residents? Can they be sued for mentioning his address even though the police report will be public knowledge? Unfortunately I have a feeling that the HOA president knows this dog owner and that is playing a part in her decision.	No
I am being evicted from my back house/garage have only 10 days to leave put of the property which the man living in the front gouse not the owner never told us we had to leave the property until last night did not tell us anything what can i do?	No
I went no contact with my mother about 6 months ago after years of dealing with her violent alcoholism, her undermining my choices as a parent, her blatant favoritism and targeting of my children, and the straw that broke the camel's back, her running a background check on my SO in an attempt to persuade me to break up with him. I just received a certified letter from her asking me to contact her to set up visitation for her and my children. It didn't explicitly say anything about her taking further steps, but it seems like that's the direction she's trying to move. If she does take me to court for visitation what sort of information would be pertinent to document? Are her chances of winning high? (We live in Nevada) I can get several character witnesses on my side if I need to. I'm just not sure if I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thanks in advance for any advice. ETA- should I respond to her letter and reiterate my stance on her visiting the children?	No
"He hired me out of college and now is deciding not to pay me. It's been 4 weeks since my last ""payday"" and 2 weeks since I stopped working for him due to lack of payment. Being that I was ""under the table"" what can/should I do?  He owes me $530+"	No
When in reality the dog got loose and I was chasing the dog.  It is infuriating that they charged me for something that I did not have any control over. My small dog(rat terrier mix) is not dangerous but not smart either.  And I would not let her off leash on purpose because she will surely get hit by a car. I tried to reason with them but they would not listen.  How can I fight this?	No
"I just moved from one apartment to another in Orlando, FL and received an email notice that I was going to be sent a ""refund"" check for roughly $2000 from my previous apartment's realty management company. I was immediately confused and thought there had been an accounting error. As it turns out, $2000 had been removed from my checking account. Since I was not expecting this charge, I was charged heavy overdraft fees and my account was completely drained. The check has arrived in the mail and it's for a third of the sum that was taken out of my account. My roommate received another third of it and I think my guarantor (i.e., mom) will shortly receive the last third. I am absolutely livid that this money was removed from my account without warning and sent to other people. Especially when they didn't automatically draft my last months rent (also without warning) and I barely caught it in time to pay without late fees. I know I can get my money back from my mom and my roommate, but what would have happened if I didn't have a good relationship with these people? I could have been seriously screwed. Anyway, I'm planning to make some angry phone calls tomorrow morning, but I'm not sure if there's any action I could take to get the late fees refunded. Also, I already cashed the check they sent me because I have next to no money after they took so much out. Was this a bad idea? What should I do? There a million and one other things that happened to me while living in this apartment and I wrote down everything, but this is the icing on the cake."	No
"So as the story goes my wife and I start looking for a house and after a few months we find one with the help of our  Real estate agent (Brian).  The wife and I decided to put an offer in on the house at $390,000 with the condition of a home inspection.  The sellers of the house get back to us and agreed to our offer!!!  After the home inspection was completed it came to light there were a few issues with the house (mould) but nothing that was a deal breaker. As the wife and I talked about the house we decided that we would alter our offer and that's where Brian comes in.   We still liked the house, the problem was we wanted the mould gone, so we wanted to alter our purchase price so we would have money to fix the issues. So we sat down with Brian and told him that we thought about offering $370,000 that way we would have money left over from the down payment to pay for the renos. His response was that the sellers were not going to accept the offer, but suggested something totally different. He suggested that we keep our offer at $390,000 but request a cheque of $5,000 on the day of signing to be issued to us from the sellers, so we can fix the mould when we move in.  To us that sounded great, because we didn't want to lose the house, so we sent off the new paperwork to the sellers.   The sellers then contact Brian and tell him that they want $390,000 and the cheque to be $3,500 instead off $5,000. We stand by our guns and tell Brian that we won't move and the $3,500 won't work for us, we want the full $5,000 or no deal. All the while Brian is trying to convince us that we are going to lose out on the house for a mear $1,500. The sellers get back to us and agree to sell the house at $390,000 with a $5,000 cheque signed over to us on day of closing ........ everyone is happy!!!   So a few days go by and my mortgage broker calls me up needing clarification, she doesn't fully understand what's up with the $5,000 cheque. I explain the situation to her and she tells me that I won't be getting the $5,000 cheque and that it will be going towards the purchase price of the house. She's a  Real estate agent as well as a mortgage broker and says that these types of deals are no longer allowed. So I call up Brian and tell him the situation and his response was ""that's not my problem"" and won't accept any responsibility.   The next day I go into Brian's office ( royal le page) and talk to the manager. The manager says that no one in the office was aware that they had changed the regulations, but at least I was getting $5,000 off the asking price. I explain that's not the deal we made, I wanted the cheque not $5,000 off the asking price. He's said they would look into it and get back to me that night.   Brian's manager doesn't call back and it's getting late so I call him.  Essentially he tells me there's nothing they can do, and I shouldn't be upset cause I'm getting $5,000 off the 390,000. Then proceeds to tell me that I will have to  amend the agreement to $385,000 and remove the $5,000 cheque or my mortgage broker won't be able to get me a mortgage. I tell him that's not happening cause then I would be letting them off the hook. I call the mortgage broker and she says that not the case at all the mortgage will go through but I won't be getting the cheque, that's going to the lender.    Now I'm here looking for help!!!!  The difference between 390,000 and 385,000 mortgage  a month is about $18, which won't help me fix the mould issues in my house but the $5,000 cheque upfront would have.  This was Brian's idea to do the cash back not ours but now we are stuck buying a house with a deal that we didn't agreed to.   Also, the closing date is in about 4 weeks and we have already sold our house and have to be out around the same time"	No
"First off, I know that placing a ""No Trespassing"" sign directly facing someone's yard (it's visible from our living room windows) is very passive-aggressive and screams that we've had some sort of neighborly feud. However, we have not. We do not even know who owns the land behind our yard and thus placed the sign.  To give a better picture, the wooded area behind our back yard goes on for about two acres. In winter, when there are no leaves, you can barely see a small house at the top of a hill, if you know where to look. From that house, I imagine, our back yard is pretty clear to see (only in winter; in summer, it's impossible to see 10 feet ahead of you). It seems reasonable that a new neighbor moved into that area beyond the woods and walked through to our backyard to post the sign. However, I know that is not the case.  The woods used to belong to a farmer that I worked for in middle school/high school. He was very kind and as he did not use the land for anything, he did not mind if the neighborhood kids played on it. Anyway, we know he sold the wooded land behind our backyard to someone, (he divided his land into much smaller parcels and sold them to people who wanted to build their own homes) but we do not know who bought the woods that touch our land.  I know that this new neighbor trespassed to place the eyesore of a sign because there is an impossibly deep ravine/creek that divides the woods. It is impossible to cross, both because it is wide and the water is deep. I'm not sure where it begins or ends, but there is nowhere to cross near our backyard or our neighbors' backyards. The person had to have driven to our house, walked through our back yard, and posted the sign. Once again, I'm not sure why they picked our house. There are other yards adjacent to the woods, and we never go in the woods (I stopped going into the woods maybe 5 or 6 years ago), but I suppose they think that we do.  I hate to mention this, but the only possibility I can think of is that it is racially motivated. There are only two black families in my small town, and we are one of them. None of my other neighbors touching the woods got signs in their yards.  My questions are as follows:  1) How do I find out who owns the property now? The farmer moved away and I don't have his contact info, so I can't find out that way. 2) If I cannot find this neighbor and ask them to take the sign down, is there anything else we can do legally?  Thank you in advance."	No
"So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I'm in a relationship with this person. So yeh this is your typical, revenge porn or nonconsensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	No
"However yesterday they called me and asked me for my account and transit number because ""They are not in the check that you gave us""   Now I assure you I gave a legit check in fact it was from the same stack that I gave to them the last new car I bought.  I think they lost my void check. What do I do in my situation? Is it safe to have a lost check out there? Does the dealership have any standing to make me replace void check?   What if I catch them in a lie and they verbally admit they lost my check and lied about the no account number stuff. (Canada is 1 party consent I double checked)   Should I just send in another check?"	No
"Hey guys,  This is a long, convoluted story but I'll keep it short as possible. Thank you so much in advance if you can help me resolve this question. :)  tl;dr: My gf lived in an apartment for a year then moved into another apartment in the same building and owned by the same landlord as per an agreement with the new apartment's tenants. It fell through and she moved out after 10 days. She didn't sign a lease or communicate with her landlord in any way whatsoever about moving into the new apartment. The landlord took the rent for 15 days in the new apartment out of the security deposit she paid for her first apartment. Is this legal? If it's not, what's our best option for getting my gf's money back?  My girlfriend has fallen on some hard times recently. We are both college students who are staying in Pittsburgh, PA over the summer.   My gf was renting an apartment for the last year and her lease ended in July. Looking for a new apartment, she found out that there was an available space in an apartment two floors down - an apartment with the same landlord as before.   She worked out a verbal agreement with the tenants there that she would move into the apartment on July 17, and she did. However, when it came time to sign the lease and make it all official, the landlord tried to hit her with a bunch of charges she didn't consent to - including paying rent for the month before she moved in. Long story short, she declined to go ahead with signing the lease and amid passive aggressive threats of eviction she moved out after ten days. She's living with me now.  Here's the problem... she recently got a list of itemized deductions from her landlord for the security deposit of her last apartment (the one she stayed in for the past year). Her landlord witheld $250 from the security deposit with the explanation ""15 days for the first floor apartment not paid.""  My gf is really financially strapped and can't afford to lose the $250. My gf never signed a lease, nor did she communicate with the landlord in any way, not verbally or in writing, about her moving in - she says her roommates talked to him about it but she never had any contact with him.  My question to you guys: Can this landlord legally withold the rent for the 15 days in the new apartment if my gf did NOT sign a lease or in any other way agree to any terms of residence? If what he has done is legal, why and how? If it's illegal, what's the best way to proceed? If she threatens in formal writing to take him to court, what should the letter say? What are her chances of winning the case if he refuses to refund her money and she takes him to small claims court??  Thanks very much to anyone who is kind enough to help us out with this issue."	No
hey, so to make this a short long story, my father has never paid child support even though my mother had got it in writing what he was supposed to pay (the amount slips my mind as I was 3 when this all happened and I have lost all the paperwork). but as of now I am of age of majority and still wondering if i have any entitlement to that money. I'm also in Canada, British Columbia. So I guess what I'm asking is where I stand with all this in a legal level, what my options are, what kind of lawyer to look into. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this. Will update with any info as needed.	No
Late Saturday night my downstairs neighbors called the police on my husband and I for arguing (the walls are thin here), we did not answer the door because the neighbors call the cops constantly over the most minor things like doing dishes, watching tv, walking around at night and so on, every time we HAVE answered the door in the past the officers simply tell us they got an anonymous complaint for noise, and that they couldn't hear anything, then they leave.  We stopped answering the door quite a while ago, because it's just an annoyance.  However when the police officers arrived Saturday night they MIGHT have heard my husband raising his voice, but we weren't in need of any sort of police assistance, it was just an argument, so we did not answer the door.  Anyway, today (Monday) I got a knock on my door in the morning while I was still in bed, then again at 6:00 PM, both times an officer not in uniform, but with a badge, had a clipboard with paperwork. The 2nd time I did try to answer the door but the officer was already leaving.  My question is this, what could they possibly want?  Could this be related to blatantly not answering the door on Saturday night over a noise complaint?  Or is this possibly a subpoena they are trying to serve on an unrelated case (last year someone attacked me and destroyed some of my property and he's still going through pre-trials)  Either way, I haven't gotten anything in the mail.  I'm just wondering what could be going on.  It's too late for me to call the district attorney's office to ask if this is about the court case I'm a victim in, and I'm scared it might not be about that and might be about that stupid argument my husband and I got into Saturday night....  Anxiety is eating me up about this.	No
"Illinois  We've been renting a house for almost three years. Throughout that time, we noticed our landlord did not want to make repairs on the house and it seemed she was planning on letting the house go and we would somehow get screwed in the process. The housing market in my area is pretty bad, and a lot of people are walking away from their houses, so her behavior had us on alert. However, the rent was cheaper than other comps in the area and we were walking distance to our kid's school, so we just decided to ride it out and hope for the best. We have never been late on rent, and we have done many minor repairs on the house that we did not charge her for. We spent hundreds of dollars on landscaping to make the place look nice, even though we knew we would not live there much longer. We were trying to follow the campsite rule and leave the house in better condition than when we moved in.   &amp;nbsp;  Over time, we started receiving mail for the landlord, such as tax bills and other things that looked important. Every time I would text the landlord she would tell me to just throw it away. I thought it was strange that this stuff was still being sent to the house after she has not lived there for many years.   &amp;nbsp;  May 2017- We were visited by a man with a foreclosure summons for the landlord. We told him that we were renters and that the landlord lived at another address. He then informed us that the house was in pre-foreclosure because the mortgage wasn’t being paid. He said they would take about a month to clear up any possible misunderstanding as to why the mortgage wasn't being paid and if the matter is not resolved, he would come back with official foreclosure papers.   &amp;nbsp;  That's when he told us that if he does come back with the official foreclosure summons, we need to stop paying our rent, and put the money in a separate account. He said that we could save that money and use it for moving expenses later. He said the foreclosure process takes about 1.5- 2 years and we can stay until the bank officially owns the house. As long as we don't touch the rent money, we should be ok. If the landlord tries to evict us, we can show that to the judge and the fact that the house is in foreclosure status, he will not let her evict us.  This was obviously very concerning but we thought that maybe this would end up helping us. We were planning on buying a house within the next couple years so this could really help us save money. June 2017- the same man came back and let us know the house was officially in foreclosure. That’s when he answered some additional questions. He was very patient and kept asking if we had more questions and seemed to genuinely want to help. I was a little skeptical, so I asked if he could provide some sort of proof in the event that the landlord tries to deceive us or evict us.  He said I would have to go to the County Clerk and I could print out the foreclosure documents since they are public record. He gave me his name and said the staff at the clerks office would know of him as well.   &amp;nbsp;  July 5, 2017. We confronted the landlord and she denied everything. She claims they were looking into refinancing but they were not in foreclosure. She claims to have called the bank to confirm that the house is not in foreclosure and that she always pays the mortgage. That’s when I looked up the public record, and what do you know, there is an open foreclosure case against her. I presented this information to her, and she stills denies any knowledge. I asked if her late husband could have signed a second mortgage on the house without her knowledge. She said maybe but she has no idea. I told her well, regardless if you know about it, they bank can still take your house, which will leave us with no place to live. Then later her story changed, now the house is not in “active foreclosure.” I’m not sure what that means, but I am inclined to believe court documents over her word. She has been dishonest and overall shady in the past, and I can see her scheming this as a way to pocket some cash. I showed her that there was a foreclosure mediation scheduled for August 15th. She claims to know nothing about that, and claims her bank knows nothing either. The thing that strikes me is that she has not offered any proof that she was paying the mortgage, I am expected to trust her word (she has lied to us in the past and is an overall shady person) against an official court document? I told her that I would gladly pay the rent once the matter is resolved, but there needs to be record that the foreclosure isn’t active before I will do that. I reassured her that we wanted to resolve this and we were sorry but this was the only way we can protect our family is to hold the money until this is resolved.   &amp;nbsp;  July 10, 2017- A small package came for the landlord from Pennymac, who is the plantiff in the foreclosure case. I texted the landlord and asked if she wanted me to mail it to her. I should have just RTS, but I want to show I am being helpful and cooperative, so I spent $3.00 to send her the package. July 19, 2017- landlord texts saying she is selling the house and if she doesn’t receive rent, she will serve us with an eviction notice. If we pay the rent, we can stay until our lease is up in October. She also says we need to set up a time for her to show the house. I think she may be lying to scare us into paying rent, or perhaps she is scrambling to get the bank to agree to a short sale instead of a foreclosure. Since she has not maintained the house (needs new roof,  water leakage/damage, plumbing issues, foundation issues…) I’m wondering if the bank would even agree to that.  I know she paid around 95,000 for the house but it is currently valued at around 50,000, which will surely be lowered once they find the condition of the house.  &amp;nbsp;  Per the advice I was given from the visitor, I should let the eviction go to court and present my evidence. I am willing to do that, but I want to make sure this person wasn’t giving me crap advice before I go down that road.   &amp;nbsp;  Here are my questions:   1.	Was the advice I was given to withhold rent total bull? Will the judge really let us stay in the house if it is in foreclosure? If so, why would this person go through the trouble to tell us that? What could he possibly gain? 2.	Can re-financing a mortgage somehow create a foreclosure case? 3.	Do we have to agree to let her show the house (assuming she is not bluffing about selling the house to try to get the rent money)? 4.	What are the legal ramifications of an eviction and will this affect us buying a house?"	No

 I signed a one year lease and moved in. I have email records of her telling me I could move in on the day I did. I read through the lease entirely and it does not mention alcohol or tobacco specifically however the Craigslist add did say no smoking but I have not smoked inside which is confirmed by her property manager. The only thing it mentions is not bothering other tenants. I was drinking beer the day I moved my stuff in and the other tenants saw but I was not being belligerent was not so drunk I couldn't move big furniture and whatnot. Over the next few days I continued to drink on the porch to my unit and smoke cig's outside. The tenants send her multiple complaints that I am extremely drunk and smoking and making noise at night which I would argue I was not beyond using my apartment (no yelling or banging). One of these tenants recorded me talking on my porch from her porch and claimed it was me in a drunken stupor (I doubt you can even hear me or see me in w/e recording they claim to have if one at all). She sent her local property manager to my house to discuss my behavior with me and to install an A/C unit. I explained to him literally what I had done every single day I had been there so far which included stopping the drinking and smoking five days previous. No music at night or loud noises beyond me talking in discord inside of my apartment this entire time mind you. He told me he thought that the other tenants were exaggerating and blowing the situation out of proportion and would tell her so himself on my behalf. I have yet to hear from her yet after this meeting. My question is: Am I breaching my lease, can she revoke my lease and if so does she have to give me 30 days to move out? Thank you for your input.	No
Hello,   I graduated High School this past summer, and bought my macbook from the school. The guarantee was that once the laptop was fully paid for, the school technology department would remove unnamed management software. I don't know if it is a keylogger, website monitoring software, or what additional restrictions exist. I know that I can not change my energy settings nor control my security and privacy options.  After I paid the school the full balance, the software was not removed. I emailed the technology department requesting removal and received a preliminary response days later stating the the lead for such matters had previously been on vacation, despite not having turned on any sort of automatic reply indicator.  I am currently overseas, and have limited wifi options. I requested that the technology department give me a timeslot that they needed me to connect to the internet within. I told them that I would make whatever time they gave work.  In response, I was told that they were unable to give me a time slot, but that it just had to be connected for a short period of time. I further emailed and explained that I was unable to just randomly have it on, as my time zone is multiple hours ahead and wifi is very limited in the city where I live, so I needed them to provide a time that worked for them, and I would cooperate with whatever time they set.  Since then, I have not received a single reply despite nearly 3 business days elapsing.  I understand that this issue may seem minor, but I bank off my computer, and am soon going to be hoping to use it for purposes of a more sensitive nature where I am legally unable to have outer management software installed on my device.   Thank you in advance for any information or advice.	No
"This is quite a long one.  Please excuse poor grammar. So 5 years ago I started custody on my son.  At the time he was 8.  While this started his mother refused to go to any court dates till she was handed with a contempt of court months later.  So during the next 2 years there were over 100 days of missed parenting time.  Our judge had enough of us constantly being in front of him.  None of this was due to me.  I had always done everything that was asked of me.  During this time his mother was charged with 7 drug felonies. She was allowed to use a 7411. Which means if she successfully completed her terms. That she would be charged with possession of non-narcotic.  During this time she had moved 90 miles away. And we had to meet half way which she despised doing.  Ok so now this is where the story picks up.  So on a Tuesday before my weekend I get a call from CPS.  I tell them that I will inform my lawyer and we will meet.  I work nights so mother goes to pick my son up.  The next day I ask my son what CPS was in regards to. And he says ""none of your business"".  Me and my son were really close prior to me starting custody.   We spent time together when she wanted a babysitter.  So we go to my parents house.  I tell him that he can go sot at his desk. For being disrespectful to his grandmother the weekend prior and me just then.  He wanted to get up so I tell him that he could write a report that his school was offering for extra credit.  He chose not to so I told him to continue to sit.  He was allowed to get up but I told him no TV.  He ends up watching TV with my father.  I tell him to sit back down he says no and what are you going to do about it.  I get up and I pit my hand on his ear and he walks in front of me and sits down.  Say an hour passes and I tell him he is done being punished.  We watch some soccer and go about our day.  Next day we all go to see Ghostbusters.  He has a younger brother and my ex's son who I raised since he was 1.  After we go to my house and they all play and go to the park.  We drop him off later that day.  So on the following Thursday I get a call from a detective and am told I am being accused of breaking my sons arm.  So when he was age 6 &amp; 7.  He had broke his arm in the same spot.  Now that January he had broke it for 3rd time throwing a dodgeball at school.  I call my lawyer.  And he says normally I would say not to talk to them but in your case we should.  We go and meet with him and tells me the allegations. The story was that  got mad at him and dragged him from one room to the other and threw him into the wall rebreaking his arm.  There are no accessible walls in the room.  Running a pornographic household.   For having a sex talk with a 13 &amp;12 year old.  Showing a Playboy and having a serious talk with them.  Both mother's had agreed and known about prior to use sitting down.  And then of course my wet preserved specimens were brought up.  Oh and I did this when CPS already had a investigation from her call the week prior. So during all this my children have been interviewed multiple time prior.  I have never hit my children.  I dont even yell at them.  So I go to court and I end up losing custody of my son.  If more back story is need on why I will provide.  But basically my court appointed lawyer set it for a bench trial.  And I was deemed unfit.  I did switch to my regular lawyer but the deck was already stacked. So during this time about 3 months later.  I find out I am being criminally prosecuted.   I get depressed about everything and stop going to work and make some overall bad choices.  One was having sex and getting a woman pregnant.   My youngest son was 9 and I had no plans on having any other children.   Well this woman is an addict.  While pregnant she was taking pills.  She goes to jail and then rehab then to methadone clinic then back to jail. All in her 1st 6 months.  So the baby is born. He maconian comes back positive for opiates.  CPS is involved. They find no reason to continue since she had a prescription for her last pregnancy.   Which was like 5 years prior.  Oh yea she signed rights away to her first son to her mother.  And gave her 2nd son up for adoption.  So CPS tells her that if she lives with me that they will be involved and want them out of my home.  So I still see my daughter when the mother would come over.  Till I ask for some things she took from the home.  I had bought everything for our daughter but was for the home.  The mother was essentially couch bouncing with our daughter. We stop having physical contact after this fight as she wasnt welcome in my home.  Over the course of her firat 16 months CPS had been involved 4 times.  One alleged incident involved her boyfriend shaking the baby.  These were always dismissed regardless of my concerns.   When we go for custody.   She received sole legal custody and I was denied parenting time.  I was also denied parenting time for my son. The reason was alleged abuse.  Even though the criminal charges were dismissed against me.  So last week CPS gets ahold of me and tells me the new case.  That the house she lives at is selling drugs.  Unknown number of people living there.  She smoked weed at 630 and at 1030 was in a single car rollover. 300ft of skid mark.  She was taken to jail for dui, driving suspended and child endangerment.  So today when I called they told me that our daughter was placed with her mother.  They are petitioning to remove custody from her and place her with the grandmother.  I have fought for my children endlessly. And continue to be disregarded.  Do I have any options?"	No
Up until last year I was a graduate student with federal student loans (no private loans) at a public university in Virginia. I had to take a leave for medical reasons, but finished all my classes and only have my thesis defense left. My last class was in Spring 2016 and I have not been registered since, but due to lack of enrollment began paying on my student debts in December 2016 after a 6 month grace period.  A few days ago I received a letter from a debt collector saying a debt has been placed with their office for collections. It states the original creditor is the university for $148.94, and there are about $150 in additional fees listed from them. It's dated June 26, 2017 and says I have 30 days to dispute in writing and gives a PO box address and phone number.   I have no idea what the debt is from and there's been no attempt to collect before now. I did move 2 months ago but have a change of address filed. I logged on to my old university account to check if a fee was added later that I may have missed but it shows my history of payments and it's all balanced at $0. I'm totally willing to pay the $148.94 if it's a real debt I owe, but I have no idea what's it's for. I would rather not pay the extra $150 in collection fees and especially don't want a hit on my credit.   Is there a way to check if it's real, and if so, what it's charged for? My university financial aid office is notoriously terrible over the phone and I'm no longer in that city to stop by in person. I want to dispute it but I don't know how to prove I send a letter in to the debt collector by writing to their PO box. I'm assuming a phone call would not be enough proof of dispute in time.	No
Hi all, please advise; I am losing my mind! I rented a condo in South Florida that upon initial walk-through, seems updated and fairly well kept. On the first day of move-in I noticed a few bugs and once night fell, realized that there was a very serious problem. The landlord refuses to take responsibility for a roach infestation that has obviously been ongoing since prior to move. The catch is that under Landlord-Tenant Responsibilities in the lease, it states that tenant is required to conduct Pest Control. However, if I had known that there was such a serious issue, I never would have signed the lease! I feel duped and now my landlord is saying it’s my problem to fix. I cannot and do not sleep there. I had to remove my dog as well. Now the condo association is calling me and saying my dog is a nuisance to neighbors when neither of us live there! Doesn’t Implied Warranty of Habitability mean that the landlord is required to hand over the apartment in livable shape? Aren’t they also violating health code? Does this fall under a major repair +$200; meaning that the landlord should be addressing this?  I have hired a lawyer but would like to hear other advice and know if anyone has dealt with something similar? Thanks in advance!	No
Hello. So I was planning on moving to Nebraska and signed a lease through the mail. Rent amount is $375 a month. (Shared house) in no longer moving to Nebraska since I found work else where. I told the landlord my intentions and they told me they will try to find someone to take over my lease. Is there any serious consequences if I don't pay the rent? I'm afraid of being stuck paying for this rent when I can't afford it.  Please serious advice will be appreciated.  Thanks! 	No
Keeping things somewhat obfuscated for safety, if you need finer details, please PM me.  This happened in upstate SC. I am now in FL.  About 4 years ago, I offered to open up my house out of the kindness of my heart to my best friend and their spouse, who have a child. The next several months after that, it became very apparent that there were things I wasn't aware of. My friend's spouse was very abusive towards my friend, mostly verbally. I found out that my friend had been raped by the spouse as well. I confronted my friend about it after witnessing abuse towards the child too, and finally my friend recognized the need to end the relationship and demand a divorce. We filed to have the spouse evicted. My friend did not leave as they did not have anywhere to go.  My friend refused to pursue charges, mostly out of fear of things not going well, potentially some Stockholm Syndrome or something going on. The spouse accused us of cheating, openly vilified myself and my friend, and claimed to be innocent of what we witnessed.  No formal divorce or custody agreement ever entered in due to the previously mentioned fears.  There was peace some time after the split. The spouse seemed to be stabilizing. There was an agreement to allow visitation. The spouse however not only has a child with another person now, but has also kidnapped my friend's child as well, and has made wild baseless accusations.  I have been asked to submit an affidavit to what I witnessed. I am concerned that if my involvement comes forward, that the target will be drawn to me and I may have false allegations filed against me, forcing me to return back to SC, which could potentially have a number of consequences for me outside of legal. However, if I don't submit my affidavit, it could potentially weaken or ruin my friend's case and the chances of my friend's child being returned to the parent who is actually a capable parent.	No
I will contact lawyers, but wondering if anyone here has a general idea of how to proceed? She left me without any warning or explanation, and I want to file for divorce. We have a shared checking acct with only a small amount of money, but I have mutual funds/retirement savings in my own name (that I had before we got married, but they've accumulated a lot of wealth in the years we've been together). Will she be entitled to money from my retirement account in settling this?  Any idea of how to serve her papers in another country? I have no idea how the divorce process works. Does she need to be there in person?  Thanks.	No
"So this evening my landlord was at my house fixing things for an inspection tomorrow. I took my dog over to a friends because we are not allowed to have pets at the current house. He must have been in my room and found something dog related because he texted me asking what was up with the dog and said he hopes the situation is very temporary. I didn't argue or ask questions because I know he isn't supposed to be there. I responded saying it is temporary as I've been ""watching"" him off and on as my friend interviews for jobs in other states. I was wondering what/any options I have going forward. Would getting him registered as an emotional service dog be the route to go? Do I have other options? I'm kinda freaking out and the worse case scenario of getting rid of him keeps popping in my head. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated as I don't want to lose my best friend.... thanks "	No
I was the victim of a discrimination suit several years ago in the US. Due to the organization being so high profile they were able to shut down the case in summary judgement and spread misinformation (the judges admitted that they didn't understand the nuances of the case, and had very strong ties to organization in question).  I don't understand it 100% but I was told that I would be responsible for some legal fees if I lost. They tried to cut a deal with me by asking me not to appeal the case and then they wouldn't charge it but I appealed anyway. From what I understand the fees are capped to bare basics like filing fees etc so I wouldn't be responsible for something like 200k+ but more like 700-800 dollars. This is a drop in the bucket for them but very costly for me.  I understand that I am legally responsible for these fees, however as a direct result of this case and the emotional trauma I suffered at the hands of this organization, I lost that job, became almost unemployable due to Googling my name shows this failed court case, had to move in with family because I was desperate to have somewhere to live, had to flee that situation because of domestic abuse at the hands of my family, and have been homeless since the beginning of the year. For some reason they are deciding to try to contact me regarding those fees now of all times when I am literally homeless.  This has really reopened my trauma and I think it's deeply inappropriate for them to try to do this at this time especially when they had a part in creating this situation. I understand that legally I promised to pay those fees. I wanted to ask a) can I appeal to a judge about my situation or did I already promise all that time ago? and b) can I tell them that I will go public with this story and create negative PR for them if they decide to move forward?  This whole time I went the legal route instead of the press route because I didn't want to be in the spotlight but I wonder if things would have turned out differently because there would have been pressure for them to be held accountable. If they are choosing to really push to get those fees after all this time when I have hit rock bottom I don't see why I shouldn't reveal what they are doing to the press.  Also please be kind with this post and don't put down and disrespect my situation or my trauma. I understand this is just one side of the story but please take it at face value without judging or victim blaming. I have been through a lot with this and I will report and flag comments that are cruel and unhelpful. Please just answer the question as asked, I do understand that I agreed to this, but is there any leverage I can use with the judge or with the organization itself to pressure them to drop it?	No
I work at a manufacturing facility in South Dakota and I'm not in HR department but sit right next to it so I overhear and greet a lot of potential employees.  We just had a lady come in who wanted to apply for a certain position but one of the qualifications is that you must be able to lift 50lbs.  She told our HR that she is currently pregnant and is on restriction from her doctor to only lift no more than 35lbs but that after her pregnancy she would have no problem doing so.   Our HR lady told her that unfortunately that's part of the job, but we'd be happy to have her apply after she has her baby.  I was just thinking about it for some reason and was wondering if that's the correct way to handle it? Because then I started wondering what would happen if someone in that position currently got pregnant and put on restrictions.	No
Hello, I'm not quite sure if this is the best place but I need to start somewhere. I, 24, have been living with my dad, his wife, and 4 kids (ages 4 and under). I am about to move out and my dad needs help with handling these children. The mother is almost non existent (stays in room and makes minimal contact), as she has a prescription drug problem... He is out of money, out of time, and almost out of his mind trying to find a helping hand somewhere to turn this situation around. My dad can't go out and make money because he is stuck at home taking care of the kids full time, almost 15 hours a day.. this situation is ridiculous and I don't know where else to go. Obviously she needs to get out but what is the fastest way to do so. My dad is afraid of reprocussions for calling CPS or setuing similar. The wife is a master manipulator.   We are in North county San Diego  Thank you, anybody, for your help.	No
I signed a lease on October 24th stating that my monthly would be $869, and this was the price that I had been using all year to calculate my living expenses. But, when my first month was due today the price said $979. I was shocked because that was not the price I agreed to. I went through all my documents again, and it turns out that I and the building manager signed my first lease agreement on 8/24. They sent me a second agreement on 8/25 at a higher price that I, the building manager, and my co-signer signed too. Can they do this? Am I now legally bound to the second one with an increase in price they didn’t specifically tell me about?	No
I need some help with my abusive family and have no idea where to start on my massive list of questions, problems and concerns.  A little about me: I'm 16 and live on a small farm in Alaska, I immigrated to the US with my mother when I was 6 and have been here ever since.  My mother re-married someone in the US but my legal and biological father is in Europe. And my moms husband has not adopted me legally. I get verbally abused everyday and physically at least once a week. I have no real bruises I can show to prove of the physical abuse as it mostly consists  of pinning me to the floor and choking me while yelling at me about how worthless I am.  They are very far-right so any physiatrists or any mental health checkups are out of the question as last time I asked I was grounded for a week.  Here is my list of questions and concerns.  1. All I have is a green card and I'm not legally adopted by my father so I don't know if I will be deported back to Ukraine to my bio father who I haven't spoken to in 10 years if I run away.   2. I've heard of some law regarding living in the US and at a certain age being automatically legible for citizenship.   3. They force me to work at a small gift shop they run for no pay and without a work permit, which I know is illegal as they are not present with me at the shop and I work up to 60hrs a week.  4. I have a medium size dog who is the only reason I'm still alive as I got him during a very suicidal period in my life. If I loose him I will most likely fall right back into that pit. So I will need some suggestions about keeping him with me.  5. They homeschool me so I have very few friends and no access to a school counselor of any kind.   6. I have not penny to my name.   The only thing that's been holding me back from going to the police is my lack of knowledge about the US immigration system and my precious dog.   Please advise me as to what I should do to get out of this nightmare. Thanks :)	No
Can a screenshotted snapchat of a little bit of weed (like maybe an 8th) be enough for police to come do a search? I have been threatened by an ex and I would really like to know if this is possible. He says he will report the photo to the police.	No
Hi, my grandmother rented her house out through a management company to some tenants. They left saying that the house was 'unsuitable for living' citing various minor things that had broken while they were here (e.g. a sliding shower door came off the track). They sent the management company a letter saying that if we gave them the full security deposit, they would not take us to court over being forced to live in those conditions.  The house had suffered major damage due to a large pet they were not supposed to have breaking through porch screens and destroying blinds etc. We spent way more than the deposit fixing this damage.   They moved out in December 2017. We didn't think they had a case so we told our management company not to release the deposit. We moved in in January 2018 so we are no longer with the management company.  Eight months later: We asked the management company what happened and they said the tenant's lawyer never contacted them. They said they would reach out to the tenants again. The management company called us later saying that they would offer for the tenant to keep half of the deposit and for us to keep half of the deposit.   Today they called and said that the tenant refused this deal and that my grandmother is going to have to appear in court to fight it, or hire an attorney to fight for her.   My grandmother is inclined to do whatever is easiest to avoid a problem, but I worry the management company is lying to her. The company is acting a little suspicious and I think they may have already released the deposit to the tenants to avoid a problem. (For reference, it's a small company of 2 people). At no time during their tenancy (or now) did we have any contact with the tenants. We know their names but we don't have any contact information with them. We have never met them.  Sorry for the long post, I tried to keep things vague because I have 1 question:  Is the dispute really between the tenants and my grandmother, or is it between the tenants and the management company?	No
I apologize in advance for this long post. I'm located in North Carolina and am a student at a public university. When I transferred in, I applied for on-campus housing but was told that due to the extensive wait list I most likely would not get a room. So I looked for an apartment. I met two people who needed another roommate because theirs was moving out. I signed the lease the morning of July 21st, and later that day I got an email from campus housing after 5:00pm notifying me that I had been assigned to on-campus housing. I called the housing office on Monday and was told that all I needed to do was send them a copy of my lease and it would be taken care of. I did so, and heard nothing. I went into the office yesterday to make sure everything was taken care of. The lady at the front desk admitted to me that she looked at the email and forgot about it, admitting that she didn't do her job. I explained the situation and was told that the date on my lease was August 1st, I already knew about my housing assignment and they were going to charge me a $3,000 cancellation fee, half of the entire years rent for half of a dorm room. I explained that since it was a sublease, I was simply added to the lease and I signed it on the 21st. I showed the people in the housing office texts that I had signed the lease on the 21st but they said that they needed something official from the apartment complex. I went to the complex and explained my situation and they printed out an email exchange with their official email on it that proved that I had started the process and signed the lease on the 1st. I took that over to university housing and they said that the cancellation fee would be waived based on this. I went online to cancel my housing and got an email asking for proof that I had already signed the lease by the time that my on-campus housing assignment was available.  At this point I believe I'm being given the run around by the campus housing to get me to pay the fee. Do I need a lawyer to contest this?	No
Please let me know of any errors and things that I can improve upon. Sorry in advance.   I can't take this anymore. I want to leave this house and be my own person. I am tired of being threatened to leave by my parents. I do so much for them and they hate me.  I am 20 years old, unemployed, and have no car or drivers license. I was adopted unofficially and have no legal paperwork and have no idea if I even have a SSN or any means to get legal help in my situation. For all my life I have been treated as a glorified slave and nanny. I have pretty much raised all 3 of my younger siblings because my parents always had to work (which I understand) but it's way past the normal help here and there. I watched them as babies and fed and bathed them, I took them to school and all of that since I was 8 or so. For 20 years I have been the backbone of my family.  Although I didn't provide financial help I did do pretty much every thing else even cooking and cleaning after my siblings parents and grandparents. They don't even seem to realize how unhappy I am. I asked my parents for my information so I could get a job and they don't have it, they  flat out refused for 20 years to help me change that. Since  I graduated HS in 2015 they've been telling me to leave the house and to get a job but I simply can't because they all ask for my ID and what not and I don't have it. I hate not having my own identity to prove who I am to future employers. I want a change and I am totally helpless and powerless. I have no control over my life and it's already taken a toll on my mental health. I need an escape badly.   I've attempted suicide more than 5 times from 13-20 years of age and I always change my mind because these people are not worth my life. Yes they did raise me but it feels like they only did so, so they could keep me as free labor. I'm basically just a tool to them they don't even let me stay over family members houses or go out simply because they want me to watch the kids so THEY can go out or sleep or whatever. It's so maddening and I do it only because I love my siblings they need me and I need them especially the youngest one, she loves me more than our parents or anyone combined and I can't bare to leave her with them.    I'm so conflicted because they do this to me but on the other hand when we go out together and do family things I feel loved. But the good is only about 10% while the other 90% makes it not worth it in the long run.  Please if anyone knows what I can do to get myself as far away from here as possible, let me know. I'm going to die if I keep living like this. I will gladly give any information I can if you need it. Just please I need advice asap.	No
"I was rear-ended. As a result I several herniated and bulging disc. The only treatment I got from the ortho was prescriptions (anti-inflammatory) stuff. I refused the spine injections (freaks me out. I rather deal with the pain). I wanted to wrap this up last time I saw him (month 3).

"I have been looking at places to move to ASAP for a couple weeks. I just started a new job so will be paid Friday.  I haven't had to pay rent for the whole time I lived here until this month. 200 was the new verbal agreement. Landlord had agreed to accept late payment due to my circumstances.  The roommates (one landlord's daughter ""C"" and the other guy ""M"") have been very aggressive, blaming things on me and such. I have been trying to keep to myself and focus on leaving.   M threatened me last night when I refused to abandon my room before I move. He wanted me to move my stuff out and live on the couch. I refused respectfully, he proceeded to cuss me out and threaten me.   I left for work early and came back to find my bedding on the couch, my books hastily stacked in a box and my bed flipped on its side. I want to go buy a lock but an waiting on Metro PD to respond and hopefully tell me my options.  I decided to call Metro PD when I couldn't reach the landlord. My roommates aren't home that I can tell.  I think legally I am still allowed to be here. I have received no notice from my landlord of any changes since past telling her I would be paying for July late."	No
"I am a landlord in Bergen County NJ in a two family house (I live downstairs, the tenant lives upstairs). I currently have a tenant who has been intermittently accusing me of smoking pot over the past few months.  At first my tenant was simply saying they were smelling smoke so I looked around the property and into the furnace to see if there was maybe something wrong. I tried asking questions about what the point of origin was for the smell (areas of room, side of houses, etc) but I only received an exasperated ""it's everywhere"".  I have suggested the tenant speak to neighbors, but they refused to even consider it could be anyone other than me. They adamantly assert it is coming from my part of the house and it has gotten to the point where one of my family members called them to state I am willing to take a drug test (so long as the tenant pays for it, my job recently shut down and I lost my insurance as a result) and that their accusations are bordering on harassment. The tenant refused to pay for the drug test so now my family member is considering pooling money with my aunt’s and uncle’s to pay for the drug test (which costs a bit under 200$).  The entire time I have maintained that I do not smoke (I quite smoking cigarettes over a year ago and I haven't smoked pot in over two years, I never smoked it at my house). My tenant is a single parent with a daughter and is claiming that they have been woken up several times at night by the smell and demanded a solution from me even after I've maintained my innocence.  I recently googled my tenant's name and discovered an incident between them and their partner, the other parent of the daughter, which involved a false report by my tenant against the other parent of sexual misconduct of the daughter and counter charges that the other parent (not the tenant) was ""wrongfully accused, arrested, charged, prosecuted, defamed, slandered, and libeled.""  The other parent apparently charged my tenant with criminal coercion, extortion and harassment. I was unable to discover how this incident ended as I try to remain at arm's length with my tenant, only helping with what needs to be taken care of in the house.  What are my rights, as a landlord? I am worried that my tenant may try to cite the text conversations as a history to display wrongful conduct on my part or otherwise continue a campaign of harassment against me. I have tried to be polite in every communication I have had with her. One of my friends has brought up that taking a drug test might establish precedent for complying with her unreasonable demands. I’m considering evicting her or otherwise ending the tenant agreement, but she has a lease and I’m aware that tenants in Northern NJ have many rights that makes getting rid of them difficult.  tl;dr I have a tenant harassing me and accusing me of illegal behavior insinuating I am endangering their daughter with alleged drug use, what rights to I have as a landlord?"	No
So my fiance and I live in the Bronx and our lease ends on August 15. We've given our landlord ample amount of notice that we were leaving (about 4 months ago) and that we'd actually be gone by August 1. We even went on vacation for two and a half weeks last month and gave them permission to showcase our apartment in our absence.   However, since we've been back, the man who is supposed to be showcasing our apartment has not been the best at letting us know when he'll be showing up. On one occasion, he even broke into our apartment while we were napping. He thought we weren't there because we didn't answer our phone within the 5 minutes he called. He tried pulling the stunt again a second time, to which we said no.  The one time he gave us notice of him coming, nobody showed up. He didn't even show up.   My landlord just texted us stating that if there is a delay in renting out the apartment, we will be held responsible. Can they do that? We've only been back for two weeks. They've had and will have so many opportunities to showcase our apartment, can they legally withhold our deposit for this?	No
Hello,  I currently own a single family residence. I have a roommate that pays me a flat fee each month to rent a room. He has a lease that is signed through May 2018. The lease does state that the roommate may break the lease as early as February 2018 so long as he provides two months notice.   I no longer want to live in an HOA and have crappy neighbors so I want to sell my home and buy another one elsewhere, but I have my roommate who has signed a lease. I imagine when I talk to my roommate he is not going to want to move to the location in which I am looking at buying a home.   What are my options if he does not want to move out? Can I terminate the lease? Can I offer for him to move into the new residence for the remainder? What repercussions am I facing for doing this?  If I'm missing any relevant information let me know and I'll try to provide you with it. Thanks for your help.	No
I can't really get very good sleep and work early, but also from home so it's constant, constant... chirping.   I think that there are two. Two of the things...  Due to the consistent nature of the chirping. It started as one was going off at about every 37 seconds the other at every 35 seconds and gotten closer to 33 and 32 seconds. I timed them and that's about the pattern. Seems to be quickening...  They have been doing renovations on at least one of the apartments nearby for over a week and I suspect that is probably where the noises is coming from.	No
"This isn't a traditional ""legal advice"" type of thing, so if it's deemed inappropriate for the sub, mods can remove.   I got roped into a catfish, but it's such a well designed one, it's worrying. Typical catfishes are usually just bots, right? Not this one. This person has been going around Instagram of local people and attempting to message them and get their Snapchat.   They added me and I went along with it. They've been adding people through the ""suggested"" portion on Instagram and then adding them on snap if they can get it. Dude even knows local high schools and things so it's definitely an in area deal. The catfish itself is also super obvious. I asked for pics of them touching their pinky finger to their ear, which they sent a pic of a random girl doing from their laptop. I asked for a similar pic of them with a fork pressed to their nose. They sent a pic of a different girl with a fork in their mouth. They then started pressuring me by asking if I'm single, if I wanna meet up, and sending obvious videos of porn from their laptop.   I'm not stupid enough to fall into this shit, but it worries me that other local kids will. Again, this is a local thing as they know area high schools. Should I be contacting the authorities about this? This seems troubling"	No
I'm more curious than looking to aid in their dispute. The total of the reversed charges hits around $8,500. He's apparently claimed to two of them that his PayPal was hacked and someone stole over $100k from him, but went silent soon after that and has now deleted his Facebook account. PayPal seems to be working with my members, but they're claiming that even if they get their money back, they want to see charges filed. I can't say I disagree with them, someone like that should feel some kind of repercussions.	No
"A year ago my roommate &amp; I cosigned a year long lease. We are both on the lease as tenants. We are in a rent-controlled apartment.   Our lease will end in 45 days and I wish to leave. However, my roommate wishes to renew.  My landlord asked me to send a written notice saying I am giving up the rights to the apartment AND the security deposit (fairly significant amount). I will need to get the security deposit from my roommate.   However, my roommate is not being forthright as to his plans on how I will get the deposit back from him or his future roommate.   Here are my conundrums:   1) Once I give up the rights to the apartment - how can I ensure that my name from the lease is removed &amp; I will not be responsible for any future damages. Would the original lease with both our names on it just terminate and he becomes the sole person responsible for damages?  2) Can I ""refuse"" to give up my rights to the deposit in my 30-day notice? Since my roommate is not being forthright, I rather the landlord just force us to vacate and him ""reapply"" for the place, etc. I do not wish to give up my rights to the deposit till I have a clear idea of how I might get it back.   Please advise."	No
I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	No
"The State placed a restraining order on her to me about a year ago. During this year we have decided to ignore the order and remain living with each other.   I found out that she was cheating last week and the police got called from a third party, basically trying to ""help me"" and get her out of my house. She was arrested and released the next day.  On Friday 8/11, she kept calling me while I was at work because I changed the locks to the front door and she wanted to get in and get clothes, etc. I told her I wouldn't leave work. She said if I didn't come back immediately, she would come down to my job and make a scene. She said she would tell my boss about me stealing random items (I work in a grocery store).  I ended up driving back and had the police informed that I wanted a civil standby for her to get her things. They didn't show up immediately and she was screaming on the street, so to help my neighbors not hear any more I opened the front door. The police showed up and arrested her for being within 500 feet. She was released Monday.  I just want to know what I can do about her personal belongings. Can I carefully put them in boxes, not breaking any of them? And put them in the corner of my house so I don't see her things everywhere I look?  She is pregnant too, about 7 weeks. She told me that she will terminate it, but then jokingly said she should keep it so she can get child support from me. I told her if she were to have my child that I would take her to court the minute it was born and prove how unfit of a mother she is and take the child.  I don't have money for a lawyer but realize this might be the only route. Does r/legaladvice have any advice for me prior to contacting a lawyer?   I really appreciate it."	No
My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	No
I own in a really strict HOA and the renters nextdoor have it in their head that I am somehow connected to some fines they got (I am not connected in any way). They have signed me up for PornHub, put my phone number and email on Craigslist in an explicit ad, and stared down visitors to my home who later mentioned it to me (I never told visitors of the issues.)  The landlord and property management company are non-responsive. The HOA is monitoring the situation.  I have made police reports and reports to the HOA where it made sense.  Is there something else I should do? Can I take another approach, like civil court?	No
We recently transferred from our old studio apartment to a new two-bed two-bath unit in the same complex. After getting all of our belongings moved over the landlord told us we would have to make sure the old unit was in immaculate condition because the new tenants were moving in the following Friday, or we would face fines equal to what the cleaning company charged.  After being up until almost 4 am cleaning they still want to charge us almost $800 for essentially renovating the entire apartment. They sent an email containing the individual fees.   1.       Carpet replacement - $400 2.       Repaint the entire apartment - $100 3.       Trash out - $50 4.       New blinds $60 (2 in living room) 5.       Cleaning $60 6.       Appliance cleaning $100 (including washer/dryer) 7.       Vacant electric - $25  This is all coming AFTER inspecting the apartment and giving the go ahead for it's to transfer. I am of the opinion that the cleaning company is gouging them and they are trying to pass the costs on to us. Rent on the old apartment was less than what they are currently charging. My girlfriend has an anxiety disorder and has been having panic attacks over this.  What are our legal options? We would rather just avoid the fees but if they insist on trying to force us I'd be quite happy to pursue damages for emotional distress. Do we have a legal leg to stand on?	No
"My friend (friend A) lived in a 3 bedroom house with 2 other roommates. Me and friend B were offered the opportunity to move in once the school year ended and take over the lease for friend A's roommates (Lease ends in July but we planned on renewing and the landlord gave us the OK). Great location near our college we both agreed and in June once the other two roommates moved out, we moved in. However upon signing up on the online website to pay rent we found out that the 2 previous roommates didn't pay rent for the previous month (May) which ended up totaling at $800. We contacted our property management to try and solve the issue with zero response. This week we received a 3 day notice to ""Pay rent or quit""  to which we immediately called the property management company in which the only response they would really give us was ""We don't care who pays it, it just needs to be paid or else there is zero chance you can renew your lease"" Today me and friend A went into the property management company to discuss this situation to which they told us the same thing but also said we should email the head of the property management company because he may possibly find us a way to fix this. Before I email him I wanted to get some advice moving forward because a mistake in these moments I know could be very crucial.  I know the obvious situation would be to just GTFO but after only two months we just got settled into this place and have been great tenants since we came here and I would hate to be forced out of here.  We have been responsible tenants since June 1st and have been trying to work through this situation with them. Any advice/questions or personal experiences would be greatly appreciated!  *We haven't signed any documents because we took over the lease somewhat under the table but the landlord knew this and didn't mind"	No

This might be stupid but I'm just covering my bases.  A telemarketer called me on behalf of the Association of State Troopers of America or something like that asking for a donation. He was nice, and I figured why not help the police and said I would send 20 bucks. He got my mailing address to send the form.   I hang up and google the number, apparently they're a huge telemarketer known for scams, fake collections, selling insurance, etc. I'd rather just not donate now but since I agreed to, can I be held liable?	No
I moved about a week ago and I realized that my apartment unit doesn't have smoke detectors. It is my understanding that under Ohio law they are legally obligated to provide smoke detectors. Unless there are exceptions? There was even a section in my lease that said I am responsible for the upkeep of the smoke detectors (testing, batteries, etc.).   I am going to speak with the landlord tomorrow, but it can be difficult to get a straight answer from them or they take a long time to do anything and make a lot of excuses as to why it's taking them so long. This is something I'd rather have dealt with sooner than later. I am hoping that this is just a mistake and they want to correct it, if only to be in compliance with the law, but if I do not get a resolution tomorrow is there any other course of action I can take that will force them to act?	No
"I'm currently in a 1 year lease for an apartment. It's a multi dwelling apartment, meaning that we have separate entrances, and separate driveways.  However we have an upstairs neighbor, and she has been very nasty to us.  We started to get weird vibes from her from the beginning, like she is nice to us, but only when other people are around. (Like the landlord, her neighbors, or sometimes her friends.) But when see her and no one else is around, she is cold and curt. Sometimes she would just ignore us.  For example, when we moved in the landlord said to work out parking spots with her. There is our driveway (which is insanely steep), and then a little 2 car lot at street level which is her driveway (she only has 1 car). you can also fit a car parallel to the road next to a power line pole. She said ""yeah it's really whatever, first come first serve. We just kind of figure it out. It's not assigned parking spots"" seemed pretty chill.  Actually on the night before we toured the unit before we knew that we had it, someone had ran into her car which damaged her parking so only 1 car fits there until they fix it, so she got the OK from the neighbor across the street (super kind and generous man.) to park in his dirt lot which can hold like 6-8 cars.  an example of weird vibes is that, before we had finished moving in, my father in law and I were bringing a couch I had bought, we didn't cover it and it started raining right as we got into town. We parked in one of the spots that was supposedly cool to park in, but she got home shortly after and was very impatient with us and was really demanding, asking us how long we are gonna be there cause she has a friend coming over (meanwhile it's raining and the couch I bought is getting wet). so I asked if we should park in the dirt lot, and she loudly said ""NO"".  she had the unit to herself for a few months before we signed our lease, so we are thinking she got used to how things were?  She sent us texts at 4:30pm when we were moving in saying that we were being too loud, and we apologized and explained why the sound was happening to which she replied ""great""  She send us another text, at about 9:40pm on a Saturday night, asking ""do you have carpets yet? maybe that would help..."" this was during my 'bachelor party' (I just had some friends over to play video games before I got married)  Since then she has had many parties (outside on her deck) that go late (11:00pm, 12:00am, 1:00am) on a weeknight, at one point she had a party go until 2:45am on a Friday night, with loud music, stomping (not walking, stomping), and when my wife and I woke up we noticed there were cigarette butts on our deck.. our deck that's covered in dry leaves.  Anyways.. a week or 2 after that, we were almost done unpacking. We had been given a piece of furniture by my sister and we decided to get rid of it by putting it in our driveway (not in the street) with a free sign on it.  we had seen the other neighbors leave stuff out with free signs, like a couch, an aquarium, and a cat jungle gym. There is no HOA here either.  She texted us about it, at which point we texted the landlord asking if what we did was ok, he said it was fine. So we replied, and explained that we saw the other neighbors do it, and that the landlord said it was ok. but we apologized that it was bothering her and that we would move it when we got home (we were out at dinner).  She replies with a lot of condescension and sarcasm, and claims that she has never seen anyone put furniture out on our street, and that she would never do that ""that's what the dump is for"" and that we need to remember that she lives here too, and that her associates come over.  we decided not to respond to that because it was obviously a lost cause (we suspect she had been drinking because there were a lot of typos). When we got home, the Futon was gone. we thought someone had taken it (it was dark), but when we walked down our driveway we saw that she (presumably) had dragged/pushed it down the driveway. We can't prove it was her. but it would make sense.  there was a huge scrape mark going down the length of the driveway, and the leg of the furniture was bent from being dragged.  we felt like that was an invasion, we didn't feel safe. It was a totally aggressive and dramatic move. not to mention completely unnecessary because we said we would move it. At that point we contacted our landlord to let him know what happened. he said he was unsure of what to do, if he should call her, or wait until his next time coming down (some contractors had done repairs) which he said would be ""in the coming weeks""  we said we would prefer it if he came down so the 4 of us could talk. we didn't want him to call her, because she could just make stuff up. also because she isn't nasty when he's around, we felt like it would help us all reach a amicable solution if he was there as an arbiter.  he said he would come down, but that was more than a month ago.  One night when we were showering, we heard really loud and startling stomping above our heads. We finished our shower and when we got out of the shower we saw that our neighbor had texted my wife using all caps, asking if we just started a load of laundry at 12:00am. - when we do something she doesn't like, she ramps up to 60mph at the drop of a hat, and does something physical.  Based on earlier events, we didn't reply to this text at all. But I emailed my landlord about it.  I didn't feel like we owed it to her to respond to her abusive texts if she's going to be rude and aggressive. and as the days went by we kept showering whenever we wanted to.  She stomped a few more times (at one point even doing like 'marching band' stomping.. it's hard to explain, but doing it with both feet very fast and very loud)   and at one point she texted my wife again and said that ""she had a meeting early the next morning and our late laundry is disturbing her sleep""  So I (hesitantly) replied on my phone that ""Hello &lt;neighbor&gt;. We actually haven't ever done laundry past 9:00pm, what you're hearing is our shower""  She was sarcastic in her response.. ""so? whatever it is is keeping me up at a very late hour""  This was kind of annoying to us, because she has people over stomping right above our heads several times a month late into the night, and after they leave she is cleaning up moving furniture around slamming it down on her deck.  I've been emailing all of this as it develops to my landlord, he was surprised at her response and expected her to be more laid back (don't really know why.. considering the furniture incident). My landlord said, if she complains again, just tell her that we hear her when her friends are over and lived with it.  A few days later we had to contact him again because our dryer had gone out and we were working on replacing it. He actually said our neighbors dryer went out too (and she left it on the hill outside of our bathroom window...) which angered me because she was harassing us about our furniture but she leaves her dryer outside of our window? I moved it a few feet over because I didn't want to see it, and I didn't want to contact her about it. (then the next day she left a cardboard box to a new samsung phone in the same exact spot...)  He said he has been busy with work and unable to come down, but in the meantime, if we see her, if we bump in to her, then should try to talk to her for a few minutes and just say ""look , we want to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers, but when you have friends over late we hear that too and lived with it."". He has been sympathetic to us, but hasn't actually done anything yet. He said that if she is disrespectful again, then he will call her himself, he also said if it was him, he wouldn't want to live here either.  Since her text we had tried to get our showers done earlier (before 11:00pm). Some of the times she has stomped it was when she was clearly awake. We will drive up to our house and see her flipping channels on her TV, we can hear her walking around, calling her cat inside, and on the phone etc... But as soon as we get in the shower she starts stomping. and complains that we are 'waking her up'  So just last week my wife and I shower at 10:30pm, and we hear her start stomping around above us.. I didn't know what to do, so my wife and I wrote a text on my phone but didn't send it, we wanted to sit on it.  We decided, if we saw her the next day, we would try talking to her. But if we didn't we would text her. I felt like I should text her soon because my family was coming over for the long 4th of July weekend, and I didn't want her to be stomping if they needed to shower. (we had a beach day + dinner planned, so I knew we were gonna get back late)  Well we didn't see her, so I texted her Monday July 3rd while we were at dinner saying:  ""Good evening neighbour.  I was wondering if you were stomping again during our shower last night? I guess even if you weren't, I wanted to say some things and try to clear the air.  We want to be able to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers. But here's the thing.... when you have your friends over with music playing late at night during the week, we hear that. and we've lived with it. In May you had people over until almost 3am with really loud stomping and music right above our heads as we were trying to sleep. I've even heard you take a hammer to your floor at 11:00pm You woke us up this morning at ~7:40am. with your banging furniture around on your deck right above our bedroom.  Because we live under you, we hear a lot more than you might realize, but we've lived with it.  Live and let live, that's what we've been trying to do.  We've been accommodating and respectful to you. That's all we are asking in return.""  to which she replied:  ""I think u need to learn how to live with neighbors.. have you ever lived in a multiple dwelling place before?  There is etiquette involved...and waking people up late (10pm-6am)cause thats when u decided to take a shower is not cool.    Having friends over...talking...listening to music at a reasonable hour is cool.    Leaving your trash / used furniture out on the side of the road with a Free sign on it like you just moved into the ghetto is not cool.  Having friends over ONCE in 3 months late on a Friday night is cool.    Not communicating concerns you have to your neighbor and instead hitting them with an Uber long text on a monday night....not cool  Having 3 gorgeous decks and wanting to sit outside at 8am is absolutely ok.  It is not my fault you choose to keep non-business hours. Stop taking showers late (after 10pm) and everything will be okay on my end.    If my friends stay past 10pm on a weeknight and we are loud...absolutely let me know and we will move it inside.  But if I have friends over 2-3 times a year...late on a Friday or Saturday night....suck it  buttercup.     You may want to have people over too...and you know what...i won't say anything 2-3 times a year And no....you haven't been accommodating and respectful....you have been disdainful and rude.  You didn't even acknowledge me outside one day.. walked right past me.....i smiled said hi....u were completely disrespectful and rude. I think I have addressed all your concerns.  Have a good night""  After she sent that, I emailed my landlord again.  He replied July 4th in the morning and he said he was frustrated and didn't know what to do. In the 12 years he's owned the place he's never had this problem. He said if we wanted him to, he could call her.  We spent 2 nights at my in laws because being home was too stressful at this point. We were sacred of how she would react when he called her, and we were scared to go home. Even taking a shower at my in laws was stressful. My wife has severe anxiety, and to be honest this situation is giving me a lot of anxiety too.  I emailed my landlord on the 5th, asking if he had called her yet. and he said he hasn't called her because he wanted to enjoy the holiday without any drama.  I haven't heard anything from him since then.  However since then I've looking into taking legal action (trying to get a free consultation from a lawyer here). I don't know what the landlord is going to do, if anything. or if talking to her is going to help anything at all (or make it worse).  When she dragged our futon around, was that vandalism? Should we have called the police? is it too late to call now?  Is what she's doing defined as harassment? Is that enough for us to get out of a lease? Is there any other legal action we can take?  We are scared to bump into her.. and she is always on her wrap around deck above us which means if we use our deck we would have to see her.  Rent isn't cheap in California, and if my landlord isn't gonna do anything I don't see why I need to pay thousands more dollars to be living under a bully with this stress. We have family willing to take us in until we find a new place.  We are very skeptical that he will evict her."	No
I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52). They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month. Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month. On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym). I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months. The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer. Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes. I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!	No
"7 of my friends went camping on a Monday night, I had work unfortunately. They were camping at a site where camping isn't allowed but many people camp there anyways. After being there for a few hours, a man and woman came to the camp site and held a gun(later revealed to probably be a pellet gun) to the back of my friends head. He started saying things like, ""Are you prepared to die?"" And remained there pointing the gun from person to person for about 10 minutes. From this I have found out his name and I am wondering what sort of action, preferably legal, we should take against him. Is there anything we can do considering they were camping illegally?"	No
I know this is super petty and I'm new to this subreddit but my ex has a Reddit account that he's been posting personal details of our relationship in. This is information that may seem like no big deal in general but is information that can cause trouble for me down the line and is, I guess, character defamation. Is there anything I can do here in order to get him to stop posting personal details? I've already had a friend and family member comment on his posts cuz they've come across them and I'm worried about him saying something that might put me in hot water. Any advice would be extremely helpful, thanks.	No

"My state appointed lawyer is trying to get the neglect charge dropped however, the lawyer informed me it's unlikely they will drop the charge. If the state refuses to drop the neglect charge, what happens when I refuse to admit to the neglect? Family law doesn't require the state to provide actual evidence in any charges therefore, the neglect charge is based on hearsay. My child was never neglected in anyway, shape or form and I refuse to let them put neglect on my record without fighting for myself. My state appointed lawyer told me its ""not a big deal"" however, I disagree. A neglect charge can impact a hypothetical custody battle and my career. I have worked with children for the past several years until a few months before this happened but I intended on returning to that field of work. A neglect charge will go on my CANTS report and will disqualify me for any position in that field. A family member was angry with me and decided to call dcyf with crazy allegations on drug use etc. When they came to investigate I admitted to being prescribed suboxone when asked what medications I regularly take. I have been prescribed this medication for nearly 8 years. My daughter is under 8 years old.  I was honest bc I didn't have anything to hide after all, it's a legal medication prescribed to me by a doctor. I've been clean since being prescribed nearly 8 years ago. However, the state used this against me. I've been doing everything they tell me to do including random drug testing which are all clean. My question is, once I tell the state I'm not admitting to the charge, what happens and how do I go about it?"	No
Hi r/legal! Recently split up with my s/o and am now in the process of setting up a new life for myself. While with s/o, we had an arrangement for rent/bills. Basically everything was split 50/50 including mortgage. The mortgage was paid off earlier this year and since February, we have both been setting aside money to pay property taxes and insurance at the end of the year. I still continued to pay my half of utilities while putting the property tax/insurance money aside in my savings account.   S/o is now asking me to give him all the money that I've saved up for that, now that I've left.   Am I legally obligated to pay him back?	No
"Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, and also- throwaway because I'm paranoid.  I had an appointment with my regular podiatrist back in June. I've been a patient for years and have never missed an appointment. The doctor is very well-respected in our area and is booked out months in advance.   On Thursday, June 8th, I got an email at 4:45 PM stating I had an appointment on Monday, June 12th at 1:45 PM. There was not an option to cancel the appointment from the email, so I called the next day, June 9th to cancel my appointment. The time of my call was 1:52 PM. When I spoke with the woman on the phone, I told her I had to cancel my appointment for Monday. She went ahead and cancelled it.  A couple of weeks ago, I received a bill from the doctors office for $35 for a ""missed appointment fee"". I called the office to remind them that I did in fact call, and I would be happy to being in a copy of my phone records to show I spoke with someone. The lady said because I called at 1:52 and not 1:45, I was outside of the 24-hour business day window so I had to be assessed a fee.   There was absolutely nothing in writing saying that I had to cancel 24 hours in advance, Not only that, but the same woman who I've been speaking with on the phone didn't inform me on Friday (when I called to cancel) that I would have to pay a fee regardless because I was outside of that window. Why would by bill say missed appointment fee instead of late-cancellation fee? The only conclusion I could come up with is that she dropped the ball on her end and now I'm left   The office wont budge and I fear that this will end up in collections. It's a small amount, but it's twice what my copay would have been and I literally live paycheck to paycheck, on the penny. I don't know what else I can do from here. Is there a way to dispute it without going through the office?"	No
Is this illegal if it's ongoing? For example, I'll be up after the quiet hours so maybe 2 am getting a glass of water and I'll accidentally drop something on the floor. Then my neighbour from upstairs will come down and start knocking.  I'm in Vancouver, BC	No
I recently broke my lease and moved out of my house after about 9 to 10 months because the house had so many problems and the landlord refused to fix them.  The landlord actually agreed to terminate the lease early without penalty.  However, the landlord notified us that she's keeping our $4000 security deposit and sent a long itemized list of all kinds of repairs she made to the house with a blanket labor cost of $50/hr.  She charged the same labor cost for cleaning windows as she did for refinishing an antique wood vanity...  Although we've requested it, she has not provided any invoices or receipts for any of these repairs.  It seems that she just created a spreadsheet and assigned random dollar values and labor times/costs to all of these repairs, and possibly did them herself if they happened at all.  (The damages she says we're responsible for are completely outrageous considering we lived in the house for less than a year and are very tidy people, but that's beside the point of this post)  She also charged us $520 in locksmithing fees because she moved to New York with her only spare key and needed to hire a locksmith for her friend to show the house to potential tenants, but our lease stated to lock the keys in the house on move out.  Are there any laws requiring her to hire out this work and provide proof of the cost to her?	No
According to our lease, our ex landlord was supposed to bill us each month for water for 2/7 of the bill for the entire house(it was a duplex and were supposed to be billed for number of people in our unit vs total number of people in the house). Not once did he send a bill to us for the entire year despite our numerous documented requests for the water bill. Our lease has been up for two months now and our ex landlord is now saying he will keep the deposit and will settle the balance for the water with that, and will send us the remainder or bill us for the amount still owed depending on how much the water bill comes to. My SO and I do not trust him at all to bill us the correct amount and want him to send us the deposit that we are owed in full, and then bill us for the water, so we are going to send a debt validation letter to him via certified mail using a template we found online. Will this be enough to cover our asses in small claims court if he does not send verification of our water bill and/or does not return our deposit? What else should we be doing?	No
Hi legaladvice,  Last night I was out with friends and drank a bit too much. Called for an Uber car, a driver pulled up to the spot we were waiting at and claimed he was from Uber.  I gave him my address and he claimed the ride would be $75 when it should have only been $25 max. He agreed to $25 and asked for my debit card and runs it through his limo company's app, asking me to sign. I did not sign. I wake up this morning to a charge for $75. Ive already called my bank and explained that:  1) I was overcharged 2) I did not agree to $75  3) If there is a signature, it is not mine.  Ive already started the dispute process. Will they side with me?	No
So my fiance has two kids with his ex he has only gotten to see one of them once and hasn't gotten to see either of them in over a year last year he asked to see them he did ask if he needed to bang on her door to be able to see them ( witch he should have put differently) when he asked that she took him to court stating she was afraid for her life and the judge granted her  with a retraining order now we live in another state but the order is over and he really wants to be apart of their lives what can he do	No
I am an international student currently enrolled in a University in CA. I had signed up for a 1 year lease for accommodation for my stay here. No actual pictures / sq-footage was provided upon request before I signed the lease but the place had great reviews on yelp/g-maps so we decided to go ahead given that there was a shortage of accomodations. Unfortunately upon arrival the place was too small for all of us, and we asked a few students if we can bail on the lease against the security deposit, to which we were informed that it does happen at times and shouldnt be a problem (I should have taken legal advice here itself).  Based on this info we decided to take a new place and signed up another lease for a year, and then decided to break the older place's lease (I wanted to break the lease before signing a new one but there is a shortage of accomodation so we decided to take this step first) - but the landlord has threatened to sue me if I do that. I am looking for alternative roommates to take my spot and settle this peacefully if I can. We cannot afford 2 places and are already burneded with student loans. Upon discussing this with a few friends, I have been suggested to default on the lease and handover possession of the apartment but I don't want to be sued for a lot more money than the actual rent.  Regarding defaults, the lease basically states that : 1. Failure of me paying rent / agreeing to this contract classifies as a default. 2. 3 days after owner gives a written notice (demanding that I pay rent or quit or cure default or quit pursuant to CCP Sec 1161 and 1162), this lease can be terminated at owners option, provided I fail to comply with owners demand. 3. After termination, owner shall have resident expressly grants to owner (what does this even mean?), the right to enter and take possession of the premises, exclude resident there from and store for 30 days, then sell the resident's surrendered personal property located therein.  Please advice, does it make sense to surrender ownership? Will I face legal trouble? Do I have any other options? I come from a poorer country and paying rent for 2 places is not going to be easy :(	No
"Hello everybody - I need some advice.  We recently bought an apartment in a condo built in the late 50s. The floors are original hardwood, subflooring, joists, some air space, and plaster ceilings. There is also a rule that requires wall to wall carpeting throughout all units except for a couple that, for some strange reason, were allowed to put engineered hardwood and keep it.   Prior to moving in, the VP on the condo board (that happens to live in the unit below ours) sent a quite menacing email to the other board members and, by mistake, to me, urging them to make sure that if replacing the carpet, I would get high quality carpet, that it had to be inspected and approved by the building manager and meet a specific IIC rating (all things not mentioned anywhere in the bylaws). My wife and I shrugged this off but bought good quality carpeting and padding that met the ""not official"" requirements anyway because we didn't want to cause trouble (although longing for hardwood) until only recently.   We just found out that the menacing VP is actually one of the unit owners with hardwood ( and he also lives above another unit), that the carpeting rule was lifted right when he and another owner decided to place hardwood and was reinstated shortly after, and that another unit is being sold with hardwood floors (a third unit with hardwood that no one knew about). All of this while we long for hardwood.  Has anybody been in such a situation? We really want to put hardwood and I understand the carpeting is being placed for soundproofing, but then everybody should have it. If some units can be without it he. It means that it's not such a problem. It feels like we are being played. Placing new hardwood flooring with good underpad and an 80% carpet covering rule just like every other condo I know about should be enough (and apparently is, for the downstairs VP and the other units with it). It seems that the condo board has only acted in the interest of its members and its very disappointing.   Thanks for any advice!"	No
I had no idea how to title the post well, because it's all very odd to me. I've been separated from my husband for over 4 years now. I haven't seen or spoken to him in over 3 of those years. I have no idea where he's living, and divorce has been complicated to try and start. This isn't about a divorce though. I just had a child with another man, and I didn't know anything about paternity laws in my state. I live in Oklahoma and found out after delivery that if I'm married my husband is the legally presumed father of my child and my childs actual father cannot be put on the birth certificate or be the legal father. I now know he has to sign a denial of paternity and the biological father has to sign an acceptance. The issue is, I have no way to get my husband to sign the form. To my knowledge, he's still living out of state in California but I have no idea where other than the state. What actions can I take to get him to sign this form? Is there any service that can help? Do I need a lawyer?  Edit: A nurse in the hospital suggested that if I absolutely cannot find him to go and file for child support against him because the agency could find him and he could come and deny paternity. I don't exactly think that would work because I'm not sure you can even get child support while still married, plus I know he's not the father and that would make the whole ordeal odd.	No
I bought a house beside a church parking lot that the church goers rarely use because there is a closer parking lot, so there's usually no need for anyone to use this back lot. Since living here a year I've seen prostitution (front row view right from my kitchen window while cooking), drug deals, teenagers doing donuts driving dangerously close to my house in the lot, people setting off large fireworks, all sorts of things. Yesterday was the kicker. I had to risk physical harm approaching a vehicle with an overdosing driver that still had his foot on the gas headed straight for my house where my daughter was inside to prevent him from plowing into it.   I plan to speak to the church's pastor and see if we can find a solution but I wanted to ask here first if anyone has any advice to offer. Is a mostly abandoned lot considered an attractive nuisance, and do I have any recourse to keep my family safe if they can't help resolve this? Thanks in advance!	No
"My parents are being evicted from the home they're renting. Long story short, they're in dispute with the landlord and decided not to pay the rent (which I advised against) and are being served their eviction notice.  While home, my mother heard a man continuously and loudly knocking on the door as if he was trying to break it down yelling ""I have the eviction notice!""   She was frightened and did not answer.  At that point the courier went to the backyard of the property and started knocking on the windows and the glass doors.   After that point, he went back to the front of the house and started yelling ""I'll bring the cops and tell all of your neighbors you're being evicted!""  Is the way this was handled legal? I told my mom to record the situation if it happens again."	No
"I recently signed a contract for a new construction home expected to close in December 2017.   The financing section of the contract states ""If buyer intends to use a lender other than designated lender, buyer shall cause said lender to execute an ""outside lender addundum"" within seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract, one the form prepared by seller, and buyer shall provide seller and escrow holder with a copy thereof within such seventy-two (72) hours after the date of this contract.""  Does this mean after 72 hours, I am stuck with the designated lender and can't shop around for a mortgage with different lenders?"	No
So I worked at the Cotton Patch for about 3 weeks before they fired me because it's brand new and they hired too many people. Our first pay check was training, we made minimum wage during this time, so the company took the liberty of making us pay $35.00 for two shirts and an apron. Fast forward to my boss firing me for a random reason and asking for the uniform back before my next paycheck. I was so confused about why I was fired that I didn't think to ask if I'd be reimbursed. Do I have the right to ask for the money back and are they obligated to give it to me? Surely, it just opened and they already want it back...	No
Our landlord lives in another state and will be in town this weekend.  He wants to see that the mower does not work, our bathroom sink is actually leaking, and hopefully to fix them.  However, he wants to come while we're at work.  Is this legal?  He has already tried to change the due date for rent from what his lease specifies; he does not seem to know landlord laws very well . Thank you!	No
More hypothetical. I am moving into a new apartment soon, and a friend told me that that same complex kept charging him random fees. He didn't tell me what kinds of fees, though. Is a landlord in Texas allowed to charge you fees that are not stipulated in your lease? I guess that may include late fees when you pay on time, maintenance fees, etc.   Thanks!	No
I'm trying to get some advice for my roommates sister, and I only have the basic run down. Her sisters son died from Bacterial Meningitis, and was sick for about 2 weeks before it happened. They were controlling it with Motrin, but his fever got worse and they took him into the ER after a couple days of him not improving. He had a 103 fever upon arrival, and they just told him to keep giving him Motrin and released him. They never ran any further tests finding out that he had that, and the next day he continued to just not really wake up, and continued to look in bad shape. They took him into another hospital the next morning after being released from the ER, and they wound up admitting him and had to put him on life support that same night. 24 hours later, they pronounced him brain dead.   I just don't see any way the ER should NOT have admitted him, and possibly been able to save his life. Would they potentially be on the hook for this?	No
 Was married a bit over 4.5 years, separated in Dec 2014. I filed in June 2016 for dissolution. We have no kids, she had a BA from UCLA before we married, didn't work during our marriage,  got her MA while we were separated, and got everything she asked the court for. I supported her for 13 months while we were separated. In that 13 months, she got $42,000.00 worth of support. I am active duty military, we don't get paid that much, so this amount of money is pretty big to me. Before we got married, she was arrested for assaulting me inn my barracks room. She took a plea for disturbing the peace. The judge still ordered I pay half of a college bill, which I never benefited from since she never worked, and pay her $1,800.00 a month for the next 14 months. I literally can not afford that. I provided my bank statements, for the last 3 years, as evidence, but I don't think the judge even looked at them. They had cover sheets with everything already calculated as to who got what, and highlighted. It would have been very easy to look through and see what I had paid her already. How can I be ordered to support someone so much when they were arrested, and convicted? How can I appeal, our file a motion for reconsideration, when I literally can't afford any of the options? How am I going to support my current wife and two step sons? Please, help me!	No
That is California, not Canada.  I purchased my condo about 4 years ago and I've been consistently receiving first-class mail addressed to what is apparently a business the previous owner ran. I usually tossed them but opened a few out of curiosity and they apparently owe import taxes to the state.  I've sent the agency emails stating it's the old resident and in fact, a quick google easily finds their new address. I've also called and left a message stating the same yet the letters keep coming and today, I received a certified letter (addressed to their business name with my address) which I rejected.  Is there the possibility they'll place a lien on my property? Or anything else? Or am I ok to continue ignoring the notices? Thank you.	No
My 27 y/o brother was in a car accident last Thursday. It's pretty serious. He has some fractures, broken bones, and a severe head trauma that has caused him to fall into a coma. He is currently in stable but serious condition in a neuro ICU room.  My family and I have been left in shambles because of my brother's accident. We are trying to collect all of his things to store away since we know he's going to be in recovery for a long while.   My brother is 27, unmarried, and living with room mates. According to the police station and tow company, the vehicle cannot be released nor the items removed by anyone but my brother or his power of attorney. The storage rental place said the same thing as well.    my brother did not have a living will or other documents pertaining to if he were to be unable to make his own decisions. We can't access any of his personal belongings to get necessary items like his keys and glasses. We aren't allowed the code to access his unit despite my brother having the same last name as my brother.   Is there ANYTHING we can do to be able to access my brother's belongings, there are several very important and sentimental items that will be lost forever or stolen if we don't get access and some of that means a lot to my brother and I.   If it helps, my mom, my father, and I all signed at least one medical document since the accident. My father is handling the insurance and health insurance portion, my mom is going back home to Florida because she still has a job and needs to keep it so it leaves my dad and I as the remaining two who can take responsibility but I'm fully ready to let my dad handle the legal aspect of my brother's recovery.	No
Last night I received a 3 Day pay or quit notice. As my landlord has never had a problem with me paying on the 20th for the last 2 years, I believe this isn't about the rent being late but about ending my tenancy as quickly as possible. I am currently month to month.   If I pay before end of day on the last day noted, can he still follow through with eviction on Monday or would he have to serve me with a 30 day notice to continue eviction at that point?	No
"&gt; Just wondering what legally I can do. I found out tonight after work that my apartment requires me &amp; my cat &amp; dog vacate my apartment mon from 9 am - 6pm. And that I ""deep clean"" my kitchen and bathroom, as well as clear out my cabinets and counter tops and have everything pushed from my wall or be faced with a $100 fine. Problem is, I'm single and alone in Texas - no boyfriend or family and I work in the service industry. I work from 9am - 11pm Saturday &amp; Sunday leaving me NO time to clean OR find accommodations. I have no clue where I'm supposed to go on Monday all day especially with a cat.  Im hourly and broke and cannot afford any extra expenses this month and they gave me zero time to figure something out. What are my rights?! Can I make them put me up in a pet friendly hotel?"	No
More info: property and divorce is in TX. Squatters rights are strong here.  Decree was not signed by him, but the judge approved it anyway due to abuse. Language is slightly ambiguous around timeframe to refi. No deed to secure assumption was drawn or filed, but a general warranty deed was.   A criminal and 2 family lawyers have said I am liable  with no option to reclaim the house or force ex to refinance and must wait him out. I am unable to purchase property or be approved for a loan or line of credit for any amount (at least not without APR north of 25 if approved at all) and he has dropped my credit score by 200+ points.   Is there any hope of filing a civil suit for breach of contract, pain and suffering due to damages on my credit history and major life impact, or anything to that effect? I just want to be completely separated from him. I don't even want the house or the money, although if he makes me drag him to court for months I'll fight for it. I've never asked for a dime. Only asked him to sell (and keep the $70K+ profit!) or refinance on his own. He refuses. It's been 7 years.   Help! I'm desperate!!!!	No
My boyfriends parents, but my mom and dad enough in heart.  Dad (50) has been fighting for disability for over 7yrs, but the first 2 were spent in VA and somehow there is suddenly no record of the doctors appointment had back then. Bad genes and work injury and mental health issues. He's been unable to work. They have been in more than poverty since moving from VA to GA. Mom (51) has been working as best she can with existing fibromialga, diabetes, and having had 2 heart attacks to this point in life. She shouldn't be working, but someone has had to. Little more than a year ago, she got hurt on the job, and while in the midst of a high pay out court case, their house burnt down. Lightning in a midnight April storm. Everything gone but the car that was in a mostly disconnected garage. She wasn't home, but dad &amp; the pets were. They all survived, but the thing was that they could barely put food on the table and gas in the car with other bills to pay on what few hours mom could work in her pained state, so of course they had no home insurance. Mom had to accept a tiny payout and just give up on her case for lack of funds, mental ability, and physical ability to deal with everything.  They were homeless, living in and out of their garage til winter, couch sleeping with not so great family, until a few months ago. Finally got the acres sold that the house had been on. That was April. They got into a rental recently after going about trying to find a place to buy/rent. They ended up having to get a car, they paid off debts, she got a credit card to work on credit to get a loan for a house. They didn't get any substantial amount from the property. They are mostly out of money now, they were sure this disability situation would be sorted out by now, but it's not. It's the absolute opposite. They are facing homelessness again, losing their vehicle, losing their pets, and their minds at this point.  I've not seen the letter about the denial of back pay. I live 3hours away, but will see it in a week. I'm not in the position to help outside of moral support and helping her keep her head on track. She's called government entities, she's got a couple letters to right, I was told she could write a 'Letter of Need' and take it to the social security office... They are in their 50s. I was homeless at 18 and pregnant, to boot. I remember how that was... I can't begin to imagine how this is all impacting them beyond the face they try to keep up for the sake of looking strong.  Now... I have to apologize for going on and one. Here is where I ask for options? Suggestions? They are in Union County. For what that's worth. I couldn't even find a way to fight a divorce I just went through, I've been unable to find them any kind of legal support being so far away.   They need hope..	No
I'm considering leaving my husband. I go back and forth on that issue, but one of the biggest points of consideration is that I am a stay at home mom and we live in Hawaii. There is zero chance I would be able to leave him and find a job that pays enough here for me to afford a place for my son and I. Even with child support, it simply isn't attainable or would be a quality of life I would want for us. I would really like to move back to the mainland. I'm not sure where yet; it will depend on where I find work.   Will I get into legal trouble if I move to another state with our son without my husband?	No
Hello r/legalavice, You have been helpful in the past, and I am now one the verge of solving a major headache in my house.  Here is a little background: My daughter was born when I was 17.  I am now 33.  I was able to pull my life together, her mother was not.  Approximately three years ago I took full physical (shared legal) custody of my daughter in order to remove her from a toxic environment.  She is now 16 years old.  We have been dealing with a wide range of behavioral issue, some which got better and some that did not.  It boils down to that we have high expectations and rigid rules in our house, and she is either unable to unwilling to follow them.  My wife and I are constantly fighting with her, and our marriage is also taking a lot of collateral damage because of it.  My daughter's mother is a very toxic person.  She has 9 children to 4 men, she has stolen money from my daughter, she give my daughter panic attacks when my daughter refuses to let her borrow money now, she lives in a very small 2 bedroom house with a rotation of unpleasant men etc. etc.. When my daughter moved out of her moms, it was because her mom was drinking heavily, having intercourse loudly in the living room, and yelling incoherently at my daughter.  This has been documented in our previous custody modification.  Since she moved out of her moms house three years ago, her mother has had very little contact with her and rarely gets her on her scheduled weekends.  I will answer any more questions that anyone has, but for the sake of brevity I will move on.    My daughter, me, and my wife are constantly fighting.  My wife only really got to know my daughter when she moved in three years ago, and despite their best efforts they have been unable to form a relationship.  My daughter is constantly lying to us and breaking our rules.  She came to us last week with a proposition.  A mutual friend has offered to let Jasmine rent a room at her house.  Our friend's daughter is also best friends with my daughter.  I would pay the $300 a month rent, my daughter would be about two miles away from where I live, and she would not have to change schools.  The family friends suggested we try it for six months and see how it goes.  I am familiar with her house and neighborhood.  She lives in a well appointed condo.  She is a single mom with a teenage daughter of her own and a 12 year old.  I am presently working out the details, but it looks like this could be a good solution for everyone involved.  I texted my daughters mother to let her know about the arrangement, and instantly she went on the offensive.  When I took custody of my daughter, I removed a chunk of child support from her income stream.  She has never quite forgotten it, and I think she would jump at the opportunity to get the income back.  The problem is that she is an absolute nightmare of a person, and my daughter living in her home would guarantee my failure as a father.  I have screenshots of the conversations where the mother is trying to borrow money and my daughter is begging her not to be mad at her.  I have the original documents I filed telling the story of how we found her on the side of the road at 11pm the night her mom had alcohol fueled intercourse in the living room.    If I allow this move to happen, am I opening up the potential for losing custody?  If this goes to court, what are the chances a judge would side with the mother?  Can she stop this from happening at all?	No
Hello all.  As the title says, my grandmother as of this morning is unable to use her shower (bath/shower) because she can't lift her leg over the tub to get in.   Her building manager says there's nothing they can do.  She's lived there for about 10 years now.    I realize that it's a bad situation for everyone involved, but are they required by law to accommodate her at all?  This is in Metro Detroit.   Thank you.	No
Pretty much the title. My mom rents a house and her last tenants didn't pay rent last month and moved out. It was the end of their lease and they didn't tell me they were moving out until they were already gone. I'm pretty sure they haven't paid the water bill either which for some inexplicable reason my parents left in their name.  He is basically ignoring me at this point, I've emailed him and will try calling once I can get his number from the realtor (assuming he even has it).  How do I go about finding him and getting my money? By the way, I don't have a copy of the signed lease, long story short, he never gave it back to me.	No
My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	No
"My sister's husband received his fifth DUI about a month ago while working out of town in Wisconsin. The court has ruled that he has to return to WI to serve time in September for six months to a year. This is his second time in jail and it has left him bitter and unpredictable towards my sister.  Last Friday night, he took the two kids to his parents house and refused to return them. He told my sister she could not have them and would not give her the gate code. She ended up calling the police and they told her since they were not separated, they could not bring the children back. This was the first time she ever called them because she feared that he  was lying and attempting to run off with them. When she let them know that he was an alcoholic about to go to jail, they told her they would investigate and if he had alcohol on him then they would call CPS to bring the kids back. Except, the police told him they were coming to check on him so he and his family hid any alcohol before they got there. The next day when he finally came back with the children, the oldest told my sister that his father had been drunk all night. He and his family claims my sister is ""crazy"" and that the police agreed. Now we fear that if the police truly said that then we have no help.  His actions make me fearful for the kids. There was a time once when he was caught trying to put one of the children in the backseat of  car while he was intoxicated. My sister caught him and stopped it. Though once they are separated and she's not there to monitor him, I'm afraid he'll do it again.  Now my sister refuses to leave because she wants to keep the house (even though I doubt she'll be able to pay for it with him gone). Does she have any rights to kick him out or keep the house while he's in jail? She is already filing for separation. The house is in a loan under his name but her name is also on the deed. What are her options for the next year as far as establishing custody and child support? I know documenting everything is an option. I guess I'm just wondering if there's anything else I should know."	No
As a tenant, is it my responsibility to water the grass? The lease does not explicitly say we take care of lawn care. It does not say that the landlord takes care of it. We were watering the new sod to be nice, but now that the front has browned (not sure why) he says it's in our lease that we water? I told him earlier in the week that the grass was browning, and we needed some grass feed for it. I'm trying not to make enemies here, but also don't want to be on the hook for failed sod. :(	No
I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit or if there's a better one to post under. Background is, I live in UT, divorced, 50/50 custody. 3 children, 2 teens and an 8 year old. My child just came to me with pictures of text conversations and pictures of the edible gummy marijuana that her Dad is using. Marijuana is illegal in UT and its really upset my kids. I am so far out of my element here. I don't know a soul who does drugs, let alone what to do since their Dad is now using them.   I have several concerns. First off, apparently the kids even know who is selling him them. My feelings on marijuana aside (I do beleive it should be legalized), I don't want someone who is obtaining a currently illegal drug and selling them around my kids. Second issue, aparently the 5 times he's admitted to being stoned the kids were with him. Add to the fact he just lost his job, and these seem like red flags to me.    Do I call the police for this? He seems in a downward spiral and no, a conversation won't work. He has no family here and the latest job he lost was working for a friend so I imagine he's low on a support network right now. Would the police even care about drug use with marijuana? He won't see a therapist of any kind, doesn't believe in them. But he needs some type of wake up call.	No
Hello All,   I am not sure this is the right place. If I am wrong please point me in the right direction.   On July 6th a driver hit me on the highway in a road rage incident. I did not go to the hospital as I did not feel any injuries.   Fast forward to today, his insurance company only wants to pay for the damages that their inspector could photograph. I am dropping off the vehicle to a GM dealership on Friday for them to inspect. This is incredibly inconvenient in that I am going to be without a vehicle. He was cited as at fault by the officers. A witness called in while he was trying to run me off the road and was on the phone when he succeeded in doing so.   Will his insurance company have to cover a rental car for me?   The big question: Am I able to receive compensation for the time and inconvenience this has caused?   I am in North Carolina if this helps.	No
"I've been chronically homeless for the last couple of years and have made the journey from NYC to central Connecticut in the hope of finding a more sedate existence. Long story short, I wound up living with these guys in a building that was obviously in disrepair, but that one of them claimed to own and the claim seemed believable due to that's person background.   Come to find out, that's not the case. The place is abandoned, but presumably has an owner who is effectively none of the people I'm living with. We've all only been here a few weeks, but I've already sunk a lot of effort into trying to tidy the place, make it more functional. The situation is obviously not ideal, but I'm reluctant to bounce because of what an otherwise very safe situation it is in the otherwise very unsafe north end of Hartford. I don't have many immediate short term options either.    But is what we're doing illegal? Despite being homeless for awhile now I actually know very little about squatting itself as a practice. I don't believe anyone broke any locks to get in here, but I can't be sure. Would that be the distinction somehow in whether or not this was breaking and entering? What do we do if the owner shows up. What do we do if the owner never shows up? Are we entitled to any sort of notice if they decide to ""evict"" us or would we immediately be arrested? So many factors, but very few actual options, any advice would be appreciated. Also, try not to judge me too harshly. I get that staying on someone else's property and potentially FORCING them to evict you is kind of a dick move. I don't have perfect moral solutions, I'm just doing my best."	No
Here is my situation.   My SO and I live in an apartment complex that allows either one cat OR one dog under 30 lbs. My SO currently has a cat that lives with us, the cat is documented with the rental office and we paid the deposit and pay extra each month.   I am hoping to get an emotional support dog. I do have a diagnosed disability and my therapist and general practitioner are both willing to write a letter for me. I am willing to get a breed fitting the weight limits of the apartment, and I plan to be very involved with training the dog (perhaps to be a certified therapy dog along with being my ESA).   I have seen many posts about getting one ESA in a no pets building, but what about getting a second animal to be an ESA in a 1 pet limit building? Can the management office deny this request or am I protected under the Fair Housing Act?  Honestly I know for a fact that some other people in the complex have multiple cats and I've also seen dogs clearly over the 30 lb. weight limit. I can make a reasonable guess that I could just get the dog without mentioning it at all and nobody would notice, but I'd prefer to go about this the right way and I'm hoping to better understand the legal processes.	No
I was hoping I could get some legal advice from a real estate lawyer on my situation if possible.  In 2009 I purchased a co-op in the NYC suburbs. On February 8th of this year I was evicted because I was sick and out of work and could not make payments for the maintenance and mortgage. I haven't been able to do anything about it until now as I had no one to help and am just getting back on my feet. I had a decent amount of equity at the time, but no idea what the situation is now and cannot afford a lawyer to look into it. Any recommendations on what to do at this point, 4-5 months after eviction? Do you think that there are any lawyers out there that are willing to look into it based on a percentage of money that is recovered?  If you need additional details, please PM me as I don't know what sort of details I should publicly disclose.  Thank you very much in advance!	No
Suburbs of Denver They live in a duplex. Both sisters rent out their own side of the duplex. Sister #2 is getting evicted for not paying rent. Landlord in a text said that the children are not allowed back on the property of Sister #1's side. Is this legal?	No
I work as a waiter in Pembroke Pines, Florida, where minimum wage for someone in my profession is $5.08. My paychecks have been about $35-$40 dollars and i'm definitely working more than 8 hours. I know that if an employee doesn't meet the hourly mark in declared tips  the company makes up the difference. But does it work the other way around? if i'm declaring tips which reach or exceed the appropriate hourly mark are they allowed to cut into my hourly paycheck and give me less than $5?	No
I need to write a complete last will and testament for a college assignment. I have a simple will I wrote by hand but it is barebones. I know it doesn't cover everything and my professor wants this will to be complete. Are there any actually free templates out on the internet? Any tips at all? 	No
Charges are against my ex. Cops/EMS were called for someone else that my ex assaulted (but they never talked to that person or got a statement). I was caught in the crossfire and they were more interested in what happened to me even though it wasn't anything super serious. I don't want to testify for various reasons. I don't want to deal with it anymore or even think about it, (I have an anxiety disorder and PTSD so would like to avoid having to be around him) and I'm sort of afraid of what ex's girlfriend would do to me if he got locked up because she's made threats before. Ex already has two felony convictions for drugs and served time in prison because of it.  I'm not sure how the process works, but I have to be there tomorrow. Would I get any charges or anything for refusing to testify against him?	No
At least once per month, we get a knock on the door from individuals saying they're from Comcast or CenturyLink and they request to go into our backyard. We've heard from our neighbors that they've attempted to access our backyard when we are not home. We have two dogs that have access to a doggie door that could potentially bite if someone accesses the backyard.   I expressed my frustration to the contractor that came to the door today and he said that there are easement rights they have so I cannot refuse access. Is this correct?	No
Essentially to make a long story short I work for my states welfare office Indiana, I came across some pay stubs that looked fake so I reviewed them and found an identical template by searching for fake pay stub templates. I informed my supervisor and was told to process them normally whether they are fake or not is not my problem because everyone lies to us. So I accepted the documents and processed them and notated my findings and my supervisors response. Essentially I knowingly accepted fraudulent documents due to my supervisors instructions. Can my employer fire me for this? Am I in anyway liable if they are determined to be forged documents since I accepted them during the eligibility determination process ?	No
Hi  In Melbourne, Australia. I signed a letter of acceptance to sell my house privately to a company that buys houses for clients, the offer letter but was bound by conditions (I had to pay for contracts and get the house inspection done).   I decided not to go through with the sale after finding out the buyers were a very dodgy company (owner has been sued for false information to both sellers and buyers).  Today I got a letter saying they will be seeking legal advice if I don't continue with the sale.  No contracts made by a solicitor / lawyer have been signed, only a offer letter signed that was made by the owner of the company.  Am I screwed and have I lost everything? I pretty much live with a bank account that's always $0, so hiring a real lawyer is not an option :'(	No
"I live in an apartment and the house it's in is being sold.  I'm looking for a new place to live but until then, there are going to be some open house showings and I can't be here for all of them.  I have Nest cameras in my apartment already.  My intent is to have them running 24/7 when I can not be here and have a posted notice at the entrance that says ""Premises are subject to video and audio recording.""  Or something along those lines.  MA is a two party consent state for audio recordings.  So my notice will serve to inform anyone who enters.  Any issues I might run into?"	No
"Hey friends, would love the community's thoughts on my situation.   I own and operate an ecommerce store. We're currently talking to a well-known artist about licensing his work to use on our merchandise.   The artist's licensing people have asked for a proposed royalty, advance, and guarantee. I'm trying to calculate these figures in a way that makes sense. In the last 30 days, our top 400 products generated a total of $1900 in sales per product (over $20k annualized). We plan on licensing over 500 designs from the artist. What sort of calculation needs to happen here?   My understanding is that a royalty of about 15% is appropriate give the fame of the artist and the fact that I operate a sort of ""specialty shop."" I've heard a $25k advance for an artist's catalog makes sense. But what about the guarantee?   We only have an online presence (only retail, no wholesale).   Does anyone have any experience in this area? Many thanks in advance."	No
I'm confused about the nj labor laws, as I understand it i should be getting time and a half, but I'm only getting time and getting paid as though it's on the books, in cash.  Is this legal? Can i do anything about this legally?	No
"Hired about a month ago and the boss asked me during my interviews what my political views are. We were on separate sides and we both agreed it wouldn't be an issue. So today I tell him how I've met a potential client by discussing politics and agreeing with someone at a bar. He states ""you'll never succeed with that mindset"". I ask to further discuss this and to explain. He tries to sway me and I tell him politely I still believe what I previously stated. I then ask him ""you're thinking about firing me over this, aren't you?"" sure enough he says yes and that we'll talk about it tomorrow. At least I got to go home early so there's that.   Anyways if I do end up getting fired is there anything I can actually do about this? I've tried to do some research but it all seems like a case by case basis."	No
Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I am having issues with my ex-landlord. I live in WA state. This is posted in TFBL too.  I moved out of my old apartment on June 12th. No issues. Lease was up June 28th. I got my move out statement from my ex-landlord, and he is demanding I pay to replace the carpets. I have asked for documentation, like receipts and pictures, and the likes of that, for the past almost 2 months and the documentation he has supplied has either been incorrect, or not what I have asked for (i.e. pictures of the carpets, and he sends me pictures of behind the fridge) He is charging over $2,000 to replace carpets for about 550 sqft. He gave me the original receipt for the carpets which would make them about 9 years old, and then went on to state the carpets were 17 years old, and had 20 years of life, and then said the carpets were actually 9 years old.   My biggest problem, is that he broke the lease, and allowed a new tenant to move in on the 16th of June, and did not include that in the move out receipt as well had no intention of prorating the rent. He says the new tenant moved in on the 20th, and he had quote for the new carpets done on the 20th as well. He sent me a new statement and explanation this week, and stated he has not yet replaced the carpets, and hasn't even treated the carpets or done anything besides a basic cleaning between tenants. He stated he is replacing the carpets while the new tenant is in the unit in August. He can't provide proof that I damaged the carpets (I have pictures of the carpets, they were fine, free from stains and other damage) and now the new tenant has had the opportunity to damage the carpets. Basically what it comes down to is that I don't think he can charge me for any maintenance, or repairs, etc. that happen after a new lease is effect? Should I take this to small claims court instead of continuing to try and settle this?  Any help or advice is appreciated. I am at my wits end with this guy.	No
I finally moved out from the apartment and all my belongings were safe and sound. Before the move out period, however, she made some insults and neglected her duty of keeping the place clean.   She's asking me about $500 for the extra week's stay, $150 for the labor for installation, and electricity bill that came when she specified that previous one was the last one I had to pay.  Now, none of these were written on the paper and I don't think I am legally required to make these payments. She still hasn't apologized and what not. Should I just move on with my life and not pay her a cent? (I did pay for the door cost and transportation for the door)  She originally tried to rip me off by adding personal purchases onto the recipt and overcharging the whole cost and now she's down to all minimums.	No
I live in Cutler Bay Florida. Comcast is digging a trench in my back yard to run conduit and cut right through the main copper water line to my home.   I contacted Miami-Dade Water &amp; Sewer and they let me know that the line was my responsibility since it was on my property.  Comcast has a plumber coming out to fix the line.  I want to make sure I have everything covered in case the repair isn't done properly and something happens some time in the future with the line.  What steps should I take to make sure that I don't end up paying for an expensive water line repair in the future because of Comcast's incompetence?	No

"Situation: I am moving in (this week) to a new apartment, my roommate is moving in tonight, and she has been to the place today. We were initally allowed to move in 8/1, but that was pushed back a day because it was not ready yet. This part we have already discussed with our broker, and we are getting a day prorated back.    When she arrived today, the apartment had not yet been cleaned (we are told cleaners are coming today, so hopefully that is being taken care of while we are at work).   Prior to moving in, our broker and the previous tenant both told us that we would be getting a new stove for when we moved in. Apparently the super checked it out, and claims ""it works"" so he did not replace it, but would replace it if it did not work. My roommate checked it out, and the stove top works, but the oven does not work at all. I had her take a video of it not working, but I want to know what else I can do to ensure this is taken care of?  Our apartment is rent stabilized, so I have a feeling he did not replace it prior to us moving in so that it not working is our responsibility, and add the cost of the new appliance onto our rent.  I know I am dealing with a shady character here, so I want to go about this as professionally as I can. I am having my roommate document the apartment with all the pictures she can. I also had her keep all receipts for cleaning supplies she picked up on her way to the apartment. What else can I do to make sure we have a functional appliance without us being responsible for the cost?"	No
" Background info that you need to know: My dad has physically abused me for basically my entire life, and my mom their entire marriage (has become a lot less frequent in the later years of their marriage, but he still threatens her with a raised hand. Also, she has kind of learned not to speak out against him because she understands the physical threat that he poses to her). Up until recently I just took the abuse and did nothing about it, but over the past year and a half or so I've been standing up for myself and threatening to dial 9-1-1 if he stepped closer (first time I did this was when he was threatening to beat me with a bat because i accidentally lost one of his papers -- locked the door and put the phone up to the window so he could see) and even using my own strength to stop him from hitting me - not hitting back, just using my arms to hold his down.  Also, my dad has been financially abusive his entire life. My mother works 5 days a week and makes almost as much money as he does on top of the countless hours of housework that she does and the abuse that she has to go through from him, and still she is barely ever allowed to spend money on anything for herself. Every penny she spends is policed by my dad and he goes so far as to make her return things that he does not approve of. He barely gives me any money to spend (probably has given me on average like 5 bucks every 2 months -- he hasn't even given me a birthday present or a graduation present or anything), which isn't such a big deal on its own and honestly it may seem like I'm complaining about a first-world problem and sound like a little brat but what makes it awful is that he did not allow my sisters and me to get jobs while each of us were in high school (although with some convincing I managed to get permission to get one near the end of my senior year of high school, but I couldn't find a job all throughout the summer), so basically we all wanted money to spend but he would not let us work nor would he give us money. He's even been known to take money from us that we received from other family members on special occasions, which is why we've learned to hide our money even around our own house.  Also, he makes every decision in the household for both himself and my mother and she plays a very small role in any of those decisions if any at all, even though she is a breadwinner just like he is. He threatens her with physical abuse or raises his voice at her if she doesn't comply with what he chooses to do, and eventually she just gives in like always.  I planned to move into my college dorm (university is in NJ) on the 31st of September to start my freshman year of college. The payment for my first semester costs, including tuition and housing and everything, is due on the 17th of August, and it's not small amount of money that I can pull out of nowhere in 7 days. --------------------------------------  So, over the past few months, things have been getting pretty heated between me and my dad. I don't see him much during the day, but on the occasion that I'd still be awake when he came back from work, we'd usually fight about something, and the fights have been getting more and more frequent.  Tonight, my whole family was in the car on the way back from an event, and he asks me about my roommate, and somehow, like always, one thing leads to another and we're arguing with each other again. He says to me ""Ok, well if this is how it's going to be, then we're not going to be paying for your college. You're on your own."" I told him to stop using the word ""we"" as if my mom had any choice to make in the first place -- I told him to say what he truly meant and use the word ""I"", because everyone knows it's only him that makes any big decision like that ever and speaks on behalf of both my parents. Even though my mom makes her own money, if she wanted to pay for my college fees, she wouldn't be able to because my dad would not allow her -- or at least she feels too threatened to try anything like that. We usually have this argument and it blows over in a few days, except this time I went even further and told him that he basically ruined my life and called him out for physically, mentally, and emotionally abusing me throughout my entire life and doing the same to my mother throughout their entire marriage. This got him especially upset, and as we were coming out of the car, he rushed to the back, clearly very angry, and I knew straight away what he was about to try and do, so I locked the door and punched in 9-1-1 on my phone and showed him. Eventually, I got out of the car safely, but he would not let me back in.   So yeah, after much threatening over the years, my dad had finally kicked me out of the house for the first time ever. I called up one of my friends but by the time he got to my house (about 2 hours ago) my mom told me she wanted me to come in and just say sorry to my dad, but there was no way I was going back inside there, so I just left for a little and my friend and I hungout and I planned to stay over his house for the night like he had offered, but my mom wanted me back home and had convinced my dad to let me stay, so I just went back. And now here I am, typing all of this that literally just happened and my dad's upstairs and things are extremely heated between us and this is the first time that I'm actually legitimately concerned about what's going to happen in my future after a threat from my dad, because our argument tonight actually went way beyond the level that it usually does.  I still have to get a new phone and laptop for college which my dad had promised me, so that's also a problem, because I doubt he's going to be paying for those things any time soon. I'm going to ask my mom to help me out on her own without my dad but I know it's possible she might not agree because she would not even think of going against my dad's word. As I mentioned before, the payment is due on the 17th of August and I do not think between now and then that my dad will change his mind about paying for it, and even if he does, I do not want to remain under his fiscal control like my sisters have all throughout their college years, because they go through hell whenever they want to make a decision about their lives and I don't want to put myself in that situation. I'm completely lost, I have no clue what to do. Please help.  P.S. sorry if there's a lot of useless information in here, I just wanted to put the stuff about my dad because it seemed to me like a lot of it was illegal and it might help. Also, I'm just a complete mess of emotions and my thoughts are running crazy right now."	No
"I recently received a strike on my Soundcloud for posting a remix/cover to ""Drake - Do Not Disturb"" I didn't however have the mechanical license for the song. If I buy the license and obtain it, will I be able to fight the strike and remove it? Location: Florida"	No
I recently bought a used Subaru with 118k miles, with the knowledge that a high mileage service need to be performed on it. Before I bought it, I called my local Subaru dealer to see if they had any service info on the specific vehicle. They looked up the VIN and confirmed that they had performed all the work on the car for the past 50k miles. They listed off the past couple years of services that they had done on the car, and nothing major came up, just typical stuff like spark plugs, oil changes, etc. I bought the car, and took it in yesterday to have the service performed, and I get a call from them saying it has a misfire requiring the replacement of the entire valve train, totaling $3,200, in addition to the other service. The mechanic told me that they pulled up the service history, and just a month ago it had been brought in for spark plugs when they diagnosed the misfire. The previous owner traded it in because of that, to an unrelated Ford dealer.  The misfire is in the service history that was not disclosed to me when I checked with them before I purchased it. I'm not sure if the $3,200 quote would be in the history, but I can find out. The call may have been recorded but I don't know where I'd check. Is there anything here that can help me?	No
"I originally posted this in /r/boston and was directed here instead.  I took a look at my electric bill this morning, and noticed that SFE Energy (one of those companies that goes door-to-door to discuss energy options) has apparently been providing my energy through Eversource since November. I usually just login, see the amount due, and pay online without taking a look at the finer details of my bill. Last week I did look at my bill, and noticed SFE was listed as my energy provider. I distinctly remember them coming to my door around October or November last year, and I freely admit to talking with one guy, asking my name, etc, but after 5 minutes or so I told them I wasn't interested. I kept the original agreement, incomplete and unsigned, and shredded it later that day. I called them to inquire, they had no email address for me on file, have never mailed/emailed me before, and they finally emailed me with a copy of my ""original"" agreement only, and the signature is forged.  Since my initial post earlier this morning, I have spoke to one of their customer service reps over the phone, and was asked to forward over proof of my signature such as from my license, which I have now done. What's the best course of action to take? Obviously, I want to be removed from their services, but I do have any recourse to be reimbursed for the money that was spent on their services? Is there a police report to be filed against the rep for the forgery?"	No
One of my neighbors (either the one directly behind me or the one directly above me) smokes a lot. It is annoying. You can smell it mostly in the bathrooms but it isn't unusual for it to permeate throughout the house. The bathroom also gets very smokey. Not like smell but obviously smokey.   My son has a lung disorder and the smoke  often leaves him up at night coughing. It is frustrating. I usually go to my parents or to a hotel but the cost of the hotel will be prohibitive after a while and I'd like to stay in the apartment I rent since I pay for it.    I've talked to management who says that although I specifically requested and got  a no smoking unit, that they made no promise that the adjacent units would be smoke free.   The smoke at some points is enough to set off our smoke detectors nearest the guest bathroom. Usually when we are asleep. I complained to the apartment but their response was to send maintenance out to remove the smoke alarm which is near the bedroom and needs to remain there.  So I asked them to put it back up. The office manager suggested just removing the battery. It goes off a couple of times a week, usually after 10 when we are asleep when whoever starts chain smoking. Around that time, we either leave and go to my parents or we go to the opposite end of the apartment to sleep with the window open.   One of the types of smoking they do is illegal in my state so I've reported them to the police who never come out.   I have looked in my lease and there is no way to break it.   I've tried to talk to the neighbor I think it is because he smokes and leaves dropping everywhere over the building (hallway, porches, etc) who basically told me to get lost and never knock on his door again. He dared me to call the police. Which I did but they again have not come out.   Obviously, my son's health is more important than an apartment lease but I don't make enough money to really break it as they are saying I'll be responsible or the whole of the lease. We've only been there a month.   I've had a doctor note that since moving into the apartment that my son's lung condition has worsened but he obviously doesn't give a concrete reason why. But he did mention that smoking could cause the condition to worsen.   It does have a clause about excess noise and nuisance. Saying I have the right to quiet enjoyment of the apartment and the right not be harassed by neighbors.   Would this be covered under the quiet enjoyment clause?  Also, if they re-rent the apartment they can't collect on the full amount of the least right? They can just collect on the months the unit is unre-rented right?   So obviously I am moving out but I am trying to cut my loss a bit on the cost of breaking my lease. Medical bills are a huge expensive and I just can't afford to pay two leases at the moment. I've offered to negotiate and give them literally everything in my savings at the moment by paying 3 months of rent upfront if they just let me out of the lease. They declined saying as long as the apartment wasn't inhabitable then the full lease stood. They said they could take the full lease amount and let me move out. I don't have that.    Can I do anything here?   Right now, my son is staying with my parents temporarily but it just isn't logistically feasible for a long term solution.	No
So I was out at 1am with friends, and I had 2 oz of weed in my bag. Cops were called by the neighbor, they showed up detained us and kept me bc of my weed I also had a scale but they gave it back. I'm 16 this is my first offense. What's going to happen at court ?	No
I live in Northern Wisconsin. Our Central Air unit for our house that we are renting broke. I notified the landlord she made the calls to get it fixed. Tech call her back and tells her she needs a whole new central air unit. It is going to cost 3K to fix. She can not afford to fix it until next spring. Which i completely understand. But with that being said I have a 3-4 week old newborn a two year old toddler and my wife who is a stay at home mom with them at this house. So we need to be able to have the house cooled down.  I understand not having 3K laying around to get it fixed. I also understand having to save up for the money to get it done. But with that being said my gas and electric bill through WPS is going to go way up to keep the house cool with window AC units. I currently pay $800 a month plus all the utilities. Is it reasonable to ask her  if she can shave money off the rent payment in order to supplement the differences of the AC units I am going to need to use? Also how would I go about wording this so I do not seem like and a-hole. I like our landlord and i like the house we are renting but I feel like something should be done for the remainder of the summer.  So again....Is it reasonable to ask her if she can shave money off the rent payment in order to supplement the differences of the AC units I am going to need to use? Also how would I go about wording this so I do not seem like and a-hole?	No
My ex and I were married for 10 years and we got divorced 3.5 years ago. He is an attorney and black mailed me into waiving the spousal support or else he would ruin my life. I have been through therapy and am ready to go back to court to modify the child support because I have had a change in income. Can I also ask my lawyer to look into the spousal support? I am no longer afraid of him and even though I waived the support I was under duress. He took advantage of his knowledge as an attorney and held me under duresss. Is this all possible? 	No
"At the end of this 3rd year, I was told I had to give termination notice before January. Otherwise I am not actually terminated and my lease renews for a year.  Disappointing, but ok my bad. Months go by and I find a leasetakeover.   But NOW they're telling me I'm actually terminated and can't do a leasetakeover.  They said it was, ""Due to a bug in the system""  Can I be terminated without even signing anything?   If not, am I on grounds to deny being terminated or recieve compensation for this ring around yes/no hassle they've given me?"	No
"Hey so I just found this sub and I've been having this question in my head for a long time. My last job, I was working about 55 hours per week yet still considered part time. On top of that, my boss would take all the hours over 40 (15 for example) and move it to the next week so I wouldn't get paid overtime. I was young and didn't really mind because i liked the place and I wasn't doing it for the money, I'm just a hard worker and I like to work. But I just told my mom the other day about it and she's like ""you should sue for all those hours."" Could I really sue for that?"	No
The short story is that the repairs our landlord has done to this house, starting from long before we moved in, are dangerously bad - ie; tin foil and duct tape holding together pipes, rags tied around pipes in leu of insulation, etc.   The latest issue is that water started pouring through the furnace and electric outlets because the roof is bad, we asked them to fix it, they came and dabbed some tar in random spots on the roof and left.  They insist that this was appropriate (they didn't even know where the leaks were inside the house and didn't come in to look and see if it was even safe with all the electric and water) and we had to shut off power to the furnace and ceiling because of all of the water and the antique cloth covered wires.    We have a baby due in two months and with all of the water/electricity being maintained in this way, there is no way it's safe for us to keep living here.  So we (while completely paid up to date on rent) told them that we would not be paying any further rent and are moving out as soon as possible, with a maximum of 30 days.  We have done several thousand dollars worth of improvement on the house, and we even told them to keep the security deposit.  We were late on rent one time last winter and the wife came over at 10pm at night with no warning screaming and accusing us of being liars, when we were genuinely just waiting for a check to clear.  They are very angry with us for blowing the whistle and calling it time to go, so with the wife's history of late night drama, I don't really feel safe having them come in the house when we are already this stressed and trying to move.    They are demanding entry, demanding to start showing the house and threatening to bring the police over to let them in.  As far as my legal knowledge goes, they can't possibly do anything of the sort - can they?  At this point this whole thing just seems insane - I just want to move somewhere where I know that my family is safe! We are in Michigan and this whole thing started on Monday.	No
I live in an apartment building and someone in the neighbouring building has an incredibly loud motorcycle. I live downtown in a major city, and next to both LRT and heavy rail train tracks so I am used to road noise, motorcycles, trains etc.. This is way beyond normal. I live on the third floor in a different building and him leaving is so loud I can't hear a TV over it.  Normally I am willing to just ignore annoying neighbours but this is a particular problem for me because I have a serious issue with tinnitus and the extreme loud roaring will trigger my ringing to be much worse. i should also note that I have poor hearing, and so if it is loud to me it must be worse to everyone else.  I called 311 and they advised to call the police non-emergency. I did that but the police seemed very reluctant to do anything (even come issue them a warning) because I did not want to give them my name and contact information. The reason I don't want to give that information is because I am fairly sure that the guy in question is some kind of skinhead or neo-nazi, and essentially i don't want to have problems with him.  My questions are:  Would anyone know if he is actually violating a noise ordinance (he comes and goes in the middle of the night fairly often)?   If him modifying the bike to be louder would be illegal (I am suspicious he has done this since the bike is so extremely loud)?  How I could get the police to take my complaint as credible without sharing contact info?   If anyone knew the consequences for the issue that would also be helpful (i.e. will he have to stop using the bike)?	No
I (25F) will be giving birth to a baby boy who is the offspring of my fiancé (31M) in September. Because we are not legally married yet, I have a few questions/concerns over medical legalities.   Basically, I need to know the steps to take in case of something going wrong during birth. I'm assuming, as the father of my child, he would take over the decision making process for the baby if something were to happen to me. Would he have the same medical power of attorney over me if I were to have to be put in a coma or on a life support machine? Or would MPOA go automatically to my parents? I guess my questions are  -Do I need to file some sort of paperwork in case of an emergency with my life?   -Do I need to have a will or some type of notarized paperwork giving him MPOA over our son?   -Should I just inform my parents of my wishes in case of an emergency?   -Am I overthinking ALL of this?   Any and all advice will be considered. Thank you in advance!	No
In a nutshell: monthly tenant paid an unofficial security deposit, abruptly decided to move out, now wants it back.  A few years ago Roommate A moved into this 3-bedroom apartment with two other people. They signed a 1-year lease and put down a security deposit in the amount of one month's rent. No new lease was ever signed and eventually the other two original tenants moved out and were replaced by various people throughout the years who never signed anything and paid month to month. I moved in last September and Roommate A said not to worry about a deposit. Roommate B moved in months later and was told the same. Around May one of the original tenants had their car stolen and needed money so A asked us for a deposit. Roommate B gave a month's rent which went to the carless original tenant. I never did, being wary that A might not get the full deposit back.   Roommate A moved out at the end of June. Roommate C is  scheduled to move in in August and when we told the landlord she said she wanted the three of us to sign a new lease and put down a full security deposit. Roommate B gave every indication that he would be signing the lease and staying long term, as he had always intended. On July 11, B announces he had been secretly looking for a new apartment, had just been approved, and would be moving out on August 1st. This put me and Roommate C in a tight spot as we had no idea how the landlord would react or if/how soon we could find a replacement. After a lot of scrambling around we find Roommate D. The landlord approves C and D and tells me I can give the security deposit directly to Roommate A, who only asks for 2/3 of the amount since B had paid in May. B now wants his deposit back.  I'm hoping that because B broke the terms of his implied month-to-month lease by not giving proper notice he has no right to recover any security deposit. Also, his girlfriend has been secretly living here after the landlord clearly said no one could move in short term or without her approval. The landlord indicated to me that technically Roommate A had been liable for the entirety of the original lease and everyone not on it. It seemed that paying him the deposit transferred the liability to me, C, and D. If we had given A the full amount would he have had the right to keep B's deposit even though he wasn't living there when B broke his terms? If so, does that right transfer to us? Am I entitled to the deposit since only B and I were here when he broke the terms? Is the landlord entitled to that money? Is giving only 20 days notice not enough to lose a deposit? Do we owe B his deposit back? He was a real dick about this whole thing I really don't want him walking away with zero repercussions, though obviously I'd like to have legal grounds to refuse him the money instead of just spite. If we can't keep it I'd rather C, D, and me pay the remaining 1/3 to A or the landlord than give it back to B.	No
I broke up with my emotionally abusive, sometimes physically abusive ex. I found out he had been recording me with a motion activated hidden camera pointed right at the bed. (I've contacted a couple of the girls in the videos and none of them care. They were more interested in telling me how much better they were than me. Can the police not contact them because I feel like they'll undermine this case?) I wanted to go to the police when I first found them, but my ex and his family basically told me if I did, they'd go after my family(I don't know what that means, but my ex has threatened to shoot my family. I've asked his parents to take his gun away, but they haven't said anything.) This is where it gets weird. They told me how close they are to 2 former Presidents and how they'll be forced to get involved in this mess. I know they're not lying because I've seen pictures of them with a couple Presidents and politicians. Everyone in his family is a lawyer. Any advice on what I can do? How should I handle something like this?	No
So in March, my girlfriend and I signed a one-year lease for an apartment in a small city in PA. Everything was going well, until around May, when our landlord request we start sending our rent to his property management company. Although they were not mentioned on the lease at all, we did what he asked because we figured it would be fine.   About three weeks ago, our ceiling started leaking. Water is coming in the side of the house and was dripping through our drop ceiling. Last Friday, one of the tiles caved in dropped a bunch of water on the floor. It's Monday, and the property management team came once and has been avoiding us since, maybe to come tomorrow, but i'm really starting to get worried. They also said that they just got this property, so they have been introduced into the equations since we signed our lease. Our landlord tells us there is nothing he can do and to call property management. Is it legal for him to do this when they were not mentioned on the lease? I really don't want to break another lease but I cannot live like this.  Thanks so much in advance.	No
"I am trying to divorce my abusive spouse. We've been married 12 years and have a six year old daughter. He has been physically violent for years and has continued to stalk me pretty aggressively throughout our separation. I moved out in Nov. 2016 and officially filed with the courts in Feb. 2017 pro se. He counter petitioned and as I did not have an attorney I was bullied into giving majority custody to him of our daughter. This has proved to be a bad decision as he does not care for her emotional well being and she is now seeing a therapist. He also continues to break the morality clause in our custody orders. I have gone to authorities to attempt to get a Protective Order against him, once with a bruise from him on my body, and they stated that as we are still married and have a child together they thought it best to deny. I have had to fight to get a criminal trespass warning for my home. Since I decided to leave I have been seeing someone else. My boyfriend has been hit multiple times and charges were pressed but they never went anywhere. The local police told him he should just stop seeing me and that I'm getting what I deserve bc I shouldn't be seeing someone while I'm still technically married. On top of physical stalking, he works in IT security and cyber stalks me constantly. He hacks into ALL of my online accounts, wipes or locks out my phone (which he is not on the account or any of my accounts), gets into my bank accounts, paypal etc, and has begun hacking into the network where I work and messing with my payroll stuff as well as posting inappropriate pictures for all of my coworkers to see. Meanwhile, no one will listen to me or acknowledge whats going on no matter what I report. He even reads all my text messages, etc, tracks my whereabouts constantly, and does petty things like driving by my house and setting of my car alarm in the middle of the night. He has recently been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder after a suicide attempt and I feel he is unfit to parent our child. However, I cant afford a retainer for an attorney. I now pay approximately 45% of my income to him for child support, insurance for our daughter, daycare for her while shes with him, and other medical fees each month. My check is already small so this has left me on the brink of homelessness even though I work full time and clean houses on the side. He tells our child awful things like I don't love her and I'm a quote ""fucking whore"" etc constantly which has been very detrimental to her. At this point I'm at my wits end. I feel like no one is listening and I have no where to turn. I would love to free myself and my daughter from this abuse and unsustainable situation, but I don't know what to do. Could anyone tell me how long he can ride this out without signing divorce papers since he counter petitioned? What can I do to lower the amount I pay to him as I am in such dire straits and he makes a few thousand a month more than I do already? Without everything coming out I currently bring home less than a minimum wage employee and cant find an attorney willing to help"	No
My landlord verbally agreed to release me from my lease and told me he'd follow up in writing. I expected an official document of some sort, but instead I got the following email:  &gt;Per your request, here is a quick note to document our agreement.. We have agreed that we will release you from all future lease obligations. In the next few days, please [...instructions for returning keys],  **Is this enough to release me from my lease, or do I need to request something more?** My limited knowledge of contract law says this is enough, but my gut tells me to be wary.	No
Hello,  My buddies and I are moving into a new apartment on July 15. We've already paid $2700 as a holding deposit and will pay another $5400 on the 15th to cover first and last months rent. Up until this point, we were lead to believe that the first month's rent we pay on the 15th would cover us until the end of August. My friend says he remembers her explicitly stating that.  However, now a few days before we move in the landlord sent an email stating that she expects us to pay a pro-rated amount for the half of July we are spending in the apartment. We can't recall this ever being mentioned in the lease (we all read it at the time of signing and we are trying to obtain a copy of now to confirm). Nor has she ever mentioned it to us. This pro-rated amount is also unspecified.  Is there anything we can do, or are we just shit out of luck? Thanks for taking the time to read this.	No
"Hi, I am A server at a locally owned Chinese restaurant. Pretty regularly the owners will ""punish"" us for not doing a good enough job by taking money off our paychecks. Our base pay is only 25 dollars for a full 12 hour shift (with no breaks). I generally end up making around 16 an hour here after tips, but these deductions are making me worried. My friend just had 42 dollars taken off his paycheck for ""forgetting to charge for wine, even though the customer hadn't tried to pay yet. What is the legality of this? I'm in Birmingham, Al."	No
My girlfriend and I moved out of an apartment complex on 6/7/17. We gave an email for 60-day notice to move out on 5/12/17. I sent it to their correct email (knowing this because at the beginning of our lease I communicated through their email for work verification forms). So when I went to pay the rent off for up to the 7th, on the 6th, they told me that my notice might of got caught up in email but told me not to worry and to just pay the pro rated amount up to the 7th and to forward the notice to their email again, sure enough they got the email and also the forward included the time and date that I originally sent it. So I went on my way to get stuff moved and I get a call from them saying that they aren't going to take the email as a notice and to pay an extra months rent plus a late fee of 100$. So approximately 1000$ extra they want for me. They claimed that an email isn't written and I told them in the lease it says nothing about email and that we can only not give notice orally. The management associate emailed me the lease again and quoting 4 emails they sent is bulk to the community on the topic of if having any questions on lease renewal to contact them. I emailed her back stating that I did not have any questions pertaining to lease renewal because we did not want to renew. So I told the associate that this isn't reaching a conclusion so I told her I'd contact the property management. On the last day of my lease, when I get getting everything cleaned and preparing to turn in the keys, they posted a 3-day notice stating to pay the rent in 3 days or to vacate the apartment. I called them and they gave me the number to a general property manager in my area. I called her 3 times left 3 voice mails and call back to the property management company telling them that I can not contact her, so they provided me her email. So I emailed her twice already and still no contact. They told me to give her 48 hours to contact back. I contacted her on 7/11/17 and 7/14/17. Still no contact yet so I called back the company and told the lady I spoke to the urgency to get this resolved and she told me she would sent the general property manager an email of what I told her over the phone. Now my girlfriend and I are pretty pissed off because we lived in this place for 2 years and never missed a rent payment and now we have management threatening that if we don't pay it, it will go to our credit. None of the people from management have reached out to me yet and in my eyes seem not to care. My girlfriend and I are far from this place now and both agreed that we will not pay it, however we would be willing to pay the things we actually owe (for example the trash fee and drip pan) but their payments are online and we can not pay a portion, they make it so you have to pay the entire thing. I'd appreciate any advice because I'm not too sure on what to do. Am I in the right or wrong? Should I just pay it? Should I contact a tenant lawyer?   TDLR: Apartment complex claims I didn't sent a 60-notice , however I sent one via email to their verified email. They demand I pay 1000$ and management company is unwilling to contact me in any form even though I've contact them many times.	No
My apartment lease is up this month. My apartments were suppose to draw up my new contract but haven't. In that time I found a house I want to move into. My apartments require a 60 notice. Since my lease is up and I have completed the year but haven't given the 60 day I am told by them that I can move out but I'd pay a reletting fee and this is a broken lease on my credit. Is this correct about it being a broken lease? I don't mind paying a fee, but I don't want this on my credit as a broken lease.   Edit:  San Antonio, Texas  Forgot location and I can't seem to edit and update it.	No
"A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine (I am a supervisor) got into a yelling match with me over me asking him to do something he didn't want to do. He did not directly threaten me verbally at this point, but he is twice my size and was attempting to intimidate me; including him coming up close to me and asking ""You wanna say something to me?"" In a threatening tone.  I contacted our director, and the other supervisor, to alert them to this. The other supervisor comes in because they live close and I was very much under the impression I was not safe at work. The co-worker that threatened me returned; thinking I was out of the office, he began to brag about how he was about to come back in and attack me.   At this, I ask him to leave for the day and all hell breaks loose. He and the other supervisor start screaming at one another, as myself and other had to hold the two back from one another or there would have been a fight. Finally he leaves the office, and having heard what happened, our director comes in to speak with him. Our director leaves, the asshole who threatened me got to work the rest of the shift. I was promised that the situation would be resolved and I was more than happy to be patient. Weeks have passed and literally nothing has been done, even the bare minimum that the director promised.   Now when have HR coming in tomorrow with an eye to fire all three of us involved. I'm at my ropes end with this company, and I've been told by a few people that if I'm fired that I'd be in my right to sue them. Is there any truth to that?"	No
I posted something on Facebook that apparently he is upset about. Is this a threat?  [this is what he said to me](https://imgur.com/gallery/a0LiP)	No
My sister (23) and myself (24f) were sexually assaulted by our older cousins (I'll use their initials, E, L, C) when we were younger. The youngest E is 3 years older than me, and C the oldest, is 6 years older than me, L being the middle child. My sister had reported to my mom that E had done something to her when she was about 10 and demanded my dad do something about it. My dad couldn't believe that his nephew E would do such thing and decided they would no longer stay over. At the time, I was also going through some questionable things with the older sister L  and because of the lack of support, I never spoke up about her and I've suppressed those memories (for the life of me I cannot remember what she did, but that it confused me). Two other aunts, my father's sisters, contacted my mother about their daughters suddenly showing sexual behaviors at such a young age. These cousins are about 6 years younger than we are. Those aunts didn't report it, again, because it's family and denied it when my mom did decide to call the cops.  All of this caused strain between my sister and dad, and of course my dads side of the family. Recently I spoke to a counselor about a memory in which I woke up to my pants being pulled down and my cousins L &amp; C hovering above me, to which they giggled and said they were playing a prank. They stopped, but in my sleepy haze, I could see my other cousin E at my sisters waist with her pants down. I fell back asleep and always beat myself up for never mentioning that. My counselor reminded me that I wasn't the adult and what happened wasn't in my control. I eventually came and told my sister this, to which she responded that she knew I knew something this whole time but didn't remember that specific incident. She waited for me to be ready and she understood why I stayed quiet. I told her that if it would help her quality of life and help her move past her fears that I would be with her every step (as much as distance and work would allow) of the process if she decided to press charges. She did, or is trying to. The detective says none of the other victims want to speak out. I'll be talking to her next week and will be giving my account of one situation no one but myself can remember. Not having correct dates and ages makes me hesitant it'll do anything.   When dealing with old situations with little to no evidence, what can one expect in Illinois? It scares me like no other that they won't have any repercussions for taking my sister's innocence and then tormenting her, her whole childhood. One of the cousins got a lawyer, and the other two won't speak to the detective.  Any advice would be great.	No
Simple question.  A neighbor, who has always been adamant that it's her fence because it's on her property line and wouldn't you know it she somehow gets onto us about everything that is or is not on her property, tore down the old fence and is building a new one. In certain spots they built the fence a foot inside our property, other sports about 6 inches.  We had a garden, we built a retaining wall, and a BBQ pit close to this fence, because it was on our property. Now the builders have torn up A LOT of this, in order to fit the fence.  What can we do?	No
I'm in Colorado. My ex and I have a parenting plan in place for my son that says I will claim him on taxes since my ex only has him on weekends. This was placed in 2011. Now all the sudden he would like to start claiming him on his taxes for the child tax credit. I said no and at first he said we need to go to mediation. Tonight I received a text from him saying I need to sign the document to allow him to claim my son on his taxes and if I choose to go to mediation he will tell the courts I'm committing fraud (which is bullshit). Is this extortion?	No
Hello, /r/legaladvice.  I am currently researching the topic of Power of Attorney in British Columbia and an attorney’s ability to designate, alter or revoke a beneficiary designation on behalf of the adult (that made the enduring power of attorney).   Section 20(5) of the [Power of Attorney Act](http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96370_01#section20) lays out specific circumstances under which an attorney can change or create a beneficiary designation.   However, my research of inquiries where this has arisen in my line of work has stated that an attorney has the power to make beneficiary designations if the Power of Attorney explicitly grants that power and, further, that Section 20(5) of the Power of Attorney Act only applies when such a provision does not exist in the Power of Attorney.   This leads me to believe that the Power of Attorney Act must fall under the legal doctrine of “everything which is not forbidden is allowed” **and so my question: is it codified anywhere that this Act, or British Columbia legislation in general, falls under this doctrine?** If so, where can I find that? Does Section 13(2) of the POA Act (“An adult may grant general or specific powers to an attorney”) considered to be the application of this doctrine?  Also, a side question. Years ago in a civics class I learned about this principle of if a law doesn’t forbid something then it is considered allowed and it was described with a one word adjective. Permissive? Non-exclusive? I can’t quite remember what that was. Does this ring a bell for anyone?   TIA	No
I am a resident of Virginia and am being harassed by my abusive ex who lives in Indiana. When our relationship ended four years ago, I was granted a no contact order and a temporary restraining order; I left the state shortly after and thought that was the end of it. He has recently begun harassing me again via phone calls and texts from various numbers. I have changed my number twice and he managed to get the new number both times. Is there any legal recourse from a different state?	No

My friend is going through a contentious divorce right now. She has asked me to give a deposition and possibly testify for her. I really want to, but have an underlying concern holding me back.   They both have a history if drug use, and I have smoked pot with both of them in the past. The things she wants me to testify about have nothing to do with drugs, so I guess my question rests with the likelihood that I would be questioned about my own drug use and what the consequences would be. Is it possible that testifying to that could mess up job, adoption, or similar prospects for myself down the line? Also, my friend seems to think I might get drug tested for agreeing to be a witness. Is that right? I really just want a clear understanding of what I'm getting into if I agree to do this.    Do they drug test witnesses in situations like this?	No
If an employer is doing a background check on me and I have a misdemeanor from 2013, does it show the court documents and the police report or just the charge?	No
My water bill went up $150 after the landlord sent someone out to power wash the house. I am responsible for the water bill, but the lease doesn't say anything about power washing. I called the leasing office and they basically said there is nothing they will do because there is no proof the increased bill is due to the power washing, but our bill has never been this high in the year and a half that we have lived here. My husband wants me to call a lawyer, but do we even have a case here? I'm not sure what to do at this point because we just can't afford this right now.	No
"Hello, going to make this quick and simple.   My lease agreement states pets are allowed, but only ones the apartment ""okays."" When I first moved in I was advised I can get a dog under 35 pounds. Now, they are telling me I cannot have a dog after I have paid pet rent every month and a pet deposit.   Due to the agreement saying only ""okay'd"" pets, does this put me in danger at all now that they have changed their minds? Or is the wording too vague to be pursued?"	No
My property has a city storm drain, which looks obviously broken. The exit of the drain hole is far below the ground level, and all the dirt from my property is sliding into it, and there's no retaining wall to prevent it from happening. The hole of the drain pipe looks like it was snapped, it's uneven. I think the original pipe was longer. The water out of the storm drain gets dumped straight on my property, there's no waterbed, it erodes my hillside  I requested city to repair, they sent a guy and he said it operates as designed, they won;t do anything  To compound the problem, the old owner of the house built a deck close to the drain pipe exit, and there's an easement. The city guy is now threatening that he'll have us remove deck, and that's the only way to get to the basement.  That leaves me in a limbo, as I can't fix city drain (I assume, since they own it, they'll come after me if I do, right?), and not only they won't fix, but if I asking them would make them come and remove the deck. And while that happens, my property takes damage every time it rains  Questions:  1. What are my legal options here? 2. Is there a good attorney in Portland or south of Portland here on Reddit, who could take case, and what will it cost me?	No
Should I be getting my parents to proactively contact the health insurance company to see how to pay or is there some out of this world reason that they don't have to pay anymore? They had cancelled the insurance through calling the Obamacare phone number stating that they didn't realize their insurance had autorenewed and got mail a month later with the results. The result was that we would have to pay anyway but the health insurance was cancelled. We haven't received mail from them anymore, not even a bill. Should I wait until a bill comes in through the mail or should we be proactively calling the obamacare hotline or the health insurance company to get further details?	No
Hi There,   I'm a recent graduate looking to rent a room in London. I found somewhere I like and have paid the admin fee to take the room off the market and will be signing the contract on Friday (28/07/2017). However, the landlord is asking to see copies of my last 3 bank statements (amongst many other things!). I feel a little uneasy about this, is this usual? do I have the right to say no? I feel like this information is a little private. I will also be sending him previous landlords reference/character reference/employment contract already. Any advice would be appreciated	No
I purchased the home in 2013. The home was built in 1993. The property that my home is sitting on is a vacant lot that is still owned by the original contractor for this subdivision. There are so HOA or  anything like that it's just a little neighborhood.   Anyways, the property that my home is sitting on is up for sale. I can't afford to buy it. My other neighbor is who brought this up to me. He was going to buy the property and had it surveyed, decided it wasn't worth the headache, and backed out. When I purchased my home in 2013 I was a first time home buyer and had no idea what to do. I listened to my real estate agent and my mortgage officer. I followed every step and did everything they asked. Nobody asked me to survey what I was purchasing before I purchased it, or I would have know about this then.   Why I'm concerned: I was about to list my home for sell and I this this will be a problem.   Am I liable? Could I be compensated?   Thanks	No
This is probably a waste of time, but I wanted to ask.  My mom and my brother traveled with Greyhound last week Thursday. They had never taken a bus before and tried to maneuver it the best they could. The person working the front desk refused to put a label on two of her items -- two plain cardboard boxes that contained medical records, a bag, school supplies, and toiletries. They swore up and down the luggage would arrive in our city. Well, shocked, it did not arrive.  The real issue here is the customer service is outrageously awful. We've been hung up on, laughed at, and we were given a claim number that doesn't work. It's a 30 minute wait to reach a person and then they transfer you again.  Their compensation policy only offers $250. These items are worth more than that, and were almost certainly lost by the employees who checked them in. It was either never placed on the bus or removed.   Is there anything we can do at this point? Can we sue them? Is there anyway to get in touch with someone at the very top of the hierarchy?	No
"This seems like complicated scenario to me, and I'm not sure how to go about it.  The first few paragraphs help explain the situation. I have a written sublet through my roommate, who in turn rent from out landlord. Currently they are in the middle of battle issues involving eviction, assault, property damaged and intrusion. My roommate has a lawyer for the assault case who's also helping with the eviction situation with the Landlord.        Currently I sublet one of the rooms in my roommates apartment. I've lived there for nearly 2 years now. My roommate(RM for short)  is somewhat messy. Our landlord(LL for short) is pretty lazy and eviction happy with his duties, but so long as we're not disturbing his precious driveway, he stays out of our hair. These is also a 3rd roommate now, his boyfriend he has on the down low. As far as Im aware of or seen, he is not officially on any agreement nor does he pay rent.       Due to events I only have vague information on LL and RM have gotten increasing agitated to the point of property damage. From what I gather, LL has used unofficial channels to attempt an eviction which has sent my roommate into an anxious frenzy.  This includes broken security cameras on both sides, unlawful intrusions into our apartment , and culminating in an assault charge brought against my roommate that resulted in a night of jail.  All of these events happen when I am away since Im out most of the day until late evening.         During this time, my roommate verbally informed me rent was $0 until further notice. This was also written on a dry erase board in the kitchen,but sadly I do not have a clear picture or any other recording of this offer i took him up on. This plays into the conversation we had following my request to clean up.        Also during this time, RM decided to switch the layout of the bottom floor and got even worse with dish duty.  The larger living room/side room combo was to become his new bedroom/living area the old room would now be the entertainment room.  After setting up his, he has since abandoned the old room in a state of storage and clutter.   Over the course of several weeks, RM has been acquiring a large number of items from amazon. Anything he uses for his room is unpacked and used, anything unused or empty boxes are thrown into the old room.It now barely has more than enough space to walk in a few feet, a room large enough for 2 queen sized beds. Dishes are left haphazardly in the kitchen with all manor of food waste. The worst one day being 3 day old meat tortellini fermenting in the water it was boiled in. Simple meals, like milk and cereal, were left out as well as cooked full course meals. Dishes get piled in the sink even after a complete wash. What was supposed to be a shared entertainment room was now a scene from hoarders. What was a livable kitchen feels like an unsanitary trash pit.  These I both have videos and pictures of at various stages. Including several over the course of my tenancy.           This brings me to the following:  At some point in the last 2 weeks his dog had taken a wet crap on the small viable floor space in the new ""Entertainment room""  He informed me of his intentions to let it dry to make for easier clean up.  After a few days he tossed a small dog bed on the mess.  Sometime early this week his dog, yet again, took a much more solid and larger crap over the same area. The dog is actually well trained. After seeing if anything would be done about it, as well as the the increasing pile of dirty dishes and entertainment room, I sent him a text informing him that if he would like my help maintaining the apartment, he needs to clean up the weeks old dog shit and finish a room we are supposed to share to livable standards. Otherwise we'd keep passing trash around as I keep my areas clean.       His response was an immediate eviction with 30 days notice for failure to pay rent.  This was followed up by a request to pay my rent and send him an apology where we ""forget this conversation ever happened"".  After that was a stream of texts. First was the refusal to clean due to stress. The next was to go stay at my mothers if I don't like how it is in the apartment.  Then an ultimatum: I stay out of the apartment for 3 days without returning or else he would evict me. Non contact with him whatsoever until Monday. Or move out. He even offered to pay for a shitty motel for the time(I would need to bring my cat).  If i would try to respond, he would immediately send (paraphrasing) ""don't send that text or you really are evicted and ill hate you"" .The entire stream of texts made me realize my continued tenancy would be dictated by RM's mood. Immediately after this text I got the OK from my parents to move in that day. Work was sympathetic and let me leave that morning to start moving out.  By the end of the night, nearly everything of mine is back at home. There was no response from RM other than a snapchat of his face with he caption ""thanx"" later.  This was not the first time he treated me with evictions or the ultimatum of moving home when I confront his bad living habits either.   Currently my plan is to official move out/break my lease this Monday. But I'm unsure what rights I have and what is expected of me to avoid legal trouble/cover my bases.  My plan is to write and official letter to my roommate and landlord stating my intention to move out and return the keys.Asking for at least RM to sign a copy. But i am unsure about the following:  -I would rather not pay the rent that I now ""owe"" for a month I was told was free since this seems like retaliation for my requests of a clean apartment. Especially given the living conditions I had to endure and the additional person now living with him.  - Would it be wise to record any further interactions with my roommate? These would likely take place in the common areas of the apartment. - Would the assault and issues between RM and LL affect anything regarding my sublease or moving out?"	No
I live in Florida. With my consent I agreed to allow my wife to take our two children, 6 and 4, on a quick vacation to NH to stay with friends and come back in a week. I did not go as I had a job interview during that time frame. A few days after leaving she advised me she wants a divorce and wants me to list our home with a mutual friend who is a realtor and she doesn't know when she is going to return. I've had limited contact with her and the children as she states she is too busy to talk. A few days ago we got in a dispute regarding minor mutual property I wanted to donate to Goodwill we had already saved for a garage sale. She's since blocked me on her phone from calling or texting her. Unfriended me on FB and changed her last name on FB. I plan on contacting an attorney this week sometime. What recourse do I have to make her bring the children back?	No
"Hello,  This is a bit of a complicated situation. I'll try and keep it simple and use as many bullet points as possible.  Who I am: I am currently a caretaker of a dying relative. I live in a duplex. The duplex is under my father's name in an corporation. This duplex is being left to me upon relative's death (as stated his his will).   Lot: Duplex is on a huge lot between two apartment complex, respectively Left Complex and Right Complex. Left Complex also has tree issues, but they have cut back the trees on their side and gave me the wood in return (which is required by state law). Right Complex has been silent, I honestly thought it was condemned because 2 of the units are boarded up.   Problem: Trees have not been maintained for 20+ years on the property. They are particularly bad on the Right, which is where I'm having problems. Right Complex has not indicated there were any issues on their side until today. We met the property owner (I was surprised) and he stated that he had to close to units because of asbestos. He has been apparently harassing my ailing relative during the day when I am at work (I work for about 10hours a week right now, and my fiance works nights, so this seemed pretty timed when neither of us are there). The cost to cut down the branches on his die was $8500.   Conversation: My father and I are in the front lawn area figuring out what to do next. We were visiting a little bit and looking at some new saplings that started to grow.   Neighbor comes over and starts talking about trees. There is one in particular that is bothering him. It bothers me too, as 3 of its branches have fallen on my roof when I've been inside.   * Me: ""Well that is on your side of the property fence, you're well within your right to cut the branches back to the property line if you wish."" * His response: ""But its your tree! You need to get rid of it!"" * Me: ""Well unfortunately I do not have that type of money, and nor does my Uncle.""  * Father (who was checking on uncle and came back outside): ""I can pay for half of the branch cutting cost cost, but we really don't have the money to get 4 80 year old oak trees removed."" * Right Complex Owner: ""Well its your tree and you need to take care of it. All of my other neighbors have removed trees when I asked them."" * Me again: ""That's very nice of them, but we're currently concerned with getting the property and grounds fire-safe and water-safe."" (We are still removing trash and other debris from the back yard. Our county limits how much we're allowed to dump per month without a permit.) * Right Owner: ""Well I can call the city and say that its a fire hazard.""  * Me: ""Sure, you're welcome to call them. Unfortunately our County has tree laws, so it will still take 6 months or so for the trees to be fixed.""  At this point the Right Complex owner shakes my hand, my dads, and leaves. I do not have his contact information and he was not forthcoming with any information.  I'm expecting for him to attempt to sue us for damages and lost income. My family does not have an attorney but my father can most likely afford one.   Questions:  * What do I do about the neighbor harassing my relative? The relative has dementia and emphysema and should not be moving/answering in any capacity * Can the neighbor sue for lost income from the units?  * Is there a way to have the county remove the tree for free if its declared a hazard? * Even though it is our tree, Right Complex did neglect trimming hazards from their side. Is that reasonable to bring up?"	No
"Hello,   I currently live in GA and have a GA license and vehicle registered here. I have something I need to do in NY next year that requires me to be able to prove residency in the state (nothing to do with college or the federal or state government). My parents live in NY and I already have a valid state ID (non-driver) with their address on it. I'm sure that would be enough to do what I need to do, but to be extra careful, I was thinking about ""moving"" to my parents house a month before and switching my GA license to NY. If I do this, will anything happen to my GA registration or insurance? I would switch my new NY license back to Georgia within about a month of getting it. Are there any other unintended consequences of doing this, such as income tax or something else I'm not thinking of? I also don't know the legality of this because I could easily justify any questions by saying I just decided to move back in with my parents if asked. Thanks."	No
There is an invisible fence on the lot next to me, not sure if that's their dog. There are 3 houses adjacent to mine.    I definitely don't want the dog in my yard. I've found dog poop too. So should I try to find out who is the owner first? Or just contact animal control, HOA or police? Since I'm new to the subdivision, I haven't been contacted by HOA yet.	No
Looking for advice. I'm currently renting my house. Tenants signed a lease at the beginning of the year. We just had an inspection done and there is a serious termite infestation. Place is about 10 years old and the level of infestation can not be treated with natural oils. The tenant is refusing to let me do the fumigation citing not wanting to be exposed to chemicals. We have offered to put them up for  3 days to a place of their choosing, but they will not agree to the fumigation. I know most laws favor the tenant.  Is there any action  we can take as landlords if the tenants refuse to leave? The termites at this point have caused some structural damage- Thanks in advance for any help, with this.	No
We need advice! We live in California and have lived in our apartment since March. This all started because I requested reasonable accommodations from the landlord for an emotional support animal. I have a legitimate need and my therapist wrote a letter to my landlord to explain.   To be clear- we do NOT have a dog or any other animal yet. An animal has never been in our apartment or building in our time living here.   But, the building manager wrote us today to say they found traces of urine in the hall and dog feces behind out back door (there are animal feces there. I don't know where they are from). They then said that we have had a pet in our apartment in violation of our lease and therefore will need to leave and end the lease early.   What can we do? We haven't broken the lease, again no animal has entered the apartment, and I just sent the official letter from my therapist on Friday, so they should receive it in a few days.   It's also worth noting that this landlord is pretty negligent. It took them over a week to get us a smoke detector and the landlord who owns the building (and we have never met) entered our apartment without cause or notice a few months ago. This is all admitted to in writing from our landlord too.   Any and all advice would be very much appreciated!!	No
Like the title says, landlord sold the place (duplex) and while she says that we won't have to sign a new contract because ours is still valid she keeps insisting to not sign another one if the new landlord steps forward with one. Is the contract I signed with the previous landlord still valid through my term of lease (through end of 2018) or does the new landlord have the right to say our contract is invalid and force us to sign a new one? This is in Missouri if that makes a difference. Thanks!	No
So my new boss told me today at orientation that it's going to take 3-4 pay cycles for my paycheck to come. The pay cycle however is twice monthly and the owner doesn't do paper checks so my only option for pay is direct deposit. Something just screams red flag. Any legal advice on this one?	No
(Michigan)  Their marriage lasted from may 2015 to may 2017. He owns a pizzeria that I currently manage. He opened it with his own money in 2008. They were in a relationship at the time and she worked there with him and put all profit in their combined personal bank account. She's now suing for lost wages. Since their marriage he's allowed her to pursue her hobbies and be free from work. She had the affair in august 2016. He caught her. They gave it another shot. May 2017, she's at it again. He had to end it. She's also trying to sue for a piece of the business. Any advice would help.	No
Hello! My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force. Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	No
I got divorced in 2003 and I was on permanent disability. Since I first started getting disability, my wife was in control of the money due to my brain injury/mental disability. To this day, she still has full control over it. I am asking for advice on how to get it out of her name and either back into my name or another family member.  I don't know the exact amount I should be receiving, but i know that she keeps about half of the total amount. The only other source of income I have is 600$ that I receive from the insurance settlement that caused by brain injury.  She says I would probably lose the disability entirely if the disability was taken out of her name or if the bank account it's deposited into changes.   Location: Florida, Hillsborough County	No
My building, which is rent-stabilized in Queens, was recently purchased by a new owner (sometime in fall of 2016). My rent was raised $40/month when I resigned a new lease this summer, but now the new owner is claiming they want an additional $30/month and are citing elevator fixes from early 2015 (over a year before they even owned the building). I just have a few questions.  1 - Am I paranoid or does this seem suspicious AF? 2 - Does a new owner make a rent-stabilized agreement null? 3 - Can a new owner legally cite renovations as an excuse to raise the rent if they did not own the building during the renovations?  Any advice would be helpful, especially how to fight this if need be. Thanks so much!	No
I'm a 17 year old, extremely smart (not bragging) O-levels student studying in Pakistan and currently in Bahrain for summer holidays.   At the age of 11, my parents took me out of school and put me into a Quran teaching institute for 5 years, during that time I got extremely depressed with having the same routine 7am to 12pm and 3pm to 7pm everyday for 5 years.   Every year I tried to convince my parents to let me go back to school but they never agreed and just beat me, until the 5th year when they realised I wasn't interested in finishing the Quran and it was getting too late.  After that I spent the next 3 months finishing the 5 years worth of syllabus of 5 subjects so that I could get into school. After 3 months I moved to Pakistan to live with my brother (who turned out to be a sadistic asshole)and left my family behind in Bahrain.   My brother wanted me to get into the 8th grade of the Pakistani education system but since I was 3 years behind my former classmates, I went behind his back and barely got myself into the first year of O-levels.  At the end of the first year, I topped all of my subjects getting all A's and A+'s except I math and ended the school year with certificates in Business, Economics, Accounting and English for the best student of each subject over the year. I did all of that in my first year of school after since the 5th grade.  After that I was still behind my former classmates who were in the 12th grade and I asked my brother to let me skip one year of school and get myself into the 3rd year of O-levels straight after finishing the 1st, my brother didn't allow me and gave me no reason as to why he didn't and said I should take my time, so once again I went behind his back and got myself into the 3rd year of O-levels all by myself. I had to finish the whole 2nd year syllabus in 2 month and, after I was done with 2 subjects out of 5, my brother caught wind of my plans to skip a grade and took away my laptop, phone and everything else knowing I needed the internet to study as I had no teachers.  so now I'm stuck. I opened up to my mother about how my brother treats me and how he's an asshole, and she replied by beating me and telling me how I disrespected my brother. Now my only option is to go with whatever my brother has planned for me which is gonna ruin my future. I know I have great potential. The students who got the same grades as me in 12th grade as I did in 10th are getting into top universities like Stanford, Harvard and Pennsylvania on full scholarships and stipends. It's been my dream to move to the US to study an to pitch an amazing app idea I have that has impressed many of people but my parents would never allow me to move there because of religious reasons and other reasons.   Other than my education, I had breathing problems for 10 years from the time I was 7 to the time I was 17 and my parents never took me to a hospital,this year, I convinced one of my brothers to take me to a hospital where I was diagnosed with either Bronchitis or asthma (full diagnosis would be done if I visited a specialist which I probably never will).  I just want to know my options, what can I do to leave my abusive and careless family behind and move to another country? If I have the option of getting into some education programs abroad I would have no trouble getting into them because I have exceptional grades in all my subjects. I have a lot of potential but I'll never be able to achieve it if I stay with my family.	No

This is a follow-up to a post I previously made here but have since deleted. Basically, I signed a lease with a student apartment electronically last week. Someone from their office called me an hour later and told me they ran out of spots and that he would add me to a wait list. I received a rent reminder later that day and I called after that to ask them why I was going to be held accountable for paying rent when they said they ran out of spots. The girl who answered told me they don't cancel leases and I would need to fill out a relet form. I explained that I signed another lease because their office told me they ran out of spots, and I was not going to pay for a unit I don't have. She asked me my name and confirmed that I had not been assigned a unit. She said to call the next day at noon and speak to a manager about the situation, because she was new and didn't know what else to tell me.    So I called the following day and asked for a manager. I explain the situation to him and ask to terminate my lease. He say they don't cancel leases and I need to fill out a relet form, and that he'd email me one. I try to explain the situation again, reiterating that I was not going to pay for something I don't have, but he said there was nothing he could do. So I got off the phone. I explained the situation later to my dad and he called up there himself. After making a big fuss, the leasing manager sent him a relet form as well, because she said they can't cancel leases, but said she'd waive the fee if they found someone.    I email the first manager and ask why I was put on the wait list if there was a spot available for me. He says that I was told I was the last unit when I signed (which there is no evidence of, no phone calls, emails, or voicemails BUT I do have a voicemail of the guy from their office that told me there was no spots left). I also signed the lease electronically, so how was I told this when I signed? Either way, I send in the relet form and have been trying ever since to find someone to relet/sublease my apartment to in case they don't find anyone.    Today is the day my rent would have been due so I know I'm not late in paying them, had they not found someone. But an hour or so ago I get a message from Adobe sign (what I used to electronically sign the lease) that said:    &gt; Lease from [Apartment Complex] Agreement Exchange Cancelled. I have cancelled the agreement exchange for Lease from [Apartment Complex] even though you have already completed and returned it. This transaction has been terminated by Adobe Sign and the document has been removed from our Adobe Sign accounts. No further steps are required on your part.    I emailed the apartment complex to get an explanation because I'm not sure what this means, but I haven't gotten an answer yet. So now I'm just trying to figure out if my lease has been terminated or not, and if they're still going to hold me accountable for my rent? I don't think this was cancelled because I didn't pay yet, because the rent is due on the 1st and isn't considered late until the 4th. But they haven't given me any notification of any sort before this that they intended to cancel the lease, only that they would try and replace me with someone and if not, I was responsible for the lease.    Sorry that this is so long but this has been giving me a lot of anxiety this past week. And I have to make sure this is finished, because I explained the situation to the other apartment complex and they are willing to let me sublease in case I am held accountable by the other apartment complex but they need to know ASAP if I need to sublease or not.	No
Simple question, what are my options here?  Our lease is 4 people, we kicked one out and had this new guy come in. The new guy is supposed to leave very soon (August should be his last month) but I can't get a hold of him (the three of us are outside of the city at the moment, we can't confront him) and he hasn't answered me in a week. His name is not on the lease. What are my options if he decides to try and skimp out?	No
"This is in Nevada, Clark county.   I am helping pay for a relative's divorce. It is not going smoothly, but I don't need to get into the relationship part of it here. What I'm concerned about is that I am not being told the truth about the legal proceedings, court dates, etc. I would like to verify a few things without relying on the word of this relative.  For instance, this relative has said he has appeared in court a number of times due to the soon-to-be-ex ""filing things against him"" and ""dragging him into court"". So there should be a record of that somewhere, right? Can I look up that kind of thing online?  There have definitely been custody hearings for their minor children. Are records of those publicly available?  Their court date for the divorce hearing has supposedly been postponed several times and is now allegedly scheduled for October. Again, is there a way I can verify this without going through my relative (or his lawyer)?  You may have discerned by now that I am not happy paying for this relative's divorce, and you would be correct. There are lots of relationship issues going on in the background and perhaps I will make another post to discuss those. This post is just to learn how I can get more information to verify if I am being told the truth or not about what is going on."	No
Hey,  I have a quick question and couldn't find the correct subreddit.  I moved out of my room on an off campus house at college, and the landlord says that my security deposit check was sent out, but I never received it. My other housemates have received there's, but I haven't received mine.  They said that they sent it to me, and now I I want to cancel the previous check, so I have to pay a fee for them to send a new one to me.  I don't see why I have to pay a fee when I have no proof they actually sent it to the correct address or ever sent it at all. Is there anything I can do/ specifically say to avoid paying the fee?  Thanks!!	No
"TL;DR: A private garage door was broken (for a year) which allowed someone to come and break into my car. The landlord responsible for the gate believes she's not liable, I believe she was negligent. I've already filed to sue her. What's my standing?  I live in a condo that I'm renting. There's a tenant living next to me and her landlord (A) who is different than my landlord (B). We have ""private"" garages in the sense that I have two spaces you can park into only if you use my garage door and there's one space using her garage door. Once inside, you can walk to the other person's space without a problem, i.e. it's open space.   The tenant had informed Landlord A that the garage door wasn't working (due to a lack of sensors?) and had to leave it on manual to open and close it. Landlord A insisted that the tenant fix it because they were the tenant and it was her responsibility. The HOA said it was her responsibility and she didn't fix it for nearly a year.   I let the HOA do its thing because that's what it's there for. And yet they couldn't get her to do anything for nearly a year. Due to her negligence, someone waltzed right in, broke my car window, and stole something with extreme sentimental value to me that I'll never get back.  I'm suing her on the grounds of negligence and being directly responsible in my bag's disappearance and my car's window damage. Here is my argument in bullet form:  * She was well-informed and told it was her responsibility to fix it asap nearly a year ago.  * She knew about problems like a homeless person using it as storage and a toilet (both piss and shit).  * These are considered private garages, i.e. not shared spaces or an open garage like the rest of the tenants have. Therefore it is not ""park at your own risk.""  * While the broken garage is not her fault, fixing it in a timely manner is and she did not do that. I was not harmed immediately after it was broken, but a year afterwards. I was directly harmed due to her negligence after a timely manner."	No
I'm a US citizen (land living in the US) and also a partner of a company based in Australia.   What is the best way to handle distributions in my case -- would it make the most sense to create a subsidiary in the USA for tax purposes, or is there a better option?   While we have a few customers in the USA, we don't plan to pursue the market here and will not open any offices in the US. We'd like to remain focused on the Australian market. If we did open a subsidiary company in the US in order to pay distributions, would that open us up to US law and liabilities? We'd prefer to remain under Australian law since most of our customers are there.  I plan to speak to a lawyer about this, but thought it would be nice to get a few different opinions to prepare in case anyone else has dealt with a similar situation. Thanks in advance for your help!	No
I don't know if there's any recourse here. I forgot to get insurance so I don't have anyone to cover a hotel for a month. I don't have $3000 extra for a hotel for a month (cheapest I could find with a pet is $100 a month). It's estimated apartment repairs will take a month and then I'll be allowed back into my apartment. Thankfully nothing in my unit was destroyed and I did talk to insurance about getting a policy as soon as I do move back in. I understand it was a mistake to not purchase and I usually do. I don't know why I forgot. I don't know what my options are except to be a wilderness man (go camping) as I don't have family in the area.	No
"Well to put it simply my roommates called the sheriffs office on me? They said i wasn't a legal resident and screamed at me and when i tried to go into my room they pushed the door open and yelled at me some more. but yea i've been living here for over 3 months and have been paying 500 dollars a month for half a room i wasn't late or behind on the utilitys they ""the three gay roommates that all have sex together"" decided they didnt want me there any more and said they wanted me gone by the first of the month. the current situation is that they called the sheriff to have me kicked out right now and i know that i am a legal resident and i have pay stubs with this address and my name on them going back months. so im wondering if ill be okay if the police actually arrive and what to say to them."

"My 21 year old deaf stepdaughter is a full time college student at a prominent university in New York - our home state is Florida. She signed a lease for an apartment at a student housing complex (not affiliated with her university) last November, along with four of her deaf friends. In the process, she signed my husband's name as a cosigner to this lease. We just found this out in the last two weeks.    To give you some background info, because of her deafness, she essentially operates on a lower maturity level than most people her age - she acts and functions on about a 16-17 year old level. While I understand this is not an excuse to not act like an adult, we genuinely believe she didn't understand what was happening or what she was doing or how serious it was (she STILL is having trouble understanding the gravity of the situation). The entire time she dealt with this student housing complex, she thought she was filling out an application, and that was what she had communicated to my husband and I at the time. When she asked him for information about financials, he thought it was for a credit check for the application. She rushed all this at us last year in a few hours one afternoon while we were at work - everything had to be immediate because the housing complex was pressuring them to apply because ""all the apartments were going to be leased so fast."" He never saw the lease, and she signed his name to it without him knowing she was doing that. He would not have signed this lease if he'd known or read it. She didn't tell us anything about this until two weeks ago, because suddenly all her friends are also not going to live in this apartment because none of their government funding, which all five of them rely fully on, is going to cover off campus housing, even though the apartment complex told them it would be no problem. So really, there are five students here who have signed this lease, and none of them plan to live there.    I have no idea what anyone else's parents are doing, but we've tried explaining the situation to the apartment complex, and they are adamant that the lease is binding and the only option is for the students to find someone to relet their rooms to. However, if none of them move in August 1, the entire rent defaults and is due immediately for everyone. They all live down here in Florida, and only are able to talk to their friends and post on facebook groups to find someone to relet to, which is proving futile. The apartment complex has placed them on a ""relet list"" but they only refer to that list once the entire complex is full, which it isn't at this time. We're now on the hook for over $10k for this because my husband's name is on this lease.    I don't know enough about real estate law, or if there's anything we can do about this situation, or if we're just stuck because our name is legally on this lease. We're trying to get in touch with the legal services at the school, but because it's still summer, it's hard to get a hold of anyone. Is there any way we can get out of this lease? What would happen if we pursued legal action against our daughter for signing my husbands name without her knowledge? While paying the $10k bill monthly or immediately is really going to be incredibly hard for us, we could feasibly consider paying for a lawyer if it could get us out of this lease.    TL;DR - deaf stepdaughter fraudulently signed our name to lease as cosigner for student housing; will not be living there, can't get out of lease.  Is there anything we can do?"	No
So basically i live on a quarter mile long driveway that i share with my neighbor who we were always friends with and kind to but he is at the very beginning near the road and I am tucked away in the woods at the end of it.  We have beach access and our neighbors have right of way to use our driveway and a path on our property only as a means of traveling to and from the beach. They have come over numerous times without warning to watch the sunset on a section of our property that leads to the beach (rather than the actual beach because they can't make it down the waterfall/stream that leads to it).  We've asked them a few times now to let us know before hand (mainly after an incident where a bunch of strangers and cars unexpectedly showed up for homecoming pictures on our land not the beach) when they are going to come down and we have always been ok with them watching the sunsets on our property leading to the beach as long as they let us know ahead of time. So basically the other day while my mom was at work and my dad was working in our garage they showed up walking down the driveway uninvited and without plans of going to the beach. My dad was outside with our three dogs (Rottweiler, golden retriever, and weimaraner all sweet hearts with no previous signs of aggression even in a house with two toddlers) and my sisters when they decided to walk down with a stranger and there three dogs (a lab, a golden retriever, and an 8 week old Australian shepard puppy they just got a week ago but hasn't met my dogs before).  My neighbors were supposed to be getting married on the section of our property that they always watch the sunset on so they said they were walking down to show the guy they brought with him the work they thought they were going to be doing to our land in preparation for their wedding.  I was not home at the time but i guess while my neighbor was walking ahead with the stranger, his fiancé was standing on our property surrounded by her dogs and now my dogs who ran up to see what was going on. I'm not sure how long the dogs were interacting for but the puppy was new to all three of my full grown dogs and the rottweiler ended up biting her and breaking her leg.  She was taken to the vet and had four puncture wounds as well but they weren't serious.  We were all very surprised to hear of the situation and upset as we are all dog lovers and offered to help in some way but we've never been in this type of situation before and didn't know how payment would work for something like that (we were still going to try to help even if we weren't liable) but my neighbors seemed pretty cool about it and said that wasn't a big concern of there's at the moment. So the dog eventually went in for surgery but never woke up from the anesthesia (we're guessing the dog was given too much for it's young age) and our neighbor told us when it happened and said to not call or text today because his fiancé and step daughter were very angry (at us? the dog? themselves? idk). So the next day my dad was coming home from work and stopped coming down the driveway because my neighbor was out and apologized for the situation he was in and my neighbor went straight to telling my dad that he has a couple thousand dollar pet bill that he's going to send him as well as a receipt for the dog that they spent $2000 on at a pet store.  Now my parents were trying to handle this situation as nicely as possible since we felt terrible and have to continue to share a driveway and think about this relationship longterm but feel like we aren't really fully responsible and don't appreciate how our neighbor is acting like it's completely our/my dog's fault and is going to demand this money from us for the incident without taking any responsibility of his own.  We've tried contacting an attorney just to figure out if it truly is on us but all so far have only been for dog bites on humans. Sorry for the grammar mistakes this is just like the 10th time reciting this so I'm getting kind of tired of it and just wanted some other opinions and feedback on the situation.  After them demanding the money basically my parents don't really want to help them pay the bills at all unless they have to but we believe that my neighbors are mostly in the wrong here and that we definitely shouldn't have to worry about the cost of the dog when the vet is the one that killed it even though my dog caused the need for surgery.  Thank you so much for any feedback this is just causing my family a lot of stress and I'd be happy to elaborate more or clear things up that weren't explained well if questions come up.  TL;DR  Neighbors have always been close friends and are legally allowed to cross a piece of our property to reach a beach that only we have access to but they always stop before getting that far and hangout on our property.  They've unexpectedly dropped down numerous times after us asking for just a heads up beforehand but they thought it would be a good idea to do that the other day with no intentions of going to the beach, a stranger with them, and their three dogs (one of which is a brand new 8 week old puppy that my three big dogs have never met).  Eventually while they were down on my property, uninvited and not there for the reason their supposed to come down, my dog with no history of any aggression bit their puppy breaking his leg.  The dog needed surgery but died due to reasons unrelated to the injury and afterwards my neighbors started acting like it was all completely our fault and that we had to pay the full vet bill as well as the cost of the dog.  Also just an FYI incase it comes up, the beach I'm referring to is public but surrounded by 40 foot cliffs and we have access to the only semi easy way of getting down on our property but my neighbors never go all the way down to the public part they are supposed to (again this wasn't a big deal to us when they would tell us ahead of time)	No

I am going on vaction in a few weeks and want to rent my apartment out for 3 days for some extra cash.  I read over my lease and there is a statement saying we can't have guests stay with us for more than 3 days. Am I obligated to even tell the landlord that I want to do this?   I read on here some posts defending landlords not to let tenants do an AirBnB type of thing because of liability and other things.  Also if I do this, what is a good way to protect myself in case something happens?  I don't have renters insurance but plan on getting it.	No
"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	No
In California. I told roommate (via text) that I would take care of all cleaning matters, she refused and said she had a right to clean the apartment as well. I wrote back to her stating that I would be out of town for two weeks and she was more than welcome to clean what I didn't get to. I returned to the apartment and she didn't clean anything. We have 3 days left on the lease and I'm curious if it's possible that she spoke to the landlord and made it seem like I should be charged for everything that is not done. I cannot ask her because she will not answer me and the landlord is very busy and does not respond right away.   TL;DR: Can roommate privately ask the landlord to charge me for certain things that pertain to our common space?	No
I am a 20 year old living at home in Wisconsin with my mother, younger siblings, dog, and my mother's ex-fiancee. They have had a falling out he is threatening to kick me out. Due to my mother's plan to leave him (violent temper and alcoholism)she left herself off of the paperwork for the house they purchased together a few years ago, on the taxes this most recent year. However per him not my mother I was to be charged rent at the beginning of each month. Since I am paying rent can I be forced to vacate immediately?	No
(Indiana and California, for the bot, but I think it's all federal.)   My former cell phone provider thinks I owe them $300. I disagree, but that's not really the issue here.  I sent a general dispute letter the first time it was sent to collections, asking for verification. Instead of verification, I got a letter back from the collection agency that they were returning it to the cell provider. Today, I got a new letter in the mail from a different agency.  I plan on disputing that one as well, but if the same thing happens, is there a point where I'm done? Or can the provider just keep sending it to a new collection agency every time I dispute it, rather than having them actually send the verifications they're required to provide by law?   Sending certified letters will eventually rack up more than the debt, but I'd hate for the one I don't send certified to be the one I actually have a solid FDCPA violation with.	No
In order to fully understand the level of confidence I have in the opinion that my daughter is being abused psychologically would take a very long time. I will give the highlights.  My ex and I got divorced due to deployment related stress in 2010 when my daughter was 2. She moved back and forth between TN and NE during my deployments and eventually, after the divorce, she settled back in NE because of better schools and better standard of living (Omaha vs Memphis).  During the time that she lived in NE, I was unable to see my daughter frequently both due to a refusal to cooperate from my ex and my continuing deployments.  I got out of the military and hoped it would be a good opportunity for me to make up with lost time, but I was met with the same lack of cooperation as before so I really only saw my daughter a couple times a year (always only at her mom's house).  I filed for a custody hearing, my ex never responded to the notification so we had the sheriff's office serve her. The day after we got our receipt of service, she moved to TN.  Since the proceedings, the lack of cooperation because a full force of loathing and spitefulness from her. Her dad wanted to fight me in front of my daughter and told me I wasn't allowed on his property. My ex has sworn at me and called me things like an asshole in front of my daughter. My ex's mom has said, in front of my daughter, that I abandoned her.  After many proceedings and a trial-style hearing on the record I was able to secure some visitation times including the school vacations. I was so excited to get her for the very first extended period since she was 2 years old, now she's 8. That excitement and blissfulness of being with my daughter is now accompanied with total anxiety.  My ex got our daughter a phone, she said that she's supposed to have to have the phone on her at all times both in TN and in NE, but I have a lot of evidence suggesting that she doesn't get her phone in TN (i.e. a complete wipe of my text messages and phone calls from her phone when she showed up here this summer).  Through conversation it is fairly obvious that my daughter has been coached about a lot of this stuff with the phone (i.e. how to always keep location on, to call her mom every morning and every night, and not letting me or my wife see the phone as well as password protecting it).  All things considered, it was really easy to get access to my 8 year old daughter's phone and the things that have been going on this summer are startling.  My ex has interrogated her nightly about her situation and what me and my wife do, more so than asking about what all she's been doing and if she's having fun or not.  She has consistently thrown shade on me over and over, though that is to be expected I guess. I am the type that tells the truth to my daughter unless it could negatively impact their relationship, I'm not about that bullshit shade-throwing.  She told my daughter only to speak to her when she can be away from me and my wife and is always asking if either one of us have had access to her phone.  In the last few weeks my daughter has really warmed up to being here and has put her phone on the back-burner most of the time. She's fucking 8 years old and she doesn't give a shit about the phone, she just worries that she's going to be in trouble if she doesn't keep it on her (she's told me so).  During those few weeks she has been unresponsive at times that she's having a sleepover or she left her phone at home. On nights that she doesn't respond, my ex is very harsh.  During a vacation to Texas my daughter left her phone in the car overnight. The next morning, my ex had sent her a text before she went to work saying that she was up all night crying and didn't get any sleep because she didn't hear from her.  Tonight, she threatened to call the cops because she wasn't responding and had her FBI ex-boyfriend blowing up her phone as well.  1) I have all of these things from her phone backed up, but I don't own the phone. The communications are taking place in my house and concern my child. Is that information admissible in an informal hearing setting... I know that if I were able to subpoena the records from the phone company that would be admissible during a trial, I just want to know if I'm going to be breaching any privacy laws by having the information (hence the throwaway).  2)I'm legitimately freaked out about what my daughter is going through, what the fuck can I do to stop it?  Thanks for the help.	No
Some ACs have gone down all over the building and people are reporting temps of 80-90 degrees F in their units for months. I found [this](http://www.ncsl.org/research/environment-and-natural-resources/colorado-landlord-and-tenant-duties.aspx) section of CO law that says:  &gt;§ 38-12-505. Uninhabitable residential premises &gt;... &gt;(d) Functioning heating facilities that conformed to applicable law at the time of installation and that are maintained in good working order;  But I couldn't find any mention of cooling, nor a specific temperature. Are we all just out of luck?	No
"I live in Sacramento California. I am a single father and have full custody of my 7 yo daughter. The court order states that my ex can only see our daughter under supervised visitation, which she does twice a week at my home.   However, I just discovered from the sac county website that she didn't show up for her sheriffs work project from her misdemeanor burglary conviction in 2016, as a result the courts issued a ""commitment warrant"" for 45 days (the time her sheriffs work project was supposed to be) and modified her work project to straight time in jail.   I want to know how i can tell if she has fulfilled her 45 day straight time conviction or if she has an outstanding warrant?  This could be an issue with the supervised visitations at my house. I went to the records office and they wouldn't tell me but there has to be an easy way to see if someone has warrants as I've seen officials announce warrants on tv.  Any help is necessary as I'm just concerned for my daughters safety."	No
She is on dialysis (no kidney function) and had surgery to remove mass from colon three weeks ago. She was put in a nursing home for about two weeks but after being diagnosed with malnourishment and in such severe pain she was put back in hospital due to an abscess which they drained. She  started having seizures every 20-30 min and has not had any nutrition in 4 days. She is begging for food but from my understanding, they won't even tube feed her until they find what is causing seizures. She is completely bedridden due to being malnourished  but of sound mind. My father just got a call from the doctor asking for her living will. I am worried they will stop all medical help if he gives it to them.  What can we do?	No
My husband and I live in Wisconsin and are expecting our first child. Our apartment building was built in 1977, so I don't think testing for lead is an issue. Our lease says nothing about children and doesn't really address max occupancy. We have a second bedroom that we'll be using as a nursery.  My landlord is the sole owner of our 8-plex. Our lease is month to month, we've lived here almost 2 years without incident. I'm concerned he may try to end our lease if he finds out (general pregnancy paranoia, I'm sure.) We can't afford to move til next spring, when baby will be about six months old. What are my legal responsibilitis here?	No
"My wife has brainwashed my children and they now have fulminant parental alienation syndrome, clinically speaking. What can the courts do to help beyond ordering parenting classes and specialized counseling for the kids? What are the possible repercussions and what recourse could there possible be? The court does not currently see or recognize the alienation and I am wondering what I have to gain by spending the time and money establishing this fact. The court initially chose to not call it parental alienation because I'm transgender and  ""I am the one who deviated from the family structure we established""...   Thanks in advance!"	No
I'm a foster parent living in Oklahoma and I'm adopting my niece. Half way through the process I got a call asking if I would be willing to help take in my nephew and knowing no one else in our family would, I accepted. I later found out that he has a serious mental health issues that my wife and I don't feel we are equipped to handle and he's tearing my family apart.  The only reasons why we haven't had a caseworker change his placement is because we still feel for him (I was a foster child for a brief period of time when I was about his age), the fact that our adoption finalizes within the next two months and the financial bind that put my family in without the stipend my state provides. We had to purchase a new vehicle since we were a family of five which is where the financial bind comes in. Is there a way that the state can take my niece so close to adoption? Also is there a way to sell back my vehicle or trade it for something with a lower payment for people in my situation?   Noteworthy items: My wife is a stay at home mother We've had my niece in our care for over a year I hate looking like the bad guy but his bio-father has had mental health issues since he was about 10 I am sure my nephew needs in-patient treatment	No

Never doing those shifts again which amount to about $4 per hour and required I essentially lived at the doggy day care (there was a bed downstairs to sleep on) for the duration of the time. They initally told me that this payment is counted as 'salary' even though I was told upon being hired that I was paid/hour as minimum wage.  I've worked under the table before but have never been this unfairly compensated. Am I right in thinking they are blatantly violating the law?	No
An apartment complex in Atlanta, GA emailed me offering me a room, I replied yes within an hour and a half, they acknowledged my response and confirmed. Now they're claiming they have no record of this and that their is no room for me. Do I have a legal case here? I rejected other sublease offers because of this, and have nowhere to go now with college starting in less than a month.	No
We live in Ohio, and my mom said if my stepdad found out she was cheating he would get a divorce settlement and not a disillusion.  She told me he'd get half of everything she owns - her savings, her retirement fund, and most importantly the house. She'd have to sell the house so she could give him half of its worth.  The thing is, they've only been married for two years. She makes house payments to the bank, but she's not renting. We've had this house for 17 years, so I feel like he would have no right to get any of it since he only moved in two years ago, but I don't know if that's how the legality of it works.  They bought two cars during their marriage, and he's a car salesman so they came from his place of work. How would this factor into the settlement?  I'm going through a lot, so my mind is just flooded with confusion. I tried googling this stuff, but I think information attuned to my situation would be the most helpful.	No
"Two weeks ago my ex-fiancee left me standing at the alter. I'll spare everyone the squishier details, but after not hearing a word from her since our wedding day, she has been texting me. I asked for the engagement ring back and she said no, saying she wanted to ""cherish the memory"". I then asked her about the wedding shower gifts and the money that was donated to our honeyfund (an online registry where guests buy you honeymoon experiences as a wedding gift) and she flat out ignored the question.   My question is that if I have a right to get the ring back (its valued at 8K) and whether I have any rights to the money that was donated to our honeyfund. I would prefer to return the money to whoever gave it to us instead of funding some stupid girls trip for her and whatever insipid friend she wants to take with her."	No
Asking this for a friend who does not use reddit.  No paper lease was signed,  the one roomate that deals with the rent decided to let my friend know that her (and her housemates) all need to move out because he is getting other people to take over their rooms while he goes and travels for a few months.  He told everyone (verbally) that they have 2 months to leave.  Does she have to leave?	No

Is there ever an actual legal distinction between these options when filling out forms, and if so, when? What, if any, consequences are there to marking single instead of divorced?  Three examples:  * I imagine that my massage therapist doesn't really need to know I'm divorced, and even if she'd like to know that, I don't think there are any legal consequences for lying on a medical intake form. * On census forms, it maybe makes sense to mark divorced, since the whole point of a census is to gather demographic information, but while by law I am required to fill out the census, I don't see any avenue by which the census would a) know if I lied or b) be able to do anything about it. * On a credit application, I could see it being fraud if I didn't report legal obligations that reduced my available income (alimony, child support), but some states award 'palimony' and you don't have to have ever been married to owe child support, so as long as I disclosed those obligations, it doesn't seem like lying to check single instead of divorced.  I put [WA] for LocationBot, but this is really a general question and I'd be interested in hearing answers to locations other than the US if it differs. And there is no particular situation I'm in prompting me to ask, it's just a combination of:  * plain curiosity. * I'm really sick of something that happened years ago being considered the fourth-most defining characteristic about me (it's often after full name, birthdate, gender). * pedantic irritation about how it's always a radio button instead of a check list even though I am technically both single because I'm not married and divorced because I used to be married, and if I were to re-marry, I would be both married and divorced and it would still be a radio button, unless by dint of getting re-married I am somehow magically 'un-divorced' in the eyes of the form gods.

"Currently renting in a house that is being sold. The realtor has notified us of a showing and used the wording ""no one should be in the house so the agent can show the property"".   It is my assumption is that there must be some legal precedent or clause that keeps them (or the landlord, considering we have no legal relationship with the realtor, but the landlord does) from making us leave the house during showings. Does anyone know of a clause like this?   The only wording in the lease regarding entry to the property by the landlord explains that we will be given 24 hours notice for non-emergencies (and showings are obviously considered non-emergencies).   The house is in Tennessee."	No
"I rent an apartment in a small, 6-unit building in Los Angeles, and the rental agreement specifies a parking space for my use.   The problem is, the space is impossible for me to use because of a staircase right behind it. Also, the trash cans for all the tenants are continually in it.  [Picture of the situation](http://i.imgur.com/pFoPnHD.jpg) (The area from the line to the wall is our ""space"")  They are insisting that it is a valid parking space, and that we should be able to use it. But we've tried, and it is close to impossible to get it in the space properly if there's no one parked next to us, and if there is, it would absolutely be impossible. And we're not driving an SUV here, it's a Honda Fit.   What is the best course of action here? Is there someone from the city that we should call to have them look at it and see if it meets LA's definition of a parking space? Send a letter to the landlord formally complaining about it?

So basically my gf's mother has always had substance abuse issues, until recently they were manageable. She lost her husband and has gone back to them harder than ever. Xanax being her drug of choice her young son has found her asleep in a bowl of food and in the garage with a cigarette. She just got out of rehab this last week and it didn't seem to help. She is going to endanger herself, the family's house/possessions and we don't know what to do. My gf of course consented to posting this. We are thinking of getting the license plate and name of the dealer that no one knows and is driving her around to find more drugs and calling the cops. Can they help? Any options at all here?  Thank you tons in advance and please let me know if this is the wrong subreddit.	No
A neighbor hired a contractor to come in my land and remove ivy plants that had been growing up my trees for decades. I've spoken to four arborists, and all say they don't value trees or plants, and that I have to ask the insurance company for a valuation.

"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."

I witnessed my (Indonesian) wife attempt to murder our daughter (Two YO), forcing her to drink bleach. Daughter recovered.  I told my mother then and wife confessed to her days later also.  Wife has disappeared with daughter now, demanding ransom over the phone ($20k). I have no legal recourse currently there, and no escape path for her.  I want my elderly mother's witness to my wife's confession to her reported legally, ASAP.  It may be useless, however some day I hope at least that my daughter could see the confession, documented at law firm here.   Could you please recommend a service type?	No
"Hi LegalAdvice  A section in my lease contains the following: ""Lessee shall not at anytime allow local/municipal inspection or inspectors on lessors property. Any housing violation, fine, or fee associated with this type of inspection is the responsibility of the lessee.  Any fee or repairs not done or paid in a timely manner within 20 days is grounds for termination of the lease.""   This doesn't seem legal; if a building inspector shows up, I'm supposed to tell him he can't inspect the property?  And if I do, I am held liable for any fees, even for situations where the lessor refused to make repairs to the building (water leak creating rotten flooring).   Looks like this [Link](http://petriepettit.com/blog/landlord-tenant/so-are-illegal-provisions-in-wisconsin-residential-rental-agreements-severable-or-not) says our lease is void, but I'm trying to understand if I have ground to stand on before paying a lawyer to write a letter.

Hey! If your reading I thank you so much because I need to clear something up in my mind. So I basically shoplifted a few months ago, at sears (ik it's dumb) in April. The police were called as there're policy states. Anyways the police interviewed me and decided not to charge me. They took my info down (DOB,Adress,name) my concern is whether if it would show up any check for any type of employment in the future for event if they didnt charge me (police encounter)! Am I good?

Hi I have some confusion regarding a leasing situation. Ill start with some background info before getting into the details. I signed a 1 year lease with an LLC, in 2015 from august 1st to July 31st. I renewed the lease last year for another year ending July 31st 2017. I sent an email with my notice to terminate the lease on May  2017. Now this is were the issue comes in to play. Last night my roommate sent an email to the landlord with a few general questions about deposit and other moving out related things. She replied that she had no idea that we were moving out and has started with demands that we need to pay rent for august and September.  Now some details from this point on I will refer to the landlord as B and my roommate as J. In 2016 B emailed us a lease renewal document on the June 1st, it had 2 options a check box to renew the lease or a box to terminate lease and vacate at end of the contract. It had a due date of June 5th. Because of this i thought that we needed to provide 60 days notice of intent to terminate the lease. Fast forward to May. After discusions with my gf and J I decided that i would not be renewing the lease. To give B plenty of notice, I sent the email stating my intent to terminate the lease on May 10th, 2017. The email was written as follows:  subject re Tractor   Hi B, I was wondering if you had an update on the mower? I would also like to inform you that I will not be renewing the lease. I met a wonderful women and I will be moving in with her. Last I checked J did not have plans to renew please double check with him.   Regards,  Now I know the email was received and opened on the same day because B replied with an update on the mower. So i assumed she read the whole email since it was 4 sentences. I forwarded that email to B showing her that i did provided notice. upon receiving that email B changed her demands from Aug and Sept rent to that the lease states the tenant must provide 90 days notice and that the lease automatically renewed.  this is what the lease states about renewal: 22. LEASE RENEWAL: A. At the end of this Lease Agreement, Tenant shall have the option to renew the Lease for an additional term that is equal to the initial term of this lease (Term of Lease Agreement) pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein.  B. If Tenant or Landlord does not wish to renew the Lease, written notice must be given to the other party at least 90 days before the end of the term (Term of Lease Agreement) to terminate the Lease (including any exercised renewal or extension thereof).  I understand that I only provided 82 days of notice.  Finally to my questions. Does the section of the lease above actually automatically renew? i understand that it gives me the option to renew and states how to go about terminating the lease but never mentions auto renewal. Since she only required 60 days last year and never sent a renewal email this year do I have some kind of case based on confusion and lack of notification from the Landlord? What should i do and expect from here?  Thanks for your time and advise	No
Long story short, I traded in my old car for a preowned BMW a couple of months ago. The BMW was 5 hours away in PA, and because of my recent move/mother being on the registration to the old car, it was tough to get the paperwork lined up to pick up the car.   She had to sign a SPOA to give me the right to trade the car in and get the new one. I guess the dealer didn't receive it back in time, so we wrote up two contracts, one with the trade and one without. The contract without trade was to be voided upon arrival of the SPOA and mailed to me. It was voided, but never went to me, until the family-friend lawyer got involved. Magically I had everything I needed.   My latest problem is I understand my old car has sold, and the previous owner is now emailing and calling me about the car saying he's have all these problems with it. From what I understand the contract signed at the dealer prevented them from giving out my information. A quick search online also suggests this is against FTC regulation. I'm not looking for any sort of compensation for this, but my question is, can the dealer legally give out my contact information without my consent?	No
I'll try and stick to the facts of the situation in an effort to maximize efficiency.  Location: New Jersey   Issue: Due to an assortment of issues I need to kick out my roommate.  Lease (who is on it): My wife and myself (my roommate is not)  Duration of Stay: 4 months  Questions I Need Answered:  If we ask him to leave is a written 30 day notice required?  What legal options do I have as far as enforcing him to move out?  Other Info: We've given him money which he's blown, a room that he's made look like a dump, and a job which he's lost. I get nothing but excuses when it comes to the things that matter such as looking for work. He refuses to assist with house upkeep on any meaningful level and he never showers which is just, from a sensory perspective is just awful.  Please help.	No
"First post and I'm on mobile so I apologize for the errors/formatting.  Beginning of April A tree has fallen on the back side of my property and is now blocking my path down the hill. Since there was no storm the previous night I checked out the roots of the tree and found grey looking water seeping from the hillside where the tree was. So I decided to contact the health department to see what was up. So I got ahold of the county health department.He said he'd come out and investigate.   April 14th I showed him the water lying underneath the tree. He asked if it was my property, I told him it was on the line seeping into my property and over my bank. He said he'd have to test the water to see if its sewage or not, and to not say anything to my neighbor, ""let me handle it, don't act like you even know me.""   Couple days pass and I notice a large amount of mosquitos laying eggs in the water. The health department sends me some mosquito dunks to deal with that problem, and I ask what's the progress on my case. He tells me that he can't get ahold of my neighbor by phone or knocking on his door, and that there is no record of him installing this sewage tank.   End of June He gets back to me and tells me he ran a test on the water by sending dye down his sink drain and let it run for an hour while he sat and talked to my neighbor. He couldn't find any dye in the grey water so he tells me it can't be from his sewage and that it must be 100 year old leaf water (whatever that is.) Basically telling me I should just drop the whole thing.   Mid July Not satisfied with this I called them again and asked to please not close my case, what else can I do. He told me to take it up with the state. So I called them and they sent over two vials for me to sample the water and send it back to them to be tested.   Yesterday I filled both vials and drove it to Charleston myself.   This morning They called and told me the results and emailed them to me as well and said my neighbors line must have busted or something, test results show positive.  Vial 1 E. coli-present-670 per 100mL  Total coliforms-present-17,329 per 100mL  Vial 2 E. coli-present-591 per 100mL  Total coliforms-present-24,196 per 100mL    So where do I stand? The sewage is eroding my trees and hillside at the back of my property. The man at my county health department apparently dropped the whole part of my neighbor not even installing the tank legally/through the county.   Is there any legal action I can take to have my neighbor remove his septic tank and have it properly installed?"	No
"So this is all happening right now and I'm looking for advice. My cat was lethargic and seemed pale so I took her to the vet. She needs a blood transfusion and they think she got into rat poison. My landlord came on July 21st to ""spray for insects"" but that's all the note said. I'm currently trying to get ahold of him to see what they sprayed. Would they be liable if it is what harmed my cat. The bill will be 1200+ and as a college student that will definitely hurt my current financial status. Any advice is appreciated thanks."	No
Specifically Fairfax County, VA  Our landlord has physically lost our lease. Does this mean we can get out of it? Can someone give me some statutes to quote for the landlord? She is saying she needs to see the lease before she makes any decisions about letting us out. But she doesn't have the lease. I'm tempted to put in my 60 day notice and peace out.  Also, I have the lease but she doesn't know it. I'm not going to give it to her.	No
My father plans on getting re-married later in his life.  I always thought when he passes away my brother and I would gain his inheritance and estate, but will my new stepmother be the new heir?  My father is older than her, so he will most likely pass away first.  My soon-to-be stepmother also has two children of her own.  I'm afraid she will gain all my father's assets and use them to benefit her children.  Is it still possible for my brother and I to inherit all my fathers property and assets when the inevitable happens.  We all live in California.	No
My boyfriend started renting a house in June. He inquired about signing a lease multiple times but the landlord never had him sign a lease. He has been paying all his rent and utilities on time. The house has multiple issues, including a leaking/sinking in roof, walls, clogged pipes, possibly black mold in the bathroom, and overall needs to be deep cleaned. Not a great place, I know. As my bf did his walk through he noted all these issues and since has messaged the landlord multiple times about fixing everything. The landlord response was to do nothing. He's already looked into moving out into a new apartment in August.   Now, my bf and I were supposed to take a road trip out to my home state in June, so I came out to the house so we could get ready to go. After some unexpected expenses, we couldn't go on the trip until the following month. I have been staying with him since.  Today, the other tenet who holds the primary lease (who he has had many issues with, including the landlord telling bf she tried to take money from his overpaying the rent) started yelling at my bf that he needed to pay back rent for me staying here. The landlord never said that I had to leave or that I had to pay anything while I have been here, and when we called to talk to my bf's dad he said that he has never heard of such a thing and he would ask his attorney.  Any advice would be helpful, neither of us have had to deal with all these issues before.	No
So this whole situation began about a month ago. I live in Ohio (Columbus) and I moved out of the state temporarily for work. Since I'd be leaving for the remainder of the year, I wanted to sublease my room so I wouldn't be eating 2 rent costs. I emailed my landlord about it and he approved, although no legal documents were signed for it. I put out a message on facebook that I was looking for a subleaser. A girl contacted me and mentioned that her friend was looking for a place and would pay extra to move in early. Hopping on the opportunity, I got his phone number and began contacting him. Seemed like a really nice guy, said his old roommates stole all of his stuff and he needed a place to live. I had one of my roommates call him (I was out of town) to clear him for move-in. He approved. The first two weeks were fine, with a few complaints about him taking food that wasn't his, etc.  After the lease changed, my new roommates moved in. Instantly, red flags started popping up. They saw him pulling out rolls of cash from his wallet and bringing in far more weed than one person can smoke in a reasonable amount of time. They tipped me off and I said ok he's gone. Roommates told him to get his shit and get out the following afternoon or the police would come and get him themselves. Finally, he left and was gone. While cleaning out his room, one of my roommates found a W-2 that was in a different name than the one he gave us. Also found a bottle of pills prescribed to a completely different name. Not wanting to risk anything, we told our new realty company that we needed the locks changed because he had a key and knew that the balcony windows couldn't lock. They did not come, and the guys had changed the main deadbolt themselves. I just found out today that someone broke in by climbing up the balcony and getting through the window and stole 2 macbooks, xbox games and controllers, and some other items. What do I do? I only have suspicion that it was him, but he would definitely know  that the windows couldn't lock and he very much has a motive. Is our realty company at all liable for any sort of negligence? We mentioned the situation and that we needed all of them changed, including the windows. I'm struggling to figure out what to do as I live over 5 hours away and can't make it back to help sort this all out, and I can't help but feel that it's my fault for letting this guy play me for a fool in the first place. Thanks in advance.	No
Hi all,   I turned 26 this year and got booted from my family's health insurance plan, was making almost no money as a contractor, so I went on Pennsylvania's public health benefits. Two months ago, I got a job offer and I needed to both start right away and move to where the job was, and in the personal tornado of making that happen, I just remembered that I never cancelled my public benefits.   The moment I took the job, I left the income bracket in which I'd been eligible to receive benefits. My health insurance with this new job didn't kick in until one month into it, so I've technically only had 'double health insurance' for one month. The only costs that my benefits have been covering in this overlap period are the monthly rental payments on a medical device I need - it's a cost that I could hypothetically reimburse the state for out of pocket.   What kind of trouble am I in? Obviously, I'd like to take action first thing Monday morning when their phone lines open up and report my mistake, but am I looking at any potential legal issues here?	No
I'm a guy and will be getting married later this year. As I understand it, here in California, it's $435 to file a change of name petition. My fiancée will also be changing her name, to take me (new) surname. I *believe* the $435 covers a family, assuming the changes are done at the same time. If so, makes sense for us to change them together. Can anyone verify?	No
I'm an international student at a Dutch university. In the academic year 2016-2017 I was unable to obtain 30ECs and hence my Residence permit will most likley be revoked. However if I transfer to a different university in the Netherlands to start a new course from Sept 2017 will I be able to stay in the Netherlands? I couldn't contact IND so I'm asking here. I hope someone here knows about this. And the MoMi states that you have to gain 30ECs ie half of the Total 1st year credit points at the University where you're enrolled to continue your studies and stay in the Netherlands.	No
Greetings,  Long story short. I was in an abusive relationship for over 15 years - myself and my children escaped from it - my soon to be ex husband lives in the US. Despite some foolishness by him and his lawyer, the divorce was granted just over a week ago, on the grounds that I contact Relationships Australia, so they can mediate more contact between him and our five children. I had to do so with 14 days of the court ruling. I did so the following Monday and I have an appointment on August 15th.  Two days ago, after I let him know that our children were ready to talk to him, he told me via text that if I didn't directly negotiate with him and send him something in writing before August 4th, 2017, he will be appealing the divorce. This is despite the fact that I have fulfilled the court's requirements.  As far as I know, as I am self representing due to financial constraints, I do not legally have to negotiate outside of the agency nominated by the courts. Nor am I legally required to agree to anything or put anything into writing before August 4th - this is just day 14 from the last court date.  I want to know if there is anything else I can do to stop this? Even talking to this man is a huge trigger for me - anxiety, nightmares, fear. I am going to start seeing a DV counsellor here soon because of the issues he is causing.  FYI: There were never any FVO charges filed because I was in socially and financially isolated in the US. He told me, and I believed at the time, that if I charged him, he would be fired by his employer and it would be my fault that our children would be homeless and destitute. Wrong in hindsight, but very real in that instance.  I also have several family members and friends writing affidavits and statutory declarations concerning what they witnessed etc.  I just want to know if there is anything legally I can do - NOW. To be proactive.  Thank you so much.	No
"My sister's roommate gave us her old washer and dryer to replace our older washer and dryer. Sunday afternoon, the moving company that the roommate hired brought them to us and installed them both, but it felt like they were rushing things to get out of there. They left and forgot to turn the water back on, which I realized when I tried to give the washer a test run.  Today (Tuesday), I discovered that the floor in the laundry room had water under it. In addition, the wall of my bathroom was wet, and a puddle has formed behind the toilet (laundry room and bathroom are back-to-back). I turn off the washer's water valve and my sister called a plumber for me. He found out that the washer's connection to the house's water valve wasn't tightened and was leaking water when turned on, and he was able to turn it a good 5 or so times to tighten it. My sister also had to call a carpet cleaner company to come dry the affected floors and walls, which they're doing now.  My sister called the movers and told them the situation and asked for reimbursement. They refused, saying that it wasn't their fault since they weren't the ones that turned on the valve. They also said that if they really didn't tighten it, then it would've leaked while they were there (it didn't leak while they were there because they forgot to turn on the water though). My sister decides that she'll have to take them to small claims court.  So I'm not exactly familiar with how these proceedings work, so what exactly should we do here? I feel like we have somewhat of a solid case, but I don't want anything to go wrong. Do they have a case for anything with the point of ""we didn't turn on that valve, we can't be responsible?"" I want to say it sounds stupid, but I could be wrong. Any advice?"	No
"I have 2 roommates in a 3 bedroom apartment. ""John"" is the one bringing his family over. He said his mom would be over for a few days, and we consented. He had 10 members of his family over for 5 days, then had 4 members stay over for another 5 days, at which point he had 10 again for the final 2 days.      I told him this was too much when I realized, but he said they had to stay as they had nowhere to go. This is the second time his mom has come in 4 months (totalling 16 days).      We are all on the lease equally. I want to know, what are my rights in this situation? I've googled and saw it was OK if it was just an overnight guest like a girlfriend, but I saw nothing about 10 people... I'm not trying to get all of us kicked out, but it feels like I have no power in this situation if he wants to bring his family back. I told him not to bring them back, but I also said to get a hotel for them, which he did not. Any advice you can give would be helpful"	No
"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	No
"Hello everyone, please help me out.   My Mom needs to get her insurance done, so I need to report my earnings from Wendy's to her report. The last month I worked at Wendy's was January 2017. Recently, I called and they gave me this site to go to which is called netsecure.adp. This is the site that shows all the times they paid me, and I need it to show it to the insurance people. I put in all my information and when I click ""enter"" it says my account is ""locked"". So I call back my Wendy's place and ask the guy if he can help me. I say, ""Can I have a number to talk to? What can I do to fix this? I really need this for my insurance."" He doesn't give me a number to talk to at all. He says I'm locked out my account because I don't work there anymore. I told him I really need it for my insurance, in which he replies ""I don't care"" with a chuckle. Please, someone help me out. I have contacted the store manager last week but she has not gotten back to me!!!!   Thanks everyone!"	No
This is more of a curiosity question; however, it could affect me if the fires affect my area of BC. If the RCMP or Forestry service issue an evacuation order and I believe it is premature or unnecessary do I retain the right to stay on my property which is owned by me? I don't want to leave and stay in some run down hotel or some school gymnasium. So r/legaladvice, can I stay in my home under an evacuation order?	No
All vehicles our parked at owners risk. No liability is assumed by management for loss or damage by fire, theft, or any other cause to, or by the vehicle while in custody of management. All claims must be presented before vehicle is taken from facility. Any person driving becomes the agent of the owner solely. We are.

I'd like to not pay the $275+ obviously. Do I have any recourse or am I SOL?	No
My friend and I had signed a lease and gave our banking information for an apartment unit on July 27th for one year.  Today I found out that our unit has been double booked and the lease has been signed by other people who had signed to pay a higher rent ($1495, we signed for $1150).   Apparently, the owners said our rental price was too low for the three bedroom unit we are renting..but we had already signed the lease with the property manager or whoever was showing us the property with that price ($1150).   She's calling me back later today, but I just want to know what I need to do or say. We had signed the lease already, can they just drop us like that?  I have an email copy of the lease with the rent stated and date we signed.	No
"My friend and roommate has a month-to-month agreement but was given her 30-day notice 30 days ago due to issues with the landlord. She and myself assumed that since the rental ""term"" is one month starting on the first of the month, she would have until August 1st to leave (e.g be out sometime tomorrow). The landlord today told her that she expects her out tonight since it would be 30 days since she was given notice.  Here is the text of the contract:  &gt; The term of this Sublease shall be on a month to month basis terminating 08-01-17. Either party may terminate the Sublease Agreement at any time with a full 30 day notice.  Who is in the right? Does my friend have to be out today, or does she have until the end of the month?"	No
I apologize in advance for my grammar, I'm currently typing this on mobile. My apartment decided to not renew my lease, I was wondering what I can do to make it the easiest process since my management does not like me since I left negative reviews about the place on Google. She asked me to remove it several time in which I politely declined since she refused to resolve any issues I brought to her attention.  Is it possible for my landlord to leave a negative tenant review on me as retaliation for the reviews even if I always paid my bills early and never had a complaint from the neighbors?   My apartment has some wear and tear from the previous tenant such as chips on the closet shelves , rust on the bathtub (which was hidden under an adhesive mat that started to pull up a few months into living here)   I did a video walk through from the day i moved in, is that enough proof to prevent them from pinning on me and charging extra fees?	No
"I went with a friend to his custody hearing yesterday, and I have an odd feeling about the situation.  He had cancer 18 years ago, and has been on SSI/SSDI after they overdosed him with Chemo and he was paralyzed. After years of physical therapy, he can now walk short distances with a cane, but is still very limited and had his disability reviewed/reapproved just 6 months ago.  During the case the Judge has been pressing him by asking things like ""Well you can still sit at a desk and answer phones right?"" And now she wants to see his Soc. Award because she is considering ordering child support based off of minimum wage instead of his actual ~$700 full disability income.  Is this a violation of the ADA at all? He was declared disabled by SSI/SSDI, but can the judge overrule this and charge child support because SHE thinks he can work, even though he has a full disability declaration?"	No
I will be leaving the country for six months for work. I have a few roommates who pay me rent. I have one who I feel comfortable putting in charge of collecting rent and paying any handy men if they are needed. Should I give her a limited power of attorney for these matters? Or is a written contract enough to hold up in any suit should things go south? Is there anything else I should consider to ensure rent gets paid while I'm away? 	No
I'm currently in a volatile relationship that is toxic and destructive to me. However, I've just started a new job and I'm undergoing training that is rarely offered, so I can't miss a day of work. I need a restraining order against my former significant other. If I fill out the paperwork and give them to a friend that is free during the court's normal hours can they submit the paperwork for me?	No
"State: CA / City: Los Angeles  Hi, I am a tenant of this apartment in LA area which was recently purchased by a new owner/management. For the past 7 years living in this apartment, I've had some great experience with the management and never had any issues with them. But this time, I am frustrated with this new apartment manager who is not willing to give us what we've initially deserved when we first moved into this apartment.  For the past few months, I've asked the manager on duty to provide us an additional parking space to park our newly purchased car. But, before I go ahead and proceed with anything, here is a little bit of a background story. As a tenant who lives in a 2 bed/bathroom unit, we were initially given 2 parking spaces when we first moved into this apartment. However, since we only had one car, the apartment manager, at the time, has asked us if they can spare one of our parking spaces to our neighbors who were in need of an additional space which we gladly let them use it without any compensation. (My parents and the manager, at the time, got along pretty well.) The manager has promised us (verbally) that we would get the space back whenever we would purchase an additional car and now with this new owner/management, they are not willing to give us another space which was something that we've originally had been granted.  I've spoken with the current apartment manager numerous times in regards to this matter and all I get from her is ""That was something that you have dealt with the previous management. There are no more spaces available and I can't give you additional parking lot for whatever reason."" I have friends and neighbors who live in a unit with 2 bed/bathrooms with 2 parking spaces (same apartment) and when I inquired about them having 2 spaces, the current manager said ""It all depends on how many cars you have."" The manager did not even care to say they would try or would get us a space when something becomes available and our family is very frustrated with this parking situation now. My little brother has been finding parking spaces on the street late at night after his work, walking great deal of a distance, after finding a space blocks away.  From the contract of ours with the apartment, the only section that mentions parking states: ***""Subject to the provisions of this Lease, the Tenant is entitled to the use of parking (the 'Parking') on or about the Premises. Only properly insured motor vehicles may be parked in the Tenant's space.""*** (As it doesn't specify how many parking spaces can be used, I don't know if I can use this statement to back up our request.)  I am about to write a formal request letter to the HQ of the management and try to explain the frustration of the current situation.  Are there anything that I can do to get our initially given space back?  Add: The previous manager who we dealt with has fled back to his country and is no longer available."	No
This is the third time in a week we've had some kind of power shutoff. We've had exactly one advance warning, and we've lost food that we had in the fridge. Can we withhold rent in the amount it would take to replace our groceries, or are we out of luck?	No
There was an offer for 499 a month on rent and I tried signing the lease online the day after the offer expired and online it said the lease was unsigned. Now I am being told that I do have the lease but I do not want it anymore. Do I have any right to get out of this lease? They're telling me it is legally binding and won't break it.  This is in Illinois	No
Throw away account used as precautionary measure.  **Short version**  Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.  **Long version**  My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have.   Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.  When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.  There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.  The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.  The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.  This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.  I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.  Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.  Any thoughts are appreciated.	No
"My boyfriend and I have been living in a co-op apartment for two and a half months now. The landlord lives in Europe, is elderly, and is only reachable by email.   Before we moved in, the place was gross. It needed a deep cleaning, which was never done, but we agreed to take it as is in exchange for almost an entire month rent free. We spent 2 weeks straight scrubbing the place of smoke stains, spills, and mildew from the last tenant. We also made the mistake of not checking every appliance or nook and cranny before signing the lease.   All of the appliances are probably near 20 years old, most work fine. The fridge has been making noises every few hours and we're afraid something is loose or will break with it at some point, so we told the landlord. She told us to have it checked out by a repairman but will not pay for anything because when she was last there it ""worked fine"".   The bathtub has been having an issue of pouring from the spout when the shower head is on and dripping when the water is supposed to be off. She told us this is a ""minor repair"" and we need to pay for it.   Other issues regarding a broken door lock and semi-broken dishwasher were brought up and she agreed to cover expenses.   The wording in my lease regarding repairs and responsibility isn't very clear so I don't know what to do. Its fine by me to leave the stuff as is and ignore it until there's a serious issue that she'll have no choice but to address. I don't want to be blamed for things breaking even though the appliances are older and plumbing has had this issue since moving in. I don't know how to approach this situation to avoid having a bad relationship with the landlord, but I don't want to pay for these repairs which should've been done before we moved in."	No
"My boyfriend and I have rented an apartment for the past year, and it's been a terrible experience.   To name a few issues to establish a feeling of our stay: we've made multiple noise complaints because the neighbors downstairs have family parties that have very loud music playing with all their doors and windows open that last until late hours of the night. Management told us no one else complains and that it used to be worse, so basically deal with it. Those same neighbors have confronted us multiple times and even left a note taped to our patio that they are calling the cops because they believe we throw trash onto their balcony. We never did. We don't even use our balcony. Management then told us she's diabetic or something and gets moody so ignore it.   The whole place is also horribly infested with cockroaches and nothing we did ever helped.   We did not get along with the maintenance people because they entered our patio without telling us a few times to do some work on the lights and also threw away a box I had up there when they did work on the lights. Once I caught one of them I caught looking into our bathroom window when I was home alone (no proof they were just working on the wall. Just creepy because I looked up, made eye contact and he suddenly left). We weren't friendly after that but not malicious either.   Also the landlord was always incredibly nosy and once entered our apartment without prior notice while we were in the bedroom doing things. When confronted she said she put the wrong paper under our door and just had to come in and get it. However she was in there for at least three minutes. I believe it could be longer because we didn't hear the door open. We heard our things being moved around. We were freaked out and didn't come out until she left.   Also the building is very old, so they're always under construction. When a yearly inspection was done, we were instructed not to talk about any issues to the people coming out to evaluate. The water is frequently turned off. The whole building is shifting, and our walls developed cracks while we lived there too. We didn't expect much. It's a bad area and cheaper than most places we could get into. We needed to move quickly and settled.   So here's where I need advice. Yesterday my boyfriend and I were moving furniture. We moved a few items (couches and futon) by the dumpster because we didn't need them. We have seen other tenants do this previously, but obviously just because everyone else is doing it doesn't make it right. A maintenance worker approached us as we were nearly finished saying to dump it up front, which yes is illegal. We said okay. We loaded some stuff onto our truck. We put the cushions and smaller item into the dumpster, which filled it up. The other things we would move later because we needed a break. So as we're leaving, another guy comes up and tells us again. We say ""yeah later we will; we were informed."" We leave to go drop our stuff off.   As we're coming back, we get a long email. It says that we were being fined for an hour of labor because they the maintenance guys moved the stuff back to the patio, for a fee to get the bulky items removed, and for a broken step to be repaired. Now this step was actually cracked before we got there. I have no photo evidence of that. It partially broke off as I was walking down WITHOUT furniture. I slipped a bit, but I have no injuries besides a preexisting injury hurting a little more than usual. However it doesn't look like I was hurt like no bruises or scratches. I took a photo where you can see it had been previously repaired because the part that didn't break off has a cemented over crack. Another lady is actually the person that broke the rest off and kicked the pieces down. However when we called the landlord, she said it was our fault because we hadn't used a dolly to carry couches down the stairs. Not sure how we would do that but okay. She said she had photo evidence of the items near and in the dumpster and that it obviously looked like we had dropped furniture on the step causing it to break. She said we only conveniently mentioned it broke before we carried furniture down it after being accused. It looks like a huge he said she said though because their story seems likely even though it didn't happen like that.   I went back today and all that was carried back up to the patio was cushions and the futon, not even everything. We arranged for bulky item pick up on Thursday. I also read over our lease and there's a clause that states we have to follow all rules they make and another saying if either party sues we have to pay up to $500 for their attorney fees.  So basically should I sue over it or suck it up and pay the fees? Because I understand that I probably can be charged for putting the furniture in the back even though I didn't really know. It still was our bad putting it back there. At the same time though we didn't break the step. The landlord is refusing to work with us, and since we already have a bad relationship with them, I don't think they will work with is. She hung up on us saying we were being uncivil for saying we're going to consult with a lawyer and that we didn't break anything and would have removed the items. Also if we sue we have to pay for their fees. This is a horrible situation and I still don't know the cost. We haven't even had a pre-move out inspection yet. I think they're going to try to screw us as much as they can. Do I have options?   If anything is unclear I can answer more in the comments. I have the emails of noise complaints, but most of the follow ups from management were verbal. I have a photo of the stairs partially broken. I have a photo of them repairing the stairs. I have a photo of half our items on the balcony."	No
My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	No
Okay, so here is the story, my neighbor drinks heavy and is a heavy drug user. Due to this she gets very violent and is always running outside and pondering on different doors. I have called the police multiple times and told me apartment manger about it each time. Nothing is done, and has gotten to the point I don't free safe walking my dog at night and on top of that I have my elderly mother living with me and she is scared to even leave the place for a second. My question is at this point can I break my lease without paying the huge fees? I still have 10 months left otherwise.	No
I am the beneficiary of my deceased father's teacher's pension through the state of wisconsin (Which will run for 7 years we are approaching the end of year 4). My parents divorced in Iowa in 2000-2001 where it seems the divorce papers said the other was supposed to list each other as beneficiaries, but neither one ever did, instead putting them both in my name. They would even laugh about it when they talked about it since they remained friends post-divorce (I know, how weird, right?)   Winter 2014 I received paperwork about the pension and my Mother was okay with and excited for me to have a nest egg. A few months later she was fired from her job and threatened to sue me for the pension if I didn't do what she wanted with money (take a lump sum instead of monthly installments). She eventually backed off. At that time I had called the pension people who said they would have required special court-ordered paperwork in order to change the beneficiary in those conditions and they never received it. The lawyer whom I met with in Iowa (as I was living there at the time) had said the same thing. She said something would have had to been filed with the court while filing the divorce, which never was.   Spring of 2017 she threatened to sue me again. Sending semi harassing texts, letters to my home, and even showing up on my doorstep (She lives on a different coast than I)without invitation. She has been announcing on Facebook that I am dead or will be dead soon because I am a drug addict (never touched a drug in my life). I received a letter yesterday, 8\8\2017 from a lawyer saying unless I'm willing to settle this matter she will be suing me. I am not sure what to do at this point.	No
Basically, I'll make this pretty concise and simple. I had a child that CPS was involved with during and after the birth due to a terrible decision of mine and a positive drug test. My aunt now has temporary custody. I have passed every drug test, I've complied with all court orders, and I'm on the way to getting my son back. However, the CPS workers involved have, behind closed doors, openly ridiculed me, accused me of altering drug tests but refusing to send them to a lab, and generally been very openly judgmental and difficult to get along with. So, my question is, WHO can I turn to as an advocate for my rights and complaints? The GAL? The CPS case worker's supervisor? A human rights advocate? Can I request a court-appointed attorney? Perhaps a change of venue to another county? Can my case worker be remanded due to personal bias? I've tried to research this information on my own, but only found information regarding proceedings and my rights, but not who I can contact as my advocate in the matter. Thank you to any and all who can point me in the right direction. Again, I live in Virginia.	No
My girlfriend and I just recently had our apartment broken into and had several thousand dollars worth of items stolen/damaged. No one was hurt as both of us were at work and we have renters insurance so it's not a huge financial hit to us.   The problem is with the building management being what appears to us as negligent about security issues. After talking to other tenants, burglaries have been a problem in the building since January and nothing about security seemed to change after that. We were never informed about these problems when we signed a lease in May. There are two doors with codes and fab access. The back door to the parking lot doesn't always close completely and needs to be pulled shut by whoever uses it (defeats the purpose of a secure door). I never emailed about this but it's possible that someone else in the building did. The codes on these doors also are always the same. The elevator has a code to access your floor but this code works for every floor and there are always the stairs. Management says there are security cameras but I don't see any.  Management also isn't exactly quick if at all to respond via email on these security topics. The incident happened Monday and we aren't getting a new lock until Thursday morning (2 days, 16 hours later). Called the emergency maintenance # to get a new lock the day of the burglary and no one answered or called back. We had to email again after the first time to get a response the next day.   Wondering if it would be in my best interest to file a civil lawsuit against the building management for negligence of security.	No
I filed for unemployment on July 4th. I had no hours at all from July 2nd to July 12th. That's basically two weeks of no work and I see no reason this will change. I am in effect unemployed.  I quit my previous job. My concern is that I will be denied unemployment because I quit that job, because when I look at the eligibility verification, it lists only the job I quit, not the job I have now where my hours have been cut to nothing.  I should say what is going on his not due to any misconduct on my part. I have been trying very hard at this job, but nothing I do makes the store manager happy. So she cut me down to no hours for one week, four hours the next, making me basically unemployed. I assume she isn't firing me because she is trying to get out of me possibly getting unemployment.  If anyone has any idea for what recourse I have, I'd appreciate it. I am looking for a new job but it's been slow going.  If I get denied I do plan to appeal, I'm just wondering what my odds are of not getting denied, since I'm filing unemployment for the job where my hours have been cut, not the job I quit. I live in massachusetts.	No
"California.  So me and 2 other friends were eyeing this great 3bdr/3.5bath (or so we thought) place. Listed as such. I went and looked, the landlord kind of was rushing through the showing, I saw the 3 bedrooms and only saw 2.5 of the bathrooms. (The 3 bedrooms are upstairs, master has one in suite, and I only caught one of the other bathrooms, assuming a closed door was the other. The downstairs has a half bathroom).  Lease mentions nothing about # of rooms / bathrooms, just the address. We moved in and there it's only 2.5 baths (1 in master bedroom, 1 upstairs, and the .5 bathroom downstairs).  We have a screenshot of the ad that states ""Each of the bedrooms has its own private bath""  Is there anything we can do? Grounds to break lease or no? We all wanted a private bath. We will make due - but think we should get a reduction in rent."	No
My family is part of a 'tennants in common' summer house. It was first owned by my mother's aunt who passed away and gave it equally to her family. There are seven 'shares' and for those that don't know, tennants in common mean that each of us own it 100% equally.  The shares were first divided as:   My mom (M) =1.5 shares  Sister 1 (S1) = 1.5 shares  Sister (S2) = 1 share   Aunt1 (A1)= 1 share  Aunt2 (A2) (has 2 shares after her brother died)  1. Aunt2 is also the 'head' leader with everything in her name because she was the closest to the house, had the time and energy to run the bills and we all paid the bills to her and she was so brilliant with everything running smoothly.  2. Aunt2 has developed Alzheimers and is now being taken care of by Aunt1. Legally, everything has been turned over to Aunt1 since she is the primary caretaker.  3. Aunt1 is going through legal troubles (a foundation company accidentally did something to her basement and caused her house to collapse, so she's in that legal battle that may not be over for a couple years and she is literally living off of Aunt2's money (who was always very good at managing her money and has quite a nice amount).  4. She also recently divorced JUST before her house collapse and was old fashioned and never had to work before, so now that she's in her 60s she isn't exactly able too. So she doesn't really know how to get money except from sueing everyone. she's stressed out from taking care of Aunt2 full time, and has finally reached a breaking point that she no longer wants part of this precious house that we all own. So she has decided to sell it/ make us buy her out or-else.  5. Because Aunt1  is legally in charge of Aunt2, that also means she technically has 3 shares. So she's trying to make us buy out all three shares even though the rest of us desperately want to keep this. It's been in our family for almost a century. Aunt2 is unfortunately so far gone that she cannot understand what is going on and can't stop her.  We have been battling this issue since last summer and we are truly worried we might actually lose this house, despite four shares  wanting to 100% keep it. My twin and I were both proposed to there, my big sister was married there, and we've had so much life lived there that we all want to do anythig to keep it, we can't afford the $50k x 3, for those shares.  Any help at all, any guidance, anything you wonderful people could offer as help would be so so SO great.	No
My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	No
