So I have a condition called POTS (posterial orthostatic tacacaridia syndrome) and was just fired from my job because of it. It causes me to pass out when I go from sitting to standing sometimes. It's happened three times at work over the past year and they decided that it's not okay for them to have me around anymore. I am a club volleyball coach and I was wondering if it's legal to fire me over this. I'm unconscious for about 30 min and am still able to work after I wake up. Is there something that can be done? Any response would be appreciated even if it's completely okay for them to do this. 	Yes
"I work as a delivery driver for an international pizza chain. I make $4.50/hour when i'm on the road, and $8.00/hour when I am in the store. Today while I was still on a delivery, somebody inside the store clocked me into the store (something that managers do in order to make their numbers look better). When my shift ended an hour later, my general manager approached me and told me that I was committing fraud because I had clocked into the store while on a delivery. They told me I wouldn't be fired, but I needed to pay for the pizza that I had delivered (when I got clocked in) and they took $25-$30 dollars out of the tips that I made for the day. I told them that the pizza that they are trying to make me pay for was paid for BY THE CUSTOMER with a credit card. My manager didn't seem to care and said she would ""look into it."""	Yes
I'm in Missouri. My boss claims that because of IRS requirements I cannot be paid drive time to our second office. Unless I clock in at our main office and ride in the company car with others. Is this company policy? Or is this actually an IRS requirement. 	Yes
So my ex-employer is a real shady POS (tax fraud, insurance fraud, etc). So the story is that for the past 2 months, he's been having big-time money problems, which caused our last four paychecks to be 7-10 days late. But then he got a loan for a couple hundred k, and now we have money again. My last paycheck was supposed to be 07/03, but I was on PTO (we don't have a written PTO policy, but other employees have taken PTO without any ramifications, and he said I could take it) until 07/05. While I was gone, he kept pressuring me to DocuSign this NDA and non-compete. He still owes me $3k for unpaid medical expenses (signed employment contract states medical coverage is part of benefits, but our insurance was retroactively cancelled in April, which caused all my doctor appointments from January to April to be rejected by insurance, so small bills became huge). He's promised to pay this back numerous times, but of course, he hasn't. I told him I'd sign the NDA/Non-compete out of goodwill, but I expected him to honor his contract and pay me for consequential damages caused by the insurance cancelling. When I return to the office, he seizes my phone and laptop (I'm guessing to get rid of my evidence I've collected against him) and locks me out of my emails. I took this as termination, even though he said it wasn't (I'm sure this was a ploy to get me to stay, so he could further insulate himself from potential damage), but since I wasn't paid, I was out of there. So I sent him a demand letter since he has 6 days to pay me my final paychecks. My question is this: I know he's going to claim that my PTO was unauthorized, but can I claim that's discriminatory because other employees literally took PTO the week before and it didn't affect their paycheck. He also told me to send the hours I was into the office, knowing that none of the employees had been to the office (yet again, none of them had to fill out time sheets) because 1. we hadn't been paid yet and 2. creditors were coming into the office threatening to blow or shoot the place up until they got their money. I was still working, and I had text messages/emails of 1. asking for him to pay server costs, so I could continue working on the website and 2. him sending me to various companies to collect bills on our company's behalf (also promising to pay my medical reimbursement if I managed to collect checks). Will he be able to deny me my last paycheck by claiming I didn't go into the office. And should I threaten what I have on him (tax fraud, insurance fraud)? I also have access to technical systems I set up (and technically own because I bought them with my own money in case something like this happened). Should I take down the systems, or will this backfire on me and allow him to sue me for damages or something. This is really complicated because this guys was SOOOO unscrupulous, sloppy, and corrupt. What do you guys propose is the best course of action? Thanks so much!	Yes
"Thank you for reading this and I understand that this is not exactly the official advice I should run into a courtroom with but I will take any and all advice and suggestions.  Long story short; my wife accepted a post at a summer job for eight weeks and signed a contract for this position.  This post is in New Jersey. The contract is for an 8 week position and she is to be paid $2450 total for all 8 weeks.  First question: As this position requires her to work from at least 8:30 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday, that makes a total of 37.5 official working hours per workweek. She's getting $306.25 per week. That translates to $8.17 an hour and in NJ, minimum wage is $8.44 and hour. Is that legal to hire employees via a contract for under minimum wage? Does it matter if it is a seasonal position?  Second question, going with the 7.5 hours of a work day, she is not given any breaks during the day. She has to set up for the next 'class' and she was told that her break is at 5 PM. Remember, her shift ends at 4 PM. Is that also legal? I thought labor laws required employees to take a break roughly every 5 hours.  Third question; is mandatory orientation and training required to be paid to the new hiree? She was told she had to attend these events which took place on three Saturdays prior to her starting date. Each event was roughly 8 hours. She also has had to work other events prior to the start of job such as a ""meet the parents"" night. She has not seen any compensation for this.  Besides teaching during the 7.5 hours per day, she was told she has to drive a minivan to pick up coworkers and clients and that she would be given $600 as a bonus for the 8 weeks of doing this. That breaks down to $75 per week which is $15 per day. The route is roughly an hour each way and that's not including her time to refuel the vehicle and do the mandatory safety inspection checklist of the vehicle to make sure the vehicle is in proper working conditions.  Furthermore the work van is being rented from a company and my wife's name is not on the contract for the vehicle nor is she listed as an authorized driver for the vehicle.   What would be the ramifications if she was driving the vehicle and something happened? The company she was hired by claims they have their own insurance for the vehicle but with all the other questionable activity, I no longer trust that situation.   Also, what would be the ramifications for her leaving this position before the eight weeks are up? She has a full time job throughout the year but summers are off. This job was mainly just for a little extra summer spending money.  I hope my rant made some sense; I am going by this handle rather than my normal handle to avoid having her identity exposed. Thank you all for your help, time, and support."	Yes
"I've been working at a cell phone store for 2 and a half months and I'm the only employee there. He refers to me as a ""manager"" and yet I get paid minimum wage. When I applied to the craigslist ad it said that it was an hourly plus commission sales job. But I've yet to see any form of commission on my ADP pay stub. He's trying to sell the business on top of that. Is there anything I can do? He only owns this one cell phone store and he's a really bad business owner. Is there anything I could do? "	Yes
"Work from home. Have MacBook. MacBook died today--against company policy to take it to Apple Store or anywhere other than our IT department. Problem is... I work for the top sales rep at the company (he's in CA but I'm in UT) and IT is based in TX... I leave for a week on Monday for Amsterdam which is not a vacation, as I planned to work the whole time there. My computer died this AM (hard drive issue on MacBook, never encountered it before) and my boss is insisting I need to take my vacation days since my computer is broken and they won't be able to fix it for ""some time"" (our IT dept is sooooo slow).... they COULD just ship me a loaner laptop to Amsterdam since our company is global and it wouldn't be an issue,,,. But my boss is legitimately trying to force me to take my vacation days ""since I'll be out of the country anyway"". Is that legal?!?!?"	Yes
Hey, so I'm getting laid off in the state of Pennsylvania. I have a bit of advanced warning, and I know they are going to offer me a shitty contract employee position that pays by the job.  I'm not going to accept that job, and am actively looking for work. It won't pay nearly as well, and involves being out in the field 100%, while my current position only requires occasional field work.   Can I file for unemployment in my state? Or does my rejecting the shitty job disqualify me? I'm pretty surey boss offers everyone he fires a shitty job to avoid paying unemployment to anyone.   It won't affect my decision, but it will help me plan financially.   Thanks!	Yes
