Post: To preface, we live in Georgia in the United States. My girlfriend is 19 years old.   So my girlfriend was offered a job as a manager of a brand new store that was opening up at the beginning of July. This was the second of an already existing store in the town we live in. She was offered the manager position, $12 a hour, at least 40 hours a week, the freedom to make her own schedule, 5% of sales at the end of the year from both stores, and a bonus at the end of year.   So they hired her and no contracts were signed before or after hiring. No official papers stating what she would be doing or that she worked there at all. She starts the job during her two week notice at her previous job. They "train" her, which was really just teaching her how to run the register and computer system and using her for labor. She was told to find employees to run the new store that would open roughly four weeks after she started. So I help her set up an online ad for the position of part time employee and numerous (probably 30) applications came in.   She reached out to a few applicants to set up interviews only to be told it was completely up to her to hire these employees because they would be splitting her hours with her. So she decided to hire none and no interviews took place. During her time at the pre existing store she worked alone probably 80% of the time. Over 40 hours a week not by choice.   So the new store opens up. It's a good 40 minute drive to the new location for everyone involved. She's scheduled to work everyday its open for the first week. And she works there with the owners daughter. (The only employees are the owner, owners daughter, my girlfriend, and someone who was hired not long after her to cover at the pre existing location). The daughter mentioned how the other employee would not work at the new location because she "didn't have the look for it." The owners daughter is very rude to my girlfriend as well. Always complaining about what she did the night before and telling her she should know how to do her job. The problem with that is, she received very little training if you could even call it that. Every day she would tell me how she got in trouble and sometimes openly in front of customers.   Then comes the Fourth of July. She's running the store alone and is left a letter from the boss. The letter is two pages long front and back that states she has a learning curve and didn't train well. It also states that the boss never guaranteed 40 hours a week and that she wouldn't receive her bonus or percentage of sales. She even mentioned reducing her hours each week.   So she texts me the letter and asks her parents and we all agree she should quit the job because it was nothing what they offered her and we felt she wasn't being treated properly. We believe she was used to make the drive to the new store because the owner and her daughter had no interest in doing it daily. That's just a theory however.   So she texts the owners daughter that she quits and needs to come to the store to take over. She continued to work and help customers and make sales until the owners daughter arrived to relieve her.   She worked 8-10 hour shifts alone in busy towns. She wasn't given an opportunity to go grab food or take a break. She couldn't use the bathroom unless there were no customers, which was rare and when there weren't she had to run to make sure no one came in. She was never given any pay stubs for any of her checks and in the letter the boss stated that she guesstimates her pay and overtime pay. I correctly calculated her overtime pay and it was double what she was actually paid.   My question is: what here is illegal - if any of it is. I believe some of it may be and we're curious what we can do about it. Apparently someone heard about what happened to my girlfriend and said the same store and boss and did the exact same thing to another person previously.   Sorry for the long patchy story.   tl;dr: Girlfriend was offered a management job at a new store and was given zero management duties. She couldn't take a break to get food and eat and could rarely use the bathroom. Owner and her daughter were rude to her and told her another employee didn't have the look to work at the new store. She received zero pay stubs with checks and was underpaid for overtime hours. She also received a letter claiming she had a learning curve during training when they never properly trained her or worked with her enough to know how she was.

Post: So at my job, we make deliveries and my employer pools and distributes our delivery tips based on the number of hours we work. We share a company car for these deliveries, and one of my coworkers got caught by an automated speed enforcement camera and the $100 ticket was sent to our boss. Apparently we have received a ticket before (I, along with a couple of my other corkers, have no knowledge of this) and it was paid for by the company. This time, our boss is upset about it and wants to pay for the ticket out of our pooled tips. This can't be legal, can it?  Additional info: * We have never been informed about this policy (until now), nor have we signed any sort of agreement. * We can tell exactly who was in the car when we got the ticket based on the ticket's timestamp and info on our delivery service's app, which shows delivery times and the driver...so a lot of us find it unfair that we are all paying for it, even though it isn't a huge sum of money split amongst us.

Post: So I'm an employee at subway. This particular one is owned by a shady ass dude. He owns many others as well. To preface, this has never happened to me, I don't work enough hours, but there is hard proof this has happened to an old coworker and the regional manager of these subways. To avoid paying either of these people overtime, when they are working 60-80 hour weeks. He has been doing this for some time. He gets around paying them overtime by sending 2 checks, each from a different store. He has also payed many employees in cash/ with a personal check in place of a paycheck in order to keep the taxes that were taken out for himself. I have hard evidence of this too, even though it has never happened to me. The owner, let's call him DT, has been doing this for 5+ years, systematically taking advantage of undereducated employees and people dependent on a job at his subways so that no one has/can challenge him. So my question is this: is DT just shady as all fuck, or could they have a legitimate case against him?

Post: So I know similar questions have been asked about this, but my current bf's situation is completely different and I can't talk to anyone about this and feel completely alone.   My partner just got a call from a one night stand he had 5 years ago claiming he has a four year old child. (they worked together at the same company so she found his number through mutual friends on Facebook) Anyway, when she was 6 months pregnant she said to him that it might be his but then weeks later said it wasn't and that she had slept with two other men that same week and that he shouldn't worry. Well she called two weeks ago for the first time in 2 years and insisted it was his, wants child support and that he should come and do a paternity test immediately. My boyfriend only told me this yesterday, I've never seen him this nervous and upset.   The problem is, is that we live in a different country now. Have been for 3 years.  So he would have to fly a 13 hour flight and pay for the expensive test. Well he doesn't have to but is scared she might go to court, convince them that its his and put a block on his passport or a warrant for his arrest. Probably would have to get lawyers involved as well. He has a job, responsibilities here and can't just leave. We're quite serious in our relationship and this might change every dynamic of it, I guess I'm just lost and he doesn't really know what to do. Any advice would be appreciated.

Post: I recently attended a concert that was put on by a third-party entertainment company which used Eventbrite to sell tickets. The concert was advertised to run for four hours and included a T-shirt and poster as part of the ticket sales. Long story short, the artist showed up 3 hours late and only performed for 10 minutes, if that. T-Shirts were distributed, but posters were not.  The refund policy set by the entertainment company (and restated through Eventbrite) was no refunds. I submitted a refund request through Eventbrite anyway but it is stated that it is at the discretion of the entertainment company to respond to the request if they want to.  I'm considering disputing the transaction through Bank of America as I made the purchase through credit card. Do I have grounds for a chargeback or dispute for bad services rendered? I realize that the bank will ask if I tried to contact the merchant first, but with a no refunds policy it seems unlikely that either Eventbrite or the entertainment company would respond. What are my options in this scenario, from a legal standpoint?   If it is relevant, I have been using this credit card through Bank of America for over 3 years now, haven't missed a payment, have high credit, and have never requested a chargeback on anything.

Post: At the beginning of June, I was in stop-and-go traffic and a woman in her car flagged me over to the side of the road. She claims I rear-ended her. I didn't think I did, and saw no evidence of damage to my car. I asked her if she wanted to file a police report, she said no. I gave her my information, never admitting fault, but not wanting to be accused of fleeing the scene of an accident. I let her take a picture of my insurance and my license, but it had my old address (I had literally just moved that day). I did not provide my new address or phone/email. When my insurance agency called, I disputed the claim and gave my version of events to the best of my ability. A few days later they called and said they were not claiming liability on the accident. Hooray, I thought I was done with this. Today, I received a letter from the state police. It has a driver Information Exchange and an Illinois Motorist Report enclosed, asking me to mail it to the department of transportation.  The reason that I'm worried is because, due to an issue with an emission test, my car's registration was expired on the date of the alleged collision. Because of that, I have a few outstanding tickets for registration violation that are currently sitting on seizure (they will boot me if they find the car). My car is currently parked in my garage until I can save enough to pay the tickets and re-register. I also have not yet reported my change of address to the DMV. I'm worried that this lady's meddling is going to get me in trouble with the DOT.  I know there's a lot there. What is my best course of action for responding to this letter? What can I do to strengthen my case that I did not collide with this woman's car? What actions should I take with the city to avoid getting an arrest warrant or something? Do I need to inform the DMV of my changed address immediately? Sorry to be so uninformed.
