A conversation with one of the owners of my company has me wondering.  He is advocating for docking pay for mistakes.  His example was to dock an hour of pay even if the mistake took the employee only 5 minutes to correct.  His reasoning is that docking only 5 minutes of pay would not hurt the employee enough to not make the mistake again.  His intention is to punish not to recover actual costs.  This is also a job with a lot of judgement required and grey areas.  Therefore, this would be a matter of him deciding after the fact that performance or the outcome was not sufficient.   The employees make over minimum wage and are part time hourly employees.  In researching this, I found conflicting information.  The law says that hourly employees must be paid for all hours worked.  It also says that pay can be docked as long as overall compensation does not drop below minimum wage.  Before anyone says it, yes, I am looking for a new job.  1. Can he deduct pay, by the hour, as a punishment? 2. Would it make it legal if he made it a set dollar amount, like a fine, as long as it does not drop below minimum wage? 3.  If he could reason that the company lost X dollars due to the mistake, would that give him legal rights to dock pay?  I don't understand how reducing agreed upon pay by arbitrary amounts could be legal but the law seems to contradict itself.	Yes
I'm an FLSA exempt employees in California.  Last weekend, my employer had a major emergency and needed me to remedy it.  After working my 40 hour week, I was kept in the office until obscene hours and asked to return each day of the weekend.  When the problem was fully solved, I had spent nearly 40 extra hours working between the hours of 6pm friday and midnight Sunday. I slept very little each day. When I asked if I could take Monday off to fix my sleep schedule, I was told no. I have yet to receive any extra compensation and am being asked to work every Saturday for a month, on top of my Monday-Friday work week. By EOD this Saturday, I believe I will have seen a 90+ hour work week with no extra compensation.  Enough of the sob story. I just wanted to give context around the magnitude of the situation.  I've read many posts on FLSA exempt employees and how they can be required to work extra without a compensation change. I consider that a given.  My question is, what's the upper boundary of extra required hours? Surely there are laws to protect these workers from situations that are a danger to their health?	Yes
I cut my finger good enough with a workplace appliance to have to go to an urgent Care facility. Got a tetanus shot and some stitches. Workers comp seems to be the way to go, but I am fairly confident I will test positive for marijuana if drug tested. Does this have potential to impact my workers comp? Seems completely unrelated...	Yes
I work at a boy scout camp in the sierra national forest in california. My camp director just announced that the majority of staff would not be allowed to eat the food prepared by the kitchen staff, and instead, for wednesday lunch would be eating the food prepared by the scouts. I don't trust the scouts to not give me food poisoning. Is there a law in california that says employers must offer food that has been prepared by a licensed professional? We don't have any other options to eat, it is either the dining hall, or starve.   I don't know if the sierra national forest thing matters, but I included it just in case	Yes
I requested to use my PTO and sick days instead of short term disability or FMLA after I give birth in a month because I will need to take FMLA later in the year when I will have no family help and therefore need to be at home.  My employer says they have never had this type of request before (taking PTO instead of FMLA) and that they will dock my vacation days since I do not want to take FMLA at this time.  Is this OK to do? I know they can't legally dock my sick time as per NY law you are required to provide 40 hours of sick time but is it OK for them to dock the vacation time they provided me as well?  Seems weird.  My husband is taking parental leave from his company and he gets to take his full PTO (his is accrued). My PTO is not accrued, I get it the first day of the year.	Yes
He was pulled aside after a shift and accused of theft. The LP guy said he had video evidence, fingerprints, and if he admitted it he'd let him keep his job. He then took his phone and wouldn't give it back until my friend went to the carrier to have them print out a receipt as proof of ownership. The LP guy then called the carrier store to speak to that employee to confirm that my friend had in fact walked in. After that, he said he was still lying because he must be friends with the employee at the carrier store.   He then said if he gave up whoever stole it he'd be rewarded with a check. Said his boss was on vacation so he'd like to wrap this case up before he arrived. He also banned my friend from using his phone and that if he was ever caught he'd personally escort him out and have his job.   Apparently to even take your phone in the trucks it has to be registered and a sticker is placed on the back. My friends sticker faded so it didn't have the info the LP guy wanted. However, when they checked the records of the registered phones her serial number, the IMEI, and all the information added up. The LP agent then accused my friend of making a counterfeit sticker to put on it so he could steal phones.   What can he do? If you guys have any more questions I'd be happy to provide more information. This is the gist of what has happened.	Yes
I recently switched jobs but when I received my last paycheck none of my vacation hours were on it. I assumed, since I've always been paid for my vacation time when I leave a job, that they were supposed to pay for the vacation time I earned. After searching google I found some sites saying that I'm owed and others that says it's up to the company. Does anyone know what the laws are about these things? This happened in Arkansas if that's relevant.	Yes
I live and work in Ohio. My job is taking out taxes for PA. I called my boss, he said he would fix it, he didn't. I called HR and they said I have to fill in a form from the IRS, but they were unable to tell me what form. Is it a W-4, and who do I send it to? HR didn't know who to send it to, either.   Google and the company website say payroll should fix it. I'm confused. Searches only pull up that I should file out of state during tax time, but that's a while away.  Thank you in advance.	Yes
"He hired me out of college and now is deciding not to pay me. It's been 4 weeks since my last ""payday"" and 2 weeks since I stopped working for him due to lack of payment. Being that I was ""under the table"" what can/should I do?  He owes me $530+"	Yes
So my employer wants to pay me a per diem for one position so that I can still work another position without incurring overtime.  My would look like this: 0700-1500 on per diem 1500-1900 hourly rate  This seems like a fraudulent way to avoid paying overtime?  Thanks in advance for any insight!	Yes
thats as basic as i could put it and can elaborate more if anyone has questions about my actual work situation or if i was not specific enough. any advice either negative or positive i feel can help me understand.	Yes
"I'm a 24 year old male, (was) working in a metallurgical quality control lab of a steel stamping plant with two old ladies (who I despise). I tolerated the 12.25hr job for a year now. Yesterday it was just me and my manager (the one who groped me) in the office and I said some like ""Yeah he's in a meeting or something"" and she awkwardly grabs my bicep in a weird in a unusual way. This isn't the first time this has happened either.   I went straight to HR and the president of the company and told them what happened,  and they were trying to make me sound like I'M crazy and hats a normal thing to do when you need to get someone's attention (even though we were alone in the office and right next to each other). They sent me home to ""calm down and collect myself""  So, this morning I go into work with the intention of going straight to my manager and saying ""Listen, about yesterday, I just don't like being touched like that"" and when I try, she interrupts me mid-sentence and tells me to go talk to HR.. I go into HR and they basically tell me that I can still use them as a reference, for another job because I'm no longer ""compatible"" to work with my manager in that quality control office.   The place was beginning to make me want to kill myself and I don't think 12.25/hr was worth that anyways. I just don't know what to do now. Hopefully a years worth of experience is enough to get somewhere else in quality control. I feel like they were scared they could get sued. Help."	Yes
I work 80-110 hours a week. I have 80 of available PTO that must be used within the next two months. I have requested single days off and up to 3 days off for PTO vacation days and every single time they say I can't for one reason or another.  They say if I don't use the PTO it will just be unused and wont roll over. They also won't pay for what I don't use. Over the course of the last 10 months off I have put in 14 requests and all have been denied. So what is the point of me getting PTO if I am not allowed to ever take it and I lose it since they won't allow me the time off?	Yes
I'm on mobile so hopefully this turns out okay.  So recently at my wife's job a couple of dishwashers started selling lsd. My wife was the assistant manager, she tried talking to the general manager about it but turns out she is buying it from them and wanted to sweep everything under the rug. Fast forward a few weeks.   At the end of Monday night my wife was cashing out her drawer at the end of her bartending shift. It's short. Alot of people were in the drawer that night and my wife is very good with her money. So naturally she's a little peeved about being the only one that had to cover it but she did it anyways. The general manager wanted to talk about it but my wife was over it at that point and left, resulting in a write up the next day.  That evening my wife and her general manager exchange some texts, basically my wife calling the general manager out about buying lsd from minors and allowing it to run rampant through the store, the general manager wanted to talk about this in person so my wife agreed but only on the conditions that there is a third party present, like the regional manager.   The regional manager texts my wife and says that a third party isn't required and she is being terminated for not agreeing to talk to her manager without a third party.   Is any of this legal? Aren't you entitled to a third party  being present in a situation like this? How in the hell is my wife the one being fired when there are people selling and buying acid on premises?  The regional manager says the GM has talked to her about the drugs and they are handling it, but I have the feeling that she is believing everything the GM is feeding her which certainly doesn't include that she has been buying and using acid.  Someone please help I have a feeling none of this is right and my wife was fired wrongfully.	Yes
Hello, I recently quit my job at Papa Johns due to constant understaffing and extreme stress. I know they are obligated to pay me my hours worked, but I still have not received my check in the mail. Are companies required to send it in the mail, or is there a chance I will need to go pick it up? I haven't returned the uniform yet, but they can't withhold my check for that, can they? Any advice is appreciated.	Yes
"So I work for a fast food restaurant (franchised, locally owned) and I have some concerns about what the owner allows for breaks. Here are some [screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/c40EX) of the state labor law site that say a 10 min break for 4 hours and a 30 min break for 5+ hours. My employer schedules me regularly for 5pm-close shifts (closing is at 10pm) but closing takes an hour or more. Since I am only /scheduled/ for 5 hours, I am given one 15 minute paid break at the 1.5 hour mark or close to then. Should I be getting more?  Also, sometimes I work a 3pm-close shift (8 hours including closing) and get either two 15 min breaks or one 30 min break (either the second break is unpaid or half of the 30 min break is unpaid). Is this legal?  The owner owns two of these places in town, and at the other one all breaks are unpaid and closing takes until at least 11:30pm. Is this bad/worse or is it considered the same?  On a side note, a (17 year old) coworker was recently ""encouraged to quit"" after working there since she was 15 for pointing out the child labor laws (see screenshot album). She would work 5pm-close shifts (more than the 3 hours max for 14-15 year olds and the 4 hours max for 16-17 year olds) on school days and 8 hour shifts on weekends and summers. She also got the same break schedule as the rest of us even though, as a minor, she should be getting more.  Is there anything I can/should do about this? I need this job through mid-September when I start a full-time job with benefits (yay!). Should I wait til then?  Thanks for any help or advice you can give me! I also have some concerns about worker safety and food safety but this post is really long as-is so I just focussed on breaks."	Yes
I work as a supervisor in a fast food restaurant that is locally owned in eastern Washington. Most of my shifts are closing shifts (75% or so), and where I work, closing shifts are on the clock until a certain time at night, whether all the work is completed or not. Not finishing the work in time (this happens often if we're busy towards the end of the night) does not remove the expectation for the work to get done properly, despite the fact that my fellow closer and I are no longer getting paid. Sometimes this means an extra 5-10 minutes of work, but in our busy season, it very often means 20-30 minutes or more of unpaid work. I'm quite sick of working for free and then getting chewed out if the tiniest thing isn't completed, because I've gotten to the point where once I'm not being paid I stop caring.  Under the FLSA, I've recently learned that I can request up to three years of backpay for unpaid work, but I'm not certain at all how I would go about proving that I've been worked off-the-clock, especially as heavily as I have been (between July 3rd and July 10th, 2017, I easily did at least three hours of unpaid work). My restaurant does have a CCTV security system that my boss taught me how to use and get footage from one time when we were robbed on a shift I was leading, but due to a shortage of hard drive space, all footage older than three days or so is overwritten. Can I get some footage over time of myself and my coworker(s) doing this extra work and use it as legal proof? There's no official tracking of how much work any of us employees have done for free, so if I can't use the security footage, what can I do?	Yes
"Hired about a month ago and the boss asked me during my interviews what my political views are. We were on separate sides and we both agreed it wouldn't be an issue. So today I tell him how I've met a potential client by discussing politics and agreeing with someone at a bar. He states ""you'll never succeed with that mindset"". I ask to further discuss this and to explain. He tries to sway me and I tell him politely I still believe what I previously stated. I then ask him ""you're thinking about firing me over this, aren't you?"" sure enough he says yes and that we'll talk about it tomorrow. At least I got to go home early so there's that.   Anyways if I do end up getting fired is there anything I can actually do about this? I've tried to do some research but it all seems like a case by case basis."	Yes
"Work from home. Have MacBook. MacBook died today--against company policy to take it to Apple Store or anywhere other than our IT department. Problem is... I work for the top sales rep at the company (he's in CA but I'm in UT) and IT is based in TX... I leave for a week on Monday for Amsterdam which is not a vacation, as I planned to work the whole time there. My computer died this AM (hard drive issue on MacBook, never encountered it before) and my boss is insisting I need to take my vacation days since my computer is broken and they won't be able to fix it for ""some time"" (our IT dept is sooooo slow).... they COULD just ship me a loaner laptop to Amsterdam since our company is global and it wouldn't be an issue,,,. But my boss is legitimately trying to force me to take my vacation days ""since I'll be out of the country anyway"". Is that legal?!?!?"	Yes
I filed for unemployment on July 4th. I had no hours at all from July 2nd to July 12th. That's basically two weeks of no work and I see no reason this will change. I am in effect unemployed.  I quit my previous job. My concern is that I will be denied unemployment because I quit that job, because when I look at the eligibility verification, it lists only the job I quit, not the job I have now where my hours have been cut to nothing.  I should say what is going on his not due to any misconduct on my part. I have been trying very hard at this job, but nothing I do makes the store manager happy. So she cut me down to no hours for one week, four hours the next, making me basically unemployed. I assume she isn't firing me because she is trying to get out of me possibly getting unemployment.  If anyone has any idea for what recourse I have, I'd appreciate it. I am looking for a new job but it's been slow going.  If I get denied I do plan to appeal, I'm just wondering what my odds are of not getting denied, since I'm filing unemployment for the job where my hours have been cut, not the job I quit. I live in massachusetts.	Yes
So my question lies within the title. I'm considered an exempt employee making 45k annually. This amount is slightly about the California minimum salary threshold. Based on labor code section 515(c) a work week is considered 40 hours a week. With that said, does Overtime apply after anything over 40 hours worked? Or am I one of the selective few that doesn't receive overtime due to being exempt?  A verbal agreement between my superior was a result of my salary. No contracts or Non-Disclosures have been signed.   Any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks in advance.	Yes
So back in July of 2016 I was at work and lost two fingers. The company I was working for didn't have workcomp insurance. So my insurance covered most of the cost for the surgery and what not. I thought it was completely paid by Medicaid but my lawyer says I actually owe them about 3k. Our options were to sue them and we offered 85k. He came up with that number by figuring out the lose of fingers and a few other things. Sorry dont have the letter he sent me to give exact info. So we sent the offer last month and no response. So I called to see if he heard anything and he said no, He thinks we should go with the Illinois Workers compensation. He said that way we can for sure get some money. But who knows when I would get that and how much since Illinois is broke. My personal opinion is that we should do a civil lawsuit but im not the lawyer. So I dont know what to do. Please advise of any info you might have.	Yes
"I was an independent contractor for an online business that had a lot of members (gaming related). In my non-disclosure agreement there is a clause that prohibits me from communcating with any previous or current members. ""The Indepependent Contractor may not commmunicate with any previous or current members that have been or are apart of XYZ properties"".  This has a 3 year term to it and is based out of New Jersey. Many of these members are my friends, and many of them are no longer active members yet I still according to this cannot communicate with them for 3 years.  I would understand not being allowed to solicit members. Also, none of these members are employees of the company. I feel like this goes way beyond examples I have read about where a current employer forbids communication with previous employees. Is this a legitimate, enforcable clause?"	Yes
I work at an all nude strip club as a bartender. Basically a juice bartender since there's no alcohol.  Can anything be done about dancers that tell customers not to tip me? I get it if the girl doesn't want to tip since she has to pay house fees and such but what if a customer wants to tip Me? A lot of times the girls will touch the no tip option for the customer. Anything I can do about this huge money blocking issue? 	Yes
It is a very restrictive non-compete and the company won't contract with any voice actor who won't sign it. But as a contractor, I thought a Company couldn't compel/enforceable a non-compete like that. It would prevent voice work for other simmilar companies, educational video voice over work, and science video voice over work. That's pretty broad. Can the enforce something like this for a contractor? They are not paying to license the voice, or hiring a spokesperson.	Yes
I have been offered a job and part of the employment agreement includes a section that states that if I am terminated for cause or resign within the first year of employment I must reimburse the company $750, and $500 if its within the second year.  I believe this training is just on the job training, getting familiar with their system and specific technologies they are using, not a course through an educational institution. The section requires an initial, and it is the only section that requires an initial, so it stood out to me. I don't intend to quit the job but if it just doesn't work out I don't want to be penalized.   Thanks in advance	Yes
"I've been experiencing some problems at work and my boyfriend suggested I ask this subreddit for help. I'm a lisensed cosmetologist working in a chain salon in New York State (not New York City). There's been rumors for years that my employers do various illegal shit. One of those things was docking our hours. The rumor was that they'd would change our time clocks to remove 30 minutes for a break when no break was given.   In my line of work it's common for hairstylists to not take a real break. When everyone is booked for the day and there's a waiting room full of people, sometimes you just keep working.  Last summer me and some coworkers found what we believe to be proof that our employers were docking our hours. When we were playing around with our new POS, we found a page that said ""Time Card Audits"". This page had entries listing everytime our manager fixed our time clock (we were at the salon at the right time, but the computer was frozen so we couldn't clock in, we accidentally clocked out for break instead of clocking out at the end of the day, etc). It also had entries with my boss' name attached to them where new time in/time outs were recorded - a  30 minute break added to the middle of the day, maybe a second break added later in the day. There were also audits recorded where it looked like my boss would move a certain girls clock in time from 8:45 to 9:00 (we usually weren't scheduled to clock in that early, but we're expected to do so to open up shop). There were nights we had to stay in the shop an hour or two past close because we were so busy, or someone got caught up on a color, and on some of those nights there was evidence that our boss would move our clock out time back to the normal closing time.  The reports spanned about 7 months if I remember correctly, and they suggested I had about 50 cumulative hours removed from my time cards.  I have been under the impression that while it's the law that an hourly worker is ALLOWED a 30 minute break, it's not required for them to take one. I was also under the impression that it's against the law for hourly workers to perform regular duties off the clock, like cut/color hair.  When my coworkers and I discovered this, they wanted to call the labor board. One girl wanted to sue the company. A few days later, when they had time to think about it, they decided against it - they were to afraid to quit/get fired. I decided not to do anything because if I got the company in trouble, my coworkers would have also been blamed (we're fairly sure our employers knew what we were doing).  A few months later my manager announced that our employers decided the new policy was, if you get a chance to eat, even if you are not clocked out for break, you are given a break. This happened one day when we ordered a pizza. I told her I thought this was stupid, shoving a slice of pizza in my face in between haircuts is not a break, and that I was pretty sure that it was against the law. The official policy was never put into place, and my manager assured me that my boss would no longer adjust our time cards.  This was probably a lie, because the other day when one of the girls opened up her time card to clock out, she had been given a break when she had never taken one. When I checked the time card audits, the log had been mostly wiped - a few irrelevant audits from the beginning of the month were all that was left.  Most of the girls I used to work with have left, and I've been looking to quit anyways, so I'm preparing to potentially go to the board with this. I have the reports from the time card audits previously mentioned printed out, as well as the mostly clean ones I found a couple days ago. Is the labor board just going to tell me I should stop wasting their time? At one point a girl I worked with years ago called them about an isolated incedent, and they told her our boss wasn't doing anything wrong, or that at least she wouldn't be able to fight them on it. Should I sue them? I really dislike these people, but I am pretty poor. Should I just quit if im gonna be all butthurt about it and leave it at that?"	Yes
My allergist provided a letter to give to my employer requesting a two day a week work from home accommodation due to dust mite allergies.  The request was denied. Almost everyone employed where I work works from home part of the week with the exception of recent hires(hired in 2016), which includes me.  Do I take this to the EEOC, suffer through it or find another job?	Yes
I am going to summarize this the best I can, I apologize ahead of time I am terrible at explaining.   I work for a Managed Service IT Provider. I work out of a satellite office 53 miles from the main office, my office is in a Office Shares building and the rent is $500 a month. My company has decided that the office isn't work the cost anymore. Which I am totally fine with, a few complications like not having a ton of work-space at my house for computer/server setup. I normally get paid Mileage to travel from my office to a clients office because of using my personal vehicle.  Here is the issue I am running into. My boss would like me to go on-site to a client's location and be there for half the day. The issue is my mileage from my home to the client's office isn't going to be considered an expense mileage I can get reimbursed for. He would like me to work from the main office once a week as well - not mileage.   This means driving 106 miles to the main office and back isn't considered mileage anymore. I have an issue with this, as I use the mileage I claim for wear and tear on my vehicle. Currently after adding up all the extra mileage my boss now wants me to drive it is almost 6 times what I would be driving to and from work. This doesn't include if I have to go to another client's office for an issue as this mileage isn't   My question to everyone here, is this illegal? What can I show my boss proving this?  Thanks ahead of time.	Yes
First time poster so go easy on me. I have a new job and this is my third week. The first two weeks we worked 10 hour shifts Monday through Friday which was fine. Now they've put us on 12 hour shifts Monday through Friday. is this even legal? Any place I've ever heard of doing 12 hour shifts the most they will work is three days in a row. This just seems overly excessive to me. There will be no work/life ratio. Thanks guys. (I'm in Kentucky, btw)	Yes
So, I'm probably about to take a position as a server and wanted to know how paying child and tips works. I know I can expect normal garnishment from my check, but I want to be able to get ahead and put a good dent in my back owed.	Yes
State: Arkansas  I work as a pizza delivery driver, and I work the late shift, which consists of me being at work 5pm to 12-2am. When I'm finished I go through the clock out process with the night manager which is one of two people, and I sign the sheet that has my miles, tips, and hours for the day on it. The past two days I've noticed is been clocked out significantly early, how do I approach this legally? One of the closing drivers told the same thing is happening for him.	Yes
"I've been working at a cell phone store for 2 and a half months and I'm the only employee there. He refers to me as a ""manager"" and yet I get paid minimum wage. When I applied to the craigslist ad it said that it was an hourly plus commission sales job. But I've yet to see any form of commission on my ADP pay stub. He's trying to sell the business on top of that. Is there anything I can do? He only owns this one cell phone store and he's a really bad business owner. Is there anything I could do? "	Yes
I work for a large, national corporation.   Our local labor union which represents more than 400 local employees has tentatively agreed to a contract this week. They have set a date to vote on the contract, which is this weekend (under 7 days notice).  The union is refusing to let any of the union members read the contract prior to the days of the vote.   I am looking for a legal basis to force them to give us the contract or to extend/block the vote.	Yes
What can I do? I've never been in a situation  like this before.	Yes
"I just got ""fired"" (he didn't say I was fired directly and didn't give me a pink slip or any notice like that but told me ""leave my restaurant"") after turning in my written two week notice last Friday. How should I follow up? Can this hurt me if in the future an employer calls for references? I've never been fired and am not sure what to do. "	Yes
So I worked for this company and left after 5 months but they are asking for £200 for training me. Is this legal? 	Yes
So, I work at a small oil and gas company in Oklahoma who has just recently award people non voting incentive units as a part of our compensation. ( but only after it vests in a few years and only if we make money after the equity partners get their money back as well) Obviously they have recommended consulting a tax advisor but as I understand it, we become members in the LLC. We have been given 30 days to file a tax election with the IRS. Various pdfs indicate this can impact my w2 status but not sure if that is true. Advice? Who to contact for advice?	Yes
"Hello all,  I am in a predicament right now regarding my current employer. I recently became a member of the management team at a new local restaurant. My company currently has six restaurants under its belt, and we opened this new restaurant for business last year and I've worked there since. My co-supervisor was recently trained on how to complete payroll before payday rolled around. In passing she candidly said: &gt;I have so much work to do! I have to go through everyone's time punches and edit them to be at least 5 minutes before their shift.  Our company policy essentially states that all employee's punches that are earlier than 5 minutes before a scheduled shift time will be edited to be, at most, 5 minutes before that shift.   That night I talked to one of our company's longer tenured managers and asked him about this practice. He told me that its ""company policy"" and everyone agreed to these policies when they signed their contracts. Many of the managers at other restaurants seem complacent about this practice. I know that you can't just write whatever you want in a contract and call it a day so I was thinking this may be an unenforceable.  I did some light research on the topic on the DOL's website and, from my understanding of the law, the law states that an employer may only edit time punches if an employee incorrectly recorded time (i.e forgetting to clock in or out). But they may not edit time punches in order to reflect something like a ""company policy.""  Now I'm not losing any sleep from my punch being edited from 2:54pm to 2:55pm. I am, however, concerned that my company is simply operating unethically. I want to talk to my HR representative and understand more about where this policy is coming from. But I also feel a little slimy doing payroll and having to edit these punches. Long term I am not interested in going to court about lose wages, etc. I just want my company to operate ethically and fairly.  So, my questions: 1) Is this legal at all? 2) Is this employment contract ""unenforceable"" because of this verbiage? 3) Is there anything a lowly supervisor can do about this company-wide practice?  Thanks in advance"	Yes
I'm applying to take intermittent FMLA to care for a family member with Parkinson's, who needs mainly to have me keep an eye on him to make sure he's eating and in case he falls and hurts himself. I requested to work from home but my employer refused and said FMLA was suitable for my needs. It's much less useful to me than WFH would be because I'll have to miss work and because, since I don't know when or if he'll need help back onto his feet or in case he hurts himself, I'll probably end up taking a few days off every week 'just in case' and play the odds.  We bid for shifts periodically based on performance, and if I miss much work I'm not going to be as able to compete for my current, desired shift. I'm worried I'll get pushed into a shift that's not what I want and that, for days I'm in the office, will actually make me even less able to care for him on those days.   Can they do that? What would be my recourse if they did?	Yes
I live in Florida. At the beginning of the summer I accepted an unpaid web development role at a start up. I was skeptical to begin with, but they said I could set my own hours and it was only part time. I also planned on working another part time job. I was the only unpaid intern they hired (which they said was because unlike everyone else who was local and could continue working throughout the year, I had to return to school at the end of the summer). They stated since I was unpaid the work I would be doing would be different. I decided to go for a few days to see what it was like since there was no real obligation.    After the first day, the CTO pulled me aside and stated that once we finished the training period I would be paid for my work. Now, I likely would not have stayed if they had not said they intended to paid me. However, the work I have been doing is exactly the same as everybody else, and the one month review where they were planning on converting me to paid that was supposed to happen weeks ago has been continually pushed back. The supervisors are now all at a conference for a week leaving only interns in the office and another week without pay for me. I would feel bad if I left because everything we've been working on has been in partners and I don't want to leave mine in the dust. When I give my availability for my other part time job I cleared my Monday though Thursday since I thought I would be making money at my internship during that time, so the opportunity cost here is high. Should I report my internship? From what I understand, since I am doing work that is normally done by paid employees and I am not paid, it's illegal. I should also note that all interns are technically independent contractors (I don't know if that changes anything).   So, is this internship illegal, and if so, what is the procedure like for reporting one? Woolf I be able to get paid for the hours I worked?	Yes
"TL;DR: The place I work is gross, and the manager does nothing to prevent it. What do I do?  I work at a local pizza restaurant, and the manager is just awful. I could go on about it, but here's the main concern: I'm pretty sure I got a fungal infection from working with dishes. The area rarely gets cleaned properly (I'm one of the maybe 2 people that uses cleaning products thoroughly), and the proper sanitary supplies are not readily available. Not even gloves. I've been cut working a handful of times, and not even washing/sanitizing has prevented the infection. People clean the dishes they need and sometimes more before the regular dish shift (6 pm to close), and the only sanitary option in the area is hand sanitizer. I'm not sure how effective this is honestly, but I personally spray my hands off, dry them with a paper towel, apply a generous amount of hand sanitizer and rub it in, then wipe off the excess before handling clean dishes. Other people typically use the sprayer and handle dishes doing little more than using paper towels after, and then proceed to wash their hands and continue food prep. This is alarming, because I can only imagine how much bacteria and fungus have spread throughout the restaurant due to the manager's utter disregard for any proper procedures. I will either be going to the clinic today or tomorrow for a check-up for the infection, but I'm wondering who I should contact to fix this. It's gotten to the point that I almost want a doctor's note to limit me from any food or dish contact and stick to driving, but that wouldn't be fair to others. They're unaware of the issue due to inexperience or ignorance. I've had issues with fungus from unsanitary working conditions in a ""high class"" popular Italian chain restaurant before. Any information is greatly appreciated, if you need any other info, let me know."	Yes
"Hello reddit I'm officially jobless (Hate not having steady income.) basically my issue is that I was fired for ""Lack of performance"" but when my general manager (friend) was telling me over a recorded phone call that I was fired; He told me that the real reason is because I said something and they heard over their audio cameras that they didn't like and the little Weasle of the owner's son told on me.   I legitimately don't recall what I said. The owner doesn't let my GM hear the record so because of hear-say I'm fired.   There were and still are no signs anywhere on the premises that say ""audio cameras in use."" Reddit help me out, Do I have a case?"	Yes
"throwaway account. Apologies for the length.  **tldr:** I am being forced to work again with an HR person who, in the past, refused to do his job and put my physical safety at risk. How do I protect myself this time with documentation in case I need to go to a lawyer? Are there other resources for disabled people?   I work for the Federal government, and my agency is headquartered in Washington, DC.  According to the agency's internal website, we have a Disability Office whose role is to help disabled employees determine reasonable work accommodations with their managers.    **PAST EXPERIENCE:** A few years ago, I was injured and needed ""reasonable work accommodations"" to enter and leave my office building, because it was not wheelchair accessible.  Of the Disability Office, Mr.X, wrote me *in writing* that the office's role was *not* to assist disabled employees and Managers, but to file paperwork for OPM.  My manager and I stopped working with this office and tried to figure this out on our own.  At the time, I was in too much physical pain and not in Washington, DC, so I wasn't able to figure out how to escalate this.   **PRESENT EXPERIENCE:** Fast forward to the present, I have another medical issue requiring ""reasonable work accommodations.""  Against my desire, I was forwarded to the same Disability Office. And then was told I was assigned to work again with Mr. X.  I emailed his Manager and requested a transfer, sharing his prior communication. The Manager disregarded my request, stating the office now cares about customer service, and Mr X is timely with his reports.  Subsequently, Mr. X emailed me, claiming to be ""delighted"" to meet and work with me, and asked me to fill out more forms.    I am distraught that I will again waste precious time and resources to work with Mr. X when I need to focus on my health. But this time, I'm now back in Washington, DC, and would like to be prepared to bring this to a lawyer, if needed.     How shall I best document my interaction with Mr. X, especially if this needs to be taken to a lawyer?  In my reply back, should I acknowledge the past communication? I don't want to lie, and claim I look forward to working with him, because then they could claim that I was satisfied with his prior help.... does this make sense?  Also, are there other groups that help disabled people receive ADA services? Lastly, do you think I have any recourse for the Disability Office's and Mr. X's past refusal of service?"	Yes
I currently work in a call center that gives two ten minute breaks and one lunch.  If we need to use the restroom we have to sign into a program that times and tracks our bathroom use and then it they subtract it from our breaks.  I've overheard them discussing other co-workers four  minute bathroom break and how they will monitor to make sure he only spends six minutes off the phones.  	Yes
"I work as a server at a restaurant in Alabama. I am not sure if there are any special rules that apply to my state, but the general idea that I have come to is that the practice of the employer taking our tips is illegal. However, I am not certain if my specific case qualifies as being illegal.  Originally servers were paid $6.00 an hour in addition to tips(we had a tip share), however this was eventually changed to $7.25 an hour with the tips being collected and ""put back into the restaurant""(whatever that means). However, this is only for the lunch/dinner shift. The original rule($6.00 plus tips) still applies to the breakfast shift.  Is this legal for employers to do? I am given many of my tips in person by the customers I serve who thank me for my excellent service quite frequently, and I feel quite cheated to be forced to put this money that is by all rights *mine* potentially into the owners' hands.  I have thought of saying something about it, but am fearful of losing my job. I have also considered simply keeping my tips, but am afraid of legal trouble that could be taken against me. Any advice/knowledge would be welcome."	Yes
I work at an undisclosed company where they pay us $8/hour plus tips (Arizona has $10 minimum wage). When clocking out you have to report your tips, and the general manager requires you to put at least $2 per every hour worked, even if we didn't make that much. If we put in less, and what we made instead, the manager will go in to the payroll and change the tips reported (and often lower clocked hours).  What do I do? I have found employment elsewhere but I don't want my friends there to continually be screwed	Yes
I work as a lifeguard. My company does things which I'm not sure of the legality of.  This time they just informed me that my pool will be closed tomorrow all day and that they knew of this well in advance but didn't tell me or the other guards. Its less then 24 hours until my shift would have started and this cuts into my over time. I'm loosing 9 hours of $16.75/hr for a day I could've made plans for but didn't because of no notice. Do I have any rights here?  I'm from anne arundel county maryland.	Yes
Over the weekend I was having a discussion with friends and they turned me on to the California Overtime Exemption laws. I work in the IT field, and according to [one site I found](http://ckslaw.com/it-and-computer-technology-workers/) it appears I'm paid significantly below the Overtime Exemption threshold, but am salaried and not provided overtime pay.  The main hangup I have is that if I check the [actual wage order](http://www.dir.ca.gov/iwc/WageOrders2006/iwcarticle4.html), it breaks down the salary cutoff as 2 times the state minimum wage, so I'm not sure where that number in the first site comes from.  I've never had any experience with legal matters like this and am not really sure what to do with this information. Any advice is greatly appreciated!	Yes
If someone made a legal recording of misconduct by a superior in a work environment, could they transfer or share the right to distribute that recording, with certain conditions met, with someone else? Not necessarily the media, but a member of their family or another party who may be seeking litigation for similar reasons as the first charging party?  For example, if the defending party puts a gag order on the charging party, but the media has been signed into ownership of a third party, what are the options of the defending party if they want to enter an agreement with the charging party to confidentiality?	Yes
I want to apologize if I'm not doing this right, I'm not one to usually post here and I'm not too sure what to do. I just came home for the summer from my university to find out my mom got a new job! Unfortunately, she has to work 3-4 jobs ahead to keep her head afloat. She found this job with a Freight company on Indeed.com, and contacted her two weeks later.   A woman representing the company explained to my mother that the company was located in London, and told my mother that she would be taking packages and distributing them out for the company. My mother signed a contract which she checked with a lawyer friend of ours, who said it was valid. The work came quick shortly after. Mom was in contact with them, and did her job as the contract stated.   Where it gets messy is that, May and June we had work coming, and she was expecting a paycheck for the two months together(as the contract stated of the first month). As July rolls around, the packages ceased and my mother's bank account didn't get the money. She attempted to call both the number on the website and the number of the woman she was in contact with, and they either hung up on her after she identified herself, or just hasn't answered any of her calls.  My mother is upset because of the validity of everything, and also the fact that this money was meant to pay back bills she owed. Can my mother take the company to small claims court? What could be her next step? Everything is recorded in texts and recorded phone calls, as well as the sight she used to receive and send out the packaging. I sincerely hope she wasn't scammed, since she gave out very little information. Any advice would be appreciated, thank you for reading.	Yes
Now not reckless driving, but the one point negligent driving. It keeps coming back for job background checks and I disclose it now after the first time I was called out on it because I had no idea it was not a general type of ticket when I was 18 and then forgot the ticket was and never thought twice. I can't get a straight answer on if it is a misdemeanor or not? Also I have a lot of driving tickets (4) from the age 18-21. Will that impact me forever? I am embarrassed of them now especially since all my future employers can see them. I haven't had a ticket in two years (23 now) and drive much more responsibly now. I also live in Florida now with the one ticket at 21 in Florida, rest are in Maryland. Will all these forever show up?	Yes
"Basically, I work as a software developer for a company in NY. Here for almost a year. Today, the company both rolled out a new employee handbook, referred to as the ""culture code"" and the ""employee innovation and proprietary information agreement""  This agreement appears to be a mashup of a non-disclosure and non-compete, but being a developer - I am really concerned with this. Apparently, even if fired/quit - any invention I made is to be considered theirs for 6 months after employment.   Whatever - so to ""continue employment"" I must sign and agree to whatever stipulations are placed in both the handbook and the ""invention"" agreement. If I refuse, I assume to be terminated.  I'm okay with this. However, would I qualify for collect unemployment? Per [NYS Title 7 - 593 - Disqualifications](https://www.labor.ny.gov/ui/dande/titles/title7.shtm#593) - I don't see any specific case of which this could apply to.  Basically, I would not be terminated either (a) voluntarily or (b) for misconduct. The first devils advocate thought that comes to mind is ""well you voluntarily are not signing the document they set forth to you"" - but on that note - assume the document wanted agreement to ""selling soul of first born child."" In other words, how can I be expected to sign simply whatever they say?"	Yes
"TLDR   I'm worried my boss won't pay me for work that I've already done.  What are my options if that happens?  I am depending on the money.  ---  I work a crappy minimum wage night shift job and handed in my notice last night.  I also slept through the first hour of my shift and made the decision to quit as I was getting ready to leave for work.  I told my boss over text.   My boss then tried to guilt - trip me into coming in anyways.  When I said no she said fine at least do the rest of your scheduled shifts and I said yes.. but only because I wanted to end the conversation.   I don't want to go back.  I don't need the four days of pay and I have had two mental breakdowns in less then a month because of this job.  I really don't want go back.    This morning, going through my records, I noticed that I didn't get the proper raise for my overtime hours.  Judging from talks with another employee (only one) this was intentional.  I am also missing a few hours of pay.  Honestly this stuff isn't a big deal to me but it happened if it helps.    However, there is still one week of work.. Another 48 hours, 4 of which should be overtime.  I'm worried that if I don't show up for my next set of shifts that my boss won't pay me for the work I've done.  I need that money.  If she does this.. what are my options?    I hope you guys sympathize with me and can offer some stellar advice because I am a depressed hermit and I haven't spoken to my lawyer in over 2 years and I don't even know if she's knowledgeable about employment law.    Don't know if this helps but I work for Tim Hortons which is a franchise owned independently but licensed by a corporation.  I don't think I signed anything.. but I have a horrid memory and I'm not positive about that.  I did give her my SIN and we had a verbal agreement.  I'm not being paid ""under the table"" or anything.  My income was taxed."	Yes
"Hey --  Does anyone have any experience with legal rights or protection of workers employed in at-will positions?  I know I can be fired without cause, but am I protected from relatiatory discharge or other forms of mistreatment while still at the job?  Additionally, do EO/discrimination complaints *only* apply to minority groups?  Is there another legal term for preferential biases that don't apply to age/sex/etc?  My next step is requesting a formal meeting and initiating the Dispute Resolution Program described in my employee handbook, but frankly I'm afraid to even go that far.    Long story short, I feel there are unfair practices at my place of employment, and one manager in particular ignores the company rules and doesn't give annual reviews and regularly reassigns employees without giving them written job descriptions or expectations.  I don't think any of that is illegal, necessarily, but all of it violates the employee handbook and some of us are planning to address it with the COO.  I work in Washington DC, and the handbook clearly states that my employment is defined as ""at-will.""  I've been there 5 years.  I can give more details via PM if anyone asks.  Thanks in advance!"

"I have a boss that intentionally leaves me out of important meetings and assignments (he makes me do all the work, but never includes me in emails or meetings); so I dont get any recognition or limelight in the corporation. To list a few examples:  He has NEVER invited me to a meeting with the head of our dept, when my peers in other depts, all do.  My boss has also said that in order for me to get promoted, I need face time with the head of the dept.  Because he has a 20+ year relationship with this executive, he doesnt want anyone else getting the attention.    My boss has several others that work for him that manage other groups.  When we had target setting meetings with heads of each dept, I asked if I could attend and he said no one on his team would attend other than him (in other words, he would represent all of us in all meetings) - later I found out, the others did in fact attend the meetings.  Have proof of this in email.    There was a company open call for nominees to participate in a task force - my boss sent an email to his team asking if any of us were interested.  I said i was, and he later verbally told me I couldn't because I was looking to change depts.  Which makes ZERO sense, and he is just fishing for excuses.  This task force would be me in touch with major players in the organization and I feel like he doesnt want that.    He has made comments like: ""why is XYZ off today? they want to have a life outside of work?""....""we are glad XYZ left the company, b/c he always had family and kids issues and never worked late""  He has taken his (personal/home related) anger out on me...when I called him out on it, he said he wasn't aware he brought his personal life at work when it was utterly OBVIOUS.  He never agrees with my thoughts in meetings with others; uses sarcasm or interrupts me almost always, when others at the meeting agree with my opinions or thoughts.  Any advice would be highly appreciated.  This man has caused me serious stress. I have frequent heart palpitations resulting in appointments with a cardiologist.  I had huge nodules on my throat that ended up being benign, however doctor says they are caused by stress.  I experienced a bout of serious migraines which  led me to get a brain scan.  I'm at my dream job, but I cant handle this anymore.  Please help."	Yes
"Hi legaladvice, I'm going to attempt to describe my issue in the best detail possible.   In March of this year, I was verbally assaulted by a co-worker that I used to be friendly with. He did not agree with a life decision I made (I did not know this information until months later) and developed a very deep hatred for me. Behind my back, he would stalk my workload and attempt to find errors and immediately report it to management/After two weeks of condescending remarks about my work, I confronted him as to why he was acting this way, to which he called me a ""fuck up"", ""ruining the company"", ""make mistakes every day"", ""I tell everyone that you fuck up"". I remained quiet and refused to engage in any sort of retaliation. After this incident, management had separate meeting with myself and the harasser, to which they claimed it was resolved. After this meeting, my supervisor stopped speaking to me and only initiated contact unless absolutely necessary. I was effectively ostracized.   Instead of attacking me to my face, the harasser then decided to make it a point to talk badly about me to all of my workers on a daily basis. He continued to stalk my work and made it his mission to get me fired. The workplace became incredibly hostile, and any projects in my department that I needed assistance on, he refused to help with outright. This was affecting business and made my workload greater. I once again reported the harassment and hostility to management, (who claimed we ""Have no HR"") and they once again had a meeting with both, separately, to fix the issue.   Once again, the harasser found ways to continue his assault. There was a racial joke made at my expense by another employee who motioned to the harasser in a knowing way, and he laughed uncontrollably. I reported the further harassment for the third time, to which there were no repercussions.   The final time I reported an issue was when the harasser resorted to laughing at me every time I walked past his area to make me feel uncomfortable no matter where I was. He would do it even louder each time he walked past me as well. At this point, the company magically had an HR department in which they directed me to email. I sent my story and current issue and received no response. This morning I received a email from the Operations Manager that I was being laterally transferred (no change in pay) to a department that had far less responsibility, is considered to be beneath my current department, and simultaneously removed me for the lead position on an upcoming project. I essentially lost many of my decision-making abilities and was placed in a position where management is fully aware I do not want to be. The harasser remains in his position in my department based on his ""seniority"".   I believe I am facing retaliation for reporting harassment, and want to know what my legal options are at this moment. From what I understand, Title VII of the  Civil Rights Act prohibits employers from doing lateral transfers in retaliation, especially to unwanted positions that revoke responsibility (seen as a demotion without legally calling it one)."

This is in the UK: Hi guys. I successfully applied for an internal role at my employer, albeit different business unit so technically an external move, and was offered the role by the actual future team. Then HR asked for my current salary, went away and came back with an approved salary offer. I accepted the offer verbally on the phone, and in the same call was told to notify my current boss that I am moving. Additionally we agreed on a starting date for the new role. 6 days later they just pulled the offer citing some business changes. Now it says here that a verbally accepted offer is legally binding ( https://www.gov.uk/job-offers-your-rights). Initially HR said only a written document is legally binding. When I sent the link, citing that verbal offers are, too, they came back saying that what we discussed on the phone wasn't an offer saying we agreed a salary that we would aim for. That salary came from the rewards team after calculating my current salary and converting it from Business Unit to new Business Unit. So to me that was the final bit of the offer to accept, which I did. Everything afterwards, i.e. waiting for written contract are procedural steps, not conditional to me. Am I right or wrong? Any advice on any options would be very welcome. Thanks in advance.	Yes
"Hi guys. I don't know what the format is here so I'm just going to go. Also not sure how detailed I should/shouldn't be, so ask for more detail as needed. GA resident, flew to VA for interview.      I was able to make contact with the VA company through a GA recruiter, so GA recruiter handled all the communication. VA company asked for me to make the flight reservation, which I was uncomfortable with because I am accustomed to the company making the reservation. So I asked the GA recruiter to do it for me on their dime, and they agreed.      When I got to the airport, *excuses here*, I missed the flight. I called up the GA recruiter and asked how best to proceed. He told me he would reach out to VA company and call me back. He called back and said they are fine to do the interview later that day or the next day, and that I should book the next flight I can. I specifically asked whether the flight change fee would be reimbursed, and discussed the specific amount it would be with GA recruiter. GA recruiter spoke with the hiring manager and then GA recruiter explicitly told me on the phone that the VA company would reimburse this amount. After this conversation, I booked the flight change, took the flight, rented a car and hotel, and had the interview the next morning.      I submitted my expense reimbursement request with the flight, car rental, hotel, and taxis to and from the airport. A full month later, I received a check from the VA company, reimbursing the car rental, hotel, and taxis. The flight change fee, which was over half the total reimbursement, was not reimbursed.      I called the GA recruiter, and sent subsequent emails because he was picking up on what was going on and not answering calls anymore, and asked what had happened. GA recruiter told me that an ""HR guy"" at VA company had ""put his foot down"" on the flight change expense, and it would not be reimbursed. To my knowledge, GA recruiter has been reimbursed for the flight they booked.      So I figure I have a couple of avenues. One, there's promissory estoppel re: detrimental reliance on GA recruiter's advice. Two, there's some kind of convoluted argument for detrimental reliance on the hiring manager (although I think that would work better for GA recruiter to use on VA company, and GA recruiter is not interested in suing a client, especially on my behalf), even if he didn't have the authority to make that decision. Three, there may be laws around interview reimbursement I haven't really looked into in VA.      I have already reached out to GA recruiter and been told to go pound sand, so any further communication there will likely need to be all lawyered up. I'm not flush with cash, but I am willing to fight this precisely for that reason.      So, uh, advice?"	Yes

Hello everyone,  I am a real estate agent. When I first began my career, I was quite naive and I signed a non-compete agreement because the firm claimed they had a number of trade secrets, incredible training, etc.   After receiving my first paychecks, I was quite disappointed, and I left for a different brokerage. My old firm's lawyer has now sent me a letter saying that I must stop or they will pursue legal action against me.   The non compete says that I cannot work for or operate within 25 miles of any of their offices. They have 4 office across the Detroit Metro region. The term is 2 years.  I know I knew what I was signing, but I had no idea it could hinder my career in this manner. A real estate agent's career depends on their sphere of influence and all of my SOi live around me. A 25 mile non compete puts me out of business for 2 years. I have to drive at least an hour and half to get to a firm outside this region. Furthermore, after interviewing with a number of firms, I have found that there really aren't any trade secrets in Real Estate. And many other firms have more robust training regimes with better splits, and every single one of them did not require a such a noncompete to be signed.   I called my state real estate legal hotline and the lawyer had no idea what to do because he had never hear of non compete agreements in our industry. Ditto with the executive officer of my board. They had never heard of such a thing in my field.   I am not sure what to do.   I can send a copy of that agreement and the letter they send me on request.	Yes
As stated I'm having to go in tomorrow at 5 am for an emergency procedure. I had today off, and just left the doctors where I found out. I haven't told my job yet. I'm a front office manager at a hotel.   Normally I wouldn't be too worried, but I'm concerned due to the fact we've just gotten a new general manager, who for lack of better words is a complete idiot. He can't do ANYTHING by himself. He's only been at our property for less than a week. No one on the property really knows how to do what I do on a daily basis. This is what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned since I will be out for a minimum of two weeks- they will replace me. Especially seeing as this is going to make everyone's lives really difficult.  How should I handle this situation with my employer and do I have any rights? All our handbook states is if you require more than three days off you need a doctors note.	Yes
Ok, asking for a friend. She works for a k-12 school district in central California as a custodian. The Assistant Principal at school site gave orders to classified workers, saying they are not allowed to speak Spanish while at work. We're not taking about in official work meetings, or to give instructions, just words thrown into casual conversation between Spanish-speaking coworkers. He won't put this in writing, of course. When she went to her union rep, the AP changes his story, saying that employees are speaking Spanish on the school walkie-talkies, and this creates a safety issue since not all workers understand it.  How much trouble is this guy potentially in?	Yes
"I work as a delivery driver for an international pizza chain. I make $4.50/hour when i'm on the road, and $8.00/hour when I am in the store. Today while I was still on a delivery, somebody inside the store clocked me into the store (something that managers do in order to make their numbers look better). When my shift ended an hour later, my general manager approached me and told me that I was committing fraud because I had clocked into the store while on a delivery. They told me I wouldn't be fired, but I needed to pay for the pizza that I had delivered (when I got clocked in) and they took $25-$30 dollars out of the tips that I made for the day. I told them that the pizza that they are trying to make me pay for was paid for BY THE CUSTOMER with a credit card. My manager didn't seem to care and said she would ""look into it."""	Yes
I was laid off the week of Christmas. Filed for unemployment, Tuesday 13/26/17. Called MARVIN, Monday 1/8/18. Christmas was a paid holiday, so we have to claim it when we call MARVIN. I haven't been paid yet, because my employer hasn't provided paperwork to the state regarding holiday pay. When we get laid off and don't get holiday pay, everything goes through just fine Everytime we get holiday pay during a layoff, we can count on not getting paid right away.  Is my employer breaking any laws? What can I do to try and get paid in a timely manner?	Yes
"I work at a minimum wage service job and put in my two weeks on Monday last week. As the usual two-week courtesy notice would have it, I would typically work until my last usual shift which is this Saturday. However, I told him in writing on my two-week notice that I only want to work til this Thursday (two days from today), which is kinda like a one and a half week notice. To get me to work the last couple shifts, he claimed two things (in person)    1) I need to show up to work because ""I already paid you for those hours, so you need to show up for them"". and    2) ""I need to give you your last paycheck on your last day"" in exchange for my uniform.    ...now for the record I think I know the real reason as to why he's doing this. A number people are leaving for vacation during this time (which is why I couldn't request time off myself in the first place) so he kinda maybe needs me. I also know that I have a direct deposit with the company, so the ""hand me my paycheck thing"" seems pretty bullshit. At the very least, I know he's heavily bending the truth, either too proud to tell ask me straight ""Hey I know you wrote you wanted to give me one and a half weeks, but I really need you this weekend."" or just hoping I'm gullible enough to believe whatever he claims.    Or is he? That's what I want to ask you guys.    Is he legally able to indebt me with ""wage prepayment"" and as a side question, how bullshit is his need to ""hand me my check on the last day""?    Thanks for your time."	Yes
I work at my state university, and there is a cap on the hours a student may work (25 hours/week). I am an instructional aid (I teach the chemistry labs), but instead of paying per hour that you are actually there they pay you at a rate of 7 hours per every lab you teach (factoring in 3 hours per lab plus 2 office hours and 2 hours grading), and 3 hours for every recitation class you teach. Now, this summer I teach 3 labs and 3 recitations per week: this should equal 30 hours per week, but since I'm capped at 25 hours, I can only enter that many on my timesheet.   I thought that this was far, since often times the 7 hours they pay you for doesn't really equal 7 hours of actual work, but then I thought that they're making me work more per week for the same amount of pay as another student who works 5 hours less than I do.   Is this legal? Thank you in advance for any help!	Yes
So I was working part time at this Bikini place for like 3 years, in Feb of this year they said they laid everyone off because of lack of work. Literally no one came in anymore and they were turning the place into a warehouse office, some of the windows were already being replaced, and there was saws and stuff. So the last week of Feb my manager Shana called me saying EVERYONE is getting laid off except for the HR/ceo people on the 3rd floor. The retail store will be closed. So that very day I went into the work and asked them is this true, and they said they are closing the retail store and only the private owners will continue running it via online.     Flash forward to today, I see they made a post on Facebook saying 4th of July week sale, Come on in! The store was open.  Now is it only open for the 4th of july week?  Or did something shady happen in Feb? Because they typed a letter for me to give to unemployment saying the store was closed and everyone got layed off.	Yes
I'm looking for a new job and am willing to contract.  Some recruiters, I'd say less than half, have language that states I agree to accept the position if the employer wants me (at the negotiated rate).   Is such a contract binding?   If so, if the job is at will anyway, what prevents me from joining for 1 day and then quitting, say if I don't like the office smell?  (promissory estoppel issues perhaps)  More curious than anything, because I occasionally agree to such terms, but only when the money is so good that I really would take the job.	Yes
In October 2016 I was let go from my job. When leaving, I asked about my 26 hours of unused PTO. They referred me to the company's HR department. This is a large company that does business in many states. It is a mail order pharmacy. When I called, they said that in Kansas they don't pay unused PTO. But I don't think that's accurate. I don't think that's accurate because when my girlfriend owned a business that went out of business, a former employee of hers sued her for unused vacation time. I'm just confused with the law is and what I should do. Your help is greatly appreciated!	Yes
"As a preface to this story I drive a truck for the nation's largest retailer and they pay me very good (six figures good).   I was on my off day and took an out of town trip with my wife and kids in the family minivan. We started to approach the small town of Uniontown AL and I was immediately pulled over by a police officer (he passed me going the opposite direction then proceeded to do a unturn to get behind me). I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam.   I know the obvious answer is to ""lawyer up"" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well?   And to revisit my beginning statement where I drive truck for the nation's largest retailer... They will not tolerate a serious violation on my mvr. So I'm possibly facing a $100,000/yr job loss. Who knows, they might be understanding and give me a slap on the wrist but either way I'm scared!   Where do I go from here?"	Yes
"I worked for an IT company and put in my two weeks notice. When I put in my two weeks notice (Resignation) I was told that I would be paid out two weeks and I would go home that day. This is typical in the IT Field. However, I received an email from our COO stating that they are ""modifying"" my resignation to the termination date of when I put in my Two weeks notice (read: not paying me the two weeks out). Is this legal?"	Yes
I can understand if someone quit and you need to cover a shift, or it got busy before you where about to leave, but;  The store I work for closes at 10:00 PM everyday besides Sunday, of which we close at 8:00 PM. The company has distribution centers which ship products to their stores - Which is fine.  What's not fine is that they frequently schedule these shipments to arrive at 7:30 PM or even 8:00 PM - When we close.  Typically, I'm pretty laid back and wouldn't care, but these shipments take *at minimum* one hour to just unload, not put the items where they need to be.  I'm just thinking that there has to be some kind of rule that prevents this. They should either rethink their logistics or schedule for tomorrow.  **Tl;dr**: I, and everyone else, am being kept working well passed store closing ours by same companies (seemingly deliberate) shipment scheduling.  Is there anything I can do about this?  Location: Iowa, USA.	Yes
Here are the questions I have so far:  1. I am in a field that has mandatory overtime i.e. if someone does not show up for a shift, the previous shift has to work the next shift and possibly the one after that in emergency situations. How would that work if the strike started during or at the end of my shift?  I could not get a straight answer on this from Googling, and I believe it's illegal for me to not stay if the next person does not show up.  2. I understand that the union may fine me for working during a strike. Would that apply if it was due to mandatory overtime?  3. Is there anything else I should know about strikes in healthcare or in general?	Yes
so basically when i quit my job and i lost there key now i felt like they deducted my hours because for starters i had split shifts 7 to 11 and 3 to 10 that 10 hr but that lasted for 2 days so now it went from 9hr 3pm to 10 that first week in i quit once again i lost the key to the shop they was telling me they was gonna hold my check deduct money out of it turns out they took out some hours so now i have 20hours when really i was supposed to have over 40hours plz tell me i can sue them for this 	Yes
"Hey guys, so I'm starting a new job and they're having me sign a non-compete agreement, and I had a few concerns about the wording of it so my boyfriend suggested I post here.   Firstly, I work in advertising, so a non-compete agreement is pretty standard I'm told. But there are a few sections that seem really unreasonable to me if I'm reading them correctly. I live in Tennessee if that matters. (I've also replaced the company name with XXX)  The first section:  'Employee shall devote all professional time and attention to the business of XXX. During the term of this Agreement, all persons from or for whom Employee solicits business or performs advertising, marketing, direct marketing, digital marketing or public relations services shall be clients of XXX, and all fees, commissions and other compensation for Employee’s services, direct or indirect, shall be payable solely to XXX. All clients, and all services rendered by Employee to or for all clients, shall be approved by XXX before any services are rendered by Employee to said clients. During Employee’s employment with XXX, Employee shall not render any services or engage in any activity which is competitive with or adverse to XXX’s business, either alone, as a partner, officer, director, employee, shareholder or otherwise on behalf of any other business.""  Does this mean I'm not allowed to do freelance work at all? I run a few networking groups for the online community that are fairly popular, and while I don't make money on them now, I could in the future. And as well, I often have people within the network who offer to pay me to consult them about their online brands, social media, etc. And on top of that, I have my own social media channels that I don't currently make money on, but might in the future. Firstly, is that not allowed? And secondly, do I have to disclose all of it to the company? and Finally, does this mean they could stake a claim to my personal properties online that I'm working on outside of work - like the networking groups I do social media for, my personal accounts that are creative/marketing based?   The second section: During Employee’s employment with XXX and for a period of one (1) year after Employee’s employment with XXX is terminated for any reason by either party, Employee will not, unless acting in his capacity as an employee of XXX in the performance of services under this Agreement, either directly or indirectly, on Employee’s behalf or on behalf of any other advertising, marketing, direct marketing, digital marketing or public relations agency, or in conjunction with any other person, firm or corporation, interfere with the business relationships between XXX and its employees, XXX and XXX Clients and/or XXX Clients and their employees by:  accepting employment with or doing free-lance work for another advertising agency, in-house advertising agency, media buying service, public relations agency, digital marketing agency or direct marketing agency in Tennessee, or influencing other XXX employees or XXX Client’s employees to do so.""  Further down it says:   ""Thus, it is agreed that, in the event of any breach of Subparagraph A or Subparagraph B of Paragraph 5 above, in addition to any other legal or equitable relief to which XXX may be entitled, Employee shall pay to XXX as liquidated damages for the breach thereof an amount equal to fifty percent (50%) of the gross income (including commissions, fees and retainers) received from any such XXX Client by Employee or by any other agency with whom Employee may hereafter, either directly or indirectly, be associated, for a period beginning with the breach of these provisions and extending three (3) years from the date of the breach of these provisions or from the date of termination of Employee's employment by CTA, whichever is the later.""  Does this mean that if I decide to leave my job or get fired for any reason, I'm not allowed to work in my field of expertise where I live for a year?! And if I do they'll try to take 50% of my compensation for 3 years?   My friends think I'm being overdramatic about this, but I really want to make sure I understand what this is saying before I sign it because I don't want to be in a situation later that could have been avoided. Any clarification or advice you guys can give is really appreciated!"	Yes
I have severe depression and anxiety and it was causing my performance to drop and they reached out to me about it. At this time I disclosed my mental illnesses to HR to get it documented. After this I was singled out and threatened on a weekly basis that they were going to fire me for not meeting stats for 3-4 months. This put a lot of stress  and anxiety on me causing my depression to get worse and worse which in turn caused my performance to worsen. I then reached out to the employee assistance program to set up sessions to get medication for my depression due to how bad it was getting due to them. Mind you that a good majority of employee's were doing around the same as me and some even worse that were not being treated this way or even being spoken to about it. They continued to push me and have gotten so bad that I can barely function. I have a session set up to see someone about getting back on medication which i fully disclosed to them that i was seeking help at which point they fired me for performance and tried to pay me to sign a contract giving up any rights to legal action. I feel I was discriminated against and harassed due to my mental illnesses to the point of breaking me and then they fired me. I'm trying to find out if I can fight this.  	Yes
    As a naive recent college graduate, I came upon an opportunity to work on a side project for a small business owner. We agreed that it would be a side project and I had to get permission from my full-time boss before I could take the project on (proactively avoid any conflict of interests situation).          My boss said he thought it wasn't the best idea because he didn't want my focus being pulled away from any client I would be working for at my full time job, but ultimately was okay with me doing the side project (with the caveat of no phone calls for side project while at a client site, and my full time job always comes first). I communicated this situation to the small business owner and he was okay with the situation.         Long story short, I completely underestimated the project (right out of college, estimation abilities weren't based on reality) and had to enlist the help of 3 other acquaintances to help. We all were working on the project on and off for over a year and there was still some minor development work to be completed plus user testing/bug fixes at the time of him deciding to call off the project.         Over the course of the year he paid me two payments of equal amount and he paid me as a 1099 employee (the second payment only for the sake of being able to include it in his 2016 taxes). From the first payment I used almost all of it to pay 3 work friends for their help. Almost half of the second payment ended up going towards paying my own taxes from the 1099 income.         At the end of 2016/beginning of  2017 his business took a huge hit after losing a major client, and he had to downsize to the point where he might be quitting altogether/finding some other opportunity. In the stress of his business falling apart all of the sudden, he burned a lot of bridges and took a lot of his stresses out on others. During this time he told me that we were going to have to scrap the project because he no longer really had a use for it.         Now, about a month later, he calls me and basically says that he doesn't have a finished product to show for his money and he wants it all back, even if we have to come up with a monthly payment plan. I brought up my time and energy spent on the project and he basically told me that my time doesn't matter, I was supposed to give him this product and I didn't so I owe him everything back. I even told him how half what he paid me had gone to outside help for his project, a large portion to taxes, and I only had a small portion left to show for my own efforts and time; to which he basically replied that that was on me and that my time and efforts are worthless and that if I didn't pay him back he would have no choice but to get his lawyer(s) involved.   So, r/legaladvice, am I pretty much screwed in this situation, or would I even stand any kind of chance in court? He decided to give up on the project and he paid me as a 1099 employee, does that matter in this kind of scenario? I know he is trying to recoup from losses in his business, but just because my efforts are less tangible in his mind (lines of code), it shouldn't discredit my hundreds of hours of effort.  Any help or advice would be appreciated!	Yes
I work for a rental/event setup company seasonal  (in the summer) last year my first season I had signed accepting this policy, since then quitting and becoming a new hire (having to fill out a new w4) but not signing the agreement of this policy; am I still subject to this policy? The policy is that quitting results in your last check dropping down to minimum wage ($7.25 an hour in my state) Wondering if im screwed or can fight this. This is in Iowa	Yes
Asking for a friend who was contracted to work until September, and was just given a week's notice they no longer have the money to keep her position. What is the minimum notice required? I only know the state/city just passed the nation's first protections for freelancers, but no idea what is now legal. Can they cancel on such a short notice?	Yes
So my new boss told me today at orientation that it's going to take 3-4 pay cycles for my paycheck to come. The pay cycle however is twice monthly and the owner doesn't do paper checks so my only option for pay is direct deposit. Something just screams red flag. Any legal advice on this one?	Yes
I was terminated from my company in May. I was paid out growth commission in April from a deal I closed in February.(commission is paid out on growth through 4 months after initial close)  The company paid the growth amount, accounting approved the payment and I was paid the amount in April. In May I was unexpectedly let go from the company for performance. I went on my way and began my search for another job. I received  a call from the company stating that there was an error and they are looking for repayment of the commission. They stated that it wasn't an accounting error but a customer success error. The customer paid the growth amount, accounting approved it and then I was paid the commission the month later in April. Now it is July and they are looking for repayment - I am hoping to get some advice on the my rights here. I was paid the commission in good faith back in April and I have spent the money as it was owed to me. They also stated on the phone that they are holding my final commission check until repayment, which doesn't seem right. I am wondering if I need to get a lawyer involved... I did not agree to any repayment and they stated they will be getting back to me..   I am happy to give anyone additional information. I appreciate any help!!! Thank you!	Yes
"Hey, guys.   I live in Newport Beach, CA.   My situation is complex and I will try to explain it to the best of my ability. I was employed by a family owned pizza place in Newport Beach, CA. The business had three locations. As a delivery boy, I would drive pizzas to the person who placed the order and received the money to pay for the pizza along with a cash tip. I would pocket this. If the pizza was paid for through a credit card, I would obtain a signature from the customer. If the customer chose to give me a tip, it was available for them to tip above the signature on the receipt. I was cashed out in full at the end of the night.   This is not problematic.   This is what is problematic.   I never received any cash tips from inside the restaurant (there was a tip jar) and never received any credit tips that were left on a receipt. I have filed a wage claim form, gone through a preliminary conference, and now I am scheduled for a hearing. My ex-boss is claiming the following:   ALL THREE LOCATIONS EARNED $220 IN A TWO WEEK PERIOD OR $440 IN A MONTH     This would mean each store earned around $15 a day just in tips. (keep in mind we are in Newport Beach, CA, there is no way the stores made that little per day).    I almost know for a certainty that the locations earned way more than this amount. How can I make sure he is telling the truth? How can I refute this?   He is also claiming this:   BECAUSE (my name) WAS A DRIVER, (my name) WAS NOT ENTITLED TO IN-STORE TIPS. ONLY SERVERS WERE ENTITLED TO SAID TIPS.   1. My ex-boss never distributed tips to any other employees, if he did, the amount was always $20 and was allocated every month, not every two weeks. From co-workers, I have heard that they claimed to never have been tipped out and never have received any kind of tips (these are the people working as cashiers)   2. On a busy night, as a driver, I would take at most 6 or 7 deliveries that averaged 2 hours to 2 hours and 20 minutes of driving time and delivery of pizzas. Keep in mind this was only on an extremely busy night. Usually, more often than not, I would take 3 to 4 deliveries which would average at about 1 hour to about 1 hour and 20 minutes. My shifts were 4-5 hours long. During the times I was not driving, I was serving guests alongside the cashiers. I would take phone orders, place orders in person, interact with guests, take food to tables, clear tables, clean the restaurant, bathrooms, do dishes, etc etc etc (My point is that I served many many people and my ex-boss is claiming that because my position was a ""driver"" that I was not entitled to any form of tips)   How can I prove that I served food and his logic is flawed and not factual?   I have most if not all of my pay stubs and I have all my W-2s.   Please please please please help.  If more information is needed I will provide whatever....."	Yes
Hey everyone. I'm not sure where to look for information, or what to search for. I've tried a bit, and found some information, but not complete.   So here's the situation.   I'm 8 months pregnant, my husband went to work for a company to go tree planting for a couple of months.   Turns out it's a shitty company and he wants to leave early. He told the boss that he needs to come back to help me, as I'm on sick leave currently.   His boss said two things that are making me scratch my head.   1. He needs me to provide a sick note detailing why I'm sick and what's wrong with me. I told my husband that in the note I provided my employer, it didn't say anything about why I am sick, just that I am sick and that I will be off work from this date until this date.   2. Then he said that if my husband leaves now, instead of paying per tree, my husband will get paid minimum wage for the hours worked. My husband also said that he can stay for one more week.   My husband doesn't have a copy of his contract, and will talk to his boss tomorrow to get a copy.   I'm just wondering about the legalities of leaving a contract early, and if the boss can change the rate of pay in this situation.   Also I tried looking into family sick leave in MB, and I found a phone number I can call to ask more. Unfortunately tomorrow is Sunday and I may have to wait until Monday to call.   Also if he is in a different province, what provinces labour laws should he be following, assuming this company is a MB company?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
"The company my wife works for called in a worker today who was ""randomly"" chosen for a drug test (turns out, the owner just assumed he was on drugs).  His drug test came back clean; however, they lied to him and told him he had failed the drug test and fired him for it. My wife doesn't like this and is planning on telling him, but does this guy have any legal ground to stand on if he contacts a lawyer. This is in Texas by the way."	Yes
I was laid off in mid June, and I'm curious about several things, including my annual reviews (I was laid off at the same time that our managers were supposed to go over reviews with us) as well as anything related to why I was laid off.  I sent my company a request based off of [Oregon Revised Statute 652.750](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2016orLaw0115.pdf), but they only sent me my non-compete and a secrecy agreement that I had signed.  I'm not sure what to expect.  I don't know what my personnel files consists of, but I want to make sure I get everything I can (including ones I'm unaware that exist, if that makes sense.)  How can I make sure they give me everything that I have rightful access to?  Thanks!	Yes
[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ffrla/pais_it_legal_for_an_employer_require_a_pregnancy/)  Short but positive update. Apparently the CEO of the company got wind of what was happening and just stopped the entire thing immediately.  She was not required to do anything at all and management has apparently been cool since.   No one knows what happened to management who asked for test behind closed doors but we imagine it was probably a lengthy reminder of what common sense is.  Thanks to everyone who offered advice, it really helped out.	Yes
"Need a little bit of legal advice. The company I was working for has been in the process of paying me back freelancer invoices back when I was under a 1099 a while ago. During that time period I had gone full-time with them and I was receiving a weekly paycheck.  Back in January/December, the company moved from one state to another and the owner was trying to make that change reflect in our taxes that are taken out as New Hampshire's is lower. There were a few pay periods that were missed, but then I resumed getting new ones again and was told that I would be reimbursed for those that I had not received during the transition, along with the original freelance checks. (At this point some of you may be wondering, why didn't you leave or take action at that point or earlier? Well, this industry is notorious for not paying people, but it is also difficult to find a position like the one that I was in, so I felt like it was the best opportunity and the reputation and experience to me at the time was worth it. I was also fresh out of school at the time.)  During my final 2 weeks which was a few months ago, 2 of the checks that they had written to pay me back for the original missed pay periods had bounced. Also, during those 2 weeks I didn't receive an automatic deposit, so I approached my employer about it. They basically said that they had a lot less money to pay me than they thought and that it wasn't fair for me to continue to work there while I wasn't getting paid.  I'm not really privy to the behind the scenes accounting, but I can't imagine they're particularly good at it. My employer wrote up a document to basically say that they were suspending payment for a while and verbally said that they would look to get me paid back within 4 weeks. Verbally, they said that want to bring me back on full-time again once the work picks up. Its been about 2 months, and I have received a replacement check for one of those missed pay periods, but I haven't received word on when I will be expecting more.  Basically, I'm trying to figure out what sort of legal power/ability I have under my control between the freelancer checks, the full-time missed pay periods, the bounced checks, and the sudden suspension of employment even though I was under contract. I'm definitely tired of waiting around and even though I would hate to break off the relationship with this company, money is more important to me at this point. If they are legitimately ""out of money"" I understand that they can only do so much to pay me back, but they lacked the foresight to deal with that preemptively and allowed me to work without receiving payments. I also feel like they are doing what they can to pay me back, as I have received one of the replacement checks, so I'm not sure if that changes anything from a legal perspective."	Yes
Thank you in advance for your consideration.  I am the only warehouse employee for a company in Illinois. I ship out orders all over the world, mostly through UPS and FedEx. Every day UPS and FEDEX stop by in the afternoon between 3pm-4:00pm to pick up the outgoing packages. But on Fridays in the summer we close at 1pm, meaning UPS and FEDEX can't pick up the packages on those days.   My boss told me I have to take all of the packages on Fridays and load them into my personal vehicle and drive them 15 minutes out of my way to UPS and drop them off. I have to do this after 1pm when I am off the clock. Basically, I'm being ordered to load hundreds of pounds of boxes into my sedan and drive them around on my personal insurance while I am off the clock.   I am very ignorant of these things so if I'm wrong, I accept that, but it seems like this can't be legal, can it? I feel like I'm putting wear and tear on my personal vehicle and taking all the liability while also working for free.   Reasoning with my boss is impossible. She is extremely petty and unreasonable. She once fired someone for bringing up serious concerns about some red flags regarding the financials of the company. Basically, discussing my concerns with her will get me nowhere. Her only boss is the president of the company who is barely ever around and he always just sides with her on things because he doesn't want to deal with it.  I've worked here for almost a year and it is painfully obvious that my boss does not like me, even though I receive high praise from everyone else at the company. I'm afraid if I speak up she'll fire me. What should I do?	Yes
I work in an IT office in Upstate NY. We have two forms of on call.  Level 1: On call for a week Friday Night - Thursday Night. 2 AM when our office closes to 7 AM (8 AM on weekends) when it opens. Work is done at home on a company issued phone and laptop. You get $7 a night to reimburse for internet bandwidth used. You get paid for the time you spend on a call that comes in. 5 minutes minimum to keep the math easy for hours worked (i.e. if you spend 3 minutes on a call it's logged as 5). The sum of hours worked gets added as overtime as you still work M-F 8 hour days.  Level 2: On for a calendar month. 11 PM - 7 AM weekdays, 5 pm - 8 AM weekends. Work done at home with a company laptop and phone. You do not get compensated every night, but if you answer a phone call once you get $5 reimbursement for internet. Same rules for logging time on calls applies as level 1.  Some people seem to think these procedures are outside the NYS labor laws and I can't seem to find anywhere where that would be true. I've specifically heard the way they pay out hours worked and also one person seemed to think there has to be a minimum hours worked even if only 5 minutes are spent working on a particular night. I just want to know if there is anything outside the law going on.	Yes
"Back story: My company (A) was acquired 1.5 years ago (January 2016) by company (B). In the agreement they were required to keep all company A employees for one year. After that year was over they laid a few of us off for financial reasons.   I was sadly one of those and am now filing for unemployment. It asks me to ""Provide your employment history for the past 18 months, including your very last employer.""   Do I include company A and company B TOGETHER as one company where I have worked for the past 18 months? or list them separately? There is nowhere to include information about the acquisition.   Thanks for the help!"	Yes
I have no idea where to begin looking for a labor attorney in San Diego, CA.   Do I look online in Yelp? How do I go about finding one?  The situation involves a company, specifically her direct supervisor, acting very unprofessional towards my girlfriend. On top of that they penalized her for the government arranging to go to a mandatory meeting for her green card.   She wanted to go to HR but other supervisors have stated it will compromise her career and discouraged it. In that case I think it's necessary for her to see an attorney before she goes to HR, or sees what the labor attorney has to say having heard the full details.	Yes
"I'm an assistant nurse mgr. on a hospital unit. One of our per diems asked if she could give me as a reference, as she was applying for another job, so I said OK. The call came yesterday, and my manager happened to be standing next to me. The prospective employer asked me what my title is, and I told him; if ""X"" worked there, and I said yes; and in what capacity - she's a per diem staff RN, I said. Then he asked if I had any specific comments about her, and I told him she's an excellent nurse and an exemplary employee. That's it. Nothing about salary, disciplinary actions, etc. My manager asked me what the deal was, and when I told her, she said in the future I should refer any similar callers to HR, because we're not allowed to give out any information about employment status, and it could be grounds for termination (not that she was threatening me - she was just letting me know). Is this really true as far as employment law is concerned? The information listed above is literally all I told the guy. I realize the hospital itself could probably have some weird policy, and we're not a union shop, if that matters. Just very curious."	Yes
Hey r/legaladvice, do you think my girlfriend should do something about her latest manager? To keep it straight and to the point: her new manager told her employees to start thinking of a few days to go on vacation next month. When asked why, she responded that any employee who couldn't take vacation would have to work 1 less day per week.  Is that even legal? Is there something my girlfriend can do before she is forced to drop from 40 hours to 30-32 a week? Losing 1/4 of your income is pretty harsh so Im hoping that there is a way she can defend herself from losing that money.  Some minor details: This manager just replaced the previous manager who was fired for raking up more HR charges than Weinstein.   She is new and was hired from an entirely different industry. There was an interim manager that worked in this company for 18 years and surpassed all previous metrics from the previous manager before being replaced by someone who never worked for this entire industry before!   This new manager wants these employees to go on vacation because this company doesnt take vacation out of the payroll budget that is involved with the managers bonus.  This is a forbes 500 company. Idk if that pertains, but I figured it might be worth mentioning  Thanks in advance to all who may be willing to help :)	Yes
I live and work in Kentucky. Work at a small business (14 employees)   I was sent on a business trip to Iowa and had to fly here for a few days. They are paying me for working Mon-Wednesday since I was supposed to be home Wednesday night. Due to storms my flight got rebooked for Thursday and now I will not be home until Thursday night. If it is important, Thursday's are my day off and I never work thursdays. So I am just wondering if I should be paid to work Thursday since I am stuck here an extra day or if it is nobody's fault.   I do think they will go ahead and pay me but I am just curious if it is illegal if they do not.   Thanks!	Yes
I don't want to give any serious details out, but my direct boss has falsely claimed that I have asked him out/ asked for his number and made advances towards him at work. None of these things are true.  Nothing serious has come of it, but is there any action I should take? This is just a shitty part time job but I don't want to get fucked over.   I only heard this from a co worker. It happened when my boss, another manager, and a few co workers went out for drinks, and I don't think anyone believed him.   Do I file with HR w/o proof? I don't even have an actual HR department, just a phone number. I just don't want to get into trouble for something I didn't do.	Yes
"Background stories: [part 1](https://np.reddit.com/r/work/comments/6jppv8/noticed_an_employee_acting_very_strange/) [part 2](https://np.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/6lrybr/work_reported_an_employee_who_is_making_me/)   I work in an office area in a warehouse. To make it short, I've been experiencing an employee/stalker since June 23rd, 2017 in the workplace. I've noticed a pattern in his behavior of pacing near me and attempting to contact me during my lunch and breaks. He has been confronted by HR that he makes me uncomfortable and to not be around me after I have reported him a second time. I have reported THREE incidents to my HR. She claims she does not know what to do and that he does not 'listen'.  * 1st incident: Reported the first time explaining I am uncomfortable during my lunch and breaks and that I had a feeling an employee was recording me. I had a gut feeling when I saw his phone angled differently, along with his slow pace of walking. HR made the excuse that his eyesight was bad, my manager said the most wrong things like: ""Stand up for yourself and say something,"" joked that there has been 4 marriages in the company, and to try being ""friendly."" * 2nd incident: He attempted to say hi to me and I ignored him. I got up to go to the office and he was behind me, chanting ""you need a physical"" 3 times. I reported it and he was confronted by HR and my manager. They confronted me shortly after and told me that the employee told them he did not attempt to contact me, and that he was chatting with two other people who were around, which is FALSE. He attempts to talk to me when I'm alone. HR and manager told me his lunch and break times will be changed, and that she wanted 'proof' and gave me permission to record. * 3rd incident: Yesterday. Employee passed by, pacing by slowly near the door-less entry of the area that I sit in. I grow extremely uncomfortable and after my break was finished, I went into the office and confronted my HR telling her that I can't focus, and that he is effecting my work. Luckily I caught the incident on my phone and was able to show them the 'evidence' that they wanted, which is ridiculous. During this time, my manager said more stupid shit like ""would you feel comfortable if all 4 of us talked"" and ""have you tried to confront him""? HR asks what I want them to do, and I tell them ""I don't know"" even though the clear answer is I WANT HIM FUCKING GONE! After my first break, I changed the location of where I have my lunch and last break. Near the end of the day, he had the audacity to walk into the office and be near me, talking to a fellow office co-worker. He has never had to step foot into in the office prior to that.  Assuming that the warehouse manager was confronted yesterday and that the employee did not see me in the usual location for my lunch and last break, I'm assuming he had the intent to violate my safe space in the office. I felt so fucking violated and I was trying my best not to visibly show that I was uncomfortable.   In addition to his unacceptable behavior, he has walked out on the job a couple of days ago and came back the next day. He has been late to work multiple times and he is currently on a 3 month work-probation. I don't know why they won't fire him when there's so many things he's getting away with. I'm assuming that the only reason is because the warehouse positions are so hard to fill.   I have not confronted the owner of the company since she is out of town, but I definitely will this upcoming week. What should I do until then, and when she does come back in town, how do I approach this issue? I really like my job and would like to grow my position with this company, but this employee is seriously creating a hostile work environment. It's so ridiculous that my HR and manager wanted 'video evidence' when I reported him a second time. I've spent all my breaks and lunch busy recording on my phone.  edit: sorry for the awful grammer. I am really, really emotionally distressed right now. If anyone wants clarification, I will be happy to provide details. It sucks that this has going on for way too long and that I even worry about work on my days off."	Yes
"I'm not at a risk of getting fired - but have been considering changing jobs if i find a better paying position.      My contract comes with a non compere clause for 12 months and NDA for 24 months limited geographically to my current country.  BUT it also comes with a line that, when translated, says:   ""The amount of monthly compensation is agreed upon at the end of the contract."".   Since sum is not specified, what stops me from asking a compensation equal to my full salary for the duration and refuse small and tiny compensations they might offer?"	Yes
Not me but a relative was fired today after 6 months working for a company. Their reason was that he did not inform HR of his conviction. This was his first job after prison and he was required to provide the halfway house he lived in a signed agreement confirming employment. His bosses both knew of the conviction from the interview forward. Even signed said document the prison system required.   Arkansas is right to work. But is there a case against the employer here? If not, is there a case to still get unemployment? They said he would not be eligible for failure to disclose the conviction to HR.   Please help! Thanks.	Yes
According to North Carolina department of labor law after 6 hours of working you MUST leave for at least a 30 minute lunch. An hour if you're working more than 8 hours (I'm not sure how this works. Is it that after 8 hours I must leave for an hour? Or simply if I work an 8 hour or more shift I must get an hour lunch?)  Let me know if there's any more information that you would need added. I don't want compensation or anyone to lose their job, although if that's what would happen by reporting it (the job losing, not the compensation) I'll do it. I want this piece of shit to know you can't deny someone a lunch break.   The only reason I didn't simply walk out after 6 hours was because I was working on someone's car, and I'm not a POS who's going to make someone wait an extra hour after I had already been working on it for an hour.   Thanks in advanced for any answers.	Yes
First off, yes I was fucking dumb for agreeing to take the job at below minimum. Current minimum wage is 11.40/h in ON. My current rate is 11/h.   I'm really hesitant to speak to my boss (Also the owner of the business) about this, because he's kind of a dick. Type of guy who'd slash my hours for bringing it up.   I have signed a contract with him and plan on asking for a copy for my records tomorrow.   My ask is: How should I proceed? I really need to keep on with this job. I don't have anything else lined up right now.	Yes
I was a misclassified 1099 employee by a company I was with for over a year. I am in the process of filling out the ss8 and I am 100% sure I will be ruled as being an employee. However, in that case I would like the state of IL to investigate overtime wages I have been due that amount to a little over 5k.   Can I file both documents at once?  Or should I wait to file the DOL wage complaint?  In my previous post about this issue I had someone mention I didn't have to wait to file the DOL wage claim but I would like to know how they'd be able to investigate or make a determination if I haven't been ruled an employee yet?   Thanks guys.	Yes
"Hello everyone, please help me out.   My Mom needs to get her insurance done, so I need to report my earnings from Wendy's to her report. The last month I worked at Wendy's was January 2017. Recently, I called and they gave me this site to go to which is called netsecure.adp. This is the site that shows all the times they paid me, and I need it to show it to the insurance people. I put in all my information and when I click ""enter"" it says my account is ""locked"". So I call back my Wendy's place and ask the guy if he can help me. I say, ""Can I have a number to talk to? What can I do to fix this? I really need this for my insurance."" He doesn't give me a number to talk to at all. He says I'm locked out my account because I don't work there anymore. I told him I really need it for my insurance, in which he replies ""I don't care"" with a chuckle. Please, someone help me out. I have contacted the store manager last week but she has not gotten back to me!!!!   Thanks everyone!"	Yes
"So some more info, first I am in Kentucky. I have a supervisor that is seemingly being harassing. I say seemingly because I do not know what legally constitutes harassment. But I feel harassed. So the information.. I started a new job, which required a lot of training on the employer's processes and their computer system. I was not learning quick enough for my boss and she began asking me if I had a ""processing disorder"". Later, she and her supervisor called me into a meeting with a list of complaints they had for me that they said came from other co-workers. The list contained some things about my attitude but the majority of the list included, things like tapping, banging my mouse, hiccuping, and talking loudly. Just to name a few. During the meeting she also accused me of being ADHD.  To be noted I am hard of hearing and I wear hearing aids. I am fairly young and have early hearing loss. I at times talk loudly when there is a lot of noise and I have difficulty hearing myself. Again because of the noise I have difficulty hearing others. I have a full list of the complaints as I had to sign it. Since that meeting I have been called into my supervisor's office over what seems like very small matters that she wishes to make big issues, such as the way I do documentation.  The documentation is not wrong, it's just different than what she does, but I try my best to conform to her way, but it has begun to be very stressful. In addition, during the meetings she speaks to me very demeaning in that she will ask ""Do you understand"" after almost every comment. I never know when I am going to be called into her office for minor offenses. And again do not know if this is legally harassing or just my boss doing her best to get me to quit. I guess my biggest concern is her asking me and telling my I have processing disorder or am ADHD just because I don't do what and how she does things."	Yes
**Fair-warning, this is textbook high school drama bullshit. Please click out if you feel like it's going to be a waste of time.**  I currently work at one of the most known fast food restaurants that serves exclusively chicken.   The manager (#1) of the store brought one of his workers with him to this store. We'll call him Kelso and he's second in position.** The dude is 20 years old** and the're basically like father and son. I'm on good terms with all of the management here, but him (because of the issue I'm about to bring up). Even though I'm close with and well liked the management team and the owner of the store, the management team here are VERY close here which is why I'm even bringing this to Reddit because I believe nothing will come out of me bringing this to their attention.  There's a girl (we'll call her Jackie) who everyone is trying to get at/talk to where I work and it's a known fact that this girl and Jake are exclusive and it's known to the public. I saw Kelso (#2) post a picture of him and Jackie on Instagram. I tried liking it and it wouldn't let me. I kept liking it, but it would unlike it automatically so I thought that was weird. So I refreshed my Instagram and his picture which was posted a minute ago was gone. I checked my followers and who I was following and he wasn't there.   So then, I went to a picture of a coworker where I knew he commented on and saw his name there. I clicked on it, and tried following him and it would un-follow automatically.   So then I dm'd a coworker who happens to be very close to Jackie. This is what was said: http://imgur.com/a/SQOQv  His girlfriend would almost always try talking to me and I knew that some shit would go down if he ever saw me talking to her so I made sure to make things short. Unfortunately for me one day, we were talking (WHILE WORKING) and I saw him staring at us from the corner of my eye. At first, I thought nothing of it and boy was I wrong. I talked to Kelso a week or two prior about my hours and I have screenshots of him saying that he'll get me anywhere from 35-40 hours and if anything, he'll get me NEAR that. Ever since the incident of me talking to his girl happened, my hours have went from 38 --&gt; 26 --&gt; 20 --&gt; 16. The guy is basically trying to get me to quit and it's working. I'm not trying to stress over some high school bs when I've been away from that for a couple of years. My question is, is there anything I can do? I was thinking that this HAS to be: 1. conflict of interest and/or 2. unrelated work retaliation. Unfortunately for me, I believe I only have circumstantial evidence. I'm going to put my two weeks in in a few days and I'm chalking this up as a lost cause, but this shit isn't right and don't want someone else going through the same thing because of this insecure fuck.	Yes
I pressed charges but it doesn't matter because my DA said it wasn't a strong enough case to prosecute so all charges were dropped in May. I was told how to pursue them on my own but I needed time to heal and be away from the case due to having a shitty detective and DA. I was planning on this week going to go get the paperwork to begin the process over again.  My question is they can't fire him due to him being in the system so what can I do to get a rightful firing? Or more how do they see he is a danger because this will not show up on his background check until he is arrested with is based on a grand jury.   Please do not suggest switching jobs I struggle to hold any jobs for more than 3 months and I've been here for 8. I can't switch and live a fulfilling life. What can I do?	Yes
"So an interesting thing happened today. There have been rumors for a while about a potential list of employees who will be laid off. Someone in the office noticed in the printer queue from our HR manager (This printer is a public printer and used for most of the office) Seperate documents in the queue with titles that would say ""termination notice - employee name.""  Things got out of hand really quickly and the entire office knew by the end of the day. HR probably scared for their own job quicky called a meeting explaining who was the person who originally saw the Printer Queue as they will be fired immediately and if no one comes forward they will start making assumptions on who that person is.  I would like to know who is in the wrong here and do they have any legal standing"	Yes
My mom has been figured from her 20 year job because they say she no called no-showed.  For the last 3 years the company has been under new management.  It's been said amongst coworkers that there has been firing among anyone not young, fresh and modern to represents the companies new image. Out of everyone that worked there before management took over, now only a handful remain. Seasoned in their fields, they are all scared.  Should she seek a lawyer? Can they reject her of anything she has earned, such as Retirement, 401, etc? We're worried all of her commitments will be degraded.  By bullying I mean she has been harassed with text messages, people demanding her to come in on days she has scheduled PTO. Demanding her not to enjoy her days off and cover shifts.. just all around pressuring her to feel stressed and she feels bullied. Please advice   The company is a healthcare facility in NV. Please and thank you for sharing anything we should be aware of moving forward.	Yes
"I'm currently employed in GA and my boss is trying to force me to resign... My boss mislead me to believe I could work remotely and relocate to another state (not in writing unfortunately) and then changed her mind weeks later. She has been trying to get me to submit a resignation letter since I plan on moving (even though I work remotely now in GA). I told her I wasn't ready to submit the letter (as I don't have another job) and she decided to find a replacement for me anyways. She hired the person under the guise as ""help"" for me but has made announcements in meetings (in front of me) that I will be leaving.   She also requested for me to be present in the interview process for my replacement and told the applicants I was leaving the company. She is going to continue pressuring me to submit a resignation letter and I'm ultimately afraid she will fire me for misconduct. She has said in the past that no one will get unemployment on her watch, etc. I'm afraid that she will create a reason to fire me for misconduct... How can I protect myself in this situation?"	Yes
Posted in r/personalfinance originally   Not sure if best place to post, but have found help on this sub-Reddit before   My grandfather passed away this weekend and I have been off work since. My partner went to work on Monday but came home early and has since taken Tuesday and Wednesday off as well. Partially as she is upset and partially to support me.  Now, the thing is she has been temping at a company the past few weeks (in the uk) and she has been called this morning to be told she is no longer wanted as she is 'unreliable'   To me this seems wholly unfair, as she is taking compassionate leave, and if she had been asked to go in, she would have.  My question is, is this right? Is there anything that can be done here?	Yes
We are located in Alberta, Canada.   Over the course of the past year, my mother has suffered a debilitating illness that has kept her from working.  There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc).   My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.    We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we don’t know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage.   Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.	Yes
"I work in New Hampshire for a summer job thats 40 hours a week for 7 weeks. Its seasonal. Its run through a department of the town I live in, so I am employed by the town. My boss told me two things, and I'm not sure how to go about them.  1) I can't get overtime. I'm not sure why not. Is there a rule/law for this? She ""forgot"" to pay us for a training session we had, so she said I have to wait until the seasonal employment is over in order to fill out a timesheet. Or put it in for a day I'm taking off.  2) One week we spend an extra hour off-site. For the past two years, we did not get paid for that extra hour that 41 hour week.  Should i be getting paid? How would I go about this professionally?  Thanks for any &amp; all help."	Yes
Hi all, About 7 months ago, I took a new position and agree to take less salary in exchange for a 1% ownership of the company once we went public. After a few odd things keep coming up like all the company's expenses are paid by a few credit cards that are all in the CEO's name. So when I did some online research it turns out that the 'parent' company and investors don't exist. There are multiple LLCs but they are all in the CEOs name and use his home address as well. It all seems very shady. I am not sure what to do now. This company turned out to charge me $528 a paycheck (bi-weekly) for health insurance. This has really hurt my take home amount and is hurting my overall finances. What should I do? Ask for a higher salary? Just leave before this whole thing blows up?	Yes
Alright so I've tried googling this but have no guts on my specific situation.  I'm a server and the owner has 3 more restaurants all within a block, so we swap and take things we need from the other 3 if we ever run out of anything. Occasionally we will run out of a certain liquor and they will typically send a server to go grab an unopened bottle and bring it back to the restaurant they work at. Is it legal to walk it if you're under 21 since it is for business and you're on the clock?	Yes
Signed up for a 1099 sales job last year.  Commission was great and was doing very well.  The company then halved the commission awarded and several people quit.  They then switch to minimum wage + commission type, and had us sign a non-compete work contract.  Since then, they have added minimum sales quotas, set hours, and even further reduced our commission.  Am I bound by this new non-compete clause?	Yes
I am in the United States now but last month I was in China. I was working as an independent contractor for a Chinese theme park company since Spring of 2016. I have a signed contract with a salary amount and no clause regarding them withholding payment for any reason. I worked the entire month of May (which was my last month) and they have copies of all my work, but are refusing to pay me. They have also stopped replying to my emails. Since I'm no longer in China, I don't know what to do other than looking online for a lawyer in China that could possibly help me. Is this the right move? Any experience with finding legal help in mainland China? I'm not expecting it to be cheap, but since it's several thousand USD they owe me, I think it's worth seeking help.	Yes
"Just yesterday an email went out from our CFO announcing we are shifting to an unlimited PTO system from an accrued vacation system as of August 1st. For the last two years I have accrued about three weeks worth of vacation, with coworkers accruing months over a longer time. A fellow coworker and myself both inquired about the hours being bought out to which our CFO replied:    &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""No, it's not being paid out in the transition, it will just remain there""   and  &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;""won't be paid out, but we are figuring how we will / can treat it.""  &amp;nbsp;  He has not replied to us requesting what that means, and if that means the previously accrued hours will still be paid out upon leaving the company (rather than just being paid out when we switch systems). With an August 1st deadline, others and I can't burn all the hours and many were expecting those hours being bought out upon leaving. I know legally in California, a company whose PTO is based on accrued hours has to buy them out upon leaving because those accrued hours are a form of deferred compensation that cannot be taken away from the employee once it is earned. But now that we've switched systems, do they still have to pay out or are all of us workers getting screwed? If they have to pay out, are they able to pay out upon leave rather than upon switching systems?"	Yes
Work in a place where traditionally lowest on the totem pole does the hard crap work. It sucks but eventually you earn your stripes someone new comes along and you do less and less of the crap until one day you rarely if ever have to do it.   Here and there over the years I have had managers try to jump someone over me (usually because they are female or older and less capable) pushed it to the main boss and they agreed that was not cool. Couple of times this resulted in the newer employee quitting because the work is that disagreeable      New group of managers has decided the traditional way of doing things (and also the way all similar departments in the company still do it) doesn't matter to them.   So now it seems that the young men no matter seniority get to do all the hard work, while being told that what we do is the top, not the bottom.   Are there and laws that protect us? (CA)  Feels real shitty	Yes
Hi, I recently got hired as a guest services supervisor. I'm a full-time employee (scheduled for and work over 40 hours per week) and am salaried at $520 per week. I work in California.   [I seem to qualify for the administrative exemption per California law.](https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/Glossary.asp?Button1=A#administrative%20exemption)    From what I can tell, I should be paid at least twice the minimum wage, is this correct? If so, am I being illegally underpaid?  Thanks.	Yes
"A couple months ago, as title says, I was offered a job through a contracting agency, which I accepted and relocated for (only a few hundred miles, but still a trek when relocating all your belongings).  The day before I was supposed to start, I hadn't received any onboarding documents from them so I started to get a little worried and tried to make contact. They ignored me all day until that night when they told me that there had been ""some mistake"" and I no longer had a job.  I was able to maintain some sort of contact with them for about  a week after, in which I was told they could give me some compensation for things like **relocation, security deposit, one month rent**. However after this they simply stopped responding and I never got my compensation.  I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to move forward with getting said compensation from them."	Yes
"My friend was talking about non-competes and brought this question up...""Is a non-compete valid if you sign it but you physically haven't started working for them yet?"" Basically, they're asking is if you sign a non-compete but haven't started can you switch to a different job without any legal ramifications.   We couldn't find any answers online.  Cheers also the location is Massachusetts"	Yes
"Im working for a P.I. as an assistant. He wants me to phone a suspect for him, because his voice would be recognized.   Most of the things he asked me to say seems alright. But theres one thing that seems sketchy. He wants me to add:  &gt;""You are not allowed to leave the country, or the city limits. If you are found fleeing you will be arrested immediately."" This is merely  to intimidate them... we havent actually been told police will arrest them."	Yes
Hi all. I work part time at a shitty job that I really don't enjoy. I keep track of my hours and I have gotten paid for all of them except for two.  I worked for four days on the week of June 26th and last Friday on July 7th.  I'm supposed to get paid weekly. So let's say I work the week of June 26th; I get paid for that week the that Friday, June 30th.  So I go in June 30th for my pay for the week of June 26th, and my boss says he is busy and because I did not call to let him know I would be picking up my paycheck, he will pay me next time I come in. Okay, fair.  I come in July 2nd and my boss tells me he may as well consolidate the check for the week of July 26th and my pay for whatever other days I work on the week of July 3rd.  So I come in Friday the 7th of July to work, and while I am working my boss tells me checks didn't come in this week, they should be in by Wednesday, July 12th.  Isn't this in violation of the FLSA? He hasn't paid me for the close of a pay period (Week of June 26th and the Friday of June 7th, which he told me he would consolidate).  What should I do? Can/should I take legal action before tomorrow? If tomorrow rolls around and he doesn't pay me, what do I do?  I do not know any personal information about my boss. No contact info, anything. I know his first and last name. The only way to reach him is at my place of work, if he's there, and if he feels like coming to the phone because 50% of the time he's busy. I also overheard him talking to a coworker where the coworker told him he recalled once when he hadn't paid him for months- because my boss needed his social security. Is what my boss is doing illegal? He's not paying us adequately, and he is hiring people without their social security. He also handles tons of raw food without gloves and forces us to do the same. Asking to use gloves while handling results in a simple answer from him: a firm 'no'. Can someone help? I feel like this place is very shady.	Yes
Hi reddit,  Got an issue here with a (currently suspended) employee in my place of work, we have not yet hired a legal rep IRL as I would like to get some advice first before we decide to make the investment.  Issue is below:  Employee declared that they had resigned from their previous place of work when we interviewed them. Been employed for a year (passed probation) and due to a tip off (came from outside the business we believe, somebody from their previous place of work), we have now discovered that they were actually dismissed for fraud from the last employer (when they told us they resigned).   Reference check was done before being offered the position (as per usual), but reason for leaving was not disclosed by the references (we always try and get the reason for leaving if possible). We have no signed documents from the employee confirming their reason for leaving; only written information is interview notes when we interviewed them, but obviously they would not have signed this (and new employees do not normally see their interview notes).  As stated, employee has passed probation so we cannot simply dismiss that easily. Currently suspended employee and waiting for a meeting date, but unsure if we have a case here… he's suspended with pay so I doubt he's worried, probably just got his feet up at home.  Management does not want this employee working for us any longer given what he was dismissed for in the last company and intentionally did not declare it in this one (and as we are an insurance-based company, something like fraud is obviously going to raise warning flags. As stated he is currently suspended (with pay) and is waiting for a meeting date with his manager and HR. He has no previous warnings or anything as such on his record, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't socialise that much (which can go either way to be honest, if he is up to something with our company then it would make sense to keep to yourself).  Thanks to all that read / give advice!  - Catherine (Assistant HR manager)	Yes
So I have a condition called POTS (posterial orthostatic tacacaridia syndrome) and was just fired from my job because of it. It causes me to pass out when I go from sitting to standing sometimes. It's happened three times at work over the past year and they decided that it's not okay for them to have me around anymore. I am a club volleyball coach and I was wondering if it's legal to fire me over this. I'm unconscious for about 30 min and am still able to work after I wake up. Is there something that can be done? Any response would be appreciated even if it's completely okay for them to do this. 	Yes
Like everybody and their brother in this town, I too, am an aspiring screenwriter on the side.  I am about to start a tech job at one of the major studios, and in my offer letter it has the boilerplate stating that as of the day of my employment I assign any and all IP to them.  I don't really have any choice about signing this if I want to work there.  This job is not creative, but I could be exposed to creative projects at various stages of development.  I have developed to a reasonable degree one TV project (pilot written, season 1 outlined) and on film script (fully outlined with 20 pages of dialogue).  I've never really done much with either project other than have my friends read them.  I have no representation, nor am I a member of any trade union.  Obviously I'd love to have the film studio pick up either of these projects, but I don't want to have gifted these work (nor anything else that I create) to the film studio just because they've hired me as a code monkey.  What are my rights here?    I know in CA that as far as tech is concerned as long as you don't develop the IP with the company's time or resources and it is not substantially related to their business you can own it.  Does the same thing apply to creative works?  Can I continue to create works on the side?  Obviously, I can't steal ideas from anything I get exposed to at the studio.  What precautions should I take to avoid any appearance that I've done so?  You can find a lot on Google advising independent creatives about sharing stuff with studios, but I don't see anything pertaining to individuals with an employment contract.  Thanks for reading.	Yes
About 6 months ago, my boss got allowed the request of one of my coworkers to get a cat for the office. I protested and said my wife may be allergic but he/she said that they had always wanted a cat and it was going to happen. It did.   Come to find out, my wife is severely allergic and can tell if the cat has been near me at work. Coincidentally enough, for the first time in my life, I have had allergies that have really hurt my health as I have preexisting conditions that affect what medicine I can take. I am considering getting a allergy test and if the results are positive for cats, then show it to the boss with a request we no have a cat.  What can I do? Should I just say I will only work from home.	Yes
I was recently passed over for a job at state agency. The choice was between myself, who I believe to be well-qualified for the position, and another individual, who did not meet the minimum qualifications to apply for the job, but is a friend of the person in charge of hiring for the position.   Of course, I will not take any formal action, as I have a professional reputation to protect. But I do have a long-standing professional/personal relationship with the person who was in charge of hiring, so I am considering asking for a private meeting to discuss how I feel that the hiring practice was unethical and seems to be based on personal relationships and not professional qualifications.   My question is, despite being unethical, is there anything illegal about this situation? How was this competitor even able to make it past the screening process without the minimum education and certifications? Surely there should be safeguards in place at the state HR office to prevent individuals in positions of power from hiring friends versus hiring for merit?	Yes
Hi!  I work for a company in Philadelphia. I'm salaried and paid every two weeks. Last pay period the checks were delayed a week and when I received my check I noticed NO taxes were taken out. The amount of the check was for my take home pay. I complained and a few days later the proper check was issued with my salary and taxes taken out to give me the take home pay amount. At the same time, other employees paychecks have bounced. Now, again, my paycheck is delayed.  I want to quit this job and get my owed paycheck, plus the paycheck for the last week I worked.  I plan on quitting today or tomorrow because as of now I've worked three weeks for free and my boss doesn't seem like he's going to pay me.   How can I go about attempting to legally collect my owed pay?	Yes
I was working at a stadium tonight, and at the end of the night it turns out the till was down. After this the security guard searched me, he searched my pockets (no issues so far), then after nothing was found he asked me to remove my bra and lift it up and shake it (with my top still on of course), I felt weird doing this but was tired and wanted to go home so I did it and after I did it the guard seemed seemed really awkward. This took place behind a fridge behind the bar so no customers could see, but the person behind the other bar would be able to see if he looked over. This feels pretty weird to me and I've never experienced this before, I'm not looking to sue or anything but is searching like this (especially by a member of the opposite sex) allowed? If not I'll bring it up to my supervisor tomorrow.	Yes
"Hey, I am currently employed in a 8:45 -4:30 job at a summer camp as a ""seasonal employee, or so I've been told, I'm paid $6.25 for this, which is well below the New York minimum wage, however I've also been told that due to my seasonal status this does not apply.  Is this true and does it apply to my current job?    Thanks."	Yes
My workplace is a secured facility, accessible only with a key card. Every employee is issued one of these. However, if you forget your card or lose it, you have to pay $10 for a new one should be issued to you, regardless of whether or not you actually needed a replacement. For employee such as myself who lives 45 minutes from work, going back home to retrieve my badge would incur an absence for the day. Basically, I'm forced to pay $10 to work, or to take a hit on my attendance. Is this legal? I feel as if it's discriminating against employees who have a larger commute.	Yes
*If this should have been posted elsewhere please let me know of the other subreddit*  Hi reddit! I work in a currently non-unionized organisation, and there have been talk of changing the situation. We have many different work team, and most employees are ok with the idea. However, my working team (the smallest) has not yet been approached by the union representative. I have an appointment with the representative tomorrow, to learn more and to eventually discuss the matter with my fellow employees.  Having never been unionized, I don't quite know what to expect. Am I placing myself in a dangerous position by meeting the representative? What are the questions I should ask, the information I should require from him? How can I verify if the promises he makes can become reality? As far as I know he can promise all the things he wants, as long as the negotiation process hasnt begun nothing can be taken too seriously right?  Reddit, help me out!  *I am located in Canada (Quebec), if that helps*	Yes
I accepted a small gift from a vendor that provides resources to the public company I work for with the gift being worth about $5. This was an informal chance meeting where the vendor was throwing a mixer and I recognized them, we talked for a bit and they then gave me that gift which I took without even thinking about it. Apparently someone reported this to my company because HR is now calling me in for multiple sessions of intense questioning. I have no authority at my job, I'm just a lower level cog with nobody under me and no purchasing power.   Am I looking at jail-time or a felony? That's what they hinted at in the meetings.	Yes
Have a legal issue i need to research (this is not related to me, but a project I have) and since i have not yet studied worker's compensation i would like some advice how to begin my research (I have access to Westlaw and Lexis)  A client was receiving worker's compensation, and died in 2010.  The settlement in his case was around $75,000.  The worker's compensation carrier asserted a lien with the client's law firm for $220,000.    Does the client's firm have to honor that lien, will the firm be liable, or will the client's estate be liable.    How would the lien holder try to enforce the lien?  Rather than giving me a straight answer, i would like only advice how to begin the research (ie key words, maybe the applicable statute, etc)  This is a learning experience for me so i do not want the answer handed to me.	Yes
So at my job, we make deliveries and my employer pools and distributes our delivery tips based on the number of hours we work. We share a company car for these deliveries, and one of my coworkers got caught by an automated speed enforcement camera and the $100 ticket was sent to our boss. Apparently we have received a ticket before (I, along with a couple of my other corkers, have no knowledge of this) and it was paid for by the company. This time, our boss is upset about it and wants to pay for the ticket out of our pooled tips. This can't be legal, can it?  Additional info: * We have never been informed about this policy (until now), nor have we signed any sort of agreement. * We can tell exactly who was in the car when we got the ticket based on the ticket's timestamp and info on our delivery service's app, which shows delivery times and the driver...so a lot of us find it unfair that we are all paying for it, even though it isn't a huge sum of money split amongst us.	Yes
Hi, I've been contracting full-time for a local firm. Recently they hired a new contractor who insists that they, their, and they're be used as the person's pronouns. The person also does not want to be referred to as man, or guy.   Though I don't mind trying to use said pronouns, it got me wondering about the legal rights an individual has to insist on using specific pronouns in a work environment. NYC if it makes a difference.	Yes
Almost a year ago I contacted a housekeeping company on Craigslist. I will change names here, let's call the owners of the company Viktor and Svetlana.  Svetlana sent a cleaning lady to my apartment, we will call her Vera. Vera does a fantastic job, we like her a lot. She is very sweet and meek and deferential. She comes every other week or so as needed, we have a tiny apartment, she charges $60 and I add $10 as a tip for a total of $70, I make out a check to Vera directly every time she comes. She cleans the whole 550 sq. ft. apartment including the dishes.  Vera does not speak basically any English at all, so anything I have to say I have to communicate through Svetlana by text message. I have never met Viktor or Svetlana, but I text them to arrange cleaning or if I have some request for Vera. I have the suspicion that Svetlana may be a bit stern or mean to Vera.  This summer Vera started bringing her girls. The girls are out of school and are helping her clean. Usually I am not home when she comes, so I didn't notice at first, but I worked from home one morning and she had brought her daughter, and then another time I noticed that she has two daughters she sometimes brings. The girls are very sweet and always smiling and pleasant.   I am not certain of the age of the girls, but they are both teenagers. The older one is probably 16-17, the younger may be 14-15.  I don't know what to do.  My concerns:  - We like Vera and her girls a lot. I actually used to clean apartments myself when I was in college full-time and I can't imagine doing it as a single mother. She seems like a great mom with happy girls and we are not judging her or wanting to get her in trouble, I am confident that she is making the best choices she can for her girls. Whatever I do I do not want to make life harder for her or her girls.  - I don't know how old the girls are or if they are being compensated fairly. I can't ask Vera about this because she knows so little English she is nearly mute. I could ask Svetlana, but I don't know how much I trust Svetlana, I have never even met her.  - I have no idea how many hours a week the girls are working, I don't know how many homes Vera cleans. It seems she only brings her girls occasionally and only since the summer began, she brings the older one more often I think.  So I guess my question is, how do I know whether this arrangement is legal? Am I violating child labor laws? How do I remedy this situation in a way that is best for Vera and her girls?	Yes
"I posted last week about being laid off due to suggesting that I wouldn't be returning after maternity leave. The gist was that my work provides childcare at a cost, the cost is daily, not as needed. This drops my income down to minimum wage and if I am out sick or take a vacation, it's below minimum wage. I simply can not afford their childcare at my wage. I expressed these financial concerns to my boss and less than a week later, I was given a date that my employment would change form full time (40 hours) to ""on call."" I was told by commenters that they were within their rights to lay me off and due to the size of the company, they don't have to comply with FMLA and PDA.  **Current issue**: Since I've been told that I will be laid off at the end of the month, the work place has been... difficult. I received a formal write-up for a small mistake in which my boss stated that she never writes people up but she *has* to write me up. I've been ""spoken to"" twice regarding my behavior while working before today. Today alone, I was spoken to regarding multiple issues ""I created."" The environment has officially gone from stressful to toxic.   Our workload has been light all week and the boss has been sending people home. I offered to go home today *if* she was cutting again. According to her, it was beyond my authority to request this. Despite my lack of authority, she decided I *could* go home and she approached me to ask if I wanted my full lunch break, a short lunch break or no lunch break. I decided on no lunch break but said ""I need to pop into my room to grab a snack to eat."" She took this as ""I need to go somewhere to get a snack, I'll take a short lunch."" We were obviously on two different pages but did not realize. The person who was sent to break me was incredibly irritated when I was confused, my boss ran into the room I was in while I was dealing with a child and yelled at me ""Do I just need to lay you off today?"" I said no, I just want to do my job. She took me outside to continue to lecture me about how I keep calling shots that aren't mine to call. I told her that I just want to do my job and I try to be easy to deal with and I'm sorry she feels this way, I'll try to stop.  I'm just so lost and confused because I work hard, I show up on time and there is so clearly a personality issue between me and the boss and I can't figure out why I am being targeted for doing the same thing everyone else does. I say yes to every task they ask of me and every time there's been an issue, it's because I'm asking for clarification or support and that's the wrong thing to do. I'm not even comfortable requesting support to go use the restroom and I'm pregnant and have to go frequently. I almost feel crazy at this point.  Ok, work vomit over. I want to quit now. I have evidence that I am going from a full time employee to an on-call employee with no shifts for the first two weeks of feb. My husband claims I can file due to constructive dismissal. After today, I don't want to go back (even after saying I would while my boss was yelling at me). I'm already worried the constructive dismissal would not be enough to be eligible, especially when I *do* have shifts on the book. I want to be able to decline those shifts and still collect due to the environment. I am also concerned these new complaints against my alleged behavioral issues will mean I'm not eligible. If I quit and present my case, is this enough? Should I continue to work for the next 2 weeks? Thanks  **tl;dr** Boss is mean, I'm already laid off for a future date. I want to leave now but I keep getting in trouble. I need an income badly."	Yes
I am posting this for a friend who does not use reddit in the hopes that someone here can possibly give some guidance since he asked me but it is not in my field.   He is an assistant to the founder of a national restaurant chain and handles a lot of the farming technology management as well as some other specific design projects for the owner himself. He and some of the other employees that do not have very defined roles and work closely with the owner were just asked to sign paperwork basically to cover the company saying they would not talk about specific ways the company does things, their emails and messages were company property, etc. At the end it gives an option to add any amendments and my friend would like to put something in saying that if he comes up with any new inventions or designs that the company profits off of that he get a share or have some sort of claim.  1. Is the reasonable? 2. If so, what should this language look like? 3. Are there any questions I should be asking?  Thank you in advance and please let me know what other information would be helpful and I will ask him.	Yes
I was an employee for a major silicon valley company. This was a remote position. I was recently terminated from my job just one week after making a request to have Sundays off to observe the Sabbath (I am a member of the LDS church).  The reasons for my firing were very shady. There was no final warning. Unemployment reviewed my case and decided that the company was in the wrong. I was hence awarded benefits.   I decided to appeal my termination with the company. An HR rep finally called me back today to discuss the matter. I told the rep that while working for the company- shortly before getting fired- I was asked by my team manager which faith/denomination I belonged to and where specifically I went to church. The HR rep informed me that this was perfectly legal for my team manager to ask of me. I knew this was false.   I honestly believe now that I was fired because of my faith.   The good news is that I had the HR rep email me this same response in writing. They wrote that its standard for managers to ask 'clarifying questions' when making schedule changes such as I had requested.   Everything I've seen online flies in the face of what this HR rep is telling me.   Do I have a strong case for discrimination? Would I win a suit?	Yes
"I’m moving for a job. My future employer has given me a set amount for relocation reimbursement, but I need to submit receipts. Per my contract, I will have to do a partial payback to my current employer (didn’t stay the specified time). Ideally it would be nice to use some of the moving stipend to pay off my current employer.   Here are my questions:  1.	Can I set up an LLC moving company and hire my own company to move me? And then submit the invoice? I would rent a moving truck and then use family/friends help. 2.	What is the legality of this? If I can’t set it up under my name, can a family member set it up for me?  If it’s legal:  1.	How difficult would this be to do? Could I use Legalzoom or something similar to set up the LLC? Would there be any other costs? 2.	How hard would this make taxes? 3.	Is it worth it?  Thanks for your help. Throwaway account for obvious reasons."	Yes
"Hi, Don't know if this belongs here but here we go. I'm a teenager and I work at a sailing camp during the summers. There's maybe 15 of us in total and this is my second summer working along with 4 of my other co workers. Last year I racked in almost 300 volunteer hours, wasn't payed a single cent just as the rest of us were. We worked those hours because we were under the common assumption that we would be paid the next year as had been explained to us at the beginning of last year. At the beginning of this season our boss explained that she was looking for everyone to have reached a certain certification level to keep working. 4 out of around 15 people received that ""degree"". We were just notified that we might have to take this year as another training year... Yet there are multiple counselors being paid who have not taken the course. No way I'm working another year as a volunteer... What can we do?"	Yes
I currently work in Minnesota. I have both personal and vacation hours that can be used for whatever reason. I recently accepted a position at a different company and was told by my current employer that I owed $870.00 in overused vacation hours.   What I realized was that even though we have access to the entire year's vacation as of January 1st each year, we earn them by accruing them throughout the year. I currently have gone over in vacation from what I have earned at this point in the year by 35 hours. I am a non-exempt employee.  The frustrating part is that I currently have 89 hours of unused personal time that will just be lost. My employer has informed me that our payroll system does not allow personal and vacation days to be switched after being processed. I have been asked to initial a document to allow me last paycheck to be garnished for the $870.00. If I do not sign it, the company has the right to take legal action to recoup the funds.   Is this common? If I do not sign it is it likely that legal action will occur? I understand that I should have researched the company policies beforehand, I am just disappointed that I have so many personal hours that I could have used instead. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
I work for a small incorporated laboratory in Washington state. On Friday we were called into a meeting and told that the company has been sold to a larger laboratory. The new company is headquartered about 40 minutes south, and they will be closing our laboratory completely.   The new company has been acting as if we are now employees of their business, however we have received our final paychecks from our old employer including our accrued vacation time. We have been told that any accrued time is being set back to 0 with the new company. In addition, we are being asked to interview for the new company and sign new employment contracts. We were told that they do not need all of the current staff.  My question is in regards to my employment status. I feel as if I have been terminated from my original position, however I have not been told this directly. I'm unsure of if I qualify for unemployment, and if I am required to continue to show up for work at the new company or if that is considered voluntarily quitting (can I even quit a job I don't technically have?). My current employment contract states that I am entitled to severance pay if I am discharged. However, I don't know if I have been.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated! I've been having difficulty finding any law advice online for this specific circumstance.	Yes
While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell.   I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home.   My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with. While I was at the ER, I told them it was a work related incident and to contact my employer. I received a bill for a little over $500 and promptly handed it to my general manager. I have now received another for a lowered amount, $267. When I received the bill for $267, I sent it to my employer with a note asking what we needed to do to take care of this and haven't heard anything.   I no longer work there because I accepted a position for an internship in another city. What legal obligation do I have to pay the remainder? I don't want it to go to collections, but I don't feel responsible for paying it, either. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have gone to the ER at all. What is the best course of action?  TD;LR: got Tilex in eyes at work, boss sent me to ER, stuck with bill.	Yes
Hello legaladvice peeps,  In 2016, I worked for a smallish tech company with a whole host of problems, including sexual harassment, unequal pay given to employees with the same responsibilities, internal nepotism, etc etc. I was asked by a journalist to speak on these problems, in particular about how several employees banded together to bargain for an HR representative and equal pay for the same work.   I spoke to the journalist already, but I've negotiated anonymity and am debating going on-record. The thing is, I signed an NDA, and I'm not sure if it's enforceable in this instance. I can send a copy of it privately if you're curious. But this article will come out within the time period specified by the NDA (2 years). My question is, can an NDA protect against claims of employer retaliation? AFAIK, that's not a business strategy, intellectual property, or anything of the like. It's just how I was treated by my employer, and as far as I can tell, collective bargaining is a federally protected action.  Anyway, any help would be appreciated, here.	Yes
Sorry, I accidentally deleted my last post.   Hey, y'all. Any employee law information you can give me, either state (Indiana) or federal (US), as well as any advice on resolving any legal matters as quickly as I possibly can would be greatly appreciated!  So, since I teach during the school year, I have employment over the summer with a summer camp. I signed no contract with my employers after receiving the job offer - only an employment application and information for payroll. I accepted the job on the premise that I would be paid an hourly wage as I did last year for the same job, but I was told after approximately a week of work that I would be paid a flat rate of $450/week.   The new year also came with some new rules for the camp counselors. We cannot leave the campus without permission, and can only leave for 2 hours at night, one-at-a-time between 11PM-1AM. We were also told that we would be getting overtime pay, and if we worked overtime, to log it on the final week of the payroll cycle in which we will only be present on campus for 1 of the 7 days.   On another note, I was offered a better position at this camp initially, and then they took the offer back to give it to another candidate after I had already made living arrangements for the summer. But I'm not sure that I can prove this/it will hold up in court.   • Since I am required to be present unless given permission and am only allowed 2 hours per night off campus with that permission, does this mean that I am on call 24 hours? If so, can I be paid for the hours that I am not necessarily actively doing something since I am essentially required to just be around?   • Is keeping me here for a month with no release okay? How can I get some time away from here if I want to see family or when I have to move my permanent residence in 2 weeks?   • Do I have a case against my employer for not paying overtime and asking us to alter our time sheets even though this was discussed in a private meeting and there is no written record?   • Can the camp be liable for my expenses since they took back a job offer after I made living arrangements? Again, I'm not really sure I can prove this part.   • Who do I report the above issues to, and how long will it feasibly take to get fixed? Is it possible to resolve some of these issues within a couple of weeks or will I be toughing it out until the end of the camp?	Yes
"Context:    My coworker (we'll call him Steve) has a 17 year old son. Steve's neighbor is a pretty old crotchety guy (We'll call him OCG) and likes to make noise complaints. OCG even said so to Steve when Steve first moved in. OCG complained to Steve once in person and Steve says to let him know any time he has any problems with noise so he may deal with his son (who may be loud at times because he is 17 years old). He also happens to mention he works at a medium sized company in town (We'll call it McCompany). OCG rents from the property management department in McCompany. Steve does not work in this department, however.     The next time OCG decides to complain he goes to the property management department of McCompany and asks the manager to mention this to Steve through his employer connections. Steve tells this to me because he found it weird. Steve also finds out that OCG had tried to file a complaint with the police.   What Happened Today:  OCG decided to visit McCompany's HR department, introduced himself as Steve's neighbor and asked where Steve works because ""He just wants to say 'Hi'"". The HR girl happily leads him into our office, then HR girl pops in and asks where Steve is and I casually mention he was out for some personal stuff and will be back shortly. That's when she mentions to me ""His neighbor is here to say 'Hi'.""  What I'd like to know:  Is what HR girl did illegal? If so, would this law be publicly available for me to read or show to them? (Hopefully with more laws they probably do not abide.) What could my coworker or myself do about this? I really don't feel like my information is safe within the hands on our HR department.  Any help or even a point in the right direction would help and I would be greatly appreciative."	Yes
"I work at a car dealership in MS, US. We work monday-Friday 45hrs a week. Once a year we work on Saturday to do ""inventory"". We basically count stuff and clean the whole building. The owner pays us cash (usually amounting to around $11/hr). I am hourly and i do not receive time and a half. We don't clock in and the money never goes to our check. He hands us cash.  Is this legal?"	Yes
So I worked at the Cotton Patch for about 3 weeks before they fired me because it's brand new and they hired too many people. Our first pay check was training, we made minimum wage during this time, so the company took the liberty of making us pay $35.00 for two shirts and an apron. Fast forward to my boss firing me for a random reason and asking for the uniform back before my next paycheck. I was so confused about why I was fired that I didn't think to ask if I'd be reimbursed. Do I have the right to ask for the money back and are they obligated to give it to me? Surely, it just opened and they already want it back...	Yes
"Posting for a friend.   Said friend is working at a certain Melville-themed Coffeeshop, and after a particularly Melvillian day received a call from the manager saying that his register was over $200 short.   Now, ""officially"", according to their training, only one person can use each till at a time. However, there's quite a bit of corner-cutting at this location, with other partners jumping on one another's tills to cover each other during breaks, fixing orders, and so on. Then there's the cash drops--large bills are ""supposed"" to go in specific lockboxes assigned to each register, except when it's 6am it's easy to forget which one's yours.  And then there's the fact that my friend is kinda just plain crap at his job--which would probably explain a shortfall of twenty or thirty dollars, but not the hundreds.   Anyway, the questions:  1. Can the store deduct from his paycheck or tips to recover the shortfall?  2. Is the absence of money sufficient evidence to accuse someone of stealing? If so, what can be done to prevent that, besides the usual advice of shutting and lawyering, respectively, up?"	Yes
"I am a certified teacher and was offered a position teaching at a performance arts summer camp for 5 weeks for 2k. I could bring my child so it was really ideal for summer pay. Since taking the position, basically everything has turned out to be a lie. I was supposed to teach Pre-K. Instead I'm teaching PreK-2nd grade all in one classroom.  Okay cool, part of being a teacher is being flexible and making it work- I can do that. Also the number of campers was supposed to be 100, and instead there's 45 at best. We're also in a low socioeconomic area in my city where many of the parents just haven't paid and we're finishing week 3.  Payday is supposed to be this Friday with half of my pay due. I wasn't feeling very confident about her reliability with paying so I asked her today. She basically said she doesn't have it but has around 1/3 of it. Meanwhile we started with around 6 teachers and are now down to only 2 because everyone else has quit or was told the camp was ""closing"" because basically she couldn't afford to pay them.  If she doesn't pay Friday, I'm done. Both myself and the other remaining teacher will not be returning if she doesn't pay us. I've been flexible with a smile on my face and she's so worried about a final performance that it's literally trumping the fact that half the kids in the main roles haven't even paid to come to camp. What are my next steps to get paid if she can't pay us on Friday?  I'm also super frustrated because on the 4th she actually text me and said she was sorry but camp was closing (in reality she knew she couldn't afford to pay me). Then proceeded to ask me to come back 2 days later after I had asked my previous place of employment if I could be added to their schedule a few days a week. So now I feel like a fool but I really love the kids... help! :(  Tldr; I've been teaching at a camp that has basically turned out to be complete lies. I've taught for 3 weeks and now that we're nearing 1/2 of the pay days she ""doesn't know if she can come up with it"". What are my next steps if she says she can't pay me?"	Yes
My employer has decided they dont have to pay us overtime. They said they dont have to pay it since they are a family owned restaurant and dont employ enough people. Is this true or are they just making it up to rip us off.	Yes
"Hello /r/legaladvice,  I work for a privately owned retail chain you may of heard of in the news recently, and we've come under new store management at our outlet here in San Diego county. While I accepted this manager with an open mind and hope, she's done nothing but demoralize my fellow co-workers. She seems to be incapable of separating numbers on a spreadsheet from human beings, but I digress. To keep this succinct, let me jump into actions she's taken and the California labor codes I believe she's broken.  I'm aware of multiple employees she's disciplined for ""excessive absences"". She gave a write-up to one of our pregnant employees who was absent for 3 consecutive days for scabies (a highly contagious and uncomfortable skin disease caused by an infestation of insects **burrowing** into your skin), despite proper documentation from a doctor. She gave a write-up to an employee for missing work due to a family emergency. She gave a write-up to an employee for absences that were clerical errors (she had switched shifts with another employee and had it manager sanctioned, but they marked her absent *by mistake*). The list goes on, and she's expressed plans to reprimand more. Although I myself have not had anything done unjust to myself, likely because I'm leaving soon, I can no longer stand by and let this happen.  I've done my research, and I believe this violates California Labor Code § [233](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=233) &amp; [234](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=LAB&amp;sectionNum=234) (tl;dr: an employer can't discipline an employee for sick time off if they don't exceed what they've been allocated by the company, and none of my aforementioned instances have done that). Since this happened to so many and will likely happen to more, it would be difficult to spread this knowledge to everyone verbally. So my plan is to arm my co-workers *en masse*. I intend to print these labor codes and covertly post them in the break-room with the title: ""Have you been punished for absences lately? This may interest you:"". I'm quite sure it'll be taken down very quickly, but I trust the rumor mill and a few backup copies should cover this.  So my question is; am I understanding these labor laws correctly, and what do you think? I am also open to suggestions of all sorts, as well as opinions on how I'm going about this.  It should also be mentioned, I'm sure they'll suspect me. My co-workers (and managers) have grown accustom to my taste in mischief/shenanigans, and often turn to me first when something of the sort has happened. They are almost always correct in doing so. Although I don't intend to admit to doing this, my employer is an ""at will"" company."	Yes
"Quick summary because this has a long explanation: I was not paid for 20+ hours of work for a restaurant, under the guise of it being a ""working interview.""  I live in VA.  Is this legal?  It's been one year since the interview happened, is it too late to do anything about it?   BACKGROUND:  Last year, I had interest in applying to a local (and highly praised) burger shop, just working in the kitchen making burgers, cleaning tables, etc.  The people that own this shop also own an extremely popular fancy restaurant.  I'm serious.  Everything that comes out of that kitchen looks like food porn.  All the people that eat there take pictures of their food when it comes out. And it's crazy expensive, all produce they use is local and they change their menu all the time based on what is available during the season or whatever.  So anyways, I am told that I have to complete 2 ""working"" interviews for these sister restaurants.  One at the burger place, one at the fancy place.  Each one had different tasks, for example the burger place did things I described earlier whereas fancy restaurant involved bussing tables, sorting silverware, etc.  Also, as you can probably tell, the fancy restaurant was a much more stressful environment and all the people that work there are pretty much professional chefs or adults.  There were a few other teens, (I was 16 at this time), but being surrounded by all these people was definitely intimidating.  More so than the laid back but still busy burger shop.  Right.  So I finish my working interview at burger shop.  I worked open to close, roughly 10 hours.  I completed the exact amount of work as the other people working that day, and was probably working 10x harder than them, considering the whole point was to demonstrate how well I worked, so I wanted to do a good job.  End of the day, I don't get paid except for splitting tips, which probably amounted to around $7.  The manager of burger shop tells me I will most likely be hired but it is ultimately up to people who own both places to decide.  I then work another ~10 hour shift at the fancy restaurant.  Now, people working here (well at the position I was applying for) are bussing tables and thus get paid below minimum wage but split tips to compensate, and with each table having bills averaging over $300, this adds up relatively well.  I did not get paid this day either, but they added me on to a list of other people bussing that night, so I assumed I would get the same tips they did? Never got those either.  Figured maybe after I was officially hired I would get them.  The end of the day, the chefs at the restaurant give me a mini interview, said I worked well, and they would give me a call.  They also said that they are known to be lazy and not call people and they ""like to see persistance"" i.e. me calling them and pestering them to give me the job if they don't call me within a week. Eye roll.  I'd like to add that this was not a competitive interview, I performed extremely well and wasn't competing against anyone else for the position.  These people literally just could not be bothered to call me.  They wanted to see me reach out. Also, I was applying to burger shop, but they had me work at both places because (very rarely) they will have people that typically work at one place work the other for a shift depending on scheduling and such.  So the fact that I worked 20+ hours with no pay is extremely annoying to me and I almost feel like that place just uses it to get free labor out of people which is off-putting considering how successful the business is and it almost seems like a bullying situation(for lack of better way to describe it.).  I ended up trying to contact the owners of the restaurant like told to (said to text her) and I didn't even get any reply, which I thought was rude.  If I didn't get the job, at least tell me.  At that point I stopped bothering to reach out just due to how disgusted I was by the people that ran the business.  I looked up if working interviews are legal in VA and from what I can tell you're required to be paid.  I would've pressed the matter if I had known this, but I was so excited at the prospects of a new job for this successful place that I sort of overlooked it.  Now, one year has gone by and I am actually kind of salty and realize how ""abusive"" they were. I feel taken advantage of. The problem is, it's one year later.  Am i too late to try and get any payment out of this? I feel stupid for not doing anything about it sooner but was wondering if I can now."	Yes
Hi All,  So apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, but I wasn't sure where else to turn, and didn't know if I had any legal options here.  So in a nutshell, I've been with my company for just over 3 and a half years. During that time I've had a few pay rises, but nothing too dramatic - started on £20k, year later £24k, year later £28k. I know that sounds like quite big jumps, but I've gone above and beyond for these guys - worked loads of (unpaid) hours of overtime, and considering how much I do for them, it's low for what I should be paid (many of my colleagues have told me this).  So it came to the time of year for the meeting I have to discuss my future/salary. Only this time they say they can't pay me any increase, due to changes at the company. Instead, they say they'll offer 'profit share' to us. What this meant, was a small percentage of our profits would come to me every quarter, this worked out to about £800/quarter. So not a great deal, but better than nothing. I tell them I'm invested in the company, I want to be here for the long haul, and if they can't offer me money, I'd be more than happy to take share options in the company. They didn't give me an answer on this.  Fast forward 6 months - we're told the company is being bought out. I organise a meeting to stress that I'm really due a pay rise (or share options) and stress that I don't want to start at the new place on a low salary, as that'll make me seem like a low level employee to them. They say they can't do anything until we start at the new place.   At the new place, they say we're all going to keep our jobs, and the salary will be in line with what we've had before. I'm offered £29k (so a £1k increase). Not great. My title changes from Production Manager to 'Creative Accountant Executive') - which does also feel like a step down. I'm told we'll have a meeting in the coming weeks to discuss this all, but I'm eating fed up of waiting by this point.  Anyway, we start a the new place. It's pretty cool, much the same as my last place, exact same kind of job, with some new duties. I go down the pub that night to discuss how it was for my colleagues, and they tell me something interesting - they were all offered share options in the new company (shares at a discounted cost). They got offered more depending on seniority, and if they didn't want to take them, they were offered a bonus. Admittedly, I'm the youngest of them  - the next oldest colleague has been with them just over 5 years. But he was offered in the region of £50k. Which seems a lot. Maybe I'm missing something,I don't claim to know all the details -  but should I not have been even considered for this? Do I have any legal precedent to stand on? Please advise, any help much appreciated.	Yes
"Hi, I just got hired at a bar a couple of weeks ago, and I was asked to sign an employment contract that contained a couple of clauses that I'm a bit apprehensive about. I've worked at many bars and restaurants over the years and I've never had to sign anything like this before, and I'm just wondering what other folks might think before I sign the contract.   The things that stood out to me were: - ""Probation: The first six months of employment are a probationary period during which Employer may, in its sole discretion and for any reason, terminate employment without further compensation, notice, pay in lieu of notice, and severance"". I assume this part is probably legal, but I don't find comfort in knowing that I could be terminated for any reason without notice for the first six months... - ""Confidential Information - you will not at any time divulge, disclose, or communicate to any individual, person, firm, corporation, partnership, or business entity of any time, any information concerning any matter affecting or relating to Employer's enterprise, including business records, business events, daily matters, marketing, operations procedures, passwords, food and beverage development and recipes, menu development, and any financial or business affairs connected thereto. Any breach of this provision causes irreparable harm to Employer, and automatically entitles Employer to, among other remedies, any injunctions required to prevent or restrain such breach by you or any of your partners, co-venturers, employers, employees, servants, agents, representatives, and any other persons or entities acting for or on your behalf.

"Title, basically. It's unlikely, but in the event that I get fired, how can I possibly prove it was due to me transitioning?

Hello Everyone,  I got a new contract for a job in UK, everything seems fine except one clause which I think is very vaguely defined.  &gt;During your employment you will not be employed, engaged, &gt;interested or concerned in any activity, office or outside business &gt;interests (whether paid or unpaid) without the written consent of &gt;the Executive Management team.   &gt;You will disclose in writing to the Executive Management team &gt;any such activities, offices or outside business interests you may &gt;currently have and in the event that the Executive Management &gt;team requires you to cease the same, you will do so forthwith.  &gt;For the avoidance of doubt consent will not be given in relation &gt;to any activities, offices or business interests which in the view of &gt;the Executive Management team, are similar to, or compete &gt;directly or indirectly with the business of the Company or which &gt;could in the view of the Executive Management team, give rise to &gt;a conflict of interest or interfere with the efficient performance of &gt;your duties.  However, such consent will not be unreasonably &gt;withheld.   As far as I understand if I haven't misunderstood it. They potentially can forbid me to do any sort of work, even volunteering for example for a local shelter.  Anyway, my main issue is that I already own a business which is in a completely unrelated field to the employment, hence I'm concerned.  I was wondering what do you gents/gals think about this clause, and would modifying the first sentence with something like this would help?  &gt;that may harm the interests of the Company, interfere with the &gt;Employee’s work time or to a not insubstantial extent occupy the &gt;Employee’s manpower.

My grammar is terrible so I apologize in advance.   So i just recently left my job because of many reasons. The other people there and myself have always notice that sometimes our checks have been a little off. Some times they seem short. So far it has not been more then comments and that is it.   Today i got my check and it looked weird, i looked at all the itemized info like any check, and the numbers looked off. So i went through with a calculator and when i took the gross pay-net pay, then i take that difference and subtract all of the things being taken out: taxes, etc. And there is still an amount left over.... but there is no place for it on the itemized section. I looked back on my other checks and same thing, all different amounts, anywhere  from $20- $80  I called a girl that quit right after me. She looked hers over, and the same thing. Some of hers didnt even have the itemized section of what was taken out.   Am i crazy or is this weird.	Yes
Myself and fellow employees at my place of work have requested time off in writing for doctor visits, family time, etc.  We all received approval, in writing, from the company owner. Is it fair and legal practice for our employer to penalize us by putting negative points in our employee record with the company and then write us up for it?  We have all discussed this at length and agree that this is unfair and ethically wrong. Good and loyal employees are being penalized for trying to take care of themselves (doc appts, etc) and they are so fed up with the backwards system our business uses that they are looking for work elsewhere. What our employer is doing is entrapment to the point where we are afraid to even ask for time off, for fear of disciplinary action if we have too many points on our record according to the owner and his HR manager, who also happens to be his wife. This severely hinders our ability to take care of our own health, our families, and other personal responsibilities that need addressed. The owner is known to also have legitimate mental issues and he often creates a hostile work environment by being rude, condescending, lashing out verbally and belittling the employees, to their face and behind their back to the rest of us. There are a myriad of problems within this workplace, but we would like to start with the above mentioned issues at the moment.  Please, any advice or referrals for our options legally would be much appreciated.	Yes
Occasionally the safe will be short at work. Last night it was short $100. The GM said that since they have no way of knowing who did it each employee who worked yesterday must hand over $15 or else they will be terminated for theft. Is this legal?    Edit: I am in Arkansas	Yes
So I worked for a pretty decent company for the past 6 years, I was part of particular department (we had 4 staff members and 1 outsourced IT personnel, that we picked up a few months back).   I was brought into the office of my VP this past week and was being told I was laid off, nothing more. I never had a negative review, never had any work performance issues. I was brought in and told my position was being outsourced. Now what has me wondering is, my title was the same as the rest of my team and we all had different responsibilities. They are currently hiring for the team (but as a different title).. and when I brought this up they told me I can put a resume in and if I qualify for the position they would consider me. I am completely livid, they offered me two weeks of severance after 6 years of working there and that is all.   I am located in Long Island, New York. I just don't see how it can be legal to lay me off (I have been in the company the 2nd longest).. when they are hiring for a position under the same supervisor - while having 4 people with the same title - and they state that its because they are outsourcing my position.

Hello... I'm asking for a friend. Here are the details:  She took a scheduled vacation and upon receiving her first paycheck back she saw that her employer only provided her with 16 out of the 40 hours that she was entitled to. She gets paid every week. However, in trying to resolve the matter she was told that she needed to submit a payroll request and she did so. She was told that it can take a few weeks for payroll to correct the issue and if she doesn't see anything on her next few checks to let management know and they'll go from there... This is from their regional manager. She doesn't have the luxury of waiting until they decide to resolve the issue and she's wondering how long her company legally has to replenish her missing compensation.  I already told  her to reach out to HR as well. Located in PA. Thanks!	Yes
I recently quit a debt collection company.  When I was hired roughly 6 months ago they made me sign an employment contract for 1 year with the term that if my employment ceased before the terms of the contract that i would owe the company an amount of money that would diminish over the course of the contract. I just got my final paycheck and it has a letter saying that I still owe them an amount to buy-out my contract and gives the remaining amount due.   The letter also says that authorized per the employment agreement and allowed by federal and state laws, that they reduced my pay for the final 2 paychecks to minimum wage and applied to the amount I owed (they sent both of my final pay periods on once check for some reason or another)  I was wondering what I should do next and if this contract itself has any legal weight. I asked when signing the contract and upon leaving if I could see or get a copy of the contract and I was denied.  So as to the specifics of the contract I'm not really sure what it says. I also know that employers can garnish your wages but I though they had to notify you and go through the legal process first.  I live in the state of Nebraska  (This is my first post so please be gentle)	Yes

"I deposited a paycheck last Tuesday (6/4) and ~$300 was deposited and the remainder was pending. The next day I went to buy gas and was denied, I checked my account and I was in the negative. My bank statement said the deposit was on hold and details would be mailed to me physically. I called my bank and they told me the other bank would not verify the transaction even after several attempts. Then after pushing them further they stated that they had confidential information about my employer's account and couldn't tell me anything, but that there was a very high chance that the deposit would be returned unpaid. I called my employer and they informed me that my bank has my funds and that I need to ""tell them to release the funds from the hold"". That sounds like it wont work and I am not sure who is telling the truth. I really need the money, I was not able to pay my bills on time this month and only have ~$200 in my account.

Hi Reddit,  This week alone I worked and average of 36 hours and 32 minutes. When I got my check it was unreasonably low and when I checked my Paycor account, it says I only have 16 hours worked?   This happens often at my work place, but hours aren't drastically cut like they were this time, 19 hours were not accounted for? I'm asking this because when I go in and speak to them about this because I'd like to if this is okay, or what I should say.  L	Yes
So I worked for a pretty big steel fab company, and was terminated because I was arrested (I had a miscarriage and forgot to go to court). Obviously I take responsibility for that. I want to know what to do now. My old boss is going around the town where I live and the town where I work telling everyone I was arrested and quit my job(which I didn't). He's telling bartenders, waitresses, or just talking about me with his friends in public. This is an older executive of the company, and the town is EXTREMELY small to the point where I saw one of the bartenders he told while at shopping and she came up and asked me how I was doing since being arrested. I've had many people come to me and tell me they heard it from him specifically. I believe it's cost me another job with a graphic design company who's president knows him. Is there anything I can do?	Yes
I live in California and my shift starts at 6:00.  Can my employer legally say that I have to call in no later than 5:00?   I can't find anything that specific but so far it doesn't seem like they should be able to say anything as long as I have the sick time available. 	Yes
Like the title says, four years ago I was involved a workplace accident that left metal shards in my chest. I had followed all company protocol and they paid for the surgery to have the metal removed. The surgeon said everything was removed and the surgery went well.  Fast forward four years and I have a chest x-ray for some breathing related issues and guess what, the doctor missed one of the shards. What are my options here? Truly, I just want the metal piece removed, I don't think suing them would be a good idea, but I could be wrong. I was laid off from that job 2 years ago, can I get them to pay for surgery to remove the remaining shard?  Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
"Repost because nobody responded, I could really use some help.  I am currently a student working at a camp, and am in Canada. So we had a training week, in which we worked 35 hours total.   Under the contract, we are to be paid ""A weekly amount $480 will be paid for employment-- not to exceed 40 hours per week."" They said that because we worked 35 hours during training, they can deduct 5 hours of pay. But I interperted that as no matter how much we work, 1hr,10 hr, we get paid 480 a week.   They replied stating another line in the contract: ""Pay will be deducted for days of work missed, for whatever reason, and calculation of said pay will be on a pro rata basis.""   If that was their argument, I was calling bullshit (figuratively) because no day of work was missed, and that line states that you can deduct 96 for every day of work missed (Pro rata).   Can an lawyer be able to confirm that I am under just grounds?"	Yes

Hello,  I was terminated from my job on April 24th this year.  I knew my health insurance was good through June 1st in which case I used it.  Since then, I thought my family was uninsured while I wait for benefits from my new job but I've received an updated insurance card from a new insurance company (Aetna switched to United Health Care) and my wife called them and they did, in fact, say that all of my benefits are active.  I have also never received any termination paperwork or COBRA information in the mail to this day.  My question is can I still use these benefits even though I think the company has no idea that they are paying for them?  (They are an extremely unorganized company with nobody looking over financial matters, so I think I may be slipping through the cracks.)	Yes

I started to work with a startup 3 months ago. They wanted to know my hourly charge and how many hours I am going to work in a week. Then they said they need the app asap, because they are going to release their product within 2/3 months. So I worked overtime and made the app almost usable (according to other fellow devs) within 2 and half months. Now when I asked for my overtime payment, they clearly denied my payment. They did not pay me 3 weeks payment. They did not pay me overtime payments. Then they stopped to communicate with me. Removed me from slack. No reply to my emails. How should I deal with this situation ? I am working as an hourly freelancer from India. This startup is Brooklyn, NY based startup.	Yes
Hello - I am a IT consultant whose business is formed as an LLC in Delaware. I was providing services to a company in NY who further subcontracted me out to a company in NJ.  My question is related to employment at will and deception.   I previously was consulting through my company with a law firm in NYC. I was not challenged enough so I made the decision to move on. The problem is that my decision was based on this new company telling me they had lots of work that would keep me challenged  and that has now turned out to be false.  I signed up to do one thing with the company and after I had started, they completely changed the scope of the project on me and I was doing something I didn't sign up for. Additionally, they told me they just needed me to do this thing first (which I did) and then they would get me going on what actually signed up to do.  That didn't happen, the project ended and I am now sitting here without a job, where as had I known what I was actually walking into, I wouldn't have the made the decision I made and could have still been working where I was or someplace else.   What options do I have here?  I do have sufficient documentation showing what I signed up for.   TLDR: Employment at will I made the decision to leave a company based on false information the new company provided. Project scope and length were completely fabricated. Had I known what I was actually walking into I wouldn't have made the decision I did and I would have still been employed.	Yes
"I am working as a Contractor in Orange, CA and teaching lessons scheduled a couple of weeks in advance. When I tried to quit, my boss told me that I was under contract and still had to teach. I have pasted the two clauses relating to quitting and teaching. It sounds like I still have to teach the previously booked lessons outside of the 14 day quitting notice. I wanted a second opinion on this. Thanks!  ""(b) Either the Contractor or the Company may terminate the Contractor’s provision of the Services under this Agreement for any reason whatsoever, including for convenience, upon giving fourteen (14) calendar days’ written notice to the other party.  (c) Notwithstanding any termination of the Contractor’s provision of the Services for any reason whatsoever, the Contractor shall teach any lessons booked prior to the date on which notice of termination was given, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Company."""

Posting for a friend. Female was Injured on the job at a grocery store due to constant lifting. Coerced into not filing a workers comp case, but has x-rays and a chiropractic visit on record from that time period. The company continues to schedule her for active shifts after hr filing her into a non active shifts which she is unable to do.     On top of this, she makes 12.80 an hour. Less than 20k a year. I was wondering what public assistance she might be able to take advantage of to help stay afloat and any recommendation on legal routes to obtain a lawyer.      Thank you	Yes
Let me start out by saying that I am transgender and I have legally changed my name. I don't quite pass yet. I signed up and started to drive for uber about 2 months ago. Last week my account was suspended indefinitely because a few passengers complained that the name and photo on my account was not the one driving the car. I tried explaining to uber that I'm trans and that I was driving the car. I tried asking uber if they can send a bigger photo to the passengers that complained to verify that I was not driving the car. Is there anything legally that I can do to get unbanned from driving for uber?	Yes
"Long story short: Wife works as an RN in California. She hasn't been getting union dues deducted from her paychecks for quite some time (something I've been on her about checking in with, but I guess she/we are just too busy to rectify the problem.. we do acknowledge that unions are important and thought she just wasn't signed on with hers, not that she wasn't paying the dues).   Nowhere on her paychecks since roughly 2014 has there been a union dues deduction. Recently, she has received a letter from her union stating that they have experienced ""phenomenal growth"" in recent years and that some employees have fallen through the cracks of their antiquated system, thus deductions had stopped for some employees.   With their updated database they've discovered that some people owe money, and we're being told that she now owes more than a thousand dollars in back payments just because this union decided to upgrade a system and discovered they fucked up and weren't deducting people properly.   The document is basically admitting fault here. I called the union myself and discovered that it's basically a mandatory repayment (of course they are going to say that), but that there's ""no due date""... they just want to set up a payment plan.  The rep did say, however, that collections could be involved at a later time if no payments are arranged.   What are my options?  It just seems like an odd move for a union to go about correcting their huge mistake like this.. my wife wants to just blindly pay the amount, but I am extremely hesitant.   Any advice is greatly appreciated."	Yes
I've been seeing several doctors lately and for privacy reasons, I'd rather my employer didn't know about every time I see a doctor.  Can my employer see the times or dates i saw a doctor? What information would they have access to regarding my health or doctor's visits?    Is the simple fact that I visited a doctor considered private under HIPPA? Thanks!	Yes
"I noticed a plummet in sales for this startup company I was interning at. About a month later, my now-former boss fired me (this Monday) with his reason being that I was the reason he experience a net loss when it comes to packaging. However, this is strongly false, as I have suggested many times prior to packaging loss to try better methods of tracking inventory, yet he consistently said he wants to try to make his method work. I told him this, and I also told him that he has been experiencing packaging losses even before I started interning there. He ignored my counters, but answered my question of getting paid by the end of this week. He said ""of course"" I will be. Friday came and I did not receive any notice of payment, so I sent him an email and he has not responded yet. I should have been paid by today, but he has delayed it. Not only am I out of a job (which I am now in the risk of being homeless because my fiancé and I have planned on using our proof of income for our application), but he has not paid me yet.  I should mention that he has talked about renewing my internship contract and extending it until August (it was from Jan to May), but he has never done so.  In the old contract, it said he could terminate me at any time for any reason. However, I wasn't under a contract from May to now.  What can I do?"	Yes
Does anyone have any insight into this at all? Talking about out in the oil fields of North Dakota. What is considered unreasonably long hours and is there any legal action you can take against your employer?  Any info would be much appreciated!	Yes
I work as a waiter in Pembroke Pines, Florida, where minimum wage for someone in my profession is $5.08. My paychecks have been about $35-$40 dollars and i'm definitely working more than 8 hours. I know that if an employee doesn't meet the hourly mark in declared tips  the company makes up the difference. But does it work the other way around? if i'm declaring tips which reach or exceed the appropriate hourly mark are they allowed to cut into my hourly paycheck and give me less than $5?	Yes
I haven't actually called him out on it as of yet. If he does not agree with my discrepancy is there any legal action I could take? Seems like a classic bait and switch to me.   Craiglist ad is directly linked to his work email. I took screen shots. 	Yes
Hello good people of Reddit, quick question about taking time off of your salary. Say if you work half a day and take off half a day can your employer deduct PTO for that half day or are you supposed to treated as you were there all day?	Yes
Im designing a prototype for a friend who will be producing a larger unit (using my prototype as a controller) and selling it on the open market. I will be paid for this, but I'm getting cold feet. I want to make sure that I'm protected should anything occur with the end unit and the user of said unit would want to sue. Is there any documentation or processes I should do to ensure that I'm not at fault and this whole thing come crashing down on me should anything happen?	Yes
I am a 16 year old living in Virginia.  My boss has me working 12 hour shifts with no breaks. I've asked for breaks multiple times, but he won't give me one. What do?	Yes
"Okay so excuse if this broken I am on mobile.  This past week I had a job interview with a prestigious company in my area that was hiring. Interview went well, said they were going to call me previous employers and run a background check. I agree to all. Fast forward to today, I go to work work is fine and finish the day. I get home and I receive a phone call for one of my employers and it goes like this "" (m) wanted me to call you and tell you that you can come in sometime next week and drop off your uniforms and pick up your last check because you were looking for another job."" Are there any recourse that I can take? What if this future employer doesn't hire because of my background and I get letgo/fired from my current employer because I'm looking for financial stability and this job isn't providing it. Thanks"	Yes
Hey all.  Today I had an interview to volunteer with Big Brothers Big Sisters in Kansas. The questions were super invasive and made me very uncomfortable. For example:  -Have you ever questioned your sexuality? -With what sexuality do you identify? Are you sexually active/do you do anything to satisfy your sexual needs? -Why did you and your ex-boyfriend break up? (after asking if I've ever been in a serious relationship.) -In what ways was your ex-boyfriend physically abusive? -Do you take medication for anxiety or depression? -Do you currently or have you ever seen a counselor, psychiatrist, psychologist, or therapist? -Have you ever had thoughts of suicide? -What was your suicide plan?  I understand some of these questions are for the safety of the children, but don't questions have to be relevant to the position? Doesn't this violate discrimination or disability laws?  Any answers are appreciated. Thanks everyone.	Yes
My wife is a part time teacher and part time server at a very popular restaurant in our area.  In June of 2017 she had a radial fracture after slipping on a floor area in the restaurant that should of had a mat on it.  She was put in a cast and placed and granted workers compensation shortly thereafter.  She remained until workers comp until October when was cleared and requested to return to work.  For a ballpark figure she typically earned 2-300$ a weekend day.  Hostessing is 12$ an hour.     Since returning to work she barely gets a shift a week, mostly hostessing which is hourly as opposed to tips.  She would typically work weekends.  This month she has not been scheduled at all.  We feel that since her injury she's been slowly phased out and now is unofficially fired for an injury due to the owners negligence.  Any advice appreciated.  Thank you	Yes
"So while I wasn't the only Mexican or ethnic person In the restaurant I was the only one working front of house as a server and one of only two at the times male servers. So what happens is I had been stuck being the only person who hosted for them for some reason even though everyone used to have to do it depending on who's turn it was. And also was promised better hours during the summer and instead got the two hosting shifts for Friday and Saturday(which are the best days to make tips) and serving sundays and mondays and almost always being called off of my shift because the place wasn't busy. Needless to say I wasn't making a livable wage being stuck with those shifts. And then I requested a day off for my best friends wedding and was told "" yeah you can do that but when you come in next we're going to have to have a chat about sticking to your schedule since you're asking for more hours"" which really confused me since my other coworkers would take whole weeks off and never reprimanded for it. So I went in the next pay day since I was off work and said I was ready for the talk which he proceeded to say he wasn't ready for the rest of the week. When I came into work for my next check before I even go to far past the front door he rushed me and asked me to follow him where he said ""I think it's best we go our separate ways."" And handed me a Check for 24 dollars. And a few points I'd like to add is that I never got a single bad review which I was proud of seeing as I'd never been a server before this place. And I was secret shopped more than people who had been working there since the brewery opened and would score 100% every time and win growlers. Apparently my last One I got which was also the week before I got fired wasn't just good and 100% according to him it was ""glowing"" and I received a 50 dollar bonus for doing so. And I should also mention the man I'm talking about was the places director of operations since his general manager had quit. Not only did he fail at his job as a director of operations  skill set needed(expert communicator, expert of delegating work) he was even worse at being the general manager. So I guess what I'm asking for advice on would whether or not I should go speak to a lawyer about this or if I'd even have a case. And Itd be for laws in Oregon. I'd appreciate anything and everything you guys could help me know what To go do and tell the lawyer I'd go to if I possibly had a case"	Yes
"I'm working this summer for a well-known Melville-themed caffeine vendor. Call them ""Ishmael.""  Now, one of the things that was drummed into me on my first day, is that everyone gets a paid ten minute break for every four hours, and an unpaid half hour for every eight hours(or six hours, I get different answers depending on which supervisor I ask.)  On most days they're pretty good about giving me my breaks, except when they don't. I'm not saying that they ""intentionally"" skip breaks, but they have a way of slipping their minds. ""After this task, and the next one, we'll let you take your ten minute break. Almost done? Whoops, we've got a long line, get back on that register! Now what was I talking about just then?""    Naturally, they only ever forget about paid breaks. No one ever forgets about the ones when I'm not paid.   Then there's a ridiculous rule that each employee is expected to bring in their own markers for marking cups, and I've been told off several times for not remembering to bring one(at four fucking AM? They're lucky I remembered to wear pants.)  So, the questions:  1. Are breaktimes set by law? Or is that an internal policy of St-- I mean, Ishmael's Coffee? Can I get anyone in trouble for not giving me breaks?  2. What are the laws for breaks in NYS, anyway?  3. Can I really get fired for this stupid marker shit?"	Yes
I was fired from my job as a health inspector at a county government in Illinois. I was told it was because I was not performing to expectations. I was on a 6 month probationary period and at 5 1/2 months through it, and would not have protection from the union until 6 months. I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me.   I work very little with my bosses (the director and assistant director of the division), and instead work closely with senior people who work as trainers. In the 5.5 months I received no formal performance review or corrective action.   I was part of a harassment investigation, against the director of the division as I witnessed him say something sexist to another coworker. This was the second harassment investigation against the director.   There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire.   Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires.   The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women).   Do I have a case for retaliation since I was fired being part of a harassment investigation? Do I have a case for wrongful termination since there was little to no documentation about corrective action and heterosexual employees, who performed worse than me were retained.   If I do have a case, what do I do next?	Yes
"I'm 50 years old.  After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.  Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.  My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.  Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.  I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.  Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.  Thanks very much for any advice you can give."	Yes
I'm confused about the nj labor laws, as I understand it i should be getting time and a half, but I'm only getting time and getting paid as though it's on the books, in cash.  Is this legal? Can i do anything about this legally?	Yes
I think some lawyer would benefited just to follow me around. Seriously. I have a series of bad luck despite of trying to be very positive. Just this week alone: 1. The president of a dumpster company trespasses my property. I complained to his worker previously but have no intention to pursue it. He took pictures and denied that his worker broke the driveway. He's going to call another expert into my property even after I said he's trespassing. I have the before and after drivrway pictures btw. His company worth 1 million and the damage only worth a few hundreds bucks. Lol.. 2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up. 3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out. 4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools..  5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it. I've dealt with many more.. IRS double charge mistake (1 year to resolve), real estate agent knowingly sold a property with many violations (didn't disclose mold, structural, etc and inspector was her brother), etc.  Disclosures: Not sue happy, PhD in science,  just wonder what the heck life at 1 am..	Yes
My paycheck was witheld this last pay period because my supervisor failed to approve my hours before she left on vacation.  I submitted my hours in a timely manner and the number of hours worked were consistent with my normal ammount.  Because of this I will not be able to pay off my entire credit card balance and will have to pay interest on my balance - in addition to the inconvenience of not having the money.  My employer told me that they cannot pay me until the next pay period.  Do you think I have any legal recourse in this situation - specifically two get my pay sooner than in another two weeks or having my employer pay all or a portion of my interest charge on my credit card?    I am in Utah.	Yes
So I had just started working at papa johns and on my 4th day or so I had to leave early for a family emergency, they didn't even let me leave early even though I told them I had to drive 2 and a half hours for a family emergency and then my car got stolen when I got to the city I had to go to. The general manager was texting me the whole week prior telling me when to come into work, so I texted her the day my car got stolen letting her know the situation, this was Thursday and my next shift was Saturday. I realize my mistake was not calling after I had not received any texts but at the time I was too stressed to deal with that situation. So upon returning I find out I'm getting fired for a no call no show because she wanted me to call her not text her. What can I do about this? Small claims?	Yes
TL;DR My SO sometimes only gets 3 to 4 hours of sleep in between shifts. Is there any requirement for adequate time between shifts?    My girlfriend normally works a shift from 7am to 3pm. However they sometimes are needed to work mandatory overtime from 7pm to anywhere as late as 2 to 3am. Considering a modest commute of 20 minutes and night / morning routine, she ends up only getting maybe 3 hours of sleep some nights. It's also worrying because she has to drive a vehicle for work and might be too groggy to be on the road.     Are there any rules for giving time in between shifts? I researched briefly and only read something about 24 hour maximum working. She works for the county government so I assume they aren't doing any shady business but thought I should ask anyways.	Yes
My wife got a new fulltime job recently but still is in the probation period. Shes been put on bed rest for few months for reasons. Her work isn't office work so she can't do it from home or anything. Can she get fired? Does she have legal protection against being fired?	Yes
"Hi, I am A server at a locally owned Chinese restaurant. Pretty regularly the owners will ""punish"" us for not doing a good enough job by taking money off our paychecks. Our base pay is only 25 dollars for a full 12 hour shift (with no breaks). I generally end up making around 16 an hour here after tips, but these deductions are making me worried. My friend just had 42 dollars taken off his paycheck for ""forgetting to charge for wine, even though the customer hadn't tried to pay yet. What is the legality of this? I'm in Birmingham, Al."	Yes
"TLDR backstory: So my wife has been offered an anchor/reporter job that's a big break for her in her field.  However, the location is far from ideal (Southern Michigan) and it has limited jobs in my field (BioEng).  Her offer is a two-year contract agreement with 90-day probational period, however we're not sure of her rights to leave there after those 90 days.  The contract states:  ""Your first 90 days of employment is a probationary period.  During this period, the company will evaluate your suitability for your position and it may decide not to continue your employment for no reason or for any reason prohibited by law.  You are free to resign your employment with the Company at any time either during your probationary period or thereafter. **This paragraph does not apply to individuals who have been employed by the Company or affiliate for more than 90 days immediately preceding the date of this offer letter**  You represent that you are not subject to the terms of noncompetition, confidentiality, or similar agreement that would limit your ability to carry out the duties of your position and your offer of employment is based on this representation. If the Company learns that you are currently subject to any such agreement that would limit or prohibit you employment with the Company, your employment may be terminated.""  Based on that, is she able to leave early without penalty a year down the road if she doesnt like it?  Could she accept a different job in the same field without violating her contract?    Thanks"	Yes
I work for a restaurant in New Jersey where employees pool tips (all cash business). It is customary that managers count the tips 15 minutes before a shift ends as the new shift workers are coming on to replace the prior shift and during the last 15 minutes of our shift those who are leaving attend to typical restaurant duties (filling napkin holders, wiping tables, etc).   The other day I was not replaced by an employee coming on to the second shift and worked 20 minutes past the time I was supposed to get off. I served two large parties and I asked a manager to recount tips since I thought I should be compensated for those tables, among others, and she refused.  My questions is whether it is illegal not to tip me out on the tables I served prior to leaving? They compensated me as though I stopped serving tables 15 minutes before the shift ended instead of recounting the tips and compensating me for 20 minutes after.   Sorry if this seems petty but this occurs rather frequently and over a longer period those tips begin to add up.	Yes
My (now former) managers told me that accepting 'grease' money at the door of the club is theft, and that I owe the money back. I'm disinclined to believe them, can someone shed some light on the facts? British Columbia, Canada.	Yes
I work for a restaurant in Michigan. The room where our dish machine is regularly gets up to above 80 degrees and 70% humidity. [Here is a photo of the temperature gauge in the room from today](http://imgur.com/a/jkIPM)  That was taken after the dish machine had just shut off for a brief ten minute period.  Our head of the building has begun to disallow us to have the doors to the room propped open while the machine is in use. These doors are at the hottest end of the machine. The ceiling vents do not work and on the weekends the air conditioner for the whole building is turned off anyway. There are two fans inside the room (there used to be three, one broke and was never replaced) that barely move the air around.   I know OSHA states that there are no temperature regulations for workplaces. However it also says that OSHA kicks in when there is a possibility for heat related illness. Spending 20 minutes in the room leaves you coated in sweat and the head of the building does not allow us to keep cups/water bottles in the dish room. We're told we have to go get water from the pop machine, but cannot do that when the dish machine is in use. Serving on 700 people on the regular in a 2 hour period means the machine is constantly in use. We constantly need to rotate people out of the room because they begin to get light headed from the oppressive heat inside the room.  Do we as employees have any legal leg to stand on to change anything?	Yes
I was cleaning out room and came across a written check from my employer that is over a year old. I know there is typically a 6-month period in which checks need to be cashed but my boss is giving me a hard time about getting a new check reissued. Are they legally allowed to refuse to rewrite a check that wasn't cashed after a set amount of time? Trying to make sure I am not getting screwed here. This is taking place in NJ if that has any bearing on the matter.	Yes
Hey Reddit,  So a friend of mine works as a cook in some big sort of conference center thingy.  Before getting into the issue at hand I want to preface that we are from California and there are established laws in our state regarding mandatory meal breaks.  Ok so onto what is going on.  My friend has told me that on several occasions, employees have been required to attend meetings during their lunch period.  They cannot bring food into this meeting and they are not given any other time during the day to eat.  I know in California, it is required that you receive a 30 minute meal break after 5 hours of work unless a shift is only 6 hours.  From what I understand, the company sometimes works around this by making employees clock out early yet not actually take a break, so that on paper they appear to be getting their break and then having them take the break much later in the day.  The final issue I was curious about, is that apparently, said company is counting restroom breaks as the employee's 10s and 15s.  And im not talking about a lengthy bathroom break.  From what I am being told, if nature calls and you arent on break, you use your break.  So if you need to pee and it takes 3 minutes, say goodbye to your 10 minute break.  Any help or comments on the legality of these practices is appreciated.  From what I understand, her division doesnt really have any HR to go to, just an office manager with no real power over how things go.  Anyway, thanks Reddit!	Yes
"Recently started a part time side job at a small music store. ( 3 months in, 2 days a week).   Employer/owner hasn't had me fill out a W-4. Paychecks have listed normal tax reductions. For what ever reason, I forgot to mention the form. It didn't cross my mind until today when he asked me for my social security number for his ""Tax Guy"".   I'm curious as to what should, needs and can happen in this case? Where has the tax money listed in the pay stub been going or logged as?   I don't have time for issues to occur. I don't need the job, just side cash I can play with. Is this reason to quit if he does not truthfully comply?"	Yes
My parent was recently dismissed after 30 years of tenured employment. Most of the information is coming to us after the fact but without going into too many details, he has been dismissed on grounds that he has sent aggressive emails to coworkers and higher ups and has avoided/ignored any attempts from the company to get his perspective on the situation. My father does have a significant substance abuse problem (alcohol) but my question is, what does it take to fire a tenured employee of 30 years? Where does mental health/illness play a role? According to the company, they had no knowledge of him having a problem – he is a higher functioning alcoholic, but in the past 5ish years, it must have been pretty hard to cover up on his part. I believe that he is most likely not able to continue working at this point in time. I also believe that this situation should not be sugar coated and should not enable him but I worry about my mother because she has been completely blindsided by all of this and I want to be able to give her advice and also keep her safe – is he entitled to severance pay? Can we get access to his termination file? While there may be marks against him on his role in certain situations, I’d like to see the proof of the charges that they are reporting. I am not defending him, but we are hearing conflicting stories.  He is in his late 60’s so he does have a significant retirement – I know the company is sending a certified letter in the next day or two and he can choose to say he was fired, retiring and then a 3rd option, but my mother couldn’t remember what that was… I was thinking resigning could be the 3rd option? What are the pros/cons of being fired vs. retired? Can he lose any of his retirement because of all of this? There has been advice given from family friends that he not sign any papers until a lawyer is involved. I just want my mom to get out of this situation without completely drowning- my gut feeling is that we need to be prepared financially for a worst case medical scenario. He also ran up credit cards and we are not even sure completely financially how deep of a hole he has dug. He has made some very bad choices, but my mother is a wonderful person who has no idea how to proceed. I'm not sure if it matters, but the boss that fired him has since been fired as well... Do we get a lawyer?	Yes
"I worked at a restaurant as a dish washer for about 5 1/2 hours as a ""trial"" period. I decided not to continue with them after that time. I gave them my information, it's been a week and haven't received any sort of compensation for my work.  What do I do if I do not get paid? There's no proof that I actually worked that night, I didn't sign in or anything like that. I just showed up and got to work, then left."	Yes
"I am a teacher in North Carolina. I have worked at this school for 5 years.  A few weeks after we got out for the summer, the school secretary sent out a questionnaire via email to all staff that asks for a list of regularly used prescription medications. The form is to be completed before school returns in August. They have never asked for this before, we usually just have to have a physical and a letter stating that we do not have TB. I have ADHD and take concerta, as well as an anti depressant and birth control. I am a private person and do not feel like sharing this with my boss. Can they ask for this? I did some reading and everything I have read so far just says ""it depends."""	Yes
I have been working at this pizza place for 8 months, and recently a shift manager at another location was fired. My boss started training me as shift manager at our location so I could replace the fired shift manager. I had to request 9 days off to go see my doctor in Arizona, and I was supposed to start at the new location when I came back. Coming back from Arizona I was nervous, because I think I did not receive sufficient training for my new position (I was never shown how to open, when that is part of the responsibilities of the shift manager). My boss messaged me this morning telling me to talk to the guy who runs the other location. Here starts my concern. When I showed up at the new location today my boss' boss did not know I was going to start as shift manager at all, and had already started training someone else for the position. He did not know I was coming over to talk either, even though my boss had supposedly set up our meeting. He said he was not sure when he would be able to put me on the schedule at his location, and it would not be as shift manager. I messaged my boss and told him how embarrassed I had been for showing up at the new location with the intent to start as shift manager and getting to know no such arrangements had been made. My boss told me he had forgot to tell the other location I would be starting, which sounds like a lie, as I have been training for a month to start in the new location. Now my boss is saying he is not sure how to fit me in the schedule at my regular location, leaving me in a tricky spot. I can't help but feel fooled (or bamboozled for the lack of a better word that I can think of right now) and am wondering if my boss is even allowed to do this? I need the hours and don't know when I'll be getting hours again. I don't appreciate the uncertainty and I feel I should not be held liable for this. What should I do? How should I go about this?	Yes
"To preface, we live in Georgia in the United States. My girlfriend is 19 years old.   So my girlfriend was offered a job as a manager of a brand new store that was opening up at the beginning of July. This was the second of an already existing store in the town we live in. She was offered the manager position, $12 a hour, at least 40 hours a week, the freedom to make her own schedule, 5% of sales at the end of the year from both stores, and a bonus at the end of year.   So they hired her and no contracts were signed before or after hiring. No official papers stating what she would be doing or that she worked there at all. She starts the job during her two week notice at her previous job. They ""train"" her, which was really just teaching her how to run the register and computer system and using her for labor. She was told to find employees to run the new store that would open roughly four weeks after she started. So I help her set up an online ad for the position of part time employee and numerous (probably 30) applications came in.   She reached out to a few applicants to set up interviews only to be told it was completely up to her to hire these employees because they would be splitting her hours with her. So she decided to hire none and no interviews took place. During her time at the pre existing store she worked alone probably 80% of the time. Over 40 hours a week not by choice.   So the new store opens up. It's a good 40 minute drive to the new location for everyone involved. She's scheduled to work everyday its open for the first week. And she works there with the owners daughter. (The only employees are the owner, owners daughter, my girlfriend, and someone who was hired not long after her to cover at the pre existing location). The daughter mentioned how the other employee would not work at the new location because she ""didn't have the look for it."" The owners daughter is very rude to my girlfriend as well. Always complaining about what she did the night before and telling her she should know how to do her job. The problem with that is, she received very little training if you could even call it that. Every day she would tell me how she got in trouble and sometimes openly in front of customers.   Then comes the Fourth of July. She's running the store alone and is left a letter from the boss. The letter is two pages long front and back that states she has a learning curve and didn't train well. It also states that the boss never guaranteed 40 hours a week and that she wouldn't receive her bonus or percentage of sales. She even mentioned reducing her hours each week.   So she texts me the letter and asks her parents and we all agree she should quit the job because it was nothing what they offered her and we felt she wasn't being treated properly. We believe she was used to make the drive to the new store because the owner and her daughter had no interest in doing it daily. That's just a theory however.   So she texts the owners daughter that she quits and needs to come to the store to take over. She continued to work and help customers and make sales until the owners daughter arrived to relieve her.   She worked 8-10 hour shifts alone in busy towns. She wasn't given an opportunity to go grab food or take a break. She couldn't use the bathroom unless there were no customers, which was rare and when there weren't she had to run to make sure no one came in. She was never given any pay stubs for any of her checks and in the letter the boss stated that she guesstimates her pay and overtime pay. I correctly calculated her overtime pay and it was double what she was actually paid.   My question is: what here is illegal - if any of it is. I believe some of it may be and we're curious what we can do about it. Apparently someone heard about what happened to my girlfriend and said the same store and boss and did the exact same thing to another person previously.   Sorry for the long patchy story.   tl;dr: Girlfriend was offered a management job at a new store and was given zero management duties. She couldn't take a break to get food and eat and could rarely use the bathroom. Owner and her daughter were rude to her and told her another employee didn't have the look to work at the new store. She received zero pay stubs with checks and was underpaid for overtime hours. She also received a letter claiming she had a learning curve during training when they never properly trained her or worked with her enough to know how she was."	Yes
"I'm not sure if this question is acceptable in this subreddit. So I will ask my question, and if people suggest hiring a lawyer, then I request advice on how to find the right type of lawyer for my situation.   After graduating from college, I spent six months working on a startup which was unsuccessful. Then I began searching for a job, and I put my accomplishments during my startup on my resume. After six months of job searching, I received my first job offer with a company in the same field as my startup, but it's a 3-month consulting agreement. The CTO of the company said if it's a good fit I will be offered a full-time position afterward. I read the consulting agreement and analyzed it with a plagiarism checker. I discovered over 90% of the contract came from two online contracts, and one major difference I found was the removal of a phrase in a statement. To summarize the statement, the online contract says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc, that I develop while performing my services under this agreement"". The contract I received does not have the last phrase so the statement says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc."".  I spoke with the CTO about this, and he said I could make changes to the contract, and they would consider it. At the moment, I had doubt in negotiating and told him I sought a permanent position. So I declined the offer. A week later I regretted not negotiating and asked for another opportunity. He said they might give me another opportunity, but they will be unable to change the wording of the contract. If I sign the contract, is it possible that I will give them rights to all my accomplishments I achieved during my startup?  Let me know if you need additional information. I am on the fence about hiring an attorney/lawyer to help me with my situation, but I would like to get advice from this subreddit first. Thanks."	Yes

I currently work at a small SaaS company in a client support type of role. I do general troubleshooting and account setups, nothing on the technical side of things nor do I take part in the sales process.   I've recently got an interview with another, much larger, company in the same exact field, in a different state, doing something pretty similar but not dealing with clients nearly as much.   Well, comes to find out that I have a non-compete that prevents me from working in the industry for TWO YEARS after quitting or being let go. The non-compete was signed when I first started at a super entry level call center position.   Is there any way around this? This is my field of expertise and it would be really hard to find another job that I'm as good at in this field. Am I screwed and stuck at my current company until the end of time?	Yes
I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.  First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying. I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.  I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.  As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.  Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.  **TL;DR, sick, boss doesn't believe me, what do?**	Yes
"First time posting here:   I work as a purchasing agent. Yesterday, a salesmen who is the boss' son believed a 6 figure order I had placed was wrong (it wasn't). While things were being figured out on my end he screamed in my ear and my coworkers ""I SWEAR TO  GOD GUYS IM GONNA GO OUT TO MY CAR RIGHT NOW AND GET A GUN""  He calmed down. The order turned out to be fine and he was fine. But it made me feel very uncomfortable - and I'm a bit on edge. What happens if next time the order is not correct?  I have not gone to human resources because, well human resources is his sister and that will be a brick wall. He frequently verbally abuses the employees. The owner of the company is his father. It is a small 10-15 person company.   I'm not sure if I should get police involved? OSHA? Or what steps I should take here, any advice appreciated."	Yes
Hello. The company I work for requires a yearly hands-on competency test. This year, they have mandated that if you miss your testing time, and don’t give 24 hour notice, you will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction. Obviously, it is illegal for an employer to deduct wages without approval; however, my employer seems to think they’ve found a way around that. There is an online test that you must take beforehand, in which 100% is required. The very first question is along the lines of, “I agree that if I miss my hands-on test, I will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction”. To me, this sounds as though they are forcing you to agree to a payroll deduction in order for you to stay employed. Is this legal? If not, any advice on how to approach management with my concern? I do not want to agree to this, as I can think of multiple scenarios where I may have to miss my test, and be unable to give 24 hours notice. Thank you for your help.	Yes
I work for a large big box retailer and have for over 10 years. I have an upper management position which is salaried. Prior to having the position I was a lower manager that was hourly. I was not allowed to take lunches on multiple occasions but expected to do “fake punches” so I didn’t get paid for that work. The only proof I have is that I can print them all out but there’s no way to show that I was required to do so. The same individual who did that was my HR at the time. He had since promoted just like I have meaning he is still my HR. Just a higher up HR. He has yelled at me and other employees, he laughed in my face and admitted to never reading a doctors note I gave him while I was at the end of my pregnancy, and he has an overall abusive personality. I recently found out from my boss that he stopped me from getting a promotion I was very qualified for and recommended for. I emailed even higher up leadership/hr with my concern almost 2 months ago. I received a reply stating that they took it very seriously and would be looking into it. They have not actually spoken with me and I feel I am getting pushed out. What is the best way to go about this? I have no physical proof that my boss admitted to the retaliation and he will side with the company in order to keep his job. Can a few texts showing his character, a letter I wrote him about his abusive behavior, and print outs of my punches get me anywhere? It doesn’t seem like enough to prove my claims despite them being very true.	Yes
"Like the title states I'm currently employed in Chapel Hill North Carolina and am interviewing for a new job this coming Wednesday. I've only been back from vacation for 13 days and if on Wednesday I am offered a job and give my two weeks notice the same day I will not be safe from the 6 weeks restriction. The policy verbatim from the employee handbook states   ""I understand that payment for PTO is subject to continued employment. If I am seperated for any reason within six weeks of the use of PTO I will not be entitled to receive pay for time not worked. If the PTO has already been paid, the company may deduct this from my paycheck. Payment for PTO is subject to home office verification of eligibility.""  This may be a stupid question but this is my first full time job where vacation was even offered and I'm not sure if this is common practice. Any help is appreciated."	Yes
"Hey so I just found this sub and I've been having this question in my head for a long time. My last job, I was working about 55 hours per week yet still considered part time. On top of that, my boss would take all the hours over 40 (15 for example) and move it to the next week so I wouldn't get paid overtime. I was young and didn't really mind because i liked the place and I wasn't doing it for the money, I'm just a hard worker and I like to work. But I just told my mom the other day about it and she's like ""you should sue for all those hours."" Could I really sue for that?"	Yes
"I worked for a 501c3 as an at-will grunt for three years. I reported some mistreatment of my coworkers (bullying, intimidation) and strong indications my Manager was lying about our numbers to the state (we're grant-funded) to our CFO. This was six months ago. I was told to come to her with any problems after our previous supervisor left, but according to our handbook CFO is not a protected whistleblower resource.  Shortly after, Manager let me know in no uncertain terms that nothing was changing. I realize that the CFO simply told supervisor exactly what was said. My coworker and I began to be subjected to constant site visits, which disrupt the traffic in our type of work. Questioning the supervisor on any subject became grounds for faux-disciplinary meetings, and we began getting write-ups for missed deadlines that weren't enforced in any other department. We were threatened with preparatory audits of our finances and paperwork (this has never been done, there has never been a problem, they take an enormous amount of time, and the actual audit is years away) and scheduled so that we worked large amounts of unpaid overtime, which we were told we could not bill for at the start of our employment. This stuff made our working lives miserable for months for virtually zero gain. It seems like this qualifies as retaliation, but aside from outbursts at meetings I recorded most of it just looks like unnecessarily strict oversight.  I decided to try my luck with HR, in the middle of this (three months ago), which the handbook did list as a protected whistleblower resource. They listened to me and two coworkers, and said ""these things take time, we're going to have to go to the board."" Shortly afterward, one of the coworkers that went to HR was fired, and a couple of miserable months afterward I was also fired for missing a deadline for internal docs by a day.  At this point all of my remaining coworkers were even more miserable, and my former supervisor appeared completely untouchable, and our project was suffering for it, so I threw a hail mary and sent a letter to the president of our organization's board (a lawyer). He met with me and said he'd probably hire an employment lawyer to look into it. Neither he nor the board had heard anything about complaints from me or anybody else from HR, which I believe, given that he didn't seem to know Manager by name or anything about our program.  Now I find out at least one of the things I reported on behalf of a coworker to PotB has been investigated and the person involved suspended, and I got a call from our CEO saying ""We take this very seriously, and we'd like you to talk to an employment lawyer we've hired to investigate the other concerns.""   All I have personally are emails documenting when I met with CFO and HR (which also outlined the complaints), some recordings of Supervisor being inappropriately and strangely aggressive in meetings, and my narrative of what happened. The five other employees who still work in my old department are also extremely unhappy, but aside from one person's emails to Supervisor outlining their bullying and other unprofessional behavior, it basically adds up to six peoples' combined hundreds of work stories about Manager being an enormous fucker and complaints to HR getting immediately redirected back to Manager.  Is any of the stuff I've already talked about a red flag for employment lawyers? Will they consider Manager as a legal liability if it adds up to heaps of borderline-actionable material, or only if they find something damaging off the bat? How should I present this to waste as little of their time as possible?"	Yes
So this guy has owned a trailer based business washing windows for awhile, every now and then on big jobs he has had college aged kids come help him complete those jobs. He files as an sole proprietor and pays the kids in cash. He is leaving for a couple years, and bought another trailer. While he is gone he wants me and another guy to run the trailers. He calls us independent contractors and asks for a 30/70 split of profits. We use his client base, and primarily he does scheduling. His name remains on the trailers, and we do not own the equipment but to dodge legalities I would be leasing the trailer from him.  He had no idea what a 1099 is, and has claimed all wages he paid to people that helped him as business expenses. What problems exist here? I can provide more non-identifying information if that helps. He also has called me a foreman in a video he put in social media.  The reason I ask this is that I believe this is an employee/employer relationship and could get troublesome fast, but there are some gray areas that could prove it possible to make work.   I'm not really interested, but he's also a friend and I want him to know why I'm turning it down and that he needs to fix some things. I'd also like to understand the situation better, and I don't think he even knows there's problems. Thanks!	Yes
"Thank you for reading this and I understand that this is not exactly the official advice I should run into a courtroom with but I will take any and all advice and suggestions.  Long story short; my wife accepted a post at a summer job for eight weeks and signed a contract for this position.  This post is in New Jersey. The contract is for an 8 week position and she is to be paid $2450 total for all 8 weeks.  First question: As this position requires her to work from at least 8:30 AM to 4 PM Monday through Friday, that makes a total of 37.5 official working hours per workweek. She's getting $306.25 per week. That translates to $8.17 an hour and in NJ, minimum wage is $8.44 and hour. Is that legal to hire employees via a contract for under minimum wage? Does it matter if it is a seasonal position?  Second question, going with the 7.5 hours of a work day, she is not given any breaks during the day. She has to set up for the next 'class' and she was told that her break is at 5 PM. Remember, her shift ends at 4 PM. Is that also legal? I thought labor laws required employees to take a break roughly every 5 hours.  Third question; is mandatory orientation and training required to be paid to the new hiree? She was told she had to attend these events which took place on three Saturdays prior to her starting date. Each event was roughly 8 hours. She also has had to work other events prior to the start of job such as a ""meet the parents"" night. She has not seen any compensation for this.  Besides teaching during the 7.5 hours per day, she was told she has to drive a minivan to pick up coworkers and clients and that she would be given $600 as a bonus for the 8 weeks of doing this. That breaks down to $75 per week which is $15 per day. The route is roughly an hour each way and that's not including her time to refuel the vehicle and do the mandatory safety inspection checklist of the vehicle to make sure the vehicle is in proper working conditions.  Furthermore the work van is being rented from a company and my wife's name is not on the contract for the vehicle nor is she listed as an authorized driver for the vehicle.   What would be the ramifications if she was driving the vehicle and something happened? The company she was hired by claims they have their own insurance for the vehicle but with all the other questionable activity, I no longer trust that situation.   Also, what would be the ramifications for her leaving this position before the eight weeks are up? She has a full time job throughout the year but summers are off. This job was mainly just for a little extra summer spending money.  I hope my rant made some sense; I am going by this handle rather than my normal handle to avoid having her identity exposed. Thank you all for your help, time, and support."	Yes
Hi all!  In the process of moving I found a paycheck that I hadn't cashed from an old employer in North Dakota.  I'm wondering if they still have to honor it even if it's from 2013 and if so how should I approach this with the company?  Thanks so much!	Yes
"I have over 70hours at work. I work in a restaurant in florida. The owner hasnt paid multiple employees and has also had 2 illegals work for him recently before they got ""married"" to citizens. I am not sure where to go from here. I have a previous paystub and also have the other employees that are frustrated. I quit last night after he refused to pay and he got very confrontational. I called the police and made a little report but they said they cant help me and its a legal matter. Im frustrated and now jobless but thankful i dont have to work for such a low life. How should i approach this matter? I feel like going into the establishment tomorrow and recording conversations between the other employees who havent been paid aswell as me amd getting a lawyer. Good idea? "	Yes
Hey Everyone,  First off, I want to say that I believe this would be the best place for this, but if you know of a more relevant subreddit for me to go to please let me know! Also thanks for the help in advance.  Ok, so I'm 20 y/o, in Nebraska.  I'm working and paying my way through college.   I am currently working a part time job in the afternoons 3-4 days a week for a cleaning service, Jane Doe's cleaning service (not the actual name).  I am getting paid hourly wages, every other week by form of a personal check. I have not signed any paperwork or anything like that, nor does she intend to have me sign anything. I keep record of my hours on a sheet of paper essentially. She's a very honest person, not shady at all, I've gotten to know my co-workers and there are no complaints or anything. Everyone is very friendly and have known each other for a while.   She had told me during the interview that I would be paid like I previously described and would have to take out my own taxes and keep record of all that.  What I'm wondering is what I need to do legally for tax purposes since there is no paperwork that I have filled out, and she is paying me by personal check based on an hour sheet that I fill out every day.  Do I need to mark it down as work income, or do I need to mark it down at all??(kidding on that last part)   I'm afraid to spend any of the money I have earned from the job just bc I don't know what I'll end up needing to do with it later on so all help is invited!!!	Yes
Long story short, I am a college aged female from Lexington, Kentucky, who found what was seemingly the perfect job at the beginning of this year. I'm a psychology major, and I found work as an office assistant at a private practice for a local neuropsychologist. I was so proud of myself for landing the position. I was getting great experience and it was going to look amazing on my resume. The atmosphere was relaxed and I genuinely enjoyed the work.   Sometimes my 57 year old boss (the doctor himself) would make somewhat inappropriate comments about my appearance, or get into personal subjects that made me uncomfortable. He also only seemed to hire college girls. Despite this, I figured he was just a slightly awkward old man until he kept me after work late one day, closed the blinds, grabbed me by the waist and tried to kiss me. I rejected his advances, and ran out to my car where I sobbed hysterically. I emailed him a letter of resignation the next day.  I found out soon after that he did the same thing to my 19 year old female coworker, and a former female employee around our age. I feel deeply disrespected and disgusted. This was someone I looked up to, admired, and trusted. I thought he really appreciated the work I was doing, but I think he just saw me as a piece of meat the whole time. I feel preyed upon and taken advantage of by someone in a position of power over me.   But beyond all of that, I am now extremely worried and stressed out about my financial situation. I never got that many hours, but the job paid decently and was enough to support my spending habits, and now I am suddenly unemployed. I have asked my parents for help temporarily, but there's only so much they are able to do. Obviously I am looking to find a new job, but with searching out positions, applying, and going through the hiring process, then waiting for my first paycheck, I can't imagine I'll have an income again for at least a month.   I am considering suing my ex-boss for workplace harassment and loss of income. I am afraid that if I don't do anything, he will continue to do the same thing to other people. However, I have no idea where to start. There were no witnesses, and what happened that day is basically his word against mine. He's a psychologist, so he knows how to get inside people's heads and twist the truth. However, I do have two other coworkers who quit alongside me (one is the 19 year old girl who he also tried to kiss), as well as corroboration from a girl who used to work there and experienced the same thing.   In addition, he sent all 3 of us who quit a long, insane rambling email that is pretty incriminating. In it, he claims he lost his balance, but also that we tried to seduce him, and he was merely attempting to test how far we'd go. There is almost no way someone could read what he wrote and believe that he's innocent.  Again, I don't know where to start - I don't have money to pay for a lawyer, and I'm afraid of my former boss coming after me. He is a powerful and experienced doctor who probably has lawyers lined up, and I'm a student who's taken one civil law class. On top of all this, I already have two police cases open from previous assaults, and I'm afraid of being called a liar.   Another thing, what if my coworkers don't want to sue? I haven't spoken to them about it yet, and I don't think I could do it without their testimonies.  Please help! How do I proceed from here?	Yes
Coming from VA, not working for a union. Recently found out a male coworker is making more than 2 female coworkers who have more experience and certifications.  Is it illegal for them to approach this subject with HR with the information that they have about the other co-workers pay?	Yes
My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	Yes
"Hi Reddit. This is my first time posting on here, and any help would be much appreciated! I apologize for the sloppiness of the format, I'm typing this on my phone at work.     I'm 26, Caucasian, female, and I work in the slot department on grave yard in a [non-union] casino. I've been in this department for 2 years, and the casino as a whole for almost 7 years. I recently, after much prodding and being insistent on other managers, have been offered a dual rate ""promotion.""  By becoming a dual rate, im basically a mini supervisor. My current rate is $10.90 an hour. The promotion is $1. But it doesn't entirely bump my pay up. Days that I supervisors all day (which would possibility be once every two weeks) I would make $11.90/hour for 8 hours. Days that I don't supervise the entire day, I would get paid $11.90 for 2 hours.   The major problem is that the manager who had the final say in promoting me told me I would be getting $2 more. All of the other dual rates make $2 more per hour. So essentially $16 more when they supervise all day, and $4 a day when they don't. Said manager (I think his official title is assistant casino operations manager, or some other fancy mumbo jumbo,) played a ton of games when it came time to offering me this promotion because he didn't want to do it since it takes away from his bonus. For example, he told another manager to tell me it was okay to promote me, even though HE was the one who had the final say so. He also took his sweet time going to HR to get the paperwork going.  This manager is also trying to cut expenses in any way possible so he gets a bigger bonus. Gotta love corporate.   The two dual rates on my shift make $2 more for supervising. Technically for them it's only $1.85 more because they got a $0.15 raise about a year or so ago. I am the lowest paid person on my shift. Everyone is at $15 an hour or more. Part of the reason is that they have been here since day one and were on a different pay scale. (Different ownership, Michael Gaughan at first and then Boyd gaming.). I understand being considerably newer, I won't be making as much as somebody since day one. My raises are $0.20 a year. That is part of the reason I wanted to become a dual rate at that $2 mark. I would basically be getting a $0.50 cent raise. My biggest gripe is that other dual rates make $2 more, why are they trying to get me to take $1?  Even newer dual rates got it at $2 an hour.  One of the managers on my shift says he personally thinks they're trying to get one over on me and suggested I sit down and talk with the director and assistant manager. After doing some thinking and talking to my best friend, I don't think meeting with them is a bad idea and inquiring about why my pay is considerably lower, especially given the fact the assistant manager TOLD ME $2 more.  I don't have any concrete proof that he told me, so it's my word versus his. I figured having the director and assistant manager in there wouldn't be a bad idea because that way it won't turn into a big game of he said she said.   I figured with the meeting, I would thank them for giving me this opportunity to further my career, but I was under the impression the promotion would be more. I know I can't be aggressive, but I can't be passive either. It's easier said than done. I don't know if they're going to care it'll literally take 20 years to get to where everybody else is at. Depending on where this meeting goes will determine what the next step is. Part of me is nervous that they'll take away my promotion for questioning them... then it opens up a discriminatory / retaliation case.  But I don't feel right taking the promotion knowing it should be more money.   One of the things I did look up was the NLRA section 7 which basically says employees are allowed to discuss salaries amongst themselves. So during my meeting if they tell me that I'm not allowed to talk about it, I can let them know there's a federal law which protects me, and section 8 of the act basically says they can't retaliate against me for inquiring about other people's pay.  I don't really want to get another job. I live in Las Vegas, and the economy is tough. Not to mention, it took me 2 years to get full time in my department. I don't want to give that up just to have to do it somewhere else and possibility wait longer than that to become full time. I do really like my job for the most part. Working on graveyard is awesome. The people on this shift are cool and want me to better myself. Also, I make tips. A lot of nights were slow, but I make good money for working a shift that isn't too busy.   The casino I work at is not union, so I'm only protected by federal laws. I would like some thoughts and opinions on the matter. Should I fight it? Should I shut up and take the dollar? Am I being a brat? Are there any other laws that protect me, or let upper management do whatever they want? Do I even stand a chance?   Thanks!!"	Yes
I know someone who works at Walmart. They were fired for violating the patriot act according to Walmart. My Friend who I will name Bob(23)  is the Walmart worker. Bob's friend Stu is 16. Stu's dad wanted to send him some money but couldn't because he isn't 18. Instead Stu's dad sends the money to Bob, Bob then signs for the wired money while on break (isn't the issue). Stu also signs the wire transfer. Walmart then fires Bob for violating the Patriot Act and alleges money laundering. Stu was using the money to buy something at the store. Did Bob violate the patriot act?	Yes
This is a lenghty read ... Spoiler, no TL;DR at the end  :(  Some context - the company that my husband works for is based in Ohio. They have offices in many different states as well as Canada. So my husband and I moved to Mississippi from Oklahoma in October due to this employer relocating him. He has worked for this same company since March of 2017. We both work in Tennessee, but we live in Mississippi. We have switched our licenses, car tags, we have a lease on our rental house, etc. We are permanent, legal residents of Mississippi, and no longer have any legal ties in Oklahoma.  So, the company - until November - was still taking out Oklahoma state witholding on the income tax on his paychecks. He called and asked them to change it to Mississippi- which I thought fixed it. No. From then until present they are taking out Tennessee State taxes. ??? We don't live in Tennessee so we will not file Tennessee State taxes - and Tennessee does not have state tax anyway.  Other than that, Mississippi has the stupid Employees Witholding Exemption Certificate that works as the state's W-4 (at least that's how my employer explained it). I had to fill one out for my job, and I told him to submit one for his when we first moved here. They refused it and said it is useless to them because they do not have an office in Mississippi.  So I did the only thing I could think of and submitted a new W-4 for his company where he withholds more on federal so we can make up the difference when tax time next year rolls around. However, when he submitted it, we noticed his paychecks are different but still more than they should be with the extra taxes taken out. They still are not taking out the extra witholding! He sent in an actual signed form that had our witholding amount on it, and the one they're showing on file is an electronically filled out one with no extra witholding form and it is e-signed. They also had him listed as a D.D.S. (yes, Doctor of Dental Surgery) on his paychecks. I can guarantee if he was a DDS, he wouldn't be working for this bass ackwards company!!  I'm beyond frustrated. I just don't know if I have any ground to stand on with getting an attorney/lawyer. If I do I'm more than willing to hire one. I know that this won't affect our taxes that we are about to file much, if at all, it's next year's that I'm worried about. With our extra witholding, do I even need to really be worried about it, or am I thinking way too much about this?? Thanks in advance for any and all advice!!	Yes
Hey everyone, I was hired on to work for an afterschool program at a local school. When I was originally hired on, I was going to be a coordinator that would be paid $12.00 an hour and start in the summer.   However, before I actually started, we found out the Assistant Manager was going to be gone for the summer. I was then told that I would be promoted to Assistant Manager for the summer. With this job, the base pay is usually $14.00, but with my experience I could expect around $14.50-15.00.   So, we started on 6/15, and I've been working full time as Assistant Manager. The entire time my supervisor has been emailing/calling/texting her boss to get her to update my pay to Assistant Manager. She didn't for the last paycheck, and I was under the assumption I would be getting retroactive pay for this paycheck. Today I found out that my pay had still not been updated, so I talked to my supervisor again, and she gave me her supervisor's (the person in charge of updating my pay) phone number and told me that I should text her myself to get her going.   Well, I did. But she didn't text me back, instead she emailed my supervisor and told her that since the original Assistant Manager would be coming back after the summer, they couldn't give me the position, and that I would have to be paid the original $12.00 that I was originally offered.   So, do I have any options? Is there any way I can get compensated for the pay I was expecting? Being the assistant manager is much more difficult than being a coordinator, so I would like higher compensation. My job role is completely different as well. I've pretty much taken on a massive amount more of responsibility and job difficulty on the expectation that I would be paid more for it, but after a month of working with that expectation I've found out that I'm not.	Yes
She worked for Burger King and left because of school, They're withholding her last paycheck. All equipment was turned in.	Yes
"I work for a small company doing manual labor. For the sake of keeping this somewhat private for now, we will say I do lawn maintenance although what I actually do is specific to the area I live and is in high demand. I started working for the company about a year ago. My boss (owner of the company) hired me to fill in for someone who had recently been fired, and him and I (as his helper) were the entire company. I started at $10/hr. As time progressed, i took on more responsibility and after about 4 or 5 months, started doing nearly 100% of the work by myself. My boss then hired a worker to be my helper, and began more of a role that consisted more of doing estimates and taking phone calls. He is not a super presentable guy, though he is very friendly, he's just kind of got this very country/hillbilly vibe about him. Ever since I started working with him, business has been growing substantially faster than it did in the previous 2 years of him owning the company. business is now stronger than ever, and i am being worked to the bone in the summer heat every day using and depending on equipment that is far beyond being in need of repair. It has gotten frustrating to be in charge of everything, (working my *** off), and maintaining to represent the company to the best of my ability, all while making $12/hour on jobs that bring company $2,000-$3000 profit every two days.   This being said, I learned a few months ago that my boss had taken my social security number that he made a copy of when I first started working for him to make me an LLC, unannounced to me. This also included filing a ""workers compensation exemption form"" on my behalf for me. The worker who is my helper is also filed on that llc as my employer/subcontractor (not sure which)I do like my boss, and don't really mind the work if it was for more money, I just feel underpaid for the major role I play in the company.   For the past few months I've been saving and working towards gathering all materials I need to begin doing jobs myself (trailer, about $2000 worth of equipment). I now have almost everything I need, and am only short of getting my own business liability insurance and business license to have everything complete.   My question is, how would you approach the situation if you were in my position? I do like my boss and wouldn't mind continuing to subcontract for his company. However, I'm not sure how he will handle the news that I may become his competition. The way I see it- For the entire length of employment with this company, I have been miscatagorized as a subcontractor. I am now doing what is necisarry for me to actually be subcontracted by him (or another company in the same field.. 2 of which have offered to pay me more than double what my current boss does, but those two company's were both under the impression at the time that the equipment I had with me was all mine when it was actually my current bosses). An arrangement where I help to train my worker to fill my position while my own business picks up seems ideal to me, but am I being too hopeful thinking he would continue to employ me when he knows I'm going to give him competition on my own? I know he is going to feel betrayed and tell me it's a bad idea etc. I'm just trying to think of the best way to present it to him so that the process that both he and I will soon undergo is relatively seamless. I feel like we could both still help each other to an extent, I'm just not sure how to phrase it."	Yes
My mother has been sexually harassed at her workplace for about a year or more. She works at a big name energy company that priorities safety for their employees in the workplace as their number one commitment (I know, I've worked with this company as a summer student many years). My mother and father live in this small company town (about 650 population) and they both work for this company at different places/roles. I live a province away and I've heard most of this through my father and sister (who still lives home).   My parents marriage has been suffering so much over the past year and it was seriously stressing out my sister and I as well. My father, sister and I could tell that my mother wasn't the same as she once was, always hiding away from us/people, getting mad with us for no particular reason, blaming my father for things that isn't his fault and just all around being distant and not being a part of the family. I don't even know how to explain this.   Now this may have been going on for more than a year but my mother only told us about her struggles within the last month. I don't know all the details. I know he has touched her body sometimes, talked about her body, and tried to convince her to have an affair. For a year, or more. She had to put up with this kind of guy. I know this guy who harassed her almost ruined her marriage (or still may) as well as part of her life. And perhaps the rest of her life will be altered by this too. My mother is very old school and didn't even want to tell us or let HR of this company know about what has been going on. She doesn't want to ruin the life of the guy who has been harassing her and his family (it's a small town everyone knows everyone) and she doesn't want people to know this has been happening in case they judge her, even if she gets moved to a different work area to get away from him. She thinks that people won't like her or be different around her because she told on him. She's insecure. My mother is on antidepressants to deal with this. She pushed her family members away to deal with this. She's done crazy things she never would have thought about doing before- driving 12 hours away from the town to get away, contemplate suicide, etc.   Today, he got called into HR to discuss what has been happening and he has denied ALL of it. HR said they need proof. We understand that. The problem is: there is no proof. No texts. No interaction over social media. No cameras. No co workers have seen (and my mother is convinced if they did, they wouldn't say anything). My mother said she knew this would happen because the guy told her that if she told ever told anyone, he would deny all of it. My mother wrote out specific scenarios that occurred with this guy who harassed her. The HR manager believes my mother but can not do anything without proof. My mother has written 15 pages of what this guy has said and done to her. These 15 pages made my father cry.   What can be done to bring justice?	Yes
So my story starts in September of 2016. I was laid off at my Insurance firm and went on unemployment. On May 1st I went back to my old job after the contacted me back. I hate to feel this way but last week pay  cuts got brought up and it kinda felt like it was suggested to take to cut or your going to be let go. I'm just wondering what my rights are. I think I exhausted all my unemployment before so I'm not sure if he lets me go I will have anything to fall back on. Serious advice only please 	Yes
Husband works in the oilfield.  They want to close down the yard here and relocate him to Oklahoma.  If he says no they say he has to quit so he won't get severance or unemployment.  What are his options?  Is this legal?	Yes
This is in Michigan. I don't know if that's relevant.  On Friday, July 14th we were supposed to be paid but there was a mistake and only about 5 people got paid out of all the employees throughout five locations in the franchise.  The district manager says the only way he'll pay us is if we prob we didn't get paid. The only way I know how to do this is by printing up my account summary and bringing it in but I really don't feel like it's their business. Then after we do that, we get a paper check and have to sign a form and write down how much our check was for everyone to see. We have no way of verifying whether the check is even the right amount.   I understand not wanting to pay us twice but the way he's treating people who just pretty much worked for free for the past two weeks is a bit rude...pretty much telling us 'you have to share all this personal information in order to get paid because of a mistake we made'.  This isn't the first shady thing this employer has done and I've been waiting for something like this to get them in trouble. I know how to file a wage claim, as I've had to before​. But are they technically withholding my wages?   Am I just looking too much into this because I'm bitter and spiteful?	Yes
"I'll try to make this short.  About a year ago, I, a minor, signed an NDA with an online tech startup based out of California. I cosigned with my parent(s) to do so. I signed my NDA under the presumption that I would be doing work, and getting paid for said work; where the latter was false. It worked out swell for a few months, but my boss started to miss paychecks -- skipping entire months of pay saying that I didn't deserve it because I was ""useless"" and so on. Just a few days ago, a direct competitor offered me a job with them and I decided that I was done with the B.S. that my boss was throwing at me, so I put in my two weeks notice saying that I was going to explore my options at other companies. Instead of working my two weeks, my access was fully removed across all platforms and he told me that in no uncertain terms, he would be suing me if I were to join a competitor. As for what, specifically, he has eluded to the doctrine of ""inevitable disclosure"". Now, I've done my fair share of homework, and there are no clauses in my NDA that prevent me from leaving him and joining a competitor. There are clauses that refer to him being able to apply for an injunction to stop me from revealing his CI in whole or in part, but that's only under the presumption that I have revealed his CI or have threatened to reveal it (which I have done neither).  I've been talking to my parents, and they think that he, for lack of a better way to say it, can't do anything. I'm not joining the competitor to reveal his CI, I'm joining the competitor because they treat me better and pay me more. I never signed a working agreement or contract with him, and it's safe to say that the entirety of the pay that I earned with him was under-the-table. Whenever I alluded to me being his employee (prior this entire ordeal), he'd be very quick to remind me that I am in fact only an 'independent contractor', and not his employee. I don't know if that's relevant to this question, but I thought it may be.  So my question, to you, is the following: What are my options? I have several offers from competitors, offers that I very much want to take, but he's saying if I take any of them w/out his prior written approval (exemption in writing), he'll file suit. Keep in mind, I am a minor from Canada, and he is an adult from California. I am afraid that if I take an offer from a competitor, he will file suit and I'll have to deal with that accordingly. He does have my address, so he can serve me papers (excuse my naivety for the legal process, I'm by no means an expert). My parents think that I am fine, and I can take an offer from the competitor. They've also said (paraphrasing): ""what is he going to do? Extradite you?"", in response to my fears of being sued. They think that if he files suit, I can simply ignore it and let it drift in the water, because what can he do? I'm a minor from Canada, and I haven't even broken his agreement.  Sorry if this post got a little long. I hope I included all relevant details. If you have any questions that I can clarify/expound upon please don't hesitate to ask."	Yes
"My OP here: https://np.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/6mtunq/recruiter_pressuring_me_and_sending_red_flags/  (Tenn.) I have no official offer letter, start date, salary, nor do I have that I accepted the job anywhere in writing. I have an email from the recruiter saying she accepted the job for me, but I never responded to it. After I sent an email explaining why I wanted to renege and cancel my contract with the recruitment firm (per my reasons in the original post) and take myself out of the running for the job the recruiter sent me an email stating: ""You signed a waiver that stated that if you accept the offer and don’t show up for the first day of work , accept a counter offer or don’t stay for a minimum of 90 days in that position– that you are financially responsible for the repayment of the placement fee ($9000). I have all the documentation that supports your acceptance and where you state you would tender your resignation and would like to start on the 7th of August""  I said I would LIKE to start on that date, but again, never said I accepted in writing nor was I given a start date or official offer. I spoke to the company who would be hiring me and they are baffled by all of this from the recruiters.   I have a copy of my contract saying: 1. If the Candidate fails to report to work on her/his first day of employment with said employer for no reason or any reason other than major substantiated intervening acts beyond the control of the Candidate (e.g. severe weather, hospitalization, etc.), the Candidate agrees to pay The [recruiters] a fee for the placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate. 2. If the Candidate voluntarily terminates said employment for any reason or is terminated for cause by said employer within the first ninety (90) business days of employment, the Candidate agrees to pay [recruiters] a fee for [recruiters] placement services rendered of 25% of the starting salary offered by said employer and accepted by the Candidate.   Does this have any ground to stand on?? Can they actually force me to take the job or pay them that fee with nothing in writing?"	Yes
After moving to an open work space, my focus and attention struggles has really been exasperated and with a family history of mental health struggles I started accepting I might be no longer overcoming my own outside of professional help. I started seeking out help on my own accord knowing I needed to improve. In a meeting with my boss about my unsatisfactory performance, I disclosed to them I had just met with my physician to begin the process of getting help.   I also reached out to HR that day seeking resources for help, if there were any. HR scheduled a meeting with me and my boss to understand my situation and during this meeting I had informed them that I was meeting with a therapist through EAP.   Now, my position is being terminated and I was informed of this the day before my therapist appointment. Though I am bring offered a generous severance and the papers explicitly state this was a decision being made before I sought help from them, it's with an obvious condition that I have no legal options.   I don't want to continue in my position, however I think this is a very questionable time line of events and I don't want this to happen to anyone else. Unfortunately I have not been officially diagnosed with anything - the earliest I could see an actual doctor in my area for this was going to be months in advance. Clearly I have no time to go do so before I have to make a decision to sign.	Yes
Hey guys,  I've been serving at a restaurant for a little over 4-5 months. A few weeks ago I was appearing on the schedule less often, and recently, the schedule was sent out and I wasn't on it at ALL. I hadn't been informed of anything, or talked to by anyone about this happening, but since there has been some tension at work regarding myself and other employees, I wondered if I had gotten fired.   So, naturally, I brought it up in the group chat that our coworkers and managers use to communicate with each other, asking if I was fired. My manager texted me, saying they *needed to investigate something regarding my past behavior, and before they got any conclusion I was suspended.* I asked him *what past behavior*, he said he *didn't know, and needed to talk to a few people first.* Furthermore, *there was no conclusion, and they may never get a solid conclusion.* So I asked him *why am I being suspended if he doesn't know what he's suspending me for*, he responded saying *you should ask yourself what happened, that (I) had said something to a coworker about something which was against the interest and honesty of the restaurant, there was no conclusion, and he was going to talk to a few people then talk to me.*  I was so confused, I know that there is no law requirement saying you have to tell someone why you're firing them, but he didn't say I was fired, he said I was suspended.   It has been over 2 weeks since he told me this, and has still not gotten back to me, nor has he put me on the schedule as I'm still part of the chat and see it every week.   Is there anything I can do?	Yes
Hi, I'm 17m working at a fast food chain in CT. My boss is taking hours from myself and the other workers. He's done this before, I had my hours written down and he told me that I changed them to give me more hours. Last time he did this, he shorted me by about 14 hours. Well now I have my printed receipts for the hours that I worked. He told one of my co workers that the hours I stayed late with her, because it was busy, I won't get paid for.(to clarify this is maybe an hour once or twice a week) I get paid on Tuesday.  My questions are, if my hours don't match up, what should I do to get them back? Can I sue him over this? What about my co workers, they don't have any evidence that they worked more than he has said, can they get any hours back?	Yes
"I'm an idiot. I've been spending, on average, 3-4 hours a day out of my 7.5 hour work-day (Monday - Friday, 9 - 5) for the past... 2 years on this website, both general surfing and posting (probably 2000 posts? no idea, at least that). I'm the only person in the company who does what I do, I took over for a retiree and there was no manual/documentation of anything, I just trained with her for a month and then learned the rest on my own and I'm integral to the department (primarily finance/secondarily admin role, don't want to get more detailed).    My boss isn't a very good actor and he's been saying/doing a lot of things over the past few weeks that make me think they're trying to get me to tell them everything about how I do my job, before they fire me. I've never had a warning for the amount of internet usage or anything but there's no reason otherwise they'd consider firing me, and like I said, I can read my boss pretty well and he's not a good actor.    If they do tell me that they're firing me and it's due to the high usage, can I say ""No, that wasn't me""? Like, can I demand proof? I'm not part of a union and I'm *pretty sure* they can fire me for any reason, but would making a demand like that do anything? Is there any possibility of legal repercussions if I argue it and make them prove it? The company is undergoing very public downsizing, so if I say I got laid off I can go on unemployment benefits, but if I got fired then I wouldn't be eligible. **Side question** If I file for unemployment, would the company tell the unemployment office that I was fired as opposed to let go? I assume yes, but would like to know. I realize I'm a piece of shit, I'm looking for a new job either way so all of this is just temporary anyways."	Yes
"Sorry this is a second post.  This is a separate issue.  I work at a corporately owned restaurant as a bartender-and there is a lot of shady practices.  Right now they are attempting to get me to quit/ fire me and I need to know what my rights are and if I am in a position to file for unemployment insurance in Ontario- and how to go about it.  Here's the run down:  *  I've been asked to resign in writing by the GM- they've threatened to fire me if I do not. * There is a lot of pressure to resign and the GM is angry when I do not * I did not resign, but I have been outright removed from next weeks schedule (they expected me to resign) prior to my refusal  * This is the second time I've been removed from the schedule- in November for 2 weeks I was given zero hours AND name was removed from the schedule- complained and was given hours * Have been asked multiple times if ""I am happy here"" and ""why haven't you resigned""  or they don't ""understand why I keep working here"" * Was provided with 3 writes up immediately following refusal to resign: I did have a bad week last week, however was not informed in writing or verbally reprimanded for anything after it happened. * Have not been provided with an opportunity or plan to fix any issues in the write ups.      I feel a strong pressure to leave, and clearly am a person non grata at the business- I know they want want me leave, yet don't seem to want to fire me and am attempting to force me to resign.    Where does this leave me?  Can I do anything via the Ministry of Labour?  Am I in a position to collect unemployment insurance while I find a new job?  Advice please?"	Yes
My father fell at work (construction) in November 2016, tripping over a tarp on the ground. At the time he was sore but no severe or lasting pain. Two weeks later, he was laid off for the winter season, starting back to work in April. In early December he was casting a fishing rod and his shoulder dislocated. He was able to pop it back in and has been fine until the last few months. He has had his shoulder dislocate a number of times since April and more recently 3 times over the last week. These dislocations are severely painful for him, to the point that the pain is unbearable for him. A doctor's appointment with xray results showed that there was an past (healed) fracture and new liesions, most likely as a result of repeated dislocations. I am wondering if this is a workmans comp issue since the only fall that could have caused a fracture was at work last November, or if this would not qualify for workman's comp.	Yes
So I'm an employee at subway. This particular one is owned by a shady ass dude. He owns many others as well. To preface, this has never happened to me, I don't work enough hours, but there is hard proof this has happened to an old coworker and the regional manager of these subways. To avoid paying either of these people overtime, when they are working 60-80 hour weeks. He has been doing this for some time. He gets around paying them overtime by sending 2 checks, each from a different store. He has also payed many employees in cash/ with a personal check in place of a paycheck in order to keep the taxes that were taken out for himself. I have hard evidence of this too, even though it has never happened to me. The owner, let's call him DT, has been doing this for 5+ years, systematically taking advantage of undereducated employees and people dependent on a job at his subways so that no one has/can challenge him. So my question is this: is DT just shady as all fuck, or could they have a legitimate case against him?	Yes
I've been working in a French international NGO dealing with an emergency crisis in my country (Lebanon) for 2.5 years. I am currently at a program manager level (head of a department) and thus I'm involved in medium level decision making and I'm involved in proposal writing and strategy design. In the meantime, I have been volunteering with a local charity for more than 6 years. This charity, of which I consider myself one of the founders, has been growing and has merged with a local NGO. I now have the opportunity to take part of that local NGO as one of its youth club's board members. (Non-paying, volunteer position). And thus will definitely have a say in the strategy and program design. I might also be involved in submitting proposals for funding. Would be a conflict of interest if take up that opportunity? Note that our current area of intervention (geographical), scope of work (what we do), and target demographics, are mutually exclusive. But obviously this could change with time.  I am worried that it would be considered unaccountable towards either of my beneficiaries. I am also worried about my employability and to negatively affect either one of the NGOs.   From a Humanitarian Standards/Principles point of view as well as French Law, am I considered in conflict of interest?	Yes
"(suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.  At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.  I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was ""I'll talk to you when I get back"" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule.   Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there.   This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting.   But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying ""I'm too sick to work"" contradicts ""The way you run this place is inhospitable for me"".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there.   What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?"	Yes
"I truly apologize for the wall of text, I am very frustrated at the moment and more than anything trying to document the situation in a public forum, as well as vent a bit. I do apologize if this is against this subs rules.   I arrived to work at my restaurant today as I always do, clocked in, and moved to the line where food is served, as my job entails ensuring that orders are accurate, prepared on time, and delivered to the appropriate diners.    After working for less than 15 minutes. I was immediately approached by my manager, and asked to step outside with him to have a conversation.   He immediately accused me of being intoxicated, stating that I had been slurring my words. He had not heard anything out of the ordinary, but an un-named source had reported the ""slurring"" to him. He stated the I did not smell of alcohol, nor did I appear drunk, but he was, ""worried something was going on.""     After speaking with him for about 15 minutes, pointing out that I have never had any alcohol on the job (before or during), did not smell of alcohol, and was clearly not drunk. He appeared to agree with me. Moments later, he asked thay I clock out (depriving me of a shift that I desperately need) and leave immediately. Additionally, he mentioned that he would ""let everyone know know that I was simply being sent home because I was ""sick"", as the staff had all already been told I was ""drunk"".   I relieve there may well be no legal recourse here, thought this feels very much like classic defamation, especially considering all of my co-workers were well aware of my manufactured drunkenness.   If there is nothing I can do, then so be it. I guess I will just be the guy who shows up to work drunk, except I don't, and never would.   TL:DR: accused of showing up to work drunk. Was not drunk, at all. Was sent home with no pay. Anything I can do?"	Yes
"Hi,  I just received an offer for a company to work ""remote"" anywhere I want in the US. Their HQ is located in a state with state income tax. Meanwhile, I live in a state without state income tax.   Would I have to pay the state income tax of their HQ?"	Yes
This is Washington State, US.   I applied to work for a company called [Fun Flicks](http://funflicks.com/). It was a strange process to get this job. The interview was conducted outside and was really casual. It seemed too easy to get the job. It was an unusually small amount of time from application to being on board. Almost all of our communication has been via text, and I have not been shown the building they operate out of. I gave them my application with some sensitive information on it, that's all I am worried about. None of the information seemed out of the ordinary for a job application, but it is still concerning. They said I was 'on board' in May, and nothing happened after that besides some texting about the position. The last time we talked was a month ago. It all seems very odd. I can't even find one in Washington on Google maps. Either they are sort of unprofessional, or something sinister is afoot. What can I do to check the legitimacy of this company/job offer? Is there even a scam like this? Thanks	Yes
"My husbands previous employer is wanting him to pay to have the office rekeyed because he did not have them sign off that the key was returned. My husband left all of his keys on his desk on his last day. It was only him and the owner there that day, and the front office person who is now contacting him after 7 months was not.  For a little more explanation, my husband used to work for a small office, he had to leave due to our daughters health issues and constant hospital trips...his former boss lost his mind when he told him his plan to leave. He resorted to calling him names, and berating him for hours at a time in his last two weeks about how he is ""not a man"" and it's the ""wife's job to stay at home"" among other even worse things. My husband didn't want to cause a scene or stoop to his level so he pretty much just put up with it until it was his last day. His boss kept saying that ""he would be back"" and when my husband actually tried to hand him the keys he refused. So instead, he left them on his cleaned out desk."	Yes
Hey guys sorry for the anonymous, this is something I would rather not be tied too. That being said, here it goes.  I have worked for a city agency for 3 years now and for 2 or so of those years almost everyday people make sexual jokes about me or my sexual orientation, this ranges from my coworkers to my boss and even his boss, the second in command. The top dog does not know anything about it.  This all stemmed from a conversation about sexual experiences in the beginning of my employment.  Day in and day out jokes are made. For example: I got to work this morning and not even an hour later a joke about me being gay came up. This happens on average 3-6 times a day.  I know the second I say anything to them it will just make work suck even more.  I would rather not do anything since this is my only form income. I used to love doing what I do and I still do it just sucks being around the people that constantly make these jokes.  Do I have any recourse other than to just quit my job?  Is it my fault for letting it go on so long?	Yes
"So, bare with me as I write this! My girlfriend has a degree in Film/Communications and roughly about a year n half ago one of her old professors came to her asking if she'd like to help edit a local man's film. She met with the man and all the material was shit, she agreed to try and edit and make it salvageable. She was able to finish it and he was able to air it a local arts theater about 8 months ago. The original agreement was for them to pay her ($250) on the spot at the airing, well that never happened. The man and his family started making excuses about how they wanted some stuff changed before paying her. At this point she was already frustrated, but agreed to help out. Well several months go by of her trying to meet with them and more excuses or them canceling on her. The last meeting consisted of her and his parents, where they basically tried to tell her they weren't paying her anything until they were 100% satisfied with the material and they were expecting her to hand over what she had, so at that point I refused to let her hand anything over until they paid what they owed. After that meeting and one more failed attempt to meet with her they just went silent and at this point she just basically wrote it off as a loss instead of trying to go out of her way to pursue it. Well it's been about 5 or 6 months since and now suddenly he decided to text her telling her how he'd making a new movie and how he wants to pay her. Well she works  50 hour weeks and doesn't have the time to meet and really doesn't even want to meet in person, so she responded letting him know she' doesn't have the time, but would be more than willing for him to send her a payment or a check in the mail and then she would send him the Flash drive with all the data and movie. Suddenly he went from ""hey Sam"" to ""I'll just take to court Sam. I don't do my business like that and that's that.""   Sorry for the long winded paragraph, but basically I'd like to know what kind of legal actions we should take and what to do from here. We're right on the border of Michigan and Ohio and if we were to go to court it would be probably be Ohio if that helps any!"	Yes
(Throwaway for obvious reasons) I wor for a small business outside of Philly in PA, USA. My boss has an unsecured computer that both employees and customers are left alone with on a regular basis. He has never given us any instruction on what we can and cannot access on said computer. I was dicking around and I found that they keep massive caches of customer and employee information on the computer, with no password protection or anything. I found email lists with names and emails of all the customers; vet records for the dogs (it's a doggy daycare); email and phone number lists for all current and former employees, and a copy of each current employee's w-2, which list our social security numbers.   Can I pursue legal actions? And if so, what will probably happen?  They also have old texts and Facebook posts from employees screenshotted on the computer, but that seems like less of a legal issue and more of an ethical one.	Yes
"I recieved a felony DUI in Oregon last year. I served two months earlier this year and am out. I have a decent job now, however a couple ""dream jobs"" have opened up lately. Here is where I run into an issue. I do not know what to answer on the ""Have you been convicted of a felony (sometimes it asks for lower level crimes too, misdemeanor, etc) box. Now before you say to tell the truth, Oregon law EXPLICITLY does not allow that question. Oregon law HB 3025 states: This legislation prohibits an employer from requiring an applicant: to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction; to disclose, prior to an initial interview, a criminal conviction; or if no interview is conducted, to disclose, prior to a conditional offer of employment, a criminal conviction. Portland (where I live) then takes it a step farther, basically stating that they must offer conditional employment before asking about a conviction. They are not even allowed to ask DURING the interview. They must first offer me a conditional offer of employment (cuz ya know, Oregon). After that, if they learn that I have a felony, they can only rescind if the felony directly applies to the line of work I would be in. So this leaves me in a weird spot. When filling out job applications, local companies and national companies (even ones with large legal divisions, think Amazon, various national mortgage agencies) ask that question. It is yes, or no, and you cannot proceed without selecting an answer. Do I tell the truth and have a 0% chance at getting the job, or do I lie since they are breaking a law by even asking that question? It gets even more complicated when looking at tax breaks for hiring felons. They get $2400 for hiring a felon within 1 year of his release date, and are protected by a federal bonding program where they can receive $5,000 fidelity bonds, free of charge, as an incentive to hire job seekers that do not qualify for commercial fidelity bonds. Some applications afterwards have you fill out a WOTC where it asks you questions about foodstamps, government assitance, and being a felon. If we decide that lying is the best course of action, do I then tell the truth on the WOTC part of the application to then not be considered a felon on the part of the application where I am being illegally discriminated against, but be considered a felon on the tax credit part where being a felon works to the companies advantage?  If anyone has any in depth knowledge of this law, or my best course of action, please advise."	Yes
My record is clean, except for one non-violent misdemeanor in a different state from April 2011. Is there any way I can get this expunged, so it won't ruin my chances at getting a decent job?	Yes
Here's the situation: I'm an engineer. I've been working at my present company since May 2014. My wife and I are moving from Canada (Alberta) to England in August. My manager, who is a close friend of mine and knows we're moving, accidentally let it slip to my director yesterday that I was going to be leaving the company. My director called me today and asked me about it, so not wanting to lie, I told him that I would be leaving soon, but made it clear that I would be available to work until August 11th which is a week before the move. 5 minutes later he emailed me and he is now asking for me to submit my 2 weeks written notice by the end of the week, in effect shorting me of 3 weeks of work (and thousands of dollars in pay.) Do I have any options or am I screwed?	Yes
"It has been a drawn out process in which she has been retaliating against me.   Essentially I had been told one thing (attendance point policy was not thoroughly enforced by her) before I reported her for theft, but afterward I ended up receiving disciplinary actions on attendance which no one on my team was receiving prior, or seemed to be after.  I noticed my boss had a ""tell"" when she was caught lying, which was to explain a process or reasoning behind a situation in full detail and seemingly out of the blue. The product that was missing? It was found in an obscure location and we don't know why it was there, but it was there.   I let my boss' questionable behavior and seemingly loose morals slide for a while, until the stress became unbearable. At which point I reported her, it was anonymous at first. A week or so after the report I brought up the fact I was stressed and made a report to the manager above my boss (who is also close friends with my boss) I had falsely believed this would help the situation and I wanted the stress to go away because I knew I was pregnant and I was concerned the stress would negatively effect my pregnancy (and even told my boss' boss as much).   That was all back in February. I spent time in the following months by feeling miserable but also looking to transfer to a different department or store. However I felt concerned and afraid my boss would not allow me to transfer and once she knew I was trying would react negatively against me even more than before. By May the work environment had become so stressful to me that I told my boss I would rather die than go to work so I needed to seek help. I spoke with HR and they brushed my concerns aside. Then I set up a leave of absence to seek help on the issue. As soon as I heard a return to work date from my doctor I notified my boss and said I would like part time hours (I was working full time before leave). My boss made no indication this would be an issue or against policy until two weeks later on the day before I was set to return. On the day before my leave was up I was informed by HR that I needed a doctor's note with restrictions stating I must work part time for my health. If that option was not used I was to apply to any job in the company as part time. Not my job I had, but any job with no guarantee I would be hired.  Being that it was the end of a business day I could not reach my doctor to get a note in time so I was unable to work my first shift back. My doctor was then out of the office for 6 days (although two were weekend days) I had been scheduled to work in quite a few of those days so I emailed HR asking what I needed to do until my doctor returned. HR directed me to the 3rd party leave office but my question pertained to the store operations, so I rephrased my question in another email and finally got an answer.   By the time my doctor responded I decided to quit. I would have loved to stay at that job but the attitudes of the office and management made me feel like a target.   I suppose what I am hoping for from this situation is at least to have my medical bills paid. I am coming to terms with not having a great job (besides my boss) but am disappointed things happened this way despite telling every manager I spoke with about this situation ""I don't want to get fired for being honest"" and being reassured that nothing negative would come from me making a report."	Yes
This is slightly personal, hence the throwaway, and this situation is based in South East Asia. So, I know that there will be a certain degree of difference but I just want to know what I can expect. Also note that I am not the embezzler  If a person has been embezzling money from the company and the company goes to the cops, will the tax records of the company be under scrutiny?   Also, if the some of the money embezzled has been used to buy houses listed under that person's kids names, will that money be recouped? Alternatively, is there any way to force the person to return the money without going to the police?	Yes
"Hello all, I work as a seasonal full time employee at my college over the summers. It's a pretty sweet deal, because I get to live in campus apartments for free, on top of having a full time job. I have a second job as well. This summer, I'm working with the catering crew in the dining hall. They have lost a few people, leaving us a bit understaffed, and as a result we've been over scheduled and worked over forty hours in one week four times.   We sign in by writing down when we came in and took our breaks, and then we sit down while our boss enters our time in online based on what hours we've worked. However, she lies about when we come in - when we reach overtime, we are told that we're not allowed to work overtime, so we ""have"" to spread our hours out in the pay period to prevent that. My friend who is also working this job this summer got fourteen hours of over time. She was unable to even claim all of her hours - she's not getting paid for the full time she worked because we were closed down for a week, and it would look suspicious to put down times that no one else would have at all in the entire dining hall staff.   I personally have five hours of overtime that I was told I couldn't claim, and my boss put it down for last Friday and said if anyone asks, we could lie and say I only came in to help unload a delivery truck. In the state of Virginia, which is where I am, overtime (which is when you exceed forty hours in one week) is paid by time and a half, so instead of making $7.25 on those five hours (and my friend on her fourteen that she didn't even get to claim all of), we should have been getting paid $10.88 for each of the hours that we worked over the forty hour limit. By spreading the hours over the pay period, we are only getting paid the minimum for our week of overtime.   I have worked forty hours in the past three days. I'm poor and mostly self supporting, and I used the promise of my paycheck motivate myself to pull through. I need all of the extra money I can get, and frankly, after pulling 12+ hour shifts and only getting six hours of sleep, I feel pretty freaking cheated. My friend is really upset too, because she's in the same boat, and she recently lost her second job.   I have emailed the Virginia Department of Labor, because I went to my boss's supervisor and asked why I couldn't claim the over time that I had worked. He said ""Well, it's just not in the budget."" I asked him who made the budget, and he said it was campus administration. I ran into my work study employers from the school year, and asked why I was being told I couldn't claim over time. He said the school has the money for it, but doesn't want to pay for it. He also said however that what my boss is doing is extremely wrong, because he's had to give people overtime before. He got chewed out for it, but the student worker was still able to claim their hours and he just made sure not to schedule the student overtime again.   What should I be ready for?? I honestly have no idea what's going to happen from here on out. And I don't want to get in trouble with my boss at work for snitching, or for anyone to get fired, I just want me and my other coworkers to get paid for what we did according to the state's labor laws."	Yes
Just like it says in the title, I'm paid $27,040 salary plus a tiered commission based on my sales. My employer claims he doesnt have to pay OT and expects me to work late to meet with clients and also has me work 8 hours overtime every other week for marketing events outside of work.   Obviously its time to find a new job but my question is, is he correct? I can't find anything concrete through google.	Yes
"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_mealperiods.htm For reference.  The law, as I interpret it: If I don't get a lunch within the 1st 5 hours of work, they need to pay me an extra hour's worth of pay. So if I get to work at 6 AM, work until 1 PM, get a 30 minute lunch then, then keep working till 5:30, they need to pay(All numbers pre-tax):  1) 6 AM to 1 PM - 7 hours of straight pay. Say $20/hour for a total of $140   2) Nothing from 1 PM to 1:30 PM - Unpaid lunch   3) 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM - 1 hour of straight pay. Another $20/hour, total of $20   4) 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM - 3 hours of overtime @$30/hour  - Total of $90   5) Since I didn't get my lunch at the correct hour, one more hour of pay at regular time - $20    I learned about point 5 recently, and did the math - it ties out to within the dollar on pre-tax amounts if 1-4 are included, but 5 is nowhere to be seen. Am I correct in thinking that they're missing that pay?  Additional details, since so much about labor law is in the details:  1) I work for a bank   2) I'm salary non-exempt   3) I'm in an operations position   4) I don't oversee anyone   5) I'm not in the entertainment industry     Standard: If correct, the usual advice seems to be ""Go file a complaint with the labor board, be prepared for retaliation."" My current plan is this: I have a mentor who's midway up the food chain without a dog in the fight. I'd like to give the company a chance to fix it themselves. I figure I can talk with him, see if he can get a review of pay going, and hopefully everything will be fixed without needing to go to the labor board. Else, off to the labor board I go, most likely.   Is anything wrong about my reasoning? Have I made any fatal mistakes anywhere? Is my interpretation of the law incorrect? (The law in question I'm looking at is also on the break room board)  Thank you!"	Yes
Weird situation but this is where I'm turning. I am in sales and share a territory with another individual. My colleague has had issues adapting to the workload and was written up for performance.   Here's where my issue starts. They have ties to a higher up in my company. They were able to work something out where she was not to come Into the office, but rather look for a new position outside the company. In the mean time their side if the territory was left without support and those who needed her support reached out to me. It just so happened thay while they were out looking for a new job, her territory landed some big deals and netted her with a commission check that doubles my own. But I supported the territory and picked up the slack for them while they were gone. This went on for 2 months.   They were unable to find a job and are now being allowed to return to work where they are to simply try again. Conveniently when quarterly commission gets paid out. I'm a loss for what to do here because I feel quite used by my company. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
Recently (a month) I accepted a job that I am very unhappy at and know will not work out for me in the long run. I am an at will employee and both the offer letter and the employee handbook mentions that management requires 14 days notice in case of quitting. Now would i be in any legal trouble if I quit immediately?	Yes
I started working for the company over 4 months ago and I have only taken one day off (for my grandmas funeral). My mom thinks I have a staph infection but I want to go to the doctor to make sure that I am ok ( I have been feeling nauseous for the last few days and I have this sore on my foot that itches). The company has about 12 employees including me. My real question really is if there is anything in Texas law about paid time off, vacation days, and sick days, for a small company. I also was wondering about not receiving check stubs when I am being paid. He takes taxes, SS, and health insurance out of my check and that is shown at the bottom of the actual check but I feel like check stubs should be in place. Any thoughts and advice??	Yes
"Hi guys,   Canadian here working for a US employer, and signed an ""at will"" employment contract so all of this might be moot (not sure about cross border law, hence the Reddit thread)   Long story short I got a new boss and he appears to be laying the groundwork to dismiss me. First the shenanigans:   - He hired two of his buddies and they go out together and exclude me.   - I work in sales and they hired us account executives a lead gen person... Only she didn't even know I existed until I reached out, so she's been working for them and not me for about a month now.   - My boss is a total moron and makes countless mistakes in paperwork that gets sent to customers, and then he turns around and blames me for lacking attention to detail.   -He'll forget to follow up with customers and then throw me under the bus to His boss.   - He's a fat piece of shit, and makes jealous jokes about me being thin, my superior martial arts background, pedigreed work history, etc.    I can do no right. I tell a short joke it should be longer, a long joke it should be shorter.   The past 2 months there has been a marked increase in *written communication.* Everything is documented in email form, so I'm pretty sure I'm getting setup.   I tried speaking with his boss who simply told me to ""manage my manager.""   I'm afraid of HR because I know they exist to protect the company, not necessarily me.   I've been forwarding emails to myself, along with copies of the mistakes he has made, Skype messages, keeping notes on conversations, etc. Is this valuable?   What can I do?   Thanks Reddit!"	Yes
Obviously I would be ineligible for unemployment benefits, but the idea of not having to list a termination on my work history is appealing.   I'm mostly wondering if resigning would impair my ability to seek legal relief regarding how my termination has been handled.	Yes
"I am male, and I recently had several job interviews at a company that is ""WBE certified"" and several of the questions were in line with the one above.  ""If a female co-worker was promoted ahead of you, how would that make you feel?""  ""Can you work in an office where most of your co-workers are female?""  I didn't get the job, and I kinda feel like I'm lucky since so much concern was front-loaded about gender. But I felt like most of these questions about gender were invalid in the least. For example, I see no reason why gender has to play any role in being a good manager.  Anyway, did these questions cross a line?"	Yes
EMT here; I found out my partner is getting about 200/week from a manager at our competitor in exchange for telling everything going on here. She provided a copy of our operations manual and got 500.00 for it; one of our encrypted radios that she reported missing they gave her 1000.00 for. Do I have any responsibility here or is she just an ethics nightmare?  And is corporate espionage just a lousy thing to do, or an actual crime?	Yes
What rights do employees have in this case? I recieved benefits for about 5 months, they audited my account, found my employer wasn't paying in, now they want ALL the money back. I have no idea what to do.	Yes
"Location: I do not want to get too specific because it will identify me. If there are major laws that apply to this that are state specific please let me know.       Background: I am a software engineering intern at a major ""non-tech"" company. I was told at orientation that interns were not allowed to work overtime- but that if we went over a bit we would be compensated for it and it wasn't too big of a deal. I have been working here for several weeks now and every pay cycle I have received a bit of overtime- nothing major. Maybe an hour or 2.       This pay cycle I was supposed to receive 2.5 hours of over time- the reason being that I was unable to leave work at an earlier time so I went over 40 hours. Instead of sitting and doing nothing until I can leave I continued to work. I found out that the online time sheet i fill out was manually adjusted to remove ALL overtime I have worked this pay cycle. I was told this is because ""interns are not allowed to work over time"" but nothing I signed through employment seems to indicate that. I did a quick run through all the documents I signed ctrl + f for terms like ""intern"", ""overtime"" and nothing came up.      I am absolutely furious that I ended up wasting time at work that I will not be compensated for. What are my rights? Since I am an intern I don't think I can afford a lawyer (and a company this big surely has some pretty decent lawyers I'd assume). I just don't know where to go from here on out.      For what its worth- this company has had controversy over overtime pay in the past which I found through some googling. I don't want to allow myself to be treated unfairly just because I am an intern. Any advice?     In case it isn't clear: I am an hourly intern unlike most of the full time employees who are salaried."	Yes
I know an employer can round to the nearest quarter/eigth hour legally, but can they switch between exact time and rounding depending on what benefits them?  Can they legally round start times to the latest eighth and end times to the earliest? Say a 7:06 to 3:40 work day with an unpaid 30m lunch that results in a paycheck for 7.75 hours.  My start and finish times are very irregular, but my hours are always lower than what I'm calculating no matter which rounding method I select.	Yes
I've been working at a small startup (UK) for about a year now and I've been pretty unhappy for a while so I decided to look elsewhere. I am considering working for a direct competitor.  My boss and I work very closely, and we both acknowledge that we do not get along. The idea of me departing has been discussed and it would not be a shock if I resigned.  In my search for jobs that suit my skill-set, I found a position identical to mine at a direct competitor. It is at a huge organisation, *pays 1.5x the salary*, and offers more opportunity to grow in my career. To be honest it's a dream job.   After interviewing, I'm optimistic that I'll get an offer in the next week or so. However his got me thinking about non-compete, considering we make essentially the exact same product for the same broad market.  **About my contract**: The clauses in my employment contract very clearly **prohibit me from dealing with any customer, employee, third party or business for 6 months after termination or divulging any trade secrets or confidential information.** The terms are really broad but very clear. *There is a 3 month prohibition on being involved with 'any business concern' in competition.*  It also states that I must notify my employer if an offer from another company is made, and that I have to give the new employer a copy of my non-compete.   I could go on 'garden leave' for 3 months but it is extremely unlikely my potential employer would wait that long.  In terms of 'trade secrets,' I know the company's financials *roughly*, and information about the number of customers we have. I don't know if they count as trade secrets.   **Questions**: * How serious is this? * Do I just go ahead and hope nothing comes of it? * Is there a legal way to go around this? * How costly and complicated would coming after me be? (My boss is lazy and disorganised) * Could this get my future employer in trouble/put them off hiring me?  **TL;DR - Hate my job - could go work for an exciting competitor, in the same role. Worried that my non-compete clause may fuck everything up.**	Yes
Thanks in advance. I am posting for my girlfriend who recently got put into this position. She has a chronic pain issue that makes her unable to work a few days a month. She applied for FMLA with her employer but was 30 days too early so she was ineligible by the date, otherwise she would have qualified and been approved.  Her employer's reaction to learning this was to force her to move positions and take a roughly 12% pay cut as well. It seems as if this was a direct reaction to learning that she would be able to protect her position and pay rate in 30 days when she will be eligible. Anything that can be done?	Yes
Today I found out that my company didn't contribute to my 401k for 3 years ever since I started working there. Even though I elected to have it maxed out and Fidelity has that on record, my employer simply has never carried out the contributions. When I asked HR about it they only said that there is nothing they can do. Is this true or am I legally entitled to some compense or solution to catch up on what I missed?	Yes
Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if any more information is needed.  Thanks in advance!	Yes
Horribly sad, very young, sweet girl.  What do we do with her final paycheck?  We don't know any of her family, only her BF who she killed herself in front of, and we will definitely not be giving it to him.	Yes
"December of last year I worked for a studio in Los Angeles, CA for a week making outfits for a commercial. I got the job through a friend and never signed a contract (I'm an idiot, I know) because it was ""such a great opportunity"".  I cut my finger open my first day in the shop and I had to go to an Urgent Care nearby for stitches. My insurance paid for it and I never filed a claim because I didn't want to cause a problem for the shop owner.   The owner turned out to be a very irresponsible, disorganized person who was a complete nightmare to work for. I worked very long hours to finish the job, and in the end only ended up getting paid half of the $1000 he owed me for the week, even after contacting him about it several times.  Last night, my friend linked me to the shop's website where they are using my photos of my personal work (stuff completely unrelated to the job I did for them)  to advertise their business. I had the intention of letting the whole thing go, but after seeing that I'm pretty furious.  Is there anything I can do about it legally or am I SOL?"	Yes
Hear me out i understand work can be an unpleasant and chaotic for all parties. But im genuinely infuriated by the horrible and incompetent management at my work. They neglect to intervene when coworkers berate and make crude jokes about each other. They are often attentive to customers, but neglect any of the needs and concerns of coworkers. I was literally in a yelling match with my supervisor before we both got told to go to HR to mitigate things, mostly in the supervisors favor. Is there anyway i can at least threaten legal action via phone call, letter etc. to get them to listen to my concerns more? How would i go about initiating this? Would i have any protection from being laid off?   A little background as well, this is in a high end restaurant setting in a country club. These sorts of jokes and crude playfulness are common in the food industry i know. But the shitty management doesnt do anything to sufficiently quell or mitigate things.	Yes
The government advises that a fit note must be provided if an employee is off sick for more than 7 days in a row (https://www.gov.uk/taking-sick-leave ). Obviously the employee in the coma is unable to provide this, and I haven't been contacted by any doctors/family etc.   Am I ok to not pay any SSP to the employee unless I receive a fit note?	Yes
Never doing those shifts again which amount to about $4 per hour and required I essentially lived at the doggy day care (there was a bed downstairs to sleep on) for the duration of the time. They initally told me that this payment is counted as 'salary' even though I was told upon being hired that I was paid/hour as minimum wage.  I've worked under the table before but have never been this unfairly compensated. Am I right in thinking they are blatantly violating the law?	Yes
I'm in Missouri. My boss claims that because of IRS requirements I cannot be paid drive time to our second office. Unless I clock in at our main office and ride in the company car with others. Is this company policy? Or is this actually an IRS requirement. 	Yes
I'm employed for 8 hours a day, but spend half of those hours working from home. The employee who has replaced me for my leave just informed me that she quit due to a reduction in hours. They've made it so that all work is done in the 4 hours, essentially making her a part-time staffer. I'm concerned that I'll be returning to either a part-time job (with no benefits I will have no reason to stay) or a different position that requires me to be onsite for 8 hours (there will be NO way to get daycare this close to my return-date and would not be worth the pay/hours away from home even if I could afford care). Is this simply unethical? Or illegal? Yay for being a new mom and having this new stress added to my leave!	Yes
I am looking to leave (flee, rather) my current employer and one of the opportunities I am presented is the same position with a competitor that is opening a new location.  Back in 2011, contingency of continued employment was a non-compete agreement of 1 year and I am uncertain of the scope of the 'area of coverage'.  This is specialty retail, so I'm not sure what could be considered 'protected information or practices' I could be taking with me. But clientele of this specialty visit most locations and I cannot imagine this not somehow getting back to my current boss if I were to leave and go to this competitor.  I doubt any action would be taken, but I do have a higher-than-most profile in this industry.  Kicker is, I am leaving because of a hostile work environment stemming from and sourced by the top of the food chain.  Berating, misplaced aggression, verbal abuse, swearing, I have documentation of instances that I could probably file a case and win with, but I'm not looking to sink a small business, just to keep myself from garnering a worsening mental state.  TLDR: If I am attacked over a non-compete, is a retort/defense of a hostile working environment forcing me to leave an acceptable legal defense?	Yes
I was walking at work when my right knee sprained I didn't fall or hit anything. I was told that they couldn't cover it because I was just walking but, the reason it sprained was  from a prior injury that I sustained from work before. The place they sent me to Concentra urgent care facility that handled and cared for my injury told me that I was fine and released me from care. Not too long ago after they let me go I reinjured the same right knee just walking at work. Now am I suppose to act like Concentra wasn't wrong for letting me go the first time? I'm sure they are not perfect so now the people handling my insurance are telling me that Concentra can never be wrong and that it's just a coincidence that the same right knee sprained just walking ? Can I sue ?	Yes
He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.   He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there.   Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday.   What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.   TL:DR; Will trying for a green card marriage as a US citizen hurt the fact that I haven't been working legally (according to the IRS)?	Yes
I work at a bar in Texas. Last week, one of the other employees brought her older sister in to start working as a busser. She's having her sister clock in under her name in order to help her sister avoid paying (what I assume is back) child support. The sister is has not filled out any W-4 forms. I have three questions.  1: How fucked is my coworker?  2: How fucked is the sister?  3: How fucked is my employer?	Yes
I have a friend who is having some problems at work. We have no idea where to start, or if there is any legal way to help.  Recently my friend over heard a coworker (I'll call her Cindy) make a threatens statement about my friend over a text conversation that happen months ago.   My friend went to HR and assumed that Cindy would be appropriately felt with. Unfortunately the situation was turned around on my friend and now she is in more trouble than Cindy.   The head of our company spoke with my friend and said that they couldn't give my friend any sympathy over the situation because she didn't bring it up months ago. Now she has a last chance write up on her record that will never fall off no matter how long she stays at the company. This write up was for miscommunication. She is also on probabtion and they said if she gets any complaints about communication she will be fired on the spot. She now has to take communication classes with Cindy and as far as I can tell Cindy did not get in trouble at all.   I feel like this is retaliation for speaking out against a hostile employee. Cindy is friends with the head of the company and cronyism runs rampant.   Is there anything legally wrong that the employer did?   Thank you.	Yes
I don't think she has a case but now that's she's of more sound mind she's annoyed she was fired because of a hospital visit related to her PTSD.  Basically she was a contract employee for a company when she had an issue that ended up with her in the hospital.  They held her for 4 days but couldn't find a bed for her in a ward better suited for her so eventually released her to my care.  (Ultimately a mistake because she ended up in the hospital again for worse symptoms for a whole two weeks but I digress).    I never contacted her work during those 4 days, I honestly didn't even think of it, I was spending those 4 days sitting in a chair in her hospital room. Upon her release I do contact them and let them know what happened, she still wasn't really in the shape to talk to them but since her job was basically ticket assigning and chat moderation she agreed to go back to work right away since it was simple and done from home at that time anyway. They ask for a picture of her release paper work showing the days spent in the hospital and leave it at that.  I let her know she said she'd handle it, sent them a picture and that was the end of it for a few hours.  A few hours later they contact us saying she sent a picture of the wrong thing, I look and curse myself for not double checking her because in her addled state she did send the wrong thing.  She sent the picture of the paperwork that basically just said they set her up with an appointment with her normal doctor to follow up about the issues with her PTSD and the hospital stay.  I grab her normal paperwork and see that since she transferred hospitals at some point they only had the 2 days at the second hospital listed not the first two.  So we head out to the original hospital and get the paperwork showing all the days she spent.  I'm sitting at the gas station outside our house when we get a call from the contracting company and are told that they have ended her contract and she doesn't have a job anymore.  They do kind of have a history of this.  Two or three months prior to this another coworker of hers who was actually employee there for over 4 years had their contract ended the day after it was revealed she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  I don't think she has much of a case because I don't think contract employees have much at all in the way of rights.  Also they didn't actually know she had PTSD the only thing that told them was the paperwork she accidentally sent them, she never told them herself at any point.  Either way I said I would ask.	Yes
I was interviewed by an older gentleman who told me that online training would be unpaid, but any orientation within the building would be compensated. Is this legal?	Yes
In TX tipped minimum wage is 2.13. The regular min wage is 7.25, which is supposed to be made up in tips. I'm not making the regular minimum through tips, so when is my employer supposed to pay the difference? On my biweekly paycheck? At the end of the year? Ever? I can't find this info anywhere!!! Thanks in advance for all help.	Yes
I'm a student who has been working at a Sydney cafe for a few weeks now, and, as the title states, I've been getting underpaid (cash-in-hand), given no payslips, and not given penalty rates. The other workers I have talked to have also been getting the same treatment. Since, there is no payslip there is no evidence except for word of mouth. I don't wish to take them to court because I don't want to make life-long enemies. What will happen to them if I report them to fair work?	Yes
Basically what the title says. I just got hired in California by a restaurant chain. I'm sitting in the employee orientation and the HR lady says employees aren't eligible for health insurance until 1 year. I was under the impression that the ACA chAnged this to a 90 day minimum waiting period, and my cursory googling confirms that. There are some exceptions but none that should extend it to a full year. I haven't even started yet and don't want to jeopardize this employment opportunity, because I need a job, but I want to make sure I am getting what's rightfully mine. I plan on asking Hr once I've completed training, but is there any other course of action I should take? With the current political situation my confidence in government actually helping me is at an all time low, but what should I do?	Yes
How does an employer prove that they have informed an employee of tip credits? Can the agreement be verbal or does it have to be written? Working in a restaurant, Tip credits and credit card processing fees are being taken from my wages. I was uninformed of this upon the start of my employment. I noticed these deductions after reading the server sales report at the end of the night. I am fully aware that the employer may take these credits, but should they be informing or providing notice to an employee about the exact numbers and percentages at the time of hire or during the training?	Yes

"I work for a theatre chain in VA and we've had complaints all year about the lack of air conditioning. At first we were told ""it's broken"" then a manager told me in private that the GM wants to save money by not keeping AC on in the lobby. I went into their office recently and they keep it a cool 68-70 while the lobby is around 80-83. This is before a large rush of people fill up the lobbies and the popcorn machines really get working. Is there anything OSHA or DOL can do? I tried googling but didn't find much on if VA requires AC for indoor employees. Could I request an inspection through VOSH? "	Yes
"After approaching her boss he said ""you havent got the raise because i dont think you proved enough to me""  my question is, is this legal?  technically they are withholding money from her that she should be getting since shes been promoted.   Ive tried looking at NYC job laws but cant find anything.  shes been doing the work load of her current title from the promotion but wont give her the raise that came with it.   Before i say anything to her i was just wondering if this falls under illegal by labor law"	Yes
"I work at a state park in Nebraska. I am currently the only one working in a small store. On my off days someone else works so I have 2 days off. My hours have recently been changed to factor in a half hour lunch, and I am currently at a point where I work exactly 40 hours a week. However, my boss told me that I will have to take a ""working lunch."" That essentially means I remain in the building and continue to work through my lunch, but I am not paid for it. My math shows that I am missing out on 2.5 overtime hours every week.  I am currently a part time employee, so they do not want me working over 40 or else the state gets upset. I told a colleague about my situation and he suggested I keep working until I am done for the season, then pursuit legal action. Tonight at the end of my shift I'm going to collect all past pay stubs and keep them organized.   Am I being wronged here? I just want an outsider opinion on the situation."	Yes
I am in Idaho, USA.   I've been working at this bar/restaurant for about three months. It is a corporate chain. It is unlike any other bar I've worked for in that the managers count and distribute the tip money amongst the bartenders. I actually never even see or held in my hand the entirety of the tips for any shift that I've closed.  Tips are distributed by dividing the total tips for the night per hour, then dividing that among the bartenders on shift for the hours they work. This makes it important that the managers look at the bartenders' exact hours/minutes each shift to make sure everyone is being paid exactly what they are owed for that shift.   I close the bar 3-4 shifts a week, usually getting there around 5:30 and leaving anywhere from 1-3 am.  I recently realized that my managers had the tips for the shift already divided and put in our individual tip folders before I even clocked out. (While I was doing cleaning and such.) Which would make no sense, since they don't yet even know the hours I worked for that shift.   So for the past three shifts I have compared my clock out slip to the tip sheet that we sign to say we received our tips, and on average I am being shorted for 30 minutes of work per shift. If this has been happening the whole time, it is at minimum $100 a month that I've been shorted, and probably more like $150.   My question is, do I have a leg to stand on here? I've signed the tip sheet every time I've picked up my tips. The hours and tips for that shift are clearly written on there. I've always just counted the money I was given, and made sure it matched what the paper said I was supposed to receive. It never occurred to me to check the hours worked to make sure it was actually accurate. I am planning to confront my GM about it tomorrow, but I want to at least kind of know if I have some good footing here.  I have a few clock out slips that can prove maybe 3 times this has happened. Other than that, I don't know if they can print records of my shifts and how many hours they were. I don't know how far back they log the tip info either.   I hope this all made sense!   Thanks for any advice	Yes
Have put more effort into my job and have demonstrated my commitment more than other employees. (attendance, going above and beyond job description)  My boss is giving me worse shifts, less hours, etc. in preference of workers that are the ethnicity of the companies owners.   I am assuming a lawyer would not take this case without up front fees.	Yes
"Hello,  Started a new job recently at a restaurant in a busy neighborhood. Not sure on the specifics  of the restaurants income. I worked 50+ (more like 50.5-52.0 hours) on the first week of my work week. I approached my employer after I got my check and my shift was done and asked if I was owed OT for the week I worked 50 hours. My employer said OT is only required for 80+ hours in a TWO week period. I pointed out I had worked 81.80 hours in my pay period and didn't receive 1.80 hours of OT if that was in fact the case. I also told him all of my previous jobs, which admittedly have been big business/corporate (compared to this family owned business) have paid me OT after 40 hours in one week. He gave me a run around and I pretty much got no where with him.  1). Is this legal in MN? Seems MN law dictates OT can only be applied after 48 hours in a 7day period, which still at MINIMUM (correct if wrong) would me I owuld have 2ish hoours of OT.  2). Federal states ""Employees covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) must receive overtime pay for hours worked in excess of 40 in a workweek of at least one and one-half times their regular rates of pay. "" [here](https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/overtimepay) if certaing requirements are met.   AM I getting jipped? Any advice how to handle this? My employer stated he ""would take care of me"" for it but this is the second of three pay checks that seem to have been off. (the second he wrote me a personal check without taking taxes out or not enoug taxes out, I'm not entirely sure)"	Yes
Briefly...  I make a HIPAA Violation report about my employer.  When you do this, there is a box that you can check that says that you do not want your information revealed to the company you are reporting.  Today I get a call from my employer... basically saying... about that HIPAA report you made about us...  Awkward.  I contact HHS.gov.  They confirmed that they erroneously revealed my information to my employer.  I do understand that my employer cannot legally retaliate against me.  (At least not overtly.  But who knows what my performance reviews are going to look like over the years).  I also understand that at least as of right now... I have no damages.  So I suspect that I answered my own question...  Except that it seems like a pretty big deal that the agency that you are reporting privacy violations to are violating your privacy.  Do you think this is something I should consider pursuing?  Or do I need to just sit back and wait for enumerable damages?	Yes
"Hi everyone, I apologize in advance if this question is inappropriate for this forum. I recently accepted a position as an R&amp;D scientist at a pharmaceutical company located in the Bay Area, CA. I accepted the position, but contingent upon my hire is passing a controlled substances drug screen before my start date, which is obviously fine and dandy.   My question is in regards to what happens afterwords. Based off of what I've read from CalChamber, ""You may not require employees to submit to random drug testing, except under certain narrowly defined circumstances."" I was wondering whether the duties of an R&amp;D scientist fall under this category? Specifically, what are these narrowly defined circumstances? The language I've seen online seems pretty vague and, as a scientist I'm a little more used to definitive language. Can anyone clarify this for me?"	Yes
"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	Yes
I work for a Fortune 500 company in California.  I accepted an offer in the fall of 2016.  The offer did not explicitly list my PTO days, but it had a link to the current benefits site.  The current benefits site detailed that PTO days for employees in my range would be X, and a footnote that said the schedule would change on 1 Jan 2017.  My hiring was delayed by the company until 2017, and now I make X-16 hours of PTO, according to the new schedule.    I believe this has happened to numerous other employees as well, since my hiring class was around 100, and all had offers accepted in 2016.  Do I have any recourse for the company changing the terms of employment?	Yes
Months ago my coworker told me that he was in love with me and I told him that I did not have romantic feelings for him and asked him to keep it professional. He has since gone on to tell me that he is suicidal and continues to pester me with personal questions, following me around at work and asking to hang out outside of work. Today after being bombarded with personal questions I told him once again to leave me alone and keep it professional, that he was making my job miserable and stressful. At this point I was met with extreme hostility, the coworker disappeared, and I told my boss that I was leaving for fear of my safety.   It's my understanding that my boss knew that my coworker has been suicidal, and also that he had feelings for me. I have not officially quit my job and will be expected to join a conference call tomorrow. What should I know about my rights in this situation? Btw, I am a female referring to a male coworker.	Yes
Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	Yes
Hey guys it's me again with an update. I wasn't sure how to go about this - please excuse me if this is not correct. Update is at the bottom of the post for those that might remember it (the post was 2 weeks ago).    Hello /r/legaladvice. Please forgive me in advance for any formatting errors that will occur. As well as spelling errors - currently bumming WiFi from my wife's work :)   So now a little info. I live in Arkansas. I'm recently employed at Walmart (Jun. 12) was my hire date. And we went through orientation (by the way we was told we were getting paid for that). I attended orientation I know for sure Monday, Wednesday and Thursday from 2-11 with an hour lunch. Walmart pays biweekly so I was hired the Monday before this last pay period (Jun. 15). Today (Jun. 29) was our payday.   Now when you first hire on with Walmart, I was told you're hired as part time. Which I am working 4 days a week 2-11 shift with an hour lunch. There for I should be earning at least 64 hours ( most of the time I clock out +15mins after my shift - since I've been hired I've worked an hour past my shift 3 times and one time I clocked out at 1:05 a.m) every two weeks.   But now here's the thing. My paystub only shows I worked 47.64 hours the past 2 weeks. 17 the first week and 30 the next. Which this is absolutely wrong.   Since I was hired the Monday before payday. Those hours should be added on along with the 2 - 32 hour work week as well as those times I've work past my shift.   Also do part time employs gain over time if they have worked over 40 hours (or 80 hours in my case ?)  I'm not as much as worried about the overtime. I really want to know why I was paid for 64 hours + the hours I attended orientation.   Any help would be greatly appreciated. This is the first time I'm working for a corporation like this. I plan on going to personnel in the morning and asking to see the hours I've clocked in. Because it's wrong on my paystub.   Thanks y'all. Have a great one.   [UPDATE]  I received another paycheck via the Wal-Mart money this past Thursday (July 13th). I only had 40 hours the past 2 weeks (according to Wal-Mart). Which I was scheduled for 64 hours the past two weeks. I've been there everyday that I was scheduled. And that's not including the times I've clocked out at 11:30 or later). I'm seriously debating giving them my 2 weeks notice. Something is not adding up.   To be honest, during orientation I over heard some of the salried managers speaking about the overtime workers were getting and that it was costing them too much. Or something to that affect.  My question is now - could they be doing something with my hours to cover that up? I know I'm only part-time but still..  Forgive me if that is a silly question. I've never dealt with this type of stuff. I've farmed all my life and always received a paper check. So all this is pretty new to me.  So can someone (anyone) please give me a little more advice I would greatly appreciate it. As I'm in a tight spot right now. And I don't know what to do.   Thanks yall. Have a good weekend	Yes
I work in an office with one other co-worker. He is male and we have the same position but I am the senior of the two.  I requested a transfer to work in another state to live with my fiance. I worked on detail in the other state who is aware of my interest in transferring and would like to have me. Unfortunately, they can't hire right now.   After this request my supervisor, who is not the authority to determine if the transfer is approved, began treating me much worse. I get that being a jerk is not illegal but I have documented several incidences where my male co-worker was clearly favored.   I then was up for a promotion, which was at the discretion of my supervisor, and which I didn’t get. She said she decided I needed to obtain a job certification first which she hadn’t told me prior. Additionally, part of my supervisor’s job is to help support me in getting certified.   I made an informal complaint to her supervisor about what was going on and the treatment I’d been getting compared to my male peer. He thought she was being fair.   Since this complaint my supervisor has been even worse. Lack of communication, discussing my work with my co-worker and not me, and preventing me from working towards my certification. Other senior staff are aware of this and no one is trying to help me. She has a history of bullying her staff.   So I need the certification to get the promotion, as well as for my job, and I’ve been told to stop working towards requirements for the certification. I think this is considered retaliation and there is a financial loss from this.   Side note: She is still supporting my co-worker in progress towards his certification.  Also, I was told that my informal complaint didn’t impact any decision on approving a transfer. It’s basically political.  There’s a lot of other examples I have documented of unfair treatment but I don’t want to make this post too long.   Ultimately, I have great job security. I like my job and I don’t want to let one supervisor stop me from pursuing what I need to do to advance my career. I also don’t want to jeopardize my chances of working with the other state or anyone to think this is just complaining because I want t to transfer.  Any advice on what to do here? Pursue discrimination case or retaliation case? I was thinking about filing an informal grievance and going from there.   Thanks in advance!	Yes
Mainly referring to working in assistive living (nursing homes) but I guess this could apply to any employer.  I recently acquired a med-tech certification and they gave me a hard time about receiving a copy because they were afraid I would take it and apply to jobs elsewhere.  I'm pretty sure I never signed any kind of contract to complete the training and the management at my facility keeps trying to refuse giving copies of licenses to employees but I don't think they can legally do this.	Yes
I work at a manufacturing facility in South Dakota and I'm not in HR department but sit right next to it so I overhear and greet a lot of potential employees.  We just had a lady come in who wanted to apply for a certain position but one of the qualifications is that you must be able to lift 50lbs.  She told our HR that she is currently pregnant and is on restriction from her doctor to only lift no more than 35lbs but that after her pregnancy she would have no problem doing so.   Our HR lady told her that unfortunately that's part of the job, but we'd be happy to have her apply after she has her baby.  I was just thinking about it for some reason and was wondering if that's the correct way to handle it? Because then I started wondering what would happen if someone in that position currently got pregnant and put on restrictions.	Yes
location: Michigan  When I first called, they asked some general questions and said they'd get back to me in a few days.  After a week I called them and they said the money probably went to the state as unclaimed money, so it would take them a little longer to get this sorted out, and [payroll person] would get back to me in a week. I received the paycheck slightly under two years ago, and looking at Michigan's laws, it looks to me like my pay would've gone to the state after a year, so that makes sense.  A little more than a week later, I tried following up, and my phone call went straight to voicemail. I tried a few more calls at different times of day, and since they all went to voicemail, I suspect they blocked me.  Around two weeks later, I went in-person to my old workplace with the check, explained my situation, and the person at the front office emailed [payroll person] on my behalf. I got an email back the same day sounding like they just heard about this for the first time. I emailed them back the next day, only to get an automated message saying that as of the previous day, they weren't working there anymore and I should send my queries to [generic payroll email] which promised a response in 48 hours.  It's been over 3 work days since.   In summary, it's been over a month since I brought this to their attention, and I don't know what has been happening on their end, nor do I know if they plan to pay me.   I would go to the state and get the paycheck myself, but the michigan website for unclaimed money/property does not yield any results for my unclaimed paycheck - I don't know if that's a paperwork issue or what. I have my stale paycheck in hand, and I checked my bank account and it doesn't look like they ever paid me via direct deposit, so I don't think I'm mistaken.   The check is worth about $1,000. I'm reluctant to take legal action, and I'm not sure it would be worth the time and money anyways... So what else can I do? Keep attempting to follow up? I'm tired and upset with doing that, but I don't know what else to do.  Thanks so much for the input	Yes
Until recently I worked for a large bank and knew before leaving that I had used up more holidays than I was entitled for the amount of the year so far. I was told it would be deducted from my wages but it wasn't. They've now written to me asking me to repay the £400 I owe. Am I legally obliged to repay it?	Yes
"Need advice due to conflicting info from fam/friends, also /r/personalfinance didn't like my post tagged with Employment.    I am of the opinion that since my former incarceration info is sealed that I may now maintain complete assurances that I have never been convicted of a crime or having been arrested. Anyone who Google searches may find old data, which is why some are telling me I should ""own up"" and be truthful if confronted about these in an interview. This is tantamount to waiving my rights which I think is a horrible idea.  Would an employer not be in gross violation of civil rights act and fair credit reporting act if it was even brought up in an interview?? How would I address this topic strongly and respectfully if confronted?  Wouldn't equal protection also mean my expungement would also apply to an employer for any other state in USA?  I am looking at my first few interviews soon since fully cleaning up my record and also earning my bachelors and I don't want to deal with nonsense."	Yes
"I have worked for this company since 2009. In 2015 I left for 8 months and when they asked me to come back we negotiated terms. As part of this deal I was now a salaried employee and working mon-Thursday. All was well and fine so I thought. Two months ago I put in a ""time off request"" for 8 working days in late June. The request was accepted and signed by the owner who is my direct boss. And nothing more was said. A week after I got back my boss told me that because I was gone so long I had to ""make up"" days I missed. This bothered me because he never mentioned it before I left or before he signed and agreed. It was only after I was back and he ""realized"" how long I would be gone. That's his fault. So he said I had to make up the days I was gone. He said he would pay me for 40 hours but the rest was on me to make up. I was bothered by it but ok whatever I'll work a Friday or two that's fine.    But then I got an email sunday asking me to fill out a new time sheet for the time I was gone and submit a plan in writing to him to make up the days I missed. Also He wants me to go through all my time sheets since I came back and document any other days he approved for vacation and document those on time sheets and show what days I will make up as well.    Then he is telling me that he is going to give me different vacation allotment because I work 4 days a week (32 total vacation hours per year when everyone else gets 40 hours no matter what) because I am salaried.   So do I have any room to say to him that I am not going to make up time because he did not require me to until after the fact?"	Yes
"I worked as a crew leader for a landscaping company in NV off and on for two years. Last Wednesday I was sent to work with another crew because they where short on people due to two or three people quitting the week prior. I had worked with this crew a few times before and due to them being short on people and hadn't had any major issues other than that I was made to do a majority of the work while they where often either just standing around talking or nowhere to be found. There was one individual who I could tell didn't like me from the first time I met him and I could tell it was a racial thing(he was Hispanic and while I have native blood in me I'm usually assumed by others to be white). In a job like landscaping you have to have thick skin, it's all dudes and it's all outside manual labor. I can put up with a lot, and for a while I did. Now I don't speak Spanish, but it's not hard to figure out when I hear the word gringo while they are talking, then immediately after tell me to go do something(I was often the only ""white guy"") that it was the old ""make the gringo do it"". Fast forward to last week. I've been sent to work with them again the prior day I had worked and this day they made me go dump my trailer then meet them up there. I get up there and drive around looking for them at their normal work areas for a while, then finally find them. First thing the individual asks me is what took me so fucking long. I told him I had been driving around looking for them to which he huffed, put his truck into gear and said ""fucking gringo"" as he started to drive off. This behavior continued through the day until around lunch, when this crew simply disappears. I've been sent to help them and they just leave without telling me where they are going. So I waste a good amount of time driving around looking for them and I finally find them and start working(me and another co-worker who had been sent up there with them(also a white guy)). We went back to doing what we where doing before lunch and at some point they just left us again, without any word. At this point I've had enough and I decide we would just work on our own and I would talk to my boss about it at the end of the day. About 20-30 minutes into working by boss pulls up and starts yelling at both of us not to work so close together because we ""look like butt buddies"". He then tells us that we need to go help the other crew or we will be fired. I started to tell him that I refuse to continue working with that crew and to continue being called a gringo when he cuts me off and threatens that if I don't go back to work with them he would fire me. I told him ""well you can fire me"" to which he replied ""fine"" then asked me for the keys to my truck. He then preceded to force the other co-worker to go back and work with the other crew and left me stranded in another town.  The day following I was told that I needed to sign some price of paper when I went to pick up my check. This paper stated that I had quit and that my ""final pay had been explained to me"" even though I was yet to receive my final pay(the check I was picking up was for the week prior)  I have tried to contact the companies HR(they are a huge company) and was told they don't even have an HR. I've contacted the Nevada equal rights commission and filed a report with them and am currently waiting for word back from a lawyer. Until then I was hoping for some guidance as to what else should be done. Is there a better agency to contact than the Nevada equal rights commission? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated.    Tl;dr was repeatedly being called a gringo at work and was fired when I refused to continue working with them."	Yes
Throwaway account to protect those involved.  A good buddy of mine has worked in management at this one place for the past twenty or so years, up until it recently moved out of state. A church has purchased the building, and has employed him to keep things in order as it is is renovated (it is becoming a headquarters for the church, as well as for a house of worship for the town). However, there are a few suspicious things going on that leave me feeling uneasy.  1. Although he is employed to be working 40 hours a week, he puts in a good number of hours of (unpaid) overtime each week, so that he is really working upwards of 60 hours a week. This is in part due to the fact that  2. in hiring him, the church had fired all of their other staff (the guy who mows the lawn, etc.) for a separate location, and is now asking my friend to manage that facility as well. Unfortunately, he's a bit of a pushover, and so he is just going along with it. So, while he is employed to be managing one location, he is really working two, without anyone under him to actually provide assistance. As such, he is doing a good deal of manual labour himself, between driving back and forth for hours between both locations. I'm worried, because his age is definitely getting to him. I fear that a few more months of this could ruin his health.  3. He is now a salaried worker of the church. However, they are consistently late with paying him. For instance, supposing he was meant to be paid on the 4th, it might be added to his account on the 7th. Usually, there is a delay of 2-4 *business days*, meaning that, when he was meant to be paid on June 30th, he only receive it on July 6th, due to bank holiday around the 4th.  Him, being the person he is, is unlikely to make a fuss about this with his management, because he doesn't see that anything is wrong. I have read up a bit about overtime exemptions for EAP employees on the DOL's website, and from what I gather, that his work primarily consists of manual labour would seem to exclude him from that exemption. The two main questions I have hear are a) is this an accurate assessment of what the DOL says about overtime exemptions in regards to the first point, and b) is there any more information I can give my friend that he can use in filing a complaint with his current employer?	Yes

"I got my 2 years green card through marriage to Citizen, and it is expiring on August. I need to apply for the 10 years green card soon.  I will participate a diversion program, and my immigration lawyer is modifying the contract for immigration reason.  The lawyer said : “It means that you are not saying the facts are right UNLESS you break the agreement. Its lawyer terms, but in immigration it makes a HUGE difference” I attach the original and the modified diversion, and want to see if anyone can check it for me and I have a few questions regarding the diversion contract Original: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m9cgzuw4t3pkp73/AACQ5aRktPbq5Ayn9DyIop-Xa?dl=0   Modified part: STIPULATION OF FACTS STIPULATION UPON VIOLATION OF FACTS: Defendant stipulates that he/she is the individual named in the complaint, and that the offense(s) charged occurred within the city limits of Lenexa, Kansas.

So my ex-employer is a real shady POS (tax fraud, insurance fraud, etc). So the story is that for the past 2 months, he's been having big-time money problems, which caused our last four paychecks to be 7-10 days late. But then he got a loan for a couple hundred k, and now we have money again. My last paycheck was supposed to be 07/03, but I was on PTO (we don't have a written PTO policy, but other employees have taken PTO without any ramifications, and he said I could take it) until 07/05. While I was gone, he kept pressuring me to DocuSign this NDA and non-compete. He still owes me $3k for unpaid medical expenses (signed employment contract states medical coverage is part of benefits, but our insurance was retroactively cancelled in April, which caused all my doctor appointments from January to April to be rejected by insurance, so small bills became huge). He's promised to pay this back numerous times, but of course, he hasn't. I told him I'd sign the NDA/Non-compete out of goodwill, but I expected him to honor his contract and pay me for consequential damages caused by the insurance cancelling. When I return to the office, he seizes my phone and laptop (I'm guessing to get rid of my evidence I've collected against him) and locks me out of my emails. I took this as termination, even though he said it wasn't (I'm sure this was a ploy to get me to stay, so he could further insulate himself from potential damage), but since I wasn't paid, I was out of there. So I sent him a demand letter since he has 6 days to pay me my final paychecks. My question is this: I know he's going to claim that my PTO was unauthorized, but can I claim that's discriminatory because other employees literally took PTO the week before and it didn't affect their paycheck. He also told me to send the hours I was into the office, knowing that none of the employees had been to the office (yet again, none of them had to fill out time sheets) because 1. we hadn't been paid yet and 2. creditors were coming into the office threatening to blow or shoot the place up until they got their money. I was still working, and I had text messages/emails of 1. asking for him to pay server costs, so I could continue working on the website and 2. him sending me to various companies to collect bills on our company's behalf (also promising to pay my medical reimbursement if I managed to collect checks). Will he be able to deny me my last paycheck by claiming I didn't go into the office. And should I threaten what I have on him (tax fraud, insurance fraud)? I also have access to technical systems I set up (and technically own because I bought them with my own money in case something like this happened). Should I take down the systems, or will this backfire on me and allow him to sue me for damages or something. This is really complicated because this guys was SOOOO unscrupulous, sloppy, and corrupt. What do you guys propose is the best course of action? Thanks so much!	Yes
"My employer is cracking down on bathroom breaks and is starting to insist we only use the bathroom during scheduled breaks and lunches, unless we request a job accommodation via the Americans with Disabilities Act. ""No exceptions."" The company, or at least this branch of it, has been making some shady policy changes recently that rides a grey area where ethics and legality aren't clear. So this isn't just about me, but an entire work force as well.  -  Illinois has no laws requiring employers to provide breaks other than meal periods. I believe OSHA has some requirements for bathroom breaks but I haven't found clear wording on that, or whether it differentiates bathroom breaks from rest breaks. I don't think it would. The company gives us two 15 minute breaks during an 8 hour shift and a one hour meal period.  -  This is a desk job where we spend all day talking on the phone.   -  I have been told that I go to the bathroom too often and I either need to hold it or get a job accommodation through ADA, which if approved would mean clocking out to take bathroom breaks when they aren't scheduled. Other people are getting the same talk, some of whom have medical conditions that make them have to go more frequently (UTI, diabetes, Crohn's, etc.). Some have suffered medical issues from holding it. I will withhold my personal situation.  - My questions, and questions on behalf of others are:  1. Would this be considered an ADA job accommodation if it's forcing the disability to be handled off of company time?   2. Would clocking out like this have any relevance to the Equal Pay Act if it's forcing the person with a disability to make less than an equally qualified employee without the disability? I don't know if it only takes into account actual time doing work activity, but that goes back to unclear bathroom break regulations.  3. Instead of ADA, would FMLA be an alternative? Seems like either is rather extreme for needing to relieve oneself, but here we are.  4. What about otherwise healthy people that need to use the bathroom and can't wait for the next break? Drank too much water/coffee, diarrhea, or other non-disability-related waste disposal need?  5. Relating to the previous item, is this a reasonable policy when some conditions necessitating frequent bathroom breaks clear up in less time than it takes to get an ADA request approved in this company (around 30 days last I heard)?  6. What does OSHA or other labor laws say about employee rights to bathroom breaks?  -  Any input that can be provided is welcomed. I have no preconceived notions about the answers to any of these questions. Any sources I can be linked to to get a better understanding would be great--whether it's for or against any of the items listed--if it's convenient for you.   - Thank you for your time."	Yes
"I accepted a job offer and started working there. They mentioned me having to sign a contract and they would be bringing one to me. It is 6 months since then and I still have not been approached by anyone.  In the electronic offer an email said this, ""This offer is contingent upon your signing a written employment agreement.""    I guess, I am worried if I left they would come after for all they have paid me since I never signed, or am I good?"	Yes
Hey guys, I'm a musician that knows only the side of law that covers things like copyright and trademark and sampling (audio).   I'm trying to make the release of my next couple of singles as professional as possible, with all bases covered on grounds of copyright and terms of ownership. I've got a song finished and I drafted up artwork for the song using a picture of a friend of mine.  I'd like to write up a Work For Hire contract concerning the picture I'm using and the model in the picture. I basically just want the contract to cover ownership of the song, the model's permission to use her likeness with the song and promotional material of the song, as well as being distributed online with her picture attached to the song.    I don't want the contract to include any sort of royalties to the model as 1. We aren't trying to pull in large sums of revenue from this release and 2. She did not have any creative involvement with the creation of the song.  Do you guys have any pointers and/or clauses that I should include in the contract? Or any advice as to the best possible way to go about writing the contract for the model?  Thank you in advance	Yes
I'm not sure if I can report this or how I should. or if by reporting it I can be retaliated against. But here's what happened.  A few months ago I attended training with my supervisor, we are both males and he is significantly older than I. We had originally planned to stay at the same hotel, however different rooms as is policy.  On arrival he did not book his room correctly and turned to me almost expecting me to say he could share mine. I offered that he could use my room to look for another hotel.  He found another hotel and after the first day of training he complained about how my hotel had the better facilities. I offered for him to use the facilities at my hotel and we could go to dinner after he was finished. He went swimming and after he was finished I said he could change in my bathroom and then we could go to dinner. He said he didn't need to change in the bathroom and proceeded to undress and change right in front of me in the bedroom area of the hotel. This obviously made me uncomfortable and I looked away.  I guess my questions are, 1) Should I report this? Or is this just acceptable as its not unlike a locker room situation? 2) Has to much time gone by for me to report this? It just recently came up again in a conversation and obviously it does bother me a bit. 3) If I take this to our HR what potential fallout could harm me?  Thanks in advance.	Yes
Essentially to make a long story short I work for my states welfare office Indiana, I came across some pay stubs that looked fake so I reviewed them and found an identical template by searching for fake pay stub templates. I informed my supervisor and was told to process them normally whether they are fake or not is not my problem because everyone lies to us. So I accepted the documents and processed them and notated my findings and my supervisors response. Essentially I knowingly accepted fraudulent documents due to my supervisors instructions. Can my employer fire me for this? Am I in anyway liable if they are determined to be forged documents since I accepted them during the eligibility determination process ?	Yes
I was hired as a full time worker, receiving benefits such as PTO, vacation, and holiday pay. When i was hired i was working 32 hours a week (which is considered full time to the corporation). about 6-7 months ago my manager cut a day of work and my hours fell under 30 hours, but i still accumulated benefits and maintained full time status. I have always been available to work 30+ hours but the former manager scheduled me less. Now there is a change in management that noticed this, we worked out a schedule where i went back to working 30+ hours (i have this conversation recorded on my phone). Corporate HR rejected the idea of me working those hours and changed my status to part time, took away my benefits and are asking me to pay back the benefits i had accumulated (holiday pay, PTO , vacation) on full time status, totaling to over $1700. I came into work when i was told to come in, and no one mentioned anything to me about loss of benefits or meeting 30 hours in the last 6 - 7 months. i get paid biweekly so thats at least 12 pay periods that this went unnoticed and was never notified to me. Now they want me to pay them back because i worked under 30 hours at the request of my former manager, even though i was available to work 30 + hours. if it means anything, the former manager has left the company and moved to the other side of the country from us.	Yes
"Looking for advice on pursuing a freelance scammer. My close friend was just ""scammed"" out of 50 hours of digital work that was agreed to be paid after completion.

I'm working with a company on an eCommerce site as general help (customer service, manufacturer communication, photos, etc.).   It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out.   Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor.   The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily.   I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.  Any resources or thoughts are greatly helpful!   States involved include CO and DC.	Yes
My gf works in hospitality, she closed out her drawer and made her drop into the safe at work which then got stuck and did not make it into the safe. After she had left her coworker came and stole the envelope out of the safe. They have cameras and caught him on camera doing this. He is denying it and will be taking a lie detector test. The owner of the business told her that if he doesn't fess up she will be responsible for paying him back. Im trying to figure out what we need to do. Apparently this is a problem with the safe and she has always made sure to check to make sure her drops made it into the safe, apparently this time is got stuck on the side and she did not notice it when checking and thought it made into the safe. I'm just worried that if he does not fess up etc that they will try to hold her paycheck, it was around one thousand dollars stolen and she does not have the money to pay them back.	Yes

"I recently applied for a position in a VT branch of a major insurance provider. During my application, I had to agreement to private arbitration for any legal disputes before, during, and after any potential employment.   In addition to signing away any right to pursue a class action, disputes covered by the arbitration clause include things like sexual harassment, unpaid wages, discrimination against protected classes, overtime, and other issues clearly covered by both Vermont and federal labor law.  This is unlikely to ever be relevant for me, but I just want to understand, because this seems a little nuts to me. Basically, if this employer were to, say, refuse to pay me for wages I had earned, and I couldn't work it out through negotiation on my own, we would then go to a ""neutral"" third party selected by the employer. This neutral third party, while technically supposed to make a judgement based on actual law, could really do anything. They could just say, ""lol, you ain't gettin' paid"", and then I would get no money. I would not be able to appeal this decision... Is this correct?? I guess I don't understand the point of labor laws existing at all if employers can just have people, for practical purposes, sign away their rights. This can't be how it works, right?"	Yes

"I am going to give all the details and I need as much insight or advice as one can provide, because I felt like I was done wrong, but I'm not really sure what to do.  It's Friday and I am a Guest Services Manager/Training Coordinator for a car dealership in Atlanta, GA.  My General Sales Manager(GSM) called me 3 times in the morning, once at 8:58 AM, 9:00 AM, and 9:32 AM. I called him back at 10:03 AM apologizing for missing his calls. He said it was fine, but my co-worker/team member needed to remove her 'du-rag' as he called it, and said it wasn't professional for her to have it on. I told him I apologize if she looks unprofessional and I would address it when I got in at 12.  In the meantime, on my way to work, I reached out to another co-worker to express my discomfort with his request. I am a latina/caucasian woman and my co-worker is a black woman. I am very aware of the hair culture and especially to her, how important he hair is to her. I knew it was a delicate situation and I didn't agree with him asking her to remove it because I assumed it was simply a head wrap and/or scarf. I knew it wasn't against dress code and she's never been anything but professional. She told me to just express my discomfort to him and it shouldn't be a problem.  A side note: She wore a multi-printed scarf just the day before and no one said anything, including my GSM, and so I assumed she was wearing the same one or just a different color and so I figured it would be no problem to talk to him once I arrived.  He called me once more at 11:13 asking if I was at work yet and told me she was still wearing it. He asked me why I didn't have the discussion with her yet? I told him I wanted to wait to arrive to work.  When I got to work we went straight into a staff meeting at which when I walked in he asked me in front of everyone ""Did you have that discussion yet?"" and pointed to her. I just nodded and immediately started texting my female co-worker I called earlier to ask for advice.   I said: ""Pussy ass R** has been hounding me all morning about telling **** to remove her ""du-rag"" as he calls it. You can clearly see it's a scarf  and I don't see the big deal. It's not that fucking serious.""  Well, I accidentally sent it to him. Shortly after he pulled me out of the staff meeting to address it. He showed me the text and asked what was going on? He was pissed, and understandably so, I insulted him.  I told him I didn't agree with his opinion of her head scarf and I didn't want to tell her to take it off. He said if I didn't agree with how they do things then we could part ways, I said I agree. He paused and then took me into a cubical to talk.  At that point he said he didn't understand where this was coming from, he said he did so much for me by giving me my $1,000 bonus for the job I was doing for the last 6 weeks (He laughed in my face when I accepted he position and asked for a raise). He said he never tells me to cover my tattoos, but makes the guy's cover theirs.  I told him that was a double standard, wrong, and I didn't agree with that either. I told him that what he was trying to make me do was discrimination against her and I told him it was not a du-rag. He then proceeded to tell me that it was in fact a du-rag and I could ask anyone else in the building, he insisted it was and it was against dress code.  ***Keep in mind*** NO where on our dress code/handbook manual specifies or even mentions that employees cannot wear hats, head pieces, scarves, accessories,  wraps, or headbands, etc.  So, I'm not sure where he got the ""dress code violation from"". When I tried to explain to him that he was being prejudice and discriminating my co-worker and trying to use me to do his dirty work he got even more upset with me. I told him of other instances where he did some questionably discriminatory/sexist and racist things. I even told him it sounded like a personal problem that he needed to address with her personally and I wanted no part in it.  He had nothing to say and ended it with ""If you don't like how we do things here then we can part ways."" and then he sent me home.  He later told my co-workers I walked and then just today he asked my co-worker (the one he wanted to remove the head piece) if she wanted my job.  Keep in mind, I never got officially fired or resigned.  Do I have some sort of case of injustice going on or is this sort of thing totally normal/acceptable?  I just really hate that this happened. I did so much for my job and I truly cared about the work I put into it."	Yes
Title. This is in Ireland, I don't know what difference that will make. I'm visiting an information center tomorrow on her behalf. We live in separate counties, and she fears that word will spread in her very petite town if she consults her own info center.  Is there any real basis? It wasn't from her HR manager either, but a higher up, similar to a teacher saying it to a janitor. The co-workers job is also, supposedly at risk.	Yes
Okay so this is a UK based company. I just received a P45 letter stating that my last day of work was at the start of April. I'm on 0 hours so I usually only work the summer holidays and Christmas. I will now be free to work often but due to an abundance of staff I will remain on 0 hours. However I worked in May and received my pay fine, the letter does state my last payment which I received last month. I am covering shifts this month and I am due to work very shortly so I'm unsure how I have somehow 'left'. I'm concerned that I now won't get paid for the shifts coming up but it's odd how it states I left in April but then mentions my June pay which came from May. As it's a weekend I can't get hold of anyone and I'm unsure what to do. Can a large employer remove you without notice?	Yes
Hey, y'all. Any employee law information you can give me, either state or federal, as well as any advice on resolving any legal matters as quickly as I possibly can would be greatly appreciated!  So, since I teach during the school year, I have employment over the summer with a summer camp. I signed no contract with my employers after receiving the job offer - only an employment application and information for payroll. I accepted the job on the premise that I would be paid an hourly wage as I did last year for the same job, but I was told after approximately a week of work that I would be paid a flat rate of $450/week.   The new year also came with some new rules for the camp counselors. We cannot leave the campus without permission, and can only leave for 2 hours at night, one-at-a-time between 11PM-1AM. We were also told that we would be getting overtime pay, and if we worked overtime, to log it on the final week of the payroll cycle in which we will only be present on campus for 1 of the 7 days.   On another note, I was offered a better position at this camp initially, and then they took the offer back to give it to another candidate after I had already made living arrangements for the summer. But I'm not sure that I can prove this/it will hold up in court.  * 1. Since I am required to be present unless given permission and am only allowed 2 hours per night off campus with that permission, does this mean that I am on call 24 hours? If so, can I be paid for the hours that I am not necessarily actively doing something since I am essentially required to just be around?  * 2. Is keeping me here for a month with no release okay? How can I get some time away from here if I want to see family or when I have to move my permanent residence in 2 weeks?  * 3. Do I have a case against my employer for not paying overtime and asking us to alter our time sheets even though this was discussed in a private meeting and there is no written record?  * 4. Can the camp be liable for my expenses since they took back a job offer after I made living arrangements? Again, I'm not really sure I can prove this part.  * 5. Who do I report the above issues to, and how long will it feasibly take to get fixed? Is it possible to resolve some of these issues within a couple of weeks or will I be toughing it out until the end of the camp?	Yes
Feeling torn about this and just looking for perspective. I work at a private hospital. On our internal email server (no external communications outside of the building), a department head's secretary (by way of the CEO it turns out) forwarded an email, explaining that the hospital held a position against the ACA and encouraged staff to contact their legislators in support of repeal. The email also request that once the employee contacted their representative(s), they should respond to the email so that the CEO could have a record of support for stats. Surely this isn't legal? It's one thing to encourage staff to contact legislators WITH THEIR OWN OPINION. It's a whole other issue when there is a possibility of discrimination based on participation. Just looking for thoughts.	Yes
Let's say I have friend who is currently in an extremely abusive relationship to the point where it is affecting her work. I am also her supervisor. Would it be possible for me to ask for a restraining order from her boyfriend? Let's say she is in such a bad state the she cannot ask herself, is being forced not to. But me, along with a few other people see how bad it is and want to get her out. Therefore if we have several people that can attest to this, could this make a difference? Like can we make an argument that she has been abused so badly she cannot make this decision for herself? If this is not technically possible, what is my next best course of action?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
"Im working for a P.I. as an assistant. He wants me to phone a suspect for him, because his voice would be recognized.   Most of the things he asked me to say seems alright, but two things seem sketchy.   He wants me to say:  &gt;*""You are not allowed to leave the country, or the city limits. If you are found fleeing you will be arrested immediately.""*  This is merely  to intimidate them... we havent been told this by police. **Is it legal to tell someone *you will be arrested for doing/not doing xyz*, as a bluff?**  Also:  &gt;*""If we cant get your friends contact info, they will be sued as well""*  This is very possible, but a lawsuit is not yet confirmed. **Is it legal to tell someone ""you **will** be sued unless xyz"", as a bluff**"	Yes
I'm wondering if any employment attorneys can help me identify the basic criteria for a successful hostile work environment claim. Specifically, suppose an employer has acted negligently, but perhaps not intentionally so, in a fashion that adversely impacts an employees career or mental health, is that sufficient for a hostile workplace claim?   As an example, say you work for a company where you need special licensure and that company screws up the process, keeping you from working. Is there a claim there?   What if your company prevents you from working for an extended period, which results in problems for you elsewhere? Say for example an 18 wheeler driver has a bunch of cocaine discovered in his trailer shipment. He has nothing to do with the coke smuggling but gets suspended for 6 months by his company anyway. Is this a hostile work environment?  What if an employee is excessively drug tested or scrutinized at work?   What if an employee is pressured to accept unfavorable workplace evaluations as a condition of returning to work?	Yes
Looking for an employment lawyer to help with a situation where work is refusing to make an accommodation for a physical injury connected to my job. At this point I'm just looking for advice on what my options are (there's no court case at the moment).  Does anyone have a recommendation? I'd love to find a lawyer who is good at working out difficult situations without escalating a conflict.	Yes
Hey everyone. I recently got laid off and am seeking full time work. I just received an offer from a local guy to buy cars for him and his business . They said they need vehicles for their business and will supply bank drafts if I negotiate the deal and I receive a commission based on what I negotiate. I just wonder what a dealership and bank will think when I walk in with a lot of cash available and buy high end vehicles.  Is this legal? do dealerships even care?  Thanks you guys!	Yes
Hello - over the last few years, I noticed my skin had been getting progressive worse like I'm really allergic to something.  I've documented the deterioration of my skin the whole time at my doctor's behest.  Over the last two years, I've worked with my doctors to try everything possible - from steroids to light therapy to daily injections.  Nothing worked.  My doctor began to wonder if it was an environmental issue and encouraged me to stay away from my old, musty office for two weeks and see what happens - lo and behold, my skin turned almost back to normal for the first time in years.    I came back to my boss and talked to her about options for me to continue working - I offered telecommuting, working in another office across the street and coming in for meetings, etc.  She refused to work with me on anything.  I'm now taking medical leave.  What options do I have?	Yes
I'm newly employed and need an attorney to review my employment contract. I've been recommended someone, but I'm struggling with the wording of the email. It never seems to sound right- it sounds like I'm asking for a favor instead of hiring him or whatever it's called. I'd appreciate some help with the initial contact/request. For example, I'm not sure if I send the contract with the first email or outline any expectations/problems I have with it.  Thanks for your time.	Yes
A fellow Redditor told me over on personal finance that if your hours at your job get butchered to the point where you only have one small shift a paycheck, it can be viewed as constructive dismissal and might be grounds for unemployment qualification even if you quit.  My question is, is this true? And if so, are their any technicalities and conditional rules to look into before I try to apply? I worked at McDonald's for three months and in my last month of work they cut me to one day a week, and eventually one day a paycheck. So, naturally, I quit. I'm looking for a new job but could really use some cash to hold me over, even if it's just enough to keep my phone turned on and pay my ride for gas when they take me to interviews.	Yes
My 50's mother in currently in a temp (6 month full-time I think) position and a permanent position opened in the vacancy of her coworker, same job just permanent.  She was told not to apply because it would interfere with her position possibly going permanent. Within a week of that, the application on the other position closed and she was also told her job was not being changed to permanent. They were going to close her temp and open an identical perm job in her slot that doesn't have a new application period but is pulling from the list of candidates from the job she was told not to apply for. She was told afterward that they were specifically looking for someone 'energetic and outgoing' in both positions. Given the fact that she was told she might be changed over, and was told she wasn't right after application closed, it is really fishy. Is this a defendable age discrimination case?	Yes
Hi,  My wife's employer pays for her health insurance. About a month ago, she had a routine doctors appointment. The doctor refused to see her since the insurance was terminated, unless she paid out of pocket. This also delayed her month prescription of medicine. Now she has a sudden sever pain in her neck, and she called her insurance to see what urgent care she should go to. They informed her that her policy was terminated again. This is very frustrating. Is this a legal or employment board issue? Someone told her to just go to the urgent care and send the bill to her boss. I think that is a bad idea.   Her employer has never announced to the overall company that there has been nonpayment of the insurance premiums. For all we know, they have failed to make payments on time other months as well. My big concern is what if she was in a serious accident or had a sudden illness. We could be liable for all the charges and he full bill if that were to happen.   Any advice?	Yes
"So ever since I got hired at this job there has been an issue with a co-worker and there is a long list let me just start   #1: complains about every thing I do. If it's not my music it's about the way I work and he goes to tell our boss and I get either yelled at or asked to turn of my music  #2: I was playing my music loud enough that I can here it in my area but walks over to my area and complains that my music is too vulgar and it offends him and his religion(Islam) I was listening to wu tang clan and the song had nothing to do with Muslims or middle eastern countries but claims that the words ""mother fucking nigga"" offends him and proceeded to yell it across the shop which in turn offended me because he's not African American I am that pissed me off  #3: I was working on a tire and proceeded to bitch about the way I work and how I'm inconsiderate to my other co workers and that I'm a lazy fat fuck   I just wanna know when it's legal to punch someone in the mouth to make them shut the fuck up and my boss won't help me either btw because the employee make the company more money than I do slightly and has tenure there. Please someone just tell me I can punch him in the mouth because I'm heated and this is the last fucking straw "	Yes
Working part-time and get paid bi-weekly. Just over a month ago, one of my days was not registered and wasn't paid. I emailed management, they said I'd get it the next pay period. That didn't happen either.   The week in question, I managed to get a lot of extra hours and ended up with 50 total (including the 8 that weren't paid). I finally got back in and spoke face-to-face with a manager and they sorted it out. With all the fuckups, I made it clear that those were OT and that I had 42 hours that week and those 8 would have made it 50. (With the understanding that anything over 40 in a week is OT.)  I was told that the only way I, as a part-timer, could get OT was while working more than 8hrs in a day. The whole OT after 8hrs is foreign to me, but I know I've seen it as part of the union contract.   What I would like to know before I escalate this is... is the manager right? I never received a copy of the union contract, so I'm not sure what my rights are from that side. I just thought federal law required payment of OT for anything over 40.  Right now, I'm just kind of pissed at the fact that it's been over a month and I still haven't gotten paid for that day and nobody seems to give a shit.	Yes
Title.  I live in Michigan and where I work, I recently got in a bit of trouble for not giving a coworkers next shift to a (potential) customer over the phone. This is a basic retail sales environment, if that matters.   When I lived in North Carolina, I was told that it was illegal to give a schedule out like that, as there was no way of knowing if the person asking had ill intentions or not, I never thought to look it up, and just stuck with it.   Now, no matter what google searches I do, I only find results for allotted breaks, overtime, and the like.   Any help would be awesome, because this manager is kind of a dick, and if I can, I'd like to prove him wrong. I'm not above admitting I was in the wrong, though. And to be honest, I'm mostly just curious.	Yes
Hello,  I'm curious about the legality of this. This is a company that I contract with, but am not an official employee of. Are these extensive restrictions legal? Are there any limitations on them?  *For and in consideration of my employment and placement as a tutor for _________, I hereby agree that during my employment for ________ and for a period of one year after the end or termination of my employment, irrespective of the time, manner or cause of said termination, I will not directly or indirectly, either as principal, agent, employee or employer, stockholder, co-partner or in any other individual or representative capacity whatsoever, solicit or tutor any person whom I have tutored while acting as an agent and/or tutor for _________. I also will not tutor any person referred to me by any client, which client was referred to me by Prime Academics, or referred to me by any psychologist or therapist of any client referred to me by Prime Academics, unless I first refer said person to Prime Academics for arrangements to be made for payment of tutoring fees for said tutoring.

Yes
I've an ongoing dispute with my employer for over a year now. We've been going back and forth through the state Labor Commission over wages and unpaid overtime. Thus far we haven't reached a resolution.  Recently, my boss handed me a memo that detailed a bunch of new policies about when to clock in, clock out, overtime, etc and asked that I sign the memo. I declined considering that a lot of what was in the memo didn't make sense and my boss wasn't able to clarify.  Payday has come and gone without my paycheck being deposited. Obviously this is a problem but what do I actually *do* about it? I have bills that need to be paid and I don't have the money to do that because my wages haven't been deposited.	Yes
"I had an employee give a verbal two week notice on Saturday. She cited that she wasn't happy and the office wasn't a good fit, and specifically mentioned it was not because of me. This morning, she said she was leaving early Wednesday for an appointment and I said that would not be possible as we didn't have coverage for her. She snapped, went on a rant about how I (the office manager) am actually the reason she's leaving, and that she is ""done."" Gathered her things and left.  I am left wondering what sort of legal protection the office has if she tries to file for unemployment. She has already secured a new job, and unfortunately, I was not able to get a resignation in writing, so I have no documentation beyond a statement I wrote out this morning regarding the situation. What should I do? Or just wait it out and see if an unemployment request comes through?"	Yes
"Hi /r/legaladvice!  I have been working in a salon industry for a substantial amount of time and was even Assistant Manager at other salons I worked at. I recently moved home during my year off before grad school and I started working at a salon at the beginning of April. I told the owner that I would be leaving at the end of July to go to grad school which is why I refused a management position with his salon. During the interview I asked for a certain amount per hour and he increased the dollar amount without any provocation. I thought this was a great opportunity for me and I took the basic sales level position.   Upon starting my job I was given sales goals and was told (unlike many others) that as long as I hit my goal I would receive 10% commission. He handed me an employee handbook and as I started to read through it line by line the owner told me all I had to do was sign the last page. I told him that I just wanted to read through in case I needed to initial any part or if I had questions about a section. He instructed me that there was no other place to initial and that I don't have to read it because it was straight forward. He pressured me into signing the last page without being able to fully go over it and I was not given a copy of what I had signed despite me asking frequently for one.   There weren't any problems in April or in May. I met all of my sales goals and was given my commission on the day it was promised. In early June I arrived at the salon location I was opening and found a letter he had left for me instructing that my hourly pay was now decreased by 20% with no mention of change in commission structure. The only other employees that received this letter were all going to school at the end of the summer but their letters stated specific hourly pay changes and changes in commission structure. Many employees quit but I decided to call the owner and alert him to the fact that I was promised at least a certain dollar amount per hour and it was his decision to increase it and now after the 20% decrease, I was below the amount I had asked for in my interview. He agreed and decided to bump my pay up to my requested amount in the interview.   After this conversation took place, he then gave me a very high sales goal and put me at a salon that wasn't busy enough for me to meet it. However after a couple of weeks he and the scheduling manager began asking me if I could cover shifts at a busier store for other employees. After accepting the shifts I was now working full time (40hr/week) after just wanting to do a max of 30. On the final day of June I ended up selling $1300+ for the busy salon and surpassed my sales goal by $9. July 1st was the end of the week and I was already clocking in 40+ hours when I asked if I could go home early since the salon died down. There were multiple employees there who could have taken care of our clients. The assistant manager told me that it was ""ok for me to leave 1 hour early"" considering I had to go to a second job that night. The salon was closed Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday for 4th of July. On Wednesday I was scheduled for 11 hours, Thursday for 12 hours, and Friday for 11 hours. On Wednesday I had worked all day and did not take a break. I saw that we were slowing down at the end of the day and when another assistant manager came in to close (who would've taken all the appointments anyway thus leaving me with nothing to do) told me that I could leave early again since there were no clients coming in and I had already been there for 10 hours. I went home and heard nothing.  I came in on Thursday fully intending to work my 12 hour shift because Thursdays are very busy and I knew they would need help. I worked non stop without a break until 5pm when the owner (whom I haven't seen in days) comes in and hands me a letter that he is terminating my employment due to ""excessive absenteeism without the approval of a supervisor"". I was livid. I initialed the document that said that I did not agree with the terms on which I was being terminated and left.   He is supposed to be paying out commission this week and I'm afraid he won't give it to me because a co-worker sent me a copy of the employee handbook which states on the last page that if you are terminated you are not entitled to you commission. I'm wondering if I have any legal recourse here. Clearly I was forced to sign a document in front of him and I wasn't able to read anything from it because he never sent me a copy and I feel like he took advantage of this situation because he clearly gave me a sales goal that I wasn't supposed to meet last month but I did and I feel like he's worming his way out of paying my commission. He knew that I would be giving my two weeks at the end of this week (after I was supposed to get my commission check) and I feel like he tried to beat me to the punch. I have NEVER been in trouble at this job and I know that he can terminate employment for whatever reason but I feel like I worked for free essentially. This commission check was supposed to be $500+ and help me for school.  TLDR; Was given a huge sales goal last month that wasn't intended to be reached. Surpassed the goal and the owner terminated my employment for things that were approved of by supervisors. Now I fear he won't pay me my commission due to an employee handbook he forced me to sign without reading."	Yes
"Throwaway acc.   I currently work for a company making a low wage for the area that I'm living in. A (shockingly high) 40% of my income is put towards my rent. The other 60% is split between food, utilities, gas, student loan payments and the remainder going towards personal interests and very little going towards savings.  Anyways, I was given a ""promotion"" 7 months ago (only in responsibility, not in title or salary) and part of the position required that I receive professional training that totaled $1900. I was asked by a manager that I take the class (over the phone, then the classes sent to me via email). My company has a 1 and 2 year payback plan. Over $2500 is a 2 year payback and under is a 1 year payback. So if I leave within the next 5 months, I'm being told I'm required to pay back the full $1900.  Can they legally require me to pay back the training cost when it was asked that I take the course so I was able to fulfill the duties of the ""promotion"" I was given? Unfortunately, this would be a prohibiting factor of me leaving this company unless I were to receive a signing bonus elsewhere. I do not have even half of the money to pay back.   I live in VA and the company was incorporated in PA and all of our legal documents say they are governed under the law of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania."	Yes
Hi /r/legaladvice, throwaway here.  I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options. On my separation agreement, they extended my exercise period from 90 days to 2 years, which made me not buy the shares and wait for an exit or something like that. Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.  Around 10 months after the separation agreement, my options were cancelled, and the CEO said this was because the extension wasn't allowed under the stock option agreement. A few lawyers went through the agreements and said this was BS. Despite this, she (the CEO) tried to make a monetary agreement for a fraction of what the shares are worth for me to give them up.  I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.  Should I try emailing the directors explaining my story, or go straight to a lawyer and send a letter of demand?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
For the record, I'm a mobile phlebotomist. I drive my car to the patients house and collect my specimen and drop off at the lab.  I had a meeting with her and the result was that she is going to pay me for the work I've done at home so that's good, but what I'm trying to find out is when I'm supposed to clock in. The office is 35 miles from home but I usually don't go there, and never before I see my patients, and instead may drive for over an hour before I get to my first patient which is when I'm supposed to clock in.  So then I do my job drawing blood then drop off the specimens at the nearest lab and after that I'm supposed to clock out. Many times I'll be an hour or more from home.  What is my boss supposed to be paying me for driving between 100 and 200 miles a day?  When am I supposed to clock in and out for work when my boss sends me an hour from home to work?  Finally, after our meeting they said that until my pay was sorted and a new contract is drawn up I won't be getting any phlebotomy jobs or other work (I understand this qualifies me for unemployment?)  If my boss comes back with a b.s. contact paying me less (she claimed that part of my 13/hr payment was for vehicle upkeep.) Or something else what happens if I don't sign it?  Thanks for your time!	Yes
"A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine (I am a supervisor) got into a yelling match with me over me asking him to do something he didn't want to do. He did not directly threaten me verbally at this point, but he is twice my size and was attempting to intimidate me; including him coming up close to me and asking ""You wanna say something to me?"" In a threatening tone.  I contacted our director, and the other supervisor, to alert them to this. The other supervisor comes in because they live close and I was very much under the impression I was not safe at work. The co-worker that threatened me returned; thinking I was out of the office, he began to brag about how he was about to come back in and attack me.   At this, I ask him to leave for the day and all hell breaks loose. He and the other supervisor start screaming at one another, as myself and other had to hold the two back from one another or there would have been a fight. Finally he leaves the office, and having heard what happened, our director comes in to speak with him. Our director leaves, the asshole who threatened me got to work the rest of the shift. I was promised that the situation would be resolved and I was more than happy to be patient. Weeks have passed and literally nothing has been done, even the bare minimum that the director promised.   Now when have HR coming in tomorrow with an eye to fire all three of us involved. I'm at my ropes end with this company, and I've been told by a few people that if I'm fired that I'd be in my right to sue them. Is there any truth to that?"	Yes
So, long story short: my child was admitted to the hospital I work for. Their lab value ranges in their EMR were set to adult values, so my kid was discharged without treatment. I took her to a different hospital when symptoms didn't resolve and her pediatrician (employer) acted as though we were exaggerating the pain.  New doctor points out her lab values were very off. Turns out kid has bone infection and will likely need many future surgeries since the bacteria ate away some of a growth plate.  New doctor's opinion is this would've been avoided if initial lab values were addressed. Also that if my wife and I had listened to the original doctors, my kid would be legless or crippled.  So I'm in a rough position. I don't want to lose my job, but I am facing many days off work, many long trips to specialist, likely future surgeries, and a whopper of medical bills from both hospital stays. Not to mention the suffering of my kid, 5 (so far) days of being hospitalized, one surgery, and future pain from this.  If I would sue, can they terminate me?	Yes
Not sure if this is the right thread, off sick due to a very personal issue because of stress (no I'm not bluffing it's real), I originally wanted to go back to work however my GP advised me not to. Now I am undertaking therapy and don't think I am ready for work but knowing the nature of my company they will do everything to get me back. What rights do I have? Can a OH Nurse overturn the sick note?	Yes
I was working contract for an oilfield company and resigned from the position. My boss has since been bitter and threatened not to pay me. I quit because he was inconsistent and unreliable with paying me. The time limit for acquiring my checks are 21-28 days after the invoice is created. It's day 28 and he has yet to contact me. What is my next step?	Yes
Hey, so I'm getting laid off in the state of Pennsylvania. I have a bit of advanced warning, and I know they are going to offer me a shitty contract employee position that pays by the job.  I'm not going to accept that job, and am actively looking for work. It won't pay nearly as well, and involves being out in the field 100%, while my current position only requires occasional field work.   Can I file for unemployment in my state? Or does my rejecting the shitty job disqualify me? I'm pretty surey boss offers everyone he fires a shitty job to avoid paying unemployment to anyone.   It won't affect my decision, but it will help me plan financially.   Thanks!	Yes
I'm looking to sublease an apartment for the rest of the summer. My spouse will not be staying with me but I have been told at past apartments that I can include spousal income when it asks what my income is. Is this still the case if he will not be joining me?	No
Last thursday August 3rd my ex boyfriend/roommate(we were both unable to move out due to financial reasons) was arrested for a violent crime. As he was being arrested, he asked the officer to tell me to log in and use his account to make sure rent was paid for the month. It was. I had already given him a person check of $930 for the rent and utilities and such and it had already been cashed.  Today I arrived home to find a notice on my door saying rent payment bounced and rent is still due plus nearly $200 of fees. If I don't pay by the end of the day tomorrow there will be a dispossessory warrant and an additional $200 will be added. His family already came into the apartment with a police escort to collect his things but in the process, they ripped my internet box out of the wall destroying the cables and kept the internet box refusing to give it back even though i told them it was mine and the bill is in my name. (so there's another $200 fee). They demanded to keep the couch claiming it was his, I didn't bother to fight it because it was a gift to the both of us for him. They took the couch outside my apartment door and shredded it and left it there (Hello another$300 fee to have it removed).  So currently I have to pay full rent plus these fees by tomorrow afternoon when I've already paid him for his portion of rent.  I am planning on calling my bank and the complex first thing in the morning but I don't think any of this can be done in the deadline.  Should I contact the police and report stolen money/items?   Do I need to contact his family and demand the items/money?  I don't know what to do.	No
In Michigan, Broke up with girlfriend and packed her stuff.  She took it and left to her friends.  I bagged and box almost everything and set it in a neat pile in the driveway.  She came back with friends to help, and spent 4 hours collecting things throughout my house and refused to leave.  I called the police after one of them threatened to kick in my daughter's door over a vacuum.  The police said she can kick in my front door if she has stuff in my house, and she can bring anyone into my house.  Is that true, and if she leaves with her belongings, how long is it still her residence?	No
"When the children were born, I tried my best to keep them on track with their developmental milestones given to us by the pediatrician.  When I weened my son off of bottles and breastfeeding at 8 months old and began baby food, the grandparents immediately put a stop to it, insisting he would choke or that the sippy cup would hurt his mouth. They continued giving him bottles against my wishes and those of the doctor to the extent that the doctor dismissed the children from her practice.  Both of my children ended up eating pureed foods and using bottles until they went to preschool.  My son wasn't talking when he was supposed to - around 2 years old - so I signed him up for the Early Learning Coalition Early Intervention Head Start program. Their father insisted I was forcing them to grow up too fast, and that he'd eventually just start talking on his own. After seeing the ""baby school"" as we called it, he relented, and my son was considered a preschooler at 2 years old, in the state school system with a structural and safe environment, and speech therapy. I was ecstatic to see their father agreeing to something finally. It turns out that my son is autistic, and this early intervention has helped him enough that it is barely noticeable.  My daughter was a thumb sucker since the womb. When she was born, be I bought her onesies with hand covers on them, and tried to get her to use a pacifier instead. His family undid it all, insisting that if it kept her calm and happy, let her do it until she grows out if it. (She was a colic baby)  She is now 8 years old, needs her mouth reconstructed so her front upper jaw won't be shaped like her thumb anymore, needs braces to straighten her teeth, and STILL sucks her thumb when she sleeps.  I left when my daughter was 7 months old. I tried to take the children with me, but he took them from me and locked them in the room with his parents. I was forced to leave without them. I tried multiple times to get the children back through the courts - even with evidence of domestic violence - but because he had more money, he kept getting primary custody. I was able to get them back for a year, before any court order was in place, and during that time (they were 3 and 4) I got them off the bottles, potty trained them both, and introduced them to solid foods. Getting them into school and social scenarios was a little harder. While my son had been in ""baby school"" since 2 years old, his grandparents wouldn't let him eat the school lunch, and only packed him a pack of crackers and an applesauce, quoting that he wouldn't eat anything else. (My kids, at the time, would eat anything I gave them)  So as my children grew older, they refused to eat anything they were not already introduced to. They would go as far as to act terrified, cry, and even vomit to justify their fear of new or different things. Even today, while I have had progress over the last few years, they will only eat things such as chicken and rice (their dad's family staple) pizza, macaroni and cheese, or fast food chicken nuggets. They don't like hot dogs, hamburgers, any kind of red meat, had never had any fruits or vegetables, or even candies and chocolate. They don't like chocolate milk or soda or tea. They are robbing themselves of their own childhood - and I don't mind some of these, but this is ridiculous. We have a rule that they have to try one new thing every visit. If they don't like it, they don't have to finish it, but they do have to try it. It's worked so far for so many things, but we're still far from even having begun.  My children have never known the need for physical exertion. They have never been exposed to sports at their dad's. They refuse to ride their bikes or scooters or skateboards. They get tired walking to the mailbox. They claim a box of food is too heavy to carry, they expect me to walk across the room to give them something off of the table in front of them. I don't do it - but someone else does. It took a long time to get my son to understand that he cannot bark at, or give orders to, my mother or myself. My daughter is still learning that she has to do things for herself. They don't know how to open packets of food, tie their shoes, brush their hair, fold their clothes...the list goes on. And they refuse to learn when I try to teach them. Because they're so used to everything coming so easily, or someone else doing it for them, if you try to teach them and they don't get it the first time, they get angry with the task and say they'll never do it again.  My daughter is actually exceptionally intelligent. She is making straight A's in school. I'm trying to skip her a grade and teach her things that are more mentally simulating and challenging, but the moment she is required to put effort into it, she refuses to do it, claiming it's too difficult for her. Turns out the county here doesn't skip grades, but they've agreed to change her educational material regardless. Hopefully, this will help her learn to accept hardships as a challenge and not a stopping point.  The children were never taught how to control their emotions, so when something happens, I have to drop everything, grab their face, tell them, ""don't panic, breathe, look at me and nothing else."" ""The worst thing you can do in a high-stress situation is panic. Now look at this situation, and tell me how you would deduce a solution"" I refuse to let them give up on anything they have the potential to enjoy.  It takes time to get through to them, but I take all the time I'm given to prepare them. I find myself often reminding them, ""as your mother, I am not here to do everything for you. I am here to keep you from harm as I guide you to learn to do these things for yourself. That is my job."" And they begin to understand.  They also learned the concept of money from me. It started with bribes as rewards, then fines as punishments - which I don't personally condone, but it taught them the basics of law and finances. If they messed up, I'd ""ticket"" them, and they'd pay. Suddenly they realised they didn't have enough money to buy another of whatever they broke. They learned that we can't ""just go out and buy another one"" anytime something breaks. So they better care of things. They know now when I do or do not have the money, but they trust me when I tell them I'll get what they ask for when I can afford it - so long as they earned it.  The children often say they do not want to return to my house, because it is too hard for them to be with me, because I teach them sports, budgeting, household chores, cooking, logical deduction, stress management... They say they're only given things to play with at their dad's, and the only real interaction they get is when they are given help with homework and food. They're otherwise left to their own devices and their grandparents will just do whatever keeps them quiet and happy so the kids don't have to do for themselves at all.  But my shining moment was when the children tried to do something they know very well how to do - such as warming up food in the microwave - and their grandparents panicked and took away the chance. When the children realized that they were treated like independent and intelligent people with me, and babies at their father's, they started getting more excited about our visits.   But the issue is, their father considers their attempts to care for themselves as ""rebellion"", and they're punished for it, then the children are told to me angry with me. The children are told I do not love them or want them, that I neglect them so they're forced to learn for themselves. Everything I teach them becomes undone. Their lost money is returned, their broken items replaced, their independence stolen from them. Then they go back to their Xbox, their tablets...they get locked away from the world I'm trying to show them.  Since 2013, my visits have been every other weekend, and 2 weeks out of the summer. During 2014-2015, they were withheld from me for 18 months in violation of that order until September of 2015, and now I'm starting all over again. Every attempt I've made to regain custody has been turned on me, and the courts see nothing wrong with how the children are parented by their father's family. I've been denied custody now 3 times.  So...what can I do?  Sorry this is too long."	No
"First of all, I know.  My husband and I have a two bedroom apartment and we are trying to save for a house. We decided to rent out the extra room to help. Our neighborhood is low income. Everyone we are friends with in the complex also are renting out rooms on the side. I'm not really sure if this is illegal since we are living there and the only thing that could be seen as illegal is they are not on the lease.  We met this couple off a local facebook room search. They are a married couple with a dog. They were great. Their dog is AMAZING (seriously I know it's not important but this is an A+ dog). There's just been some things the last few months that have made us realize we need to part with them and find new roommates.  The big issue is they went on a weeks vacation and came back with two kids. They are the wife's kids from a previous relationship that live with their father on the other side of the country. They just showed up with the kids. No notice. No ""Hey is it okay if my kids stay for a bit"" or even a ""hey my kids are coming back with us."" Just showed up and acted like this was a-okay.  It's not. It's a tiny two bedroom apartment and it is way too crowded for 6 people. I have pretty bad social anxiety. I was diagnosed as agoraphobic at one point and didnt leave my home for over a year. I really can't handle this much activity in my home.  Now on to my legal question.  They are not on the lease. They do not have any mail coming to the apartment. Nothing is in their name. There's nothing that ties them down in a residential manner to the apartment. There's no contract or paper trail as they were paying in cash.  Can I just give them a 30 days notice?  I want to explain the situation to them (ie, I rented the room to a single couple not a family of 4) and tell them they have 30 days to leave and after 30 days the locks will be changed."	No
"Hello all,  We are a new clothing company based out of Phoenix AZ. We are in a very early stages of creating this business so I wanted to cover everything to make sure what I am printing is legal. Our shirts have sayings such as ""Kill ____ ____"". The blank spaces are the names of certain people such as politicians and celebrities. I wanted to see if I can legally print and sell shirts with this type of wording on them. ""Kill"" Murder"" and other violent terms. I know it sounds weird but I have made a couple and have people tell me how much they love them all the time. If you could help me out, that would be great."	No
Throwaway, just in case.  My wife has joint custody of her kids.  We live in another state, so their father has them for the majority of the time.  He travels for his job some times and she will go back to stay with the kids to keep them in school whike he travels for a week or more at a time.  Recently, he decided to move and sold his house.  They, he and the kids, currently live in a camper with no running water and only a generator for electricity.  The kids are taking showers at the Y and he said the can shower at school once it starts back.  He plans to dig a well, but it has been over a month and he hasnt even has someone come out to look for a site to drill.  He had been talking about sending the kids to live with us.  Nothing definite, but with the way things are going, we figured it would be for the school year.    Last night he said he was not going to let the kids come live with us.  I believe he pulled this last night because she was taking the kids to visit family today and he is leaving to travel  for work before she would be back.  Very passive aggressive.  He wont be able to appear in front of a judge because he will be travelling, so if a hearing is required, it will have to be delayed until he returns near the end of the month.    My wife is going to talk to her attorney there.  What can we expect, as she is going to be asking for emergency (lack of a better word there) 100% custody until their father has a place other than a camper with a generator.    As a note: both kids are teenagers and want to live with us.  They were 5 or 6 when the divorce happened.  I know some states take this into account, but it is not relevant to the issue of living conditions.	No
Hi I need an legal advice in Ohio Dublin about landlord violating the lease. I'm supposed to move in this Saturday to a specific address I signed lease to and they called this afternoon that they already gave out my apartment to other person because their apartment had carpet problem or something. They told me they found another same priced same designed apartment for tomorrow. But now I don't want to continue with this apartment. How would I get the penalty fee from the landlord?	No
I have a roommate that is not on the lease and has caused damage in the room. I walked into his room the yesterday to take photos because he should be vacating by the 31st of July. I found a large hole in the bathroom and some other minor damage. I took photos and sent them to him asking if he can pay for the damages before leaving. He said he called the cops because my photo proves I was breaking and entering and he will have me arrested if I press for him to pay for damages. He also claims the cops told him he has the right to arrest me and have filed a report if he chooses to press charges.   There is no written agreement that he is part of the lease, and the apartment is solely in my name. I only went in to take photographs. My career is in serious risk if I am arrested for breaking and entering, and I need to know if he is bluffing or serious.  I have agreed to back off since he is essentially blackmailing me because he knows I have a lot to lose if I am arrested.   Thank you for your time and consideration.	No
So I have an account on plenty of fish and I met a girl on there who was claiming to be 19, I'm 21 so I messaged her. We exchanged numbers and she started texting me. Eventually she started sending me nudes and speaking to me sexually she also asked for some and I sent one. We had planned on meeting up but then she told me she was actually 17 but we could have sex. I replied that we absolutely could not do anything like that and immediately deleted all the pictures she sent me along with all other messages and her number. I also reported her account to POF. She would message me occasionally after that but would get one word answers and communications eventually ceased. Then I get a call from her dad saying he saw all the messages and he's going to have me arrested. So I explain the situation which he should already know if he really had the messages. Now he's telling me that if I don't pay him $500 he's going to report me to the police. I don't know what to do. I don't have $500. Please help.	No
"A family I know just sold a house. They had been renting the house out for 2-3 years prior to selling. They received an email from the buyer of the new house demanding compensation for the air conditioner which apparently has some sort of leak. They are saying that it was not in the disclosure.  The seller does not believe that the buyers have an argument as the air conditioning ""works"". The tenants who reported the problem had the refrigerant refilled and had no complaints after that.  The buyer threatened some sort of legal action (but I personally believe that to be a bluff).   I guess the questions that I would like answered are:  1) what constitutes as ""working condition"", it's clear that the a/c still works if you just refill the refrigerant  2) are the sellers liable for the full repair costs/were they obligated to list the leak in the disclosure if the a/c was still working to their knowledge (I do not know if they knew about the leak or not)"	No
So I was out at 1am with friends, and I had 2 oz of weed in my bag. Cops were called by the neighbor, they showed up detained us and kept me bc of my weed I also had a scale but they gave it back. I'm 16 this is my first offense. What's going to happen at court ?	No
Here's my situation regarding my marriage..  I am American-Vietnamese, born here in the United States in the state of Georgia. My husband was an international student I met when I was 17. We started a relationship in which lead to our marriage when I was 18. I had our son when I was 19. We went through paper work to change his status and attempt to get his green card through marriage. I am not familiar with what the correct terms of the whole process. During the process I was pregnant with our son, so the initial interview happened to confirm if our marriage was real or not. We definitely passed really easy because of our baby. Since then he got temporary USA resident and temporary work permit (I think that's what it is), and the application for his actual green card applied for. We got lots of confirmation letters that the application had been received. We lived our lives as we waited. During this wait time our relationship went downhill. It was a very unhealthy relationship in which I needed to escape in order to recover myself and to do everything I could to provide for my son. He was arrested when I was 21 for domestic violence. It was an accident on his part but I was scared so I called the police. He had to pay a fine, take family violence classes, and was on parole for a few months. That was the end of our relationship.. the last straw. I immediately moved to Florida with my son to get away and start my life over. I left with nothing but our clothes. I've since then built a life for my son and I here. I am about to turn 23, he is 29, and throughout these two years I have let his dad see him many times. I am grateful for their father-son bond and do not ask much from his father. His dad asked me to continue helping him getting his green card because he does not want to be sent back to Vietnam. Out of fear that he would be sent back and my son would not have his father here in the states or him not being able to help with child support, I agreed. I am in a very healthy relationship right now with a man who loves my son and I for about six months now.  Now that I live in another state and in a relationship, I'm worried. He called to tell me that he got a letter asking for an interview next month. It's been almost two years since I left and this is the first letter. He asked me to fly in for this interview. Let me also add his family here in the states are the ones handling all the paper work and they are the ones going back and forth with the lawyer.. I pretty much have been doing what I was told since this whole process begin and I have no knowledge of what goes on.  All I know is I have to attend this interview and I am nervous. He was arrested and I moved out of state and am in a new relationship. I honestly want out, but I do not know where to start. I no longer care about getting his green card and don't really want any ties to him anymore besides our son. I want to get a divorce and move on with my life. Should I go to this interview and tell them our relationship didn't work out? And I don't want to do this anymore? And is there any chances I can get in trouble?	No
My mother-in-law is about to visit my wife and I for 3 days (Thursday night, leaving Sunday evening.)  We have strong reasons to believe that MiL's spouse will attempt to have her served for divorce, while she's staying with us.  (His motivations would likely be: (1) doesn't have to deal with her in the immediate aftermath, since she'll be 200 miles away (2) snubbing my wife and I for perceived past transgressions, and (3) MiL might be inclined to ask to stay with us, rather than return to a tension-filled situation at her domicile  (a request that my wife and I would unanimously deny.)  While we don't want to interfere with the court, we also don't want to be used as pawns in MiL's current-husband's game.  Asking her not to come is not an option that I am allowed to consider.  So I want to know where the legal limits are on how I can delay service until after we have returned her home.  * Are we allowed to lie to a process server, and claim that she is not present at our house, when she is? * If we decide to just put her up in a hotel room &amp; visit her there-- taking other precautions to not be followed-- can the court's process server just hand the documents over to another adult at my residence, and consider her properly served?	No
"I am a 27 year old and have been on the ""Healthy Michigan Plan"" through Michigan medicaid due to being a graduate student with no income.  Back in February I received a one-time inheritance payment of $26,000 which would bump me over the limit for 133% of the federal poverty level which is the designated level for benefits eligibility.  My negligence to report the ""income"" change within 10 days indicates that I may be responsible for overpayments by medicaid.  I had been confused about whether the inheritance counted as income and would be treated as such by medicaid.  I did some research and am unsure as to whether the income reporting is annually or monthly.  Since that one time payment, my income has returned to zero. What are my options at this point?  I have used medical services since that time using my medicaid insurance. Will reporting the income now start a shit storm that will require legal counsel?"	No
My parents have just recently started the process of selling their home that they've owned for 30+ yrs. My grandfather owned the adjacent property in which their septic system lies. It was sold in the last year and now the current owner states that they cannot sell their home without first putting in a new septic system on their property. They've offered the guy a few thousand dollars to get around this extra work, but alas he is a major doucebag and likes to see the world burn. Do they have any legal rights to fight this?	No
Hi,  Like the title states - the previous tenants in our apartment left a big couch, some tables, and some assorted bedroom furniture.  During the course of our lease, our building changed hands and now our new landlord is threatening to withhold our security deposit if we don't move the furniture out of the apartment.  We've moved out everything we own, but it'd be a huge pain in the ass to move out the other furniture (specifically the ancient, heavy couch) down 2 flights of stairs. Are we obligated to move this out? Or can we assert that we're leaving the apartment in the same state we got it in?	No
Backstory is my girlfriend and I recently moved in together (in Colorado) in June but her lease for her last place doesn't end until August. To be able to move in with me she couldn't afford July's portion of rent which was $425 for her. Her and her ex roommate agreed both verbally and over text that she would pay June and July utilities but my girlfriend would only have to pay for June's rent.  Now July has come along and the ex roommate is demanding she pays or she will take her to court. My girlfriend talked to her old landlord and he does remember the situation but both my girlfriend and ex roommate have two different stories and he just wants to be paid. He said he has not been paid by ex roommate  yet and is willing to give an extension to my girlfriend if she needs. He just is confused by the situation and now not really sure what was agreed upon.   Does the ex roommate have a case against my GF? Does she have one if my GF does pay rent to landlord (even though wasn't decided previously) and still try and take her to court. What are the scenarios here? My GF cant afford this and is feeling screwed over but knows nothing was signed just verbal and text agreements. It is in Fort Collins CO. Any help would be appreciated 	No
Previous posts are [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6hqze7/my_neighbor_cut_my_trees/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ivmck/update_my_neighbor_cut_my_trees_nh/)  It's been a month and we've finally gotten a detailed drawing of landmarks from the surveyor (to confirm that the surveyor got the lines plotted correctly), comprehensive estimates from a landscaper based on photos provided by the previous owner of the house and timber values from an arborist. Now that everything is all squared away in that regard, we're getting ready to submit a demand letter.   The one question my lawyer asked is if I should include a value in the demand letter or if I should invite them to contact my lawyer for further details. What would be the pros and cons of each approach?	No
I just got home today, and there was a letter wedged in my screen door that had a bunch of information on it describing our termination of tenancy. The thing is, my house isn't rented, we bought the house, and the name that the letter was directed to wasn't ours, although it was our address. Is this a scam? Should i just ignore it?	No
"My boyfriend and I decided we were ready to start house hunting; we found a place we liked and put in an offer, after some negotiation it was accepted. Initially, I was involved in all the documents with our real estate agent (a friend of the family) when drafting offers, and I met with the mortgage broker, but other than that, my boyfriend has been the one handling everything with the agent/broker/lawyer.  About a week ago, my boyfriend said that the broker advised leaving me off the ""mortgage documents"" because I was unemployed and he was the primary bacon maker.  He works in emergency response, I'm a game designer about to start my own company, but am currently unemployed until after the house is settled - one big life change at a time. Anyway, that made sense to me; I will have no active income at the time of the move (already put in notice at my current job).  What he has come to explain to me more fully is that I will not be on any of the formal documents; we renegotiated the offer one last time (for some work to be completed before the closing date, as recommended by our home inspector) to be drafted by the end of today, but my boyfriend now tells me that I will not be a part of those documents and only he will be signing them; that it was the recommendation of the mortgage broker. He explained that, if I were to be included in the documents, any of my debts would add to his and he would no longer be approved for the mortgage at all.  It is true that I have a $400 balance on my credit card, but that is my only debt in the world (his credit card balance is somewhere around $3000).  My boyfriend also said that a lawyer could draft a document stating that I was an equal owner of the property, even if my name doesn't go on the documents he is signing and sending off today.  My question is, does all of this sound legit? Is my $400 debt enough to write me out of the whole deal? Could a document like that be prepared after-the-fact? In Canada, there is a bit of a boost for home buyers tax returns (the year they purchase) - would I still be eligible for this if my name is not technically on the offer, bank documents, or deed to the property?  Thanks all - sorry if this doesn't make sense or if I don't know what I'm talking about!"	No
Hello, posting from Ontario, Canada.  I am a step-parent of three years to a nine year old girl whom my wife had with her ex boyfriend. My wife and I also share a child together of two years. I have fully supported this family and the biological father has paid maybe $600 total over the entire course that I have been in a relationship with my now-wife. To give context, I make about $53k per year on average, and my wife makes about $16k. I suspect the bio father makes about $45ish.   My wife refuses to pursue legal action against the biological father to pay child support. My home expenses are roughly $3000 a month, and my family (my mother, myself, my father) have basically helped clothe, feed, and provide a home to my step child. The bio father provides no support.  Am I legally able to initiate a legal action against him for child support? All of the results I found online were post-divorce, but I am still married. Please advise, thank you!	No
Paid for parking at a college and was mailed a pass, in the meantime I printed a Temp Pass which states I paid for Summer Parking + my vehicle license plate. It expired 2 days ago and I got a ticket ($35) for displaying an expired temp pass and not the one that was mailed to me. {I understand the word of the law is the law, I just feel the cop was unnecessarily being a dick}	No
My parents bought their California house in 1981 and their property value never goes up for property tax reasons.  Does anyone know what law caused them to have this benefit?  It's not proposition 13 because their property value doesn't even go up 2% each year.  They are in San Bernardino County in California in case that's relevant.    I believe that people who bought their house at a later year don't get this benefit because their next door neighbor bought about eight years later and has a substantially higher property value for property taxes.

Hi Reddit, after 2 years of living in a shitty 3-1/2 apartment in Kingston, Ontario, my girlfriend and I finally moved out and we now live in Québec about 9 hours away.   The day before moving out, the moving company started packing boxes in the apartment for us. Unfortunately, we didn't notice that they packed all of our 4 keys in a box (Apt key, building key, laundry room key and the mailbox key). So when we left, we told the landlord that we'd mail her the keys as soon as we unpacked at our new location.  Today, while I was at work, my girlfriend received a call from the landlord claiming that we owed her 100$ for the keys (25$ per key), because the envelope got ripped in the mail and the content was lost.  Also, a while back when I was still a tenant there, I lost the mailbox key and the landlord charged me 25$ to get a new key/lock because they didn't have a copy of the key. A month later, my girlfriend found the key and SURPRISE, the old and new keys are identical and the lock was never changed. I paid 25$ for a key double...  Imo, 100$ is way over the line to get 4 keys replaced since I'm about 95% certain that she has the originals and could easily make doubles at Home Hardware. We've been out of the province for over a month now and my girlfriend and I just want to move on from this thing.  My questions are:  1. Do I owe her anything since I did my part and mailed the keys? She blames me for not using a fancy bubble wrap package instead of a regular envelope.  2. If I do owe her money, how much? 100$ is unreasonable for 4x key doubles. Right now, we plan to ask her to make doubles and send us a copy of the bill.  3. If I end up flipping her off and stop answering her calls, is there a change this could legally bite me in the ass in the long run? I don't want to go to court for a bunch of keys. It pisses me off because we've been exemplary tenants for over 2 years and the landlord is still trying to rip us off even after we've moved out. I don't have the time because of work   in the military and I can't afford it.  Sorry for the wall of text, but this has got my girlfriend really stressed out and we're not sure what our options are here. Thank you in advance for your answers.  tl;dr: After we moved out, 4 keys were lost in the mail and landlord wants to charge us 100$ to get them replaced, when she can easily make doubles at Home Hardware for 3$ per key.	No
So here's my deal: I live in Los Angeles. About last November I was looking for a new place to move into. A friend told me about two friends of hers who were looking for a roommate. Rent's $350/mo. Cool, right? I move in, no lease, mo-mo, no contract, but I pay a $210 deposit. (If I got a receipt at the time it's gone now.) Well this place was alright (except for the cockroach infestation) and these two fellas seemed ok at first.. but they're both actors and one has a hot head because he looks like Thor. If Thor was a total tool. As the weather started to get warmer (I'm talking like low 70s here) I open the windows to let a nice, cool breeze in. Apparently my roommates were allergic to fresh air and wanted the windows to be closed at all times and have the a/c running 24/7. We didn't pay any utilities so they could care less about what it cost to run it. The bathroom smelled like mildew and there was black mold on the windows when I moved in (I took care of that, as well as a large part of the cockroach infestation.(Endorsement: Check out Advion Bait syringes👌)) So I keep the bathroom window open to air it out. By and by these guys kick me out because I won't keep the windows shut (I think I bruised Thor's ego because he's used to getting his way.) Anyway, I'm told I'll get my deposit back when someone else moves in (smells like BS). I say screw it and go on my merry way. A month later (a few days ago now) I text Thor telling him that I need my deposit. He says tough luck, claiming there are damages (a lie. I did nothing but improve that place.) By CA state law, any deductions from the deposit must be taken out within 21 days of a tenant having moved out, and an itemized list of said damages along with the (reasonable) costs. I never heard anything from my old roommate until I texted him and he refused to return my deposit. In that sense, I have the upper hand..however, I have no contract. No receipt of a deposit (only a PayPal transaction for an amount greater than the deposit), no hard evidence except my recent texts and the check images and deductions from my bank account over the course of my having lived at that apartment. So I sent Thor a request for Deposit Return letter and my next step would be to take this to small claims court..but is it worth it? Do I have a leg to stand on or would it be a waste of time and money?  I only have texts and my check images and PayPal statements directed to him. I don't have a written contract or receipt of deposit, etc.  Should I just accept that there are unscrupulous douches out there and I'm a victim of theft, or is there a way I can fight this? Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice!	No
Im writting this on behalf of a friend.  A mom and dad are separated, and have a schedule for child custody. The mom sent the kids to camp at a location several hours away from the dad's home. When the camp is done, it will be time for the dad to pick up the kids from the mom. However, the mom purposely did not pay the camp to drive the kids home. This means that the dad is left to drive several hours to pick up the kids. Of course, he will drive there to pick them up. But, is there anyway to discipline the mom?  Is there anything that can be done?	No

"Firstly, I'm not as much looking for legal advice specifically but for anything that could help me in this situation. I don't want to give away my country of residence. I live in the EU, I hope this is enough information. Mods, if you think this post doesn't belong here, feel free to delete it. But it'd be nice, if you could point me in  a better direction. *I am afraid. Please hear me out.*  **TL;DR:** Found child-porn on my flatmates computer but don't want to call the police on him because  he is my friend and I may be in more trouble than him if the police searched our place. **TL;DR END**  The current situation: My flatmate and I live in my fathers house, I get to stay there for free, he pays a small rent.  It's not big but it's enough for two people. My dad lives in a house directly across the street  and we use his internet, more about that later.   Short introduction to my flatmate, let's call him Nick.  Nick is the personification of the term ""neckbeard"".  He has long hair, a beard on his neck, his room is always messy, he showers only once a week,  instead of a carpet he has worn boxers. He doesn't work, spends 90% of his time in front  of his gaming-rig and his mother pays all his expenses. He orders almost all of his food online  and in the rare case that he attempts to cook something by himself, the whole house smells horrible  and the kitchen is dirty (of course he doesn't clean up after himself). He takes my food  without asking. It has gotten so bad that he eats almost a third of it because he is to lazy to go  out end buy some himself. To top it of he owns a Katana-like sword. The only thing missing is a fedora. Sometimes he leaves the house for hours at weird times and never even gives a hint as to where he goes. Why did I let him move in with me? Despite all of the above, he actually is a very nice person and totally  oblivious to the fact that he is a neckbeard. Also, i didn't know how bad his neckbeardism was until  he moved in and we were friends for a long time.  Here is what made me suspicious of him and how I found the cp:  Clue 1: He once sent me a picture of a naked loli-girl (young anime girl for those who don't know what  ""loli"" means) and told me how cool it looked. The girl in the picture made a pose that concealed  her vagina and (probably non-existant) breasts. There was no real sexual aspect to it, the pose  was not sexual in any way. It was well drawn and actually looked pretty cool tbh. I also try to be  open minded, and loli isn't real.  Clue 2: He sometimes sends me memes about cp, but we have pretty dark humor.Even though the cp-memes  didn't really match the stuff we sent to each other normally, I didn't think too much of it.  Clue 3: Not really a clue, but it contributed to my actions: Nick has zero social awareness. He randomly puts his hand in his pants, blows his nose in his hand,  farts while talking to people and doesn't even realize that all the things he does may be disgusting. And of course the fact that he is a cliché neckbeard.  All of this made me think:""Well, if this isn't the perfect out-of-the-book pedophile."" And then I realized that he is using my fathers internet. My father once got (wrongly) accused  of being a pedophile by his crazy ex-girlfriend, therefore an investigation due to his internet access  being used to download cp could be more than dangerous for him.  I made a plan: Open Nicks Computer while he is away, get his harddrive, copy all of it's contents  to my own as fast as possible, put his PC back together and review the acquired data later.  I executed the plan, but didn't really think I would find anything. I just wanted to be sure.  What I found: *Several loli-pics. *A japanese loli-game. *A 15 minutes video of a ~ten year old girl masturbating (presumably) in front of a webcam.  I was horrified. I only watched a few seconds of the video, but I almost threw up on my keyboard.  I immediately deleted it.  After I calmed down a little I took my phone and wanted to call the police. But here are the problems:  *I now have cp on my harddrive. Even though I deleted it, it can be retrieved in case the police  decides to take my computer too. I could overwrite all free space on my disk (and thus making it  impossible to retrieve the deleted data), but that would be even more suspicious.  *Stealing someones personal files is probably illegal and evidence that was acquired trough illegal  means is often ignored by the court.  *I browsed some shady imageboards and accidentally stumbled over sexualised pictures of children. Not  even nude pictures, but little girls in swimwear doing poses and such. In case they can find out what  sites I visited in the past year, they may think I'm a pedo too.  *Sometimes I look and hentai-pictures online, so naturally I came across some loli material too. When  this happens I just ignore it as there is no real sexual appeal in it, but the police can't know that.  *I'm somewhat of a privacy freak. I use TOR browser, extra-long passwords and encrypt everything I can. One doesn't need much fantasy to turn this into just another pedo who is trying not to get caught.  *We laid our internet-cable from my fathers house to our house under the street. This was my dads idea  and probably is illegal.  *I used an encryption program to overwrite a few of my old hardrives so nobody can retrieve my old data.  The police will probably think there are hidden volumes with cp on them because there is no way to tell  the difference between a ""cleaned"" drive and and encrypted drive.  *I still kinda like Nick. He is just such a nice person and seems so helpless in his total ignorance  of everything. I don't think he would actually harm a child. And I don't want his mum to find out. She is  very sweet and protective of him and seeing her only child being locked away as a pedophile would break her  heart.  Long story short: If I called the police, my flatmate wouldn't be the only one having problems."	No
"I am an Active Duty member of the Air Force who recently PCS'd to Nebraska. Upon arrival I have been given 10 days to find a house before reporting to my gaining unit.  Talking to my sponsor, they advised me that the contracted military housing company is bad and ""honestly, kinda sketchy"". She advised that I rent a house off base.  Personally, I already wanted a house away from the base as it is less of a hassle for relatives who are visiting, and so I spent the last 8 days looking for a house. I found one that I liked, did a walkthrough and thought everything was good to go until I saw the lease.  The landlord has written a clause into the lease that if I break lease under SCRA lease termination rights (if I PCS [unlikely] or deploy for 90+ days [more likely]) that I am subject to pay $500 for using my right as a service member under SCRA.  Is this even legal? I have an appointment with the ADC (Airmen Defense Council) and my leadership has been notified. Obviously I'm going to be looking for another house, but I worry that this guy (who says he owns several homes and rents to military often) is scamming my fellow servicemen and servicewomen.  TL;DR Was about to sign on renting a house, noticed that the lease required me to pay $500 if I terminate my lease under SCRA pretenses as a military servicemember (which is allowed under certain conditions in the SCRA)."

So back in 2007 I moved out of the apartment I shared with my boyfriend at the time. He had thrashed a bunch of my belongings during a rough breakup and I had filed a police report, but eventually dropped the charges the police were planning on filing (domestic violence). He continued to live there, and I moved on. I NEVER signed the lease, but had agreed to be listed as an occupant - I don't recall if that involved giving them my social security number but they must have had it because when my ex left the apartment he did so a month early and didn't pay that rent. When I got the call from collections (now living in CA) I was super confused and asked if his name was also on the debt. They said no, it was just me.  Yes, I've waited a LONG ASS time to do anything, mostly because I have moved states a couple of times and have not been financially in a position to pursue him legally. I've asked him a couple of times to do the ethical thing and pay me the $700 but he is cheap and mean and will not.  At this point I get I may not have legal recourse, but just curious if this was even legal to do to a non-lease holder and would there be any way to remove the debt?	No
       Hello Reddit - I've used a throwaway because this post may contain a bit of possibly identifying features when used with my original account history.    So the case is pretty simple - We've lived at our place in the kinda country for 15 years. We own about 100 acres of farm/woodlands.  About a year ago (because we don't have commercial zoning laws) A man purchased the tiny piece of property next to us and began building his massive enterprise (multi-million dollar a year gross).   They clear cut their land and actually cut down and destroyed parts of our property/woods in addition to building their HUGE (like youth detention centre big) security fence on our property.   They have admitted that these two things happened and that they would be willing to negotiate reparations for the damage and the fence being on our property (so they want it to remain there). I don't have parents (living in this house with a sibling - both under 23 years and students after mom died and left the house to us).   Where do I start with this? They wanted us to come up with an amount for the reparations but I don't know the first thing about the Line Fences Act/Squatters Rights/Reparations. Is there somewhere I can find case examples to get an idea of how much we should ask for?   Its worth it to also note that the construction crew building this business verbally attacked me on a few occasions and were not the least bit respectful to the wildlife/land/earth (or residential people) at all. Its been emotionally draining - I'm not going to go into detail on the 8+ incidences but just want you to know whats been going on.   I also want to give props to the business for finally responding to my respectful letter requesting a meeting and volunteering the results of their land survey that confirmed they had built the fence on our property (roughly 2 metres into it actually).   We want to be respectful with them because they are our new neighbours but at the same time - we can't ignore the invasiveness that has occurred. Can anyone point me in the right direction?   Thanks in advance from small town Ontario!	No
Hello, I was wondering if someone on here could help point me in the right direction.    Back in March 2017 my 18 year old daughter contacted me and asked me to come pick her up and asked if she could live with us.  She had been out on her own since Jan 2016 when her and her mom got into a fight and her mom kicked her out.    I jumped on a plane immediately and flew to NC to pick her up.  After getting her settled in and enrolled and transfered in to the local High School I decided to contact the OAG to file a change of status and termination of CS.   The OAG mailed me the required forms and gave me instructions on how to prove her residency. Which I sumbitted per their request.    Now child support was due to terminate in June 2017 so there was merely 3 months of payments left from a 17 year history of the order. I did not want my ex to have anything she did not deserve especially once I learned my daughter had essentially been homeless since Jan 2016.   The AOG placed the moneys on hold while they verified the change.  Months went by.  Finally received a status update from the AOG on June 20th 2017.  However it was not was I was hoping for.  They informed me that with out the other parents signature stating she is giving me credit for those three months the AOG states they can not return the money to me.    The OAG claims it is their policy but refused to give me documentation stating the legal procedure claiming it is not public record.    It has been one month since they mailed my ex wife the documentation and she never responded.  I called the AOG and asked them what the next step was and they told me they do not have an answer for me.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor who ended up just contacting someone else who is going to send another letter to my ex wife inwhich will go straight to the trash.    So my question is what policy is the OAG following that stipulates they must have a response from the other party to determine status change?  They claimed it is not public record when I asked about such policy.  Also if I were to file a suit in court on what grounds would I file since the court order has already expired since my daughter is 18 and has now graduated?    A lawyer would cost too much in comparison to what the AOG is holding.   Any advice would be appreciative.	No
I took out a student loan in 2013 to attend trade school with a company called TFG and we paid those off in full. Now - 4 years later - NELNET is calling me saying that I have a student loan that is delinquent and will need to pay or it will start affecting my credit.   I know for a fact that we never took out federal student loans. What do I do?	No
Hi!  Our lease renewal is coming up in less than 3 weeks. We want to stay in the apartment as it's well located and nice. We contacted the landlord recently about renewing the lease and she's responded that the rent would increase by $180 (9% increase). The apartment is in California.  My understanding is that a landlord as to provide a 30 days notice before a rent increase of less than 10%, 60 days notice otherwise. Does that also apply in the case of a lease renewal coming up? Can I do anything to pay the new price later than 3 weeks from now?  Ideally I would like to reduce the increase, can we use this in our favor?  Thanks!	No
My friends and I love watching movies and making fun of them. It was suggested that we make a YouTube series of us doing this, and so I did some reasearch at this seems like it could be a fun hobby. I was going to have us sitting around with mics, and then show the movie as we are watching it at the bottom of the screen. It occurs to me though that the movie is under copyright, but I don't know exactly what that protects.  So what does the copyright prevent me from doing. Can I show the movie? If not, is there another way to do it that will make it legal?  Thank you in advance.	No
I'm 20 years old. I have one little brother, he's 8. He's with me right now. All of my relatives live in South Africa. My aunt and uncle are flying out to help me but they won't be here until Friday morning. I just need to know where to go to get the ball rolling.   My parents spoke of a will but I haven't been able to find it. My mom was an attorney so they didn't use one that I can contact. I know my parents had money, but it was all tied up in real estate. There are tenants living on 3 of their properties. Two sets I'm sure will be respectful but my parents were trying to evict the other set and I'm afraid they'll use this to take advantage of me and try and get some kind of claim to the house. Please don't think I'm selfish for thinking about money, but I need to take care of my brother.   I have both my parents credit cards and bank cards so money isn't an issue for the time being. But can the bank/credit card companies freeze the cards if they find out that my parents passed?   Most importantly I'm worried about my brother. I think my aunt will try and take custody of him. She spoke about bringing him back to SA with her. Can she do that? I have no job. I guess now I have money but I have no figures right now.  One of the reasons I'm worried about custody is that I regularly smoked weed before all of this. Now that I have to take care of my brother I obviously won't be doing that anymore. But I'm afraid that they'll drug test me and say I'm unfit for custody. With the amount I smoked it'll probably take 3+ months to get out of my system, maybe up to six. I've also been in two at fault car accidents this year, but I wasn't under the influence or anything. Can my aunt use this against me?  I don't even know what else I should be asking. Just a point in the right direction. This is the first time I've been able to sit down and think. I'm about to start doing some googling but I figured I'd post here first.   Thanks.	No
"Hello guys,  Well, the mother of my child is moving away with my kid about 300+ miles away from me. We were never married but have had split custody without any official court order for that matter.  I have had a personal addiction problem which I have sought treatment in recently after getting into Rehab.  She gave me the heads up of her move well over a year ago and I did not put up with a fight due to my admittance of personal demons.  At the moment I am clean and have turned a new leaf although I am within 3 months of recovery I'd rather not elaborate.  Despite my problem I have always held down a job, often two when no overtime is available.  I live with both parents, one who is retired and taking care of my child most days of the week and another who is retiring within the year to dedicate bringing my child to school and taking care of her.  Now this was something the mother of my child and I were ok with as our plan for 5 years.  However, she is still adamant of moving away.  She virtually has the worst credit score, car repo'd, lives with either her spouse or family.  I am not on child support however I make sure to give her a couple hundred+ monthly which was originally for day care services however, she hasn't been in day care for over a year.  (Maybe longer, it's hard to believe her at this point.)  Now with my health and wellness getting in order I fear for my child.  Her mom still plans on moving to LA despite no vehicle, credit score, and no family in that area, let alone a true job option or place (she is waiting on section 8).   She's ""almost done"" with school  and does not have a good employment history.   I really want to fight for full custody and keep my child with me and my parents, we even had a school lined up a few blocks away from my house but the mother of my child immediately interjected at my suggestion with ""shes not going to school here"".  With her vehicle repo'd I told her that I wanted my child with me being that you don't have a car nor stable home to live in and she was adamant of her moving to LA.  Despite no vehicle her response was ""she'll just have to school late"", she will be attending 1st grade.  I am really trying to not let the stress get to me.  I do NOT anticipate a relapse nor am I considering it, but I really want full custody of my child.  I work 7 days, 56 hours a week as my parents depend on me to maintain my good credit score (they have filed for bankruptcy) and despite the economy, there retirement pay supports our household."	No
Hi everyone, I (22f) have a question on how my husband and i should handle child support. So my husband is the military and we stationed in VA, he was recently contacted by social services about a former girlfriend who claims to have had his kid. Now we haven't done a paternity test yet, (we will have one done in about 2wks), but we are 98% the kid is his due to timing. So since we are pretty sure, my husband contacted the woman and spoke to her and discussed what it is she wanted for support and they both agreed to a few terms once the paternity test is completed and positive. So here is my question. The kid and mom are in TN and we are in VA, how do we go about through the court systems to sign something that states what we have agreed on since we are in different states?	No
"I bought my first house about a year ago in a small ohio town. On the property disclosure form the seller filled out they stated ""the property gets some standing water towards the rear of the yard"". After some decent rains this past year iv realized the flooding situation is worse than i first thought. The back 40 yards of my property has about a foot of standing water after a good rain and most times ir takes a couple days to drain. Is there anything i can do legally to keep the water back? Could i go after the sellers for the cost to fix it? Seems like a grey area since you cant really define ""some"". "	No
This is more of a curiosity question; however, it could affect me if the fires affect my area of BC. If the RCMP or Forestry service issue an evacuation order and I believe it is premature or unnecessary do I retain the right to stay on my property which is owned by me?

My partner and I are moving from Illinois to separate states. He will be working in New York and I will be attending grad school in Connecticut. He currently owns a car that is registered in IL which he will be giving to me to use while I'm in school.   I am trying to work through the mess of how/when we need to transfer everything. Can we both be on the title if we live in separate states? Is it easier to transfer title to me while we are still in IL and then register the car in CT? Will there be complications if he is on title still and is not a CT resident? Ideally he would remain on title as he will be paying for insurance, maintenance, and still will drive the car when we see each other.	No
A few months ago these complaints started, its a rough guess its a neighbor across the road who's girlfriend works nights assumingly and the vehicle may wake her up during Daytime hours.  The Vehicle in question is a Rx-8 with a slightly modified exhaust which didn't increase make it significantly louder, but the nosey person across the road made note to start the complaints after the maintenance was done.  Basically everything has been done to keep the idles low, and putt around to not offend anyone but the person keeps complaining saying its disturbing them, and we're at risk at being fined from Strata Council, due to this.  We don't know who it is exactly making the complaints so we're at a impass attempting to work it out, but will request a Council hearing regarding it so they can hear our side since the emails we've sent stating we've done everything possible to adhere and respect everyone's space.   ~~ My question is, is the Strata going to be basing this off local bylaws because those are enforcable with Sound measurements instead of just petty he said - she said statements about something annoying someone, when there are many loud noises in the complex and other vehicles and motorcycles just as loud that consistently go about and should be just as much of a offender.  It feels like we're being targetted just because of basically unknown reasons and the Strata is taking the side of the person filing complaint after complaint.  The vehicle is also only driven in daylight hours generally 12pm-6pm and never at night or early in the morning.  http://www.rdno.ca/bylaws/BL_2581.pdf  Is the information I found on local bylaws for sound enforcement, but could use some advice the best way to go about tackling this issue.

So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
If you are married and if the wife (not working) has higher income (passive) and the other has very low income (working very hard at a tough job) and a severe medical issue, can the husband claim SSI, or is he dependent on his wife's income and won't qualify because she makes too much money?	No
"As the title says, my roommates and I are being sued by a former landlord to the tune of roughly $7500 after a tenancy that stretched from 2014 until April of 2017. The bulk of the charges come from painting ($3000) and carpeting ($3200). In addition to these charges there are $600 in damages that they are attempting to charge us for that appear on the initial commencement checklist as being previously damaged, signed in 2014 at the outset of the lease. They are also suing us for their attorney's fees; one of my biggest questions regarding the issue is if they are allowed to do this and if so is there a limit to the amount we can be held liable for?  There are some damages we do not contest, such as wall dings, scratches, and a broken kitchen drawer, however, we assert that the ""damage"" to the paint and carpet was normal wear and tear over the course of a 3 year lease. Some of the paint in the home at lease origination was noted as ""freshly painted"", while other rooms were not. The carpets were dirty at the time of lease inception and one of the tenant's parents rented a carpet cleaner and cleaned them before they moved in, it is our belief that the carpets in the home may be original to the home (built 1997), but we do not know for sure.  After we moved out of the home the landlords fully re-painted and re-carpeted the entire house and have since sold it. It is our belief that they are attempting to leverage our security deposit and other alleged damages to offset the costs of their renovation of the property.   Ultimately, the main questions I have regarding our case are whether or not the life expectancy of the paint and carpeting was exceeded by the term of the lease and whether or not we are liable for their attorney fees should we choose to go to court.

Backstory,  we've been married 14 years.  We/He just bought our first house in another state.  We are moving with the intention of getting divorced in the next year. He agreed to move to my home town but said if he decides to purchase and not rent, he wants  me to not fight him for the house in the divorce.  I haven't worked significantly in the last several years to care for our daughter.   Will this document he wants me to sign hold up in court? I have no access to any money to hire legal help I'm not sure if I should sign.	No
I issued a cashier's check for $1200 on 5/12/16 to my old landlord for my deposit. I received a letter a month ago from my bank stating the check was never cashed, and that if my landlord didn't cash it or I didn't cancel it the funds would be turned over to the state as unclaimed funds. I messaged the ex landlord, and she asked me to reissue the check minus the fees for doing that. She admitted to losing the check, and I told her I would do it. Life happened, and I haven't done it yet. She messaged me today stating I have 5 days to get her the check or she would seek legal action. I have a bank statement showing the funds were withdrawn, along with a text message from her stating she both had the check and lost it. Does she have a leg to stand on in small claims court?  I was planning on doing this, since the right thing to do is give her the money. However, I am so offended that she would threaten to sue me when she would have forgotten all about the check and never gotten the money that I would have no problem going to court with her. If I do give her the check, I'm planning on having her sign a letter I write stating she did lose the check and will accept a new check for a smaller amount, subtracting the fees for reissuing the check. It will also state that she will not take any further legal action against me.  I apologize for the rambling post, but I have never been threatened to be sued before, and again I am just so offended that she would threaten to sue me for trying to help her get money she had forgotten about. I appreciate any advice given.	No
Hi Legal Advice!  We're considering options against our landlord and want some opinions before we speak with a lawyer.  We first reported bedbugs and mold on 5/15. Maintenance declined to treat the mold until the bedbug issue had been resolved.  Our landlord first sent pest control to our unit on 6/2. We received a note from the pest control company stated that the unit had been sprayed.   On 6/9, our landlord sent us a note threatening to evict us because we had not been properly prepared and the pest control company could not spray the until. We immediately reached out to corporate, informing them of the note we received from pest control. We did not receive a reply.  We then reach last week, when we are informed that the pest control company did not find any bedbugs the first three times they came out to treat the unit, however, they did find bedbugs on the fourth visit (so clearly we had bedbugs the entire time).  This is primarily relevant because they still have yet to treat the mold and Ohio code states that landlords are required to address maintenance emails in a reasonable time frame, at most 30 days. We were okay waiting for the mold to be treated if the maintenance men were trying to avoid the bedbugs, but if the landlord claimed that there were no bedbugs, the mold should have been treated immediately.  We are moving in a week, so typical solutions (escrow, etc.) are not available to us. We are very seriously considering suing our landlord, and know that we have a strong argument concerning the mold. However, we are unsure about a few things:  * Is this even something we can pursue? Legally, they've violated Ohio code, but as we can't go through the typical process, I'm not sure if that's something we're allowed to do.  * How likely would we be to able to argue that waiting two weeks before treating bedbugs falls outside of acceptable treatment? * Also, would we be able to claim negligence (or something similar) because we repeatedly told them that we still had bedbugs as the pest control company was telling them that we didn't? Do they have a responsibility to insure that the pest control company is doing a thorough job?  I'm trying to stick to the highlights, so hopefully this makes sense. I'm cutting out a lot of the communication between us, our landlord, and the pest control company.   Any guidance would be appreciated.  Thanks!	No
I've been working on a game and I have it pretty fleshed out. But I'm worried about moving forward without having some protection of it. How do I make steps to publish this to the public?  Is Kickstarter a good method to move forward? I hear that it's hard to successfully do a Kickstarter without having already made a game or some previous experience.	No
The toilet in our rental property overflowed, and caused several thousands dollars damage to the unit below. I was told that our tenant was very reckless and would not open the door to stop the toilet overflowing, even after people were banging on the door for several minutes (until eventually the police arrived). There is a police report which says the toilet overflowed.    We called a plumber to check on the toilet and he stated that there was nothing wrong with the toilet.  Next we tried to file a claim with our insurance (under the liability clause), but it was denied because the insurance company stated that I'm not liable, since the damage was not caused by my negligence. I was told that if my tenant had renter's insurance, their insurance would cover it.     Neither our tenant or the tenant below have renter's insurance. The landlord below is very angry and says that she will sue both me and my tenant in small claims court.    From what I understand since I'm not liable, I do not owe anything to the other landlord but I want to avoid the hassle of going to court, and I offered to pay $1500 as a goodwill gesture. Can this be used against me? (i.e. interpreted as admitting guilt?) Should I not give a check? or should I use any particular verbiage on the notes field?	No
My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.  My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?  Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.   I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!	No
"Hi there, First time posting here and I'm hoping that it's helpful to my understanding of the system and what the circumstances mean. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible.  Location: CT and NY -CT is where the crime is taking place, NY is where the person responsible lives. Summary: An independent contractor, working for our company in the service industry, has been and continues to plan and execute the theft of at least $25,000. That amount is what we know of so far but it keeps getting larger. He's accepting and reporting (on weekly reports) that money is coming in (to make us think it's being collected and placed into the right account). In reality, he's having clients make out checks to him personally and depositing them into his own bank account. He's also accepting cash from clients for things that aren't being reported and further, he has clients paying for services without reporting that they exist. Again, in total that theft amounts at least $25,000.  The real question: Okay so we spoke to some police officers in CT and they said that once the warrant is out (which will take 4-6 week) they will contact the police in NY and see if they will also issue a warrant. Now, let's say there is a warrant out in CT and NY BUT they also said that they won't actually go and bring him into custody...Huh? There's an unbelievable amount of evidence we've compiled that should be more than enough to go out and bring this person in but what it seems that we're being told is ""he's basically free to be until he makes a mistake."" How can this be correct? I understand that some CT police don't want to go all the way to NY to arrest this person but, what if he's in the state? What if he happens to be in the same town? Will they take a call that says ""Here he is?"" The answer seems to be no, and my mind also seems to be blown that a criminal isn't being brought it and put through our legal system. I don't even know what the charges would be but maybe - grand larceny, fraud, damage to a business, forgery, like what would it take to mobilize and bring this person to justice? Are we just stuck with a warrant waiting for him to get pulled over for running a stop sign? There has to be an easier, more efficient, and just way to have him answer for his transgressions. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"	No
"I am writing on behalf of a close friend. Her husband passed away rather dramatically and unexpectedly and she was forced to sell her old home and move into a new one. The company responsible for building this home we'll call Homes Inc. Where we live in Florida it rains a lot. Apparently when they put down the concrete foundation or the ""slab"" as they call it, they didn't allow it enough time to dry before they started putting the flooring in. Not long after she moved in, floor boards literally started to come apart as they became warped by water from underneath and the glue came undone. She spoke to Homes Inc. and they offered her $2,000 dollars for repairs to the floor in the areas where the leaks had happened. Keep in mind, this is still just a few months after her husband passed away and her whole world got turned upside down. She does not have experience with this sort of thing as her husband was the one to handle this kind of business. So she signed the very long paper and accepted the money. This money was not intended for any repairs to the concrete slab, it only paid to replace the damaged floor boards. What she failed to realize at the time was the true intent of this payoff. The document stated that Homes Inc. was exonerated from any blame for any future damage coming from this problem. It also said she was not allowed to speak to anyone about this or they could sue her. Now it's been months and she still gets leaks all over the house, in her bedroom, in her office, in the living room, in the kitchen. It's far and above a $1,700 job to repair and she feels terrible and trapped. She feels like she was completely deceived since they told her that the areas would dry out over time, yet this has clearly not been the case. She doesn't know what to do and quite frankly neither do I. I know hardly anything about the legality of all this, but I know the fact that she signed that document isn't a good sign.  Does she have any chance at legal action against Homes Inc. for repairs to her home? Who or what kind of lawyer would she need to speak to? I've heard of certain legal scenarios where the lawyers work for a share of the winnings. She doesn't have the money for a long and lengthy legal dispute, but could this be an option for her?"	No
So a guy almost hit me with his car while I crossed the street.  As he pulled around he yelled obscenities at me, I yelled obscenities back, and then he yelled that he was going to beat the shit out of me and started pulling his car over.  I told him to hold on while I wrote down his plates.  He drove off.  I called the cops.  2 questions: Firstly, I don't really care anymore and was seriously freaked out by the situation and in hindsight honestly don't really care to press charges.  How much is this going to cost me in time and money?  Secondly, I yelled obscenities back at him (but no threats).  Does that totally screw me over?  Thank you in advance, legal gods.	No

"My grandma had a stroke, she is fully paralyzed on the left side. Can not function mentally. She can not go to the bathroom without the help of someone else. My Step grandpa will not help her because he is physically unable. My step grandpa is also very emotionally abusive to her, yells and cusses at her when she needs her diaper changed or is hungry. I do hold recordings of my grandma complaining about how she is mistreated and never wants to ask for food because she doesn't want to be emotionally abused.   My mother has power of attorney, yet my step grandpa declines her the call list when tonight my grandma was admitted to the ER. My grandma says that she doesn't want to be around her husband (my step grandpa) because he is ""not nice to her"". My grandma has medicare in Arkansas and a supplemental plan.

I've been working to get all holds on my license taken off. I was told I owed $1,300 to a county in Louisiana (I currently reside in Arizona). I paid the money, but realized the hold never came off my license. Turns out I have a seperate ticket in the City Court that has a bench warrant attached to it. They said I owe $710, must be paid in full (No payment options) or I can get my butt to the court where I will be jailed for 45 days as retribution to the ticket. I don't have 710 bucks and honestly I would do the time if i could get to Louisiana but that's not an option, either. Is there any other way I can go about getting on a payment plan or fines reduced?!? I just had to take out a damn loan for the first 1300 bucks and am paying on that, so another loan isn't really an option for me.	No
My girlfriend's dad wants to change her name. She's 16 and will be 17 soon. Next year she'll be 18. Is he allowed to change her name without consent?  I know she doesn't want it to be changed, but he can be quite abusive so she hasn't argued much about it.  If the parent wants to change their child's name without the child's consent, is that easy for them to do?	No
When the landlord is a step father to the wife of the husband who abandoned the home and his belongings, what action can be taken? Can the home owner legally withhold the processions of the renter who has abandoned the home, leaving his family behind and not paying the agreed upon rent to the landlord? Is the landlord within his rights to confiscate the personal belongings until he pays past rent and returns all keys to the landlord?	No
My neighbors contractor flooded their unit, which in turn caused damage to my units kitchen and carpet. I called his insurance company about their procedures and my reimbursement for moving expenses and he says they're a liability company who reimburses the owner after they submit an estimate. I take this to my landlord, and now his representative wants us to either continue paying rent while we stay in the unrepaired unit, or move all our belongings out while they do repairs without reimbursing us for moving fees or hotel charges. I had told her if they wanted to break the lease 7 months early, they'd have to give us our deposit and last months rent back (which was paid at the beginning of the lease), and allow us to stay for the month of August rent free while we searched for another home. She countered with a hard no, and said we can continue to pay rent on the damaged unit until we leave, at which point they'll refund our deposit and last month if required, or she will call the state to have the unit condemned then lock the doors and have us escorted to gather our belongings and exit the property...sans our deposit of course.  My question is, what are my options here? I'm dumb and don't have renters insurance, and believe me I'll never make that mistake again. My realtor who is a family friend recommended I go to small claims court and make my case, and they'll side with me considering the situation. I tried to be cordial with my landlords rep, but she devolved into insults and that was quite frankly the straw that broke the camel's back. I don't want to get taken advantage of here, especially for doing nothing except having the misfortune of living in the unit next to the one where the problem originated.   The unit isn't unlivable, but the condition of the kitchen cabinets and carpet is beyond repairs; should I be paying rent during a time when the apartment isn't in a state that was agreed upon during the lease? Do i have recourse in seeking reimbursement or even straight payment for my moving expenses? And what abkut the lease...can my landlord just decide to condemn the place even if it truly isnt condemned and unlivable just to have a reason to break the lease? Can I get some advice? Thank you so much reddit, it's very much appreciated.	No

"Hi Reddit! I posted a similar thread a few weeks ago over in a relationships thread - but I have a follow-up post as well as sneaking some advice. We live in Santa Monica, Los Angeles.   In short, my boyfriend and I just moved to a nicer, higher rent area. We were disappointed to find out that upstairs neighbor (""Alexandria"") is AirBnB'ing her place and the high traffic of guests make us feel uncomfortable. The guests have to walk in front of our front door/bedroom to get to our neighbors' place. There was like a new family/guest almost every three nights. While the guests are mostly quiet, they always seem to come in and out at weird hours which gets annoying. We have approached our neighbor but nothing has changed. She doesn't seem to care about our comfort.  I should also mention that AirBnB'ing is also illegal in Santa Monica, not to mention violating the terms of our agreement.   Since nothing changed - my boyfriend and I decided to email the AirBnB listing to our landlord and her husband. The immediately called us, appreciated our efforts, and said that they would shut this down. They confirmed that the listing has been removed. They also said that they would leave our names out of it.  Alexandria has since moved back in and we have seen a lot more of her these last few weeks.  So apparently Alexandria also has a dog and smokes on property. Again, she's violating MORE terms on the lease agreement. It's also illegal to smoke in apartments in Santa Monica.   We live in a little enclave environment - so we can hear the dog all the time and smell the smoke.   Honestly, my boyfriend and I wouldn't care if she smokes or has a dog or even Air BnB *if she kept it more secret*. Instead, we have to deal with the smoke, the dog, as well as random people walking by our front door almost every other day (until the AirBnB was shut down). I want to reiterate that we just moved to the neighborhood and pay much higher in rent; if we knew this was happening we wouldn't have moved here!  Anyways, my boyfriend and I decided to stay quiet about the smoking and dog.... until a few days ago. Alexandria left her dog out in the little courtyard area right in front of our apartment. She left it there for a good while (over an hour). It was barking and whimpering. My boyfriend works from home and got fed up. He sent Alexandria a text that said:  ""Hi Alexandria. Your dog is barking right outside our window. I am trying to work and this is very distracting. I would appreciate it if you collected your dog. Cheers""  No response. Alexandria came down 15 minutes later, got her dog, and went back upstairs.  An hour later, she knocks at our front door and proceeds to go on absolute tirade at my boyfriend. Here are some the highlights from her incoherent outburst:  - She told us to lose her number and that we will need a lawyer ""for harassing"" her so much. (THE FUCK?)  - She told us that we need to move out and live on a farm if we can't handle ""the typical happenings of a neighbor""  - She repeatedly told us that we were evil and that we need to ""GET OUT""  - She said that's she's going to be the miserable neighbor and make our lives a living hell  - She said we complain too much - to which my boyfriend responded, ""What are you talking about?"" She goes ""You know - the dog, the smoking, the AirBnB!"" My boyfriend replied ""What AirBnB?"" She goes ""Whatever.""  My boyfriend remained calm the entire time (bless his heart). We were both trying to stifle laughter because we couldn't believe how ridiculous she was being.  The only correspondence we've with Alexandria is on two occasions 1) We offered to buy her a rug to help quell the noise upstairs from all her guests; she gladly took our $100  and 2) a text message about the dog. That's it. The correspondence has been nothing but polite. Lots of ""thank yous"" and smiley faces.   ANYWAYS. Here's the kicker. About a month ago when we noticed the AirBnB ramping up - **we decided to purchase a security camera.** Thank goodness we did that, because we got her whole outburst on video.  From the looks of it, it appears that she basically ADMITTED on camera to smoking, having a dog, and AirBnB'ing. (BTW, we have never complained to her or the landlord about smoking or the dog...)  We immediately sent the security footage video to our landlords. They called us immediately afterwards and said that they will ""deal with it.""   Interestingly enough, Alexandria left for vacation the very next morning.  We suspect that Alexandria will get evicted at this point. That issue is between Alexandria and the landlords.  My boyfriend and I are wondering what else we can do to protect ourselves in the event that Alexandria tries to sue us for harassment. Should we make the first move here since we have documented proof of her acting crazy? Should we send this footage (of her threatening us) to the police? Should we try to get a retraining order first? Should we send all the evidence of her AirBnB'ing illegally? We realize that we have some ammunition here, but we want to make sure we use it in the smartest way possible. We are also worried about her retaliating. The previous tenant was never around so Alexandria was able to get away with having a dog/AirBnBing/smoking/etc. for many years until we moved in. I worry that she will try to seek revenge (she just seems like that type of person, we have a gut feeling about this).  My boyfriend and I have somehow NEVER had to deal with a crazy neighbor in all our apartment-living in Los Angeles. We appreciate all your help."	No
I've been carrying this on my shoulders since Nov. 2015. The therapists know the entire situation, in depth, and even though I feel iffy about what to do, they still encourage me. It is not such a black and white/cookie cutter situation, it's also very twisted, and gross, and sick... So I'll spare you the details and make this brief.   I don't have money to hire a lawyer, but my current therapist told me to at least seek a free consultation with one. How do I do this? If the crime happened in another county, what do I need to do. What will happen if/when I finally press charges? What should I expect? I need to know so much, but I don't know what all to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	No
"My husband likes to tell me that if I were to divorce him I wouldn't get any alimony. He seems to be under the impression that if I were to ""abandon"" the marriage then I'm not entitled to alimony. It's only if he were to divorce me that I would be given it.   I'm a stahm with only a high school diploma, so I wouldn't be making as much as him were I to get a job. Divorcing him would be me voluntarily giving up his pay and the lifestyle we have, so I wouldn't be awarded any alimony.   I don't think this is true. But I thought it couldn't hurt to ask r/legaladvice to find out for sure."	No
(KS) I have moved out to an apartment. We have been fairly amicable to this point. She has decided that she wants to go ahead and file for divorce now. She lives with her parents. She pays no rent. I have a fairly new job after going to school for two years and I am still getting my financial stability under me. Her answer to the budget stated in the DRA is a hypothetical budget of what she'd spend IF/WHEN she moves into a new situation. The state of Kansas utilizes third party child support and the sooner we file, the sooner I get a massive payment that will be tough to handle as of now. Any suggestions to what I can do to postpone filing or payments? I can try and clarify with any questions. We have been married eight years and have one child. Thank you for your time.	No
We have battled the poor drainage on the road above our home since we purchased in 2012.  The hill we live on is steep, but the road is sloped too flat, so instead of diverting water to the ditch (above the road), it is diverted towards our house (below the road).  During a larger than average rain event while we were away from the house all the water from above our house (large area with many homes) was basically diverted to my driveway rather than the ditches and culverts system that is in place.  A torrent of water ripped my very manicured gravel driveway to shreds with gully's almost a foot deep.  Rock from my driveway was transported up about 100 feet from the driveway on our yard below.  We gave the borough the chance to offer to fix our driveway and they didn't make an offer.  I think it may be time to get a lawyer.  What kind of lawyer do I need, will they require upfront payment, how do I pick a good lawyer?  They have previous plans to re-surface the road this year and we want an engineer to certify their plan will solve our drainage issues permanently, and to reimburse us for costs related to fixing our driveway (I estimate somewhere in the $4000-8000 range + legal costs).	No
"Hello all.   I signed a year long lease for a two bedroom apartment in Maryland in October of last year. I moved in with my sister at the time. She wanted to move back home in April, so she signed a deletion form the next day at the leasing office to have her name removed from the lease. The people at the office told her she was good to go.   My girlfriend signed an addition form to have her name placed on the lease in place of my sisters. We were also told by the leasing office that we were good to go.   She moved her stuff in after my sister moved out.   Now, in July, we were three days late to pay our rent. I did not realize that they would retaliate so heavily.   Rent was due on 7/4. I paid the rent, along with the late fee (and ""court fees"", which I was unaware at the time what that even meant) on 7/7. It was paid through the online portal. My account shows a zero balance. I checked my mail today and found a complaint from my apartment written on 7/19, with a court date listed for 7/27, for failure to pay rent and with the full amount of rent listed as still due. The tenants listed on the summons are myself, and my sister, who's name should have been deleted from the lease MONTHS ago.   What are my options? If my account is fully paid, do I really need to waste my time going to court? This is my first time being late to pay ANYTHING and I'm shocked that they still want me to appear to court when my account is currently paid in full. I am currently the only employee at my job and it is incredibly difficult for me to take time off, let alone at such short notice. Can I have the case closed without having to appear? And if I do have to appear, would my sister have to as well?"	No
I received a parking ticket in the mail from U of I in Urbana, but I've never been there (I live in Wisconsin). In addition, the ticket was dated 2009 but my plates were issued in 2017 (they had the right plates for me). The number and website on the form seem to be legit University of Illinois parking services. I called them and the ticket is on record for them, but the vehicle description is wrong and they couldn't provide an explanation for the date. Will this negatively impact my credit or anything? How do I fight this? I've already sent a vehicle abstract from the Wisconsin DMV to the U of I parking services website to prove my plates are relatively new.	No
"Howdy /r/legaladvice.   My wife and I recently bought a house and are looking to end our 2 year lease early. It's scheduled to be up April of next year and we anticipate being fully ""moved over"" by November.   The problem? Our landlord has no desire to work with us. I'm fully prepared to pay out the remainder if needed, but I'm really trying to find a middle ground. Our lease doesn't have any verbiage regarding terminating early.   He's stated the only way he'll let us out is if he's able to sell the house. No timeline. So if he lists it high we could end up in April 2018 anyway. He said he has no desire to re-rent the house after I offered to help find another tenant and might even leave it vacant for a bit after we leave.   From my basic understanding: That's malarkey. He has to at least ""try"".   What are my options here? What's the best way to approach it?  The situation has my wife furious because he originally tried to sell the place one month in to the 2 year lease (it fell through) and was only going to give us 2 times our security deposit for the ""inconvenience""."

I'm in the middle of getting my flight (China Eastern from US to Japan) cancelled in order to attend my great grandmother's funeral. In order to get the full refund, they're asking for legal proof of relation in addition to the death certificate since we don't have the same last name. Her grandson (my father) doesn't have the same last name either. Any tips for how to go about this? When I google I only see stuff about immigration.	No

"Hi LegalAdvice  A section in my lease contains the following: ""Lessee shall not at anytime allow local/municipal inspection or inspectors on lessors property. Any housing violation, fine, or fee associated with this type of inspection is the responsibility of the lessee.  Any fee or repairs not done or paid in a timely manner within 20 days is grounds for termination of the lease.""   This doesn't seem legal; if a building inspector shows up, I'm supposed to tell him he can't inspect the property?  And if I do, I am held liable for any fees, even for situations where the lessor refused to make repairs to the building (water leak creating rotten flooring).   Looks like this [Link](http://petriepettit.com/blog/landlord-tenant/so-are-illegal-provisions-in-wisconsin-residential-rental-agreements-severable-or-not) says our lease is void, but I'm trying to understand if I have ground to stand on before paying a lawyer to write a letter.  Any insight is appreciated.  Thanks all!"	No
My girlfriend, and I are thinking of moving in with my parents in Colorado to focus primarily on school. Right now we're working full time while going to school full time in Nebraska, and it's way to much work... however we're running into big problems regarding in-state tuition in Colorado.   To my understanding I would qualify for in-state tuition because my parents both live there, and have for multiple years. However she has no relatives up there at all. We thought maybe she'd be able to gain residency there, but it seems like Colorado is very difficult. From my understanding she wouldn't be able to gain residency or in-state tuition till she is 22 years old, or considered emancipated. This is because in Colorado you're considered a minor until 21 years old, and your residency is based off where your parents are located. We've both been completely independent for 2 years, living together for 1 year.   Sorry for the poor format I'm at work, and trying to be fast. I'm basically wondering 1. How can my girlfriend get in-state tuition without having to become emancipated 2. What does becoming emancipated include? would there be reasons not too? 3. Is there anyway around these strict in-state tuition rules that are legal? Thanks everybody in advance.	No
"I own and rent out a 7th floor condo in a 10 story building.  I was an idiot and didn't carry condo insurance.  There was allegedly a leak in the joint between the common water supply for all the units above and below me, and the pipe that supplies my 2 story unit. My unit had minor damage,  but the two story unit below was devastated, mold etc.    When it happened, I was called and had to give a credit card to a plumber HOA called to fix the leak AND to a drying company to dry it out.  The  the dry-out company attempts to charge me for my unit and the unit below.  I investigate a bit,  determine the leak was common,  and refuse to pay for the dry-out in the unit below.  They eventually re-invoice me for just my units dry out.  The owner of the unit below sues me for repairs.  I respond via email the leak was in a common pipe,  not my responsibility.  Owner of unit below then re-files small claims suing me and the HOA.  We go to Small claims,  the HOA wants to arbitrate with the owner. I proclaim ""I'm not paying anybody anything,  do whatever you want.""   We all cram into arbitration torture chamber,  I say very little.  Arbitrator asks to speak to the plaintiff alone.  Then the HOA alone,  then we all go back in.   The HOA offers to re-imburse me for the plumbing repair,  but not the dry-out.  The HOA board member present said ""send me the invoice and I'll re-imburse""  So I get the invoice,  and lo and behold,  it says they repaired a 1"" pipe,  the common pipe.  When the HOA shared their evidence prior to arbitration at Small Claims,  they presented a picture of the 1"" common pipe,  the 3/4"" tee and the 3/4"" line into my unit.  It was a pinhole leak,  you couldn't tell,  they just draw a red arrow pointing to the 3/4"" pipe and said ""see,  It's not common"".    My tenant at the time took a picture on her cellphone,  she said ""I put it right up to where the leak was"",  that photo shows the 1"" pipe.  The access hole the cut into the back of my shower was directly centered over the 1"" common supply pipe.  The red arrow drawn in the HOA's 'evidence' and the access hole they cut don't line up at all.  Also,  the Invoice for my unit from the plumber is made out to a name I do not know or recognize in any way.  I have reason to believe the building has had a long running problem with pin hole leaks in the 1"" common pipe, and have routinely claimed the leaks were NOT in the common line,  and made the unit owner's insurance pay.  They have been doing this for years,  and got tripped up when I didn't have insurance.  WTF do I do now?"	No
Hey r/legaladvice,  A few weeks ago, our A/C went out, and our Landlord was very prompt in getting it fixed. Cue a couple inspections from the city, her, and the A/C company.  Anyway, I'm at work right now, and my landlord just sent an email (she inspected the house today while me and my three roommates were at work) with her reactions to our house.  Here's the weird bit: one of my roommates locked his door before he left, and she went into his room and complained about an odor and the general uncleanliness. Now, she's not demanding or threatening anything, but it does seem questionable. Aside from this, we've gotten along decently with her. But this seems like an invasion of privacy.  What do you think? Are we overreacting? Or did she breach our privacy?	No
I am a foster parent and have been getting increasingly frustrated with the way DSS is handling my daughter's case. It has made it abundantly clear that there isn't enough oversight. They make decisions on behalf of the kids that have a great, and sometimes permanent, impact on them and there is no higher entity signing off to ensure that the decisions being made are in the best interest of the children (spoiler alert: in my kids case, they're not!)  I want to propose some kind of legislation making it necessary to get a judge or guardian ad litem or someone to sign off on these big decisions before they can be implemented. And they need to be able to provide a GOOD reason for something as extreme and permanent as separating siblings into separate pre-adoptive homes. IMO this kind of decision should be made by a judge the same way a judge is who decides whether or not they go home to mom and dad. That isn't something that 2 people from the county DSS should be able to decide on behalf of a child. There needs to be more oversight.   I am in the state of Virginia. How can I go about suggesting a change in our laws like this?	No
I signed a lease contract that ended middle of July. The contract was signed months ago and specifically states the exact date that the lease would end on July 14th of 2017. I paid him a prorated amount that covered half of July, but he wants the full amount for the month. He says he will take me to small claims court if I don't pay him the full amount. Thank you for your help!  Some other details: -My original residence is in County A (to which I will return to when my lease ends) but rental location that I leased from him is hundreds of miles away in County B (to which he will return to after lease ends). If he does end up suing me in small claims court, will he sue me in County A or County B?	No
Hi there. Quick question please; I am supposed to have my son every second Sunday as per a court order which was agreed to in mediation. Last week Sunday my visit was cancelled despite the court order saying it was non negotiable and the reason why it was cancelled is because apparently my son was sick although he was fine the previous evening when I saw him and they would not show him to us to verify that he is indeed sick. Also they did not take him to the doctor and I stay less than twenty metres from his place so there was no real reason that they needed to cancel the visit. I went to the police station to report them and the police were unable to do anything. The court order is brand new and I'm already being pushed around like this. Now the social workers have told me to forfeit this week's visitation as well because they worry that the conflict is harmful to my child however what they fail to acknowledge is that there would not be any conflict if the other party simply followed what they agreed to. Is there any justice for people who breach court orders and go against agreements? I do not understand why I must now make a second agreement if they wouldn't even follow the first. I stay in the same apartment complex as him and they still never let me see him and it's grossly unfair. Also they drive around with him in the car without a car seat. I am extremely discouraged by the judicial system!!! 	No
"I have a 2 year old who does not have any father declared on her birth certificate. Her father turned out to be a drug addict and has not been involved in her life since I left him 22 months ago. He has made no attempts to establish paternity, but has threatened to try and sue for custody a few times when I have spoken to him.   He is very unstable, and his family is equally unstable and they all have a plethora of substance abuse problems. I am very afraid his grandmother may give him the money to sue for custody. I think he would end up dumping her with his mother and her heroin addict boyfriend because he is completely incapable of caring for her (or thinking of anyone but himself). It would ruin her life for them to be involved. Ruin it.   I have an advanced degree and am financially stable on my own. I don't need child support from him, so that is not a factor.  I read that if the parent is a drug addict and doesn't try to establish custody, it is possible to petition the court to terminate their parental rights.  What is the likelihood of this succeeding? What kind of proof do I need to file my petition?  How likely is it that this would just be an easy way for him to establish paternity without having to pay any money (which is probably the only reason he has not done it yet)?  He did complete a drug treatment program, and has a job / apartment now, but he is still making up excuses to go to the hospital and get pain meds - which is what he is addicted to.  He is so addicted that he actually hurts himself so he has a reason to go (punching walls to try and break his hand, jumping off things to try and break an ankle, throwing himself down stairs to try and get injured, he even faked needing a cane for after ""breaking his back"" several years before I met him)."

"I've been chronically homeless for the last couple of years and have made the journey from NYC to central Connecticut in the hope of finding a more sedate existence. Long story short, I wound up living with these guys in a building that was obviously in disrepair, but that one of them claimed to own and the claim seemed believable due to that's person background.   Come to find out, that's not the case. The place is abandoned, but presumably has an owner who is effectively none of the people I'm living with. We've all only been here a few weeks, but I've already sunk a lot of effort into trying to tidy the place, make it more functional. The situation is obviously not ideal, but I'm reluctant to bounce because of what an otherwise very safe situation it is in the otherwise very unsafe north end of Hartford. I don't have many immediate short term options either.    But is what we're doing illegal? Despite being homeless for awhile now I actually know very little about squatting itself as a practice. I don't believe anyone broke any locks to get in here, but I can't be sure. Would that be the distinction somehow in whether or not this was breaking and entering? What do we do if the owner shows up. What do we do if the owner never shows up? Are we entitled to any sort of notice if they decide to ""evict"" us or would we immediately be arrested? So many factors, but very few actual options, any advice would be appreciated. Also, try not to judge me too harshly. I get that staying on someone else's property and potentially FORCING them to evict you is kind of a dick move. I don't have perfect moral solutions, I'm just doing my best."	No
So I recently was kicked out of my house in Ontario, and housing here is expensive and there aren't too many Computer Science jobs, which is why I wanted to move to the US. I hold US citizenship and a US passport. In Ontario, we do not have an emancipation process so I'm not sure if I'd be able to sign legal contracts here or in the United States. I'm sure I'd be able to get a CS job but signing a contract is slightly confusing.  Thanks, Ashar	No
My wife has 2 kids from her ex-husband who has custody since they divorced. We have 2 kids from me and my wife. My wife has been unemployed for the last 4 years and is a stay at home mom. I am military and our lifestyle is much more significant and beneficial for my step kids. Her ex-husband recently remarried and is trying to modify the order for more child support among other things that would impact our life for us and our 2 kids. I pay my wife's child support because she doesn't work and has a low education. Her income is imputed. I cannot afford the modifications he's asking for and any job my wife could get has the same effect since we would need child care.  What I want to know is there any chance we could pursue a change of custody especially if our lifestyle would be better for the kids, and they would grow up with their half siblings among many other beneficial opportunities he can't provide?	No
I am getting divorced and have a 18month old son. I have moved out of the house because Wife has made false accusations against me in the past and I do not feel safe at home.  My Mediation for Temporary Hearings is coming up. My lawyer (a expensive one) told me straight that if we do not get agreement at mediation, the judge will just give me a Standard Possession Order at the Temporary Hearing.  I am sure my wife knows this so she will offer me nothing more than the Standard Possession Order at all.  My goal for this custody battle is to get 50% of my son's time. Question is - should I settle at the Mediation for time equivalent to the Standard Possession order or go to Court for the Temporary hearing and get teh Standard Possession order (SPO) there?  The reason I ask this is because - It seems that if I voluntarily ACCEPT an offer equivalent to the SPO, I will probably not get anything more later. If I do not accept, it will be on record that I did not accept and I can continue to fight for more.  Is my reasoning right here?	No
Hello! I made a post about this not too long about but circumstances have changed and I am in need of more help.  My BF and I recently rented a room from someone , we had to take what we could get and though we didn't want this place we just had to take it, so we did.We signed a lease he wrote out and gave him first and last and he told us we could move in straight away because he knew we were in a bad situation at home.  My BF moved in a few days later, I stayed behind to pack everything up and when he moved in the landlord kept refusing to fix the lock on any of the doors saying it should be fine and denying us our privacy. He also kept hanging around the house and bringing people around, drinking, doing his laundry there..even though we were assured he does not live there but two other roommates did.   Literally the morning after my BF moved in, the landlord asked for more money because we moved in early, we didn't agree upon this before when he said we could move in but since we had nowhere else to permanently live we said screw it and decided we'd have to pay him.  About two days later , my BF phoned me and told me to go to the new place because the landlord isn't the landlord which confused me and concerned me, so I went over there.  I was greeted by BF, his mom, the two other tenants that lived there and one of their moms and also a lady I hadn't seen before and that lady told me that she is the REAL landlord and that she was there to attempt for the 10th time to deliver eviction papers that he was ignoring when they would come in the mail. She kept trying to serve them in person but the landlord guy would run away and not acknowledge her. He apparently had not been paying his rent or anything since the beginning of the year when he moved in but was renting to us and keeping the money for something else.  The actual landlady said that she wrote in the lease that he wasn't supposed to be renting to other people but in my previous post here I learned that because I am in ontario, it doesn't matter if the lease says he can't do that or not, he still can. She also told us that as soon as she can get this guy to acknowledge that he is evicted (she is doing all she can to be taking him to court for it because she can't just turn off the utilities and change the lock to force him out apparently) then my BF and the other tenants will be evicted as well because she isn't our landlord and has no desire to be, the guy renting to us was our landlord and if he is gone then so are we.    So rather than wait to be kicked out when this scamming scumbag does and continue to give this guy money that wasn't even going towards the house or utilities to live in a room that actually apparently was THIS guy's room, we decided to leave because not only was this guy clearly a scammer that somehow is legal, he also acted aggressively towards us when we interacted with him on more than one occasion and mentioned he had been to jail and had gun charges, so we had concern for our safety as well as concern about this guy not paying his rent and effectively putting us in a position to be homeless eventually because of that.   After this happened, my mom, who helped convince my grandma to lend us money for first and last, talked to this guy and asked for our money back , minus the extra $200 he wanted for us moving in a few days early, and he said he would give us our money back on Saturday.   Saturday rolled around and he said Sunday, Sunday rolled around and he said Monday FOR SURE. Monday rolled around and he told us that someone was giving him money and he needed to wait for that, then he said his friend sent the money and he was waiting for it to arrive to him then he would send it to us. He didn't reply for the rest of Monday then on Tuesday he said the money wasn't sent to him and we still have to wait for it..and we have not heard anything from him today.   He keeps mentioning that we put him in a really bad way by moving out, but he put himself in a bad way for lying and for not paying rent for so long. He also put us in a very bad way by doing that and by not giving us our money back. We are on disability and had to borrow money to move there and now we are out of options for borrowing money because we can't pay it back fast when can barely scrape by as it is and now we have a month where we are staying temporarily then that's it , we have no roof .   So what I am asking is can I legally get this money back from this guy? Is it at all possible that we are entitled to have our deposit back that was for two months (first and last) when we were not even living there a week, did not cause damage(in fact, made minor repairs) and at least in my opinion had good reason for leaving?	No
"My husband and I are at a point where civility is the best way to describe our relationship. He has cheated in the past and despite trying my best to work through it, things are not good. I'm very tired of feeling bad about myself and this relationship is toxic. We are living with his parents in the UK and we're separated for six months. I have spoken to him about how I feel and his response was ""tough, but put up with it for the kids"". I am suspicious he is cheating again. The trouble is he says I can leave, move out to my own place or whatever but he won't let the kids go.   I have always thought he is a great and loving dad but he talks to my daughter in the most unpleasant manner (she was with him when I left, it was a decision made by everyone). He curses at her ie STFU and yells - this is unacceptable to me regardless of how she behaves. He has always yelled and cursed and broken things and I've learned to let it go but I don't want my daughter to think that's how men are supported to be. Today he told me ""what am I doing to you that's so bad? I don't beat you!"" I couldn't articulate how that in itself is an insult to me, like I'm supposed to be glad I'm not beaten?   I want to return to the USA, both my kids have American passports - what can I do? Do I have any legal recourse to take them with me?   Please advise."	No
"Location: Los Angeles, California  Stressing out about this. It's the first lease I ever signed, and I messed up.  I've been living in this unit for the past two years without being on the lease (basically subletting from my friend/roommate). He's moving out, and a new lease was signed. I am on good terms with the property manager, whose parents own the property and are thus technically/legally my landlord(s) (I think?). I've never met them or interacted with them in any way.  Specific section:  &gt;Tenant agrees to pay for all utilities and services, and the following charges ___ (left blank in our lease), except ____ (also left blank), which shall be paid by landlord.  &gt;If any utilities are not separately metered, Tenant shall pay Tenant's proportional share, as reasonably determined and directed by landlord.  My roommate and I were previously not responsible for water. Neither my roommate or the person who's room I took recall if the lease they signed had an exception for water in the contract. I asked around, and no one that I know who rents anywhere in Southern California pays anything for water unless the water bill is in their name and they have a separate line.  I messed up here by assuming that the PM had written in the exception prior to meeting, since everything else that I expected (like parking) was written in. The PM and my new roommate seemed to be in a bit of a hurry, so I felt a bit rushed and didn't read through everything as thoroughly as a normally do. I know, not an excuse, lesson learned.  The building does not have separate meters, only one single meter for the entire building.  I called the PM after signing and realizing that the exception for water wasn't written in. He told me not to worry about it, they cover water because it's a single meter for the entire building, and they would continue to cover water as before even though it wasn't written in the lease.  What I'm worried about now is receiving some sort of backcharge for water bills. If the landlord starts to ask for $x per month to account for water and it's reasonable, that's fine, my fault for not getting the exception in writing.   My concern is that, at some point long after I've moved out, I'm going to get a bill for months or years worth of distributed water charges. At that point, I feel like I would not be able to realistically ask for proof and a breakdown, and I may not even be in California anymore to contest it.   I'm worried that such a bill would not only take the tenants into account, but also landlords costs like watering the lawns, and thus end up being quite significant.  The biggest thing that worries me is the possibility that we are the only tenants who have agreed to be responsible for water costs (or that there's a couple more in the building, but not many).   I'm worried that my new roommate and I could suddenly be legally responsible for more than our proportional share of the water costs based on other tenants' lease agreements, or, in the worst case, legally responsible for *all* of the building's water if everyone else has a water exception in their lease.   Did I basically just give my landlords carte blanche to distribute any water usage running through the building's meter in any way/proportions that they see fit?   Do I have any right to say something like ""hey, it's fine for you to start charging me for water, but you need to charge me on a regular basis, and we need to agree upon the terms for our share of the cost""?   Is there any way for me to protect myself against back-charges?   If I wanted to ask for an assurance in writing that I wouldn't get billed for water without first working out a specific calculation for the split, where do I find a generic template or guide for creating a document like that? I know my PM / the landlords won't be under any obligation to sign it, but I hope he'll consider it after I explain how much this is stressing me out."	No
We haven't been looking for a place at all and in our area it is very difficult to find a place to live. Our plumbing fucked up a couple weeks ago and it was supposedly fixed but our landlord is saying it wasn't fixed all the way and that is why she is kicking us out. any advice is welcome because we are freaking out right now	No
"5 years ago my step father and mother helped me get a mortgage for a farm business I started, somewhere in the purchase process it went from a Co-signer arrangement to my step father alone being the only one on the note.     However, we had an written agreement that he was just the intermediary of the property and it was a rent to own with a term of 30 years or until the mortgage was paid off.  I never pressed the issue for them to sign it as I was young and trusting, but they did make changes and return via email in the email stating ""Your mother and I are very comfortable with how this reads"".    Three years later, as agreed upon that if the first document jeopardized the good health of the business we would amend it, so I  presented a second contract that re-iterated the language in the first at that they verbally agreed and gave me enough reassurance that I proceeded with remodels and the creation of our bed and breakfast.   At this point I have spent 50k in improvements. remodels, landscaping and ect, most of which I did myself.  We are almost finished with the remodels for our bed and breakfast and were scheduled to open July 1st.    Now they are claiming that the first agreement is void due to some weird dates they defined as the term of the operating agents of the business and they are attempting an unjust eviction at the moment.   They presented a crazy lease, that tripled my rents and would have tricked me into surrendering the property and all my possessions, I refused to sign and stated my reasoning being that I cannot agree to theft.  A day later out of retaliation, they came up with the Sheriff and served what I believe to be a fraudulent ""Notice to Quit"".  In the notice they claim I must surrender all my property, and that my tenancy was only for 6 months.  (Pretty sure this is no good for them)  My question is, is their case history of promissory estoppel being upheld in a real estate transaction.  In addition, the language of our agreement stated it was to be a transfer not a sale.    I do not see how there is any way for them to pay me for the damages they have caused without selling the property (I believe they are broke and desperate).   This would additionally breach our agreement as we agreed that this land was not to be sold back to any banks.    Thanks,"	No
So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them.   For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.  I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?  My business is in Pennsylvania and they are located in New York.   Thanks for your assistance.	No
OK so to start, I'm subletting an apartment in NYC, so my name is not on the lease. (I actually never saw the original lease because my previous roommate left and it's been hard to contact her..) Anyway, the lease is over at the end of this month and I will be moving out, so the landlord / brokers have been scheduling showing. Fine with me. However, it has happened more than once now that the super has opened up my apartment and let people in without ANY notice. When I brought this up to the broker, he said that the original lease stated that even if I don't have any notice at all, the landlord and super can just enter whenever they want even if they don't let me know. Is this legal??? My feeling is that even if it was on the lease (which I doubt) it's probably still illegal and would be considered trespassing. Can anyone point me to official NYC law or wording about this? I'm feeling really disturbed by this...	No
I have scoured google looking for answers but can find none. I live in Johnson County within Iowa.   Here's the scoop: About a month ago, we found out we had bed bugs. We could not, for the life of us figure out where they came from (we don't travel) until the pest guy stated that the ladies next door had earlier reported things that indicated bed bugs. And my neighbor downstairs said someone below him had them far earlier.   We were never told of any problems, we've lived here 11 or so years and not a note, a letter, a heads up. Nothing. I feel like that part is allowable by law here (which sucks).  The pest guys told us to spray we needed to move everything to the center of each room, get rid of clutter and pack our things into boxes. I threw out my bed frame, a lot of things, estimated loss/cost just in all the prep for spraying was around $800. And that doesn't include what my roommates paid in losses and costs to clean. I waved goodbye to my savings and we got through it.   All of this happened a week or so before our lease was coming up. Not enough time to find a place to live nor buy. The landlord made us sign the lease (we did not know our options as everyone gave us conflicting advice) and said if we could find a place in a week he'd tear up the lease, which was impossible (can't close on a house/condo in a week!).       He is paying for them to treat it now, but today I found a bed bug in the bathroom, likely having come through the shared heating system between apartments. (This was after two spray treatments in our apartment).     He is not spraying other tenants homes. Our downstairs neighbor were unaware there was an issue. The landlord even said he was sure it came from the hoarder-esque women who moved out recently.      We don't want to go through treatments the rest of our time here (A year) because the neighbors are not taking care of the problem and it's likely going to spread to others who are unaware there IS a problem. We're living out of boxes at the moment, limited in what we have access to. I earn a bit of extra income in artwork and leatherwork that I am currently unable to do so I am losing money the longer this goes on.    We want to move. This is the last straw in a long list of grievances and we're finally in a spot financially where we can leave. We wanted to go month-to-month renting until we could find a home but he refused, despite us being reliable tenants for the past 11 years.   So what are our rights here? Can we break our lease because of it? Can we force him to treat the whole building? General Pest treatment is guaranteed in the lease but are we going to be paying for treatments if this keeps happening?	No
Are there any laws in California about how close you can smoke to doors and windows of residences?    I live in an apartment complex with a lot of cigarette smokers.  I am highly allergic to cigarette smoke (been to the ER, multiple doctors, prescribed inhalers, EPI-pens, etc.)  The number of smokers has gotten much worse in the last few years, and it is negatively impacting my health to a serious degree.  I had to move out of a previous residence for the same problem.    The apartment complex has a small open grassy space with a barbeque where most people smoke.   [&lt;Sexy MS Paint Diagram!&gt;](http://i.imgur.com/5uOE8AX.jpg) It is within a few feet of windows and doors.  People also smoke inside the laundry room and inside the enclosed garage.  At any given time of the day or night there are around 2-4 people smoking.  I really don't want to be one of those people who complain about this sort of thing, but there are lots of children in the complex who shouldn't be inhaling this too.	No
"So my dog and I were attacked by a loose dog about a year back, I fronted all vet and hospital bills, and we're about to go into mediation with the dog's owner. Thankfully, my pup recovered very well, and the worst I've got on my end is numbness on one pinky and a bad scar on the other hand.  What really gets me is that Animal Control was familiar with the family (recurring), and the owner relocated the animal citing, ""we're not sure how she reacts to smaller dogs and children."" I assume everything is based on actual damages, but the recurring theme and the fact the dog was moved into another home without notice makes me feel like it's going to happen again. Is this something to bring up in mediation?"	No
Does anyone have a good recommendation for a lawyer that represents tenants or a plan of action to take?  I have lived in a brand new apartment since December 2016, and have had several problems with my apartment. I have been extremely patient over the last 7 months, trying to work things out with the property management. I have spoken to the property manager, district manager, and the vice president. The most pressing issue is that during the summer spring, there have 3 storms that have come through, that have resulted in an inordinate amount of water coming into my bedroom through the window. Each time it has gotten my bed, floors, and walls wet and each occurrence have contacted the necessary people to report the problem with videos and pictures. They said they fixed it after the first one, however I believe they mistakenly worked on the wrong apartment. In addition they entered my apartment without giving notice to me. I believe it is now time to pursue different avenues to get my expected resolution. I can find plenty of lawyers that represent properties, but am having a hard time finding a lawyer to represent me. Need recommendations or advice. Thanks in advance!	No
Someone is contesting the right to my daughter. He claims to be the bio father after 15 years.  I just want to learn as much as I can about this guy.	No
Hello,  Exwife and I have been caught in a contentious, nasty divorce for nearly two years now.  Since 2014 I haven't changed the asset allocation of my investments.  She has claimed a much larger share of these as common property.  Her attorney has claimed my separate property became commingled.  I have so far made a partial tracing, which I believe is accurate (because opposing counsel has so far avoided mentioning it).  I was concerned about overexposition to the stock market, and asked my wife in late 2015 to make changes.  She ignored my request.   I made a new declaration of disclosure last february.  I'm becoming increasingly nervous because opposing side is asking for specific quantities, instead of a reasoned request for a specific number of shares or a percentage, as I've asked them.  I would like to convert some of the investments under dispute into cash or at least move them into less risky investments.  My attorney insists I should not do that, as it might look bad before the judge and I'll become liable for any cap gains tax.   I feel overburdened because while my exwife claims a sizeable share of these funds, she has completely ignored anything related to stewardship.  If the stock market makes a downturn, the other side might as well make me responsible for mismanagement and make their demands based on last February's valuation.  Exwife and attorney have successfully delayed the case for a while now, asking for more paperwork every time, pretending to be unavailable, or absent from the country, or that they didn't receive anything, and so on.  Judge so far has done nothing for me other than set up a mandatory conference..., in two months..., just to hear what paperwork the new judge wants to see.  Legal costs just keep mounting and I'm already forced to convert investments into cash to pay for my attorney.  My own expenses, alimony, and attorney fees exceed well over 50% my net pay on a monthly basis.   Any advice appreciated.	No

I'm about to get married. My dad just went through a really rough (second) divorce. I don't have the whole picture, but from what I gather, they each spent around $50k+ on lawyers to fight over maybe $500k in retirement savings and home equity. This sounds like an absolute nightmare and a total waste of money.  My fiance and I are both 25 and just starting out our careers. Neither of us have anything worth fighting over in terms of existing assets/savings so I wasn't planning on any sort of prenup. But, ideally in 5+ years we would have plenty to fight over, and that is what I'm worried about.   Is there any sort of prenup to make sure we don't both blow a ton of money on lawyers if we ever do get divorced? A sort of civil agreement that would benefit everyone involved? Should I bother bringing it up to her?	No
I just graduated from a one year masters program and of course, the last year was Insanely busy because of my coursework (i.e. not sleeping one or two nights a week). The neighborhood was right next to my school and fine, but the next neighborhood over is notoriously dangerous.   I rented an apartment in August and by October a sexual assault had occurred in the middle of the day. Two young men followed a girl into the building and assaulted her at 2pm in the entry way. I was the first person on the scene after they fled. There were also many mugging in the neighborhood that semester. I talked with my landlord on the phone and he refused to install a camera in front of the building or better lighting.   A few weeks later I came home from Thanksgiving break and someone had cut a perfectly smooth, circular hole out of the outer pane of my bedroom window, which goes out to a fire escape. I think they didn't break in all the way because either someone saw them or they noticed I have an alarm sticker. (which only goes off when the window is opened- but they didn't know that) The neighbors said they heard people running up and down the fire escape. Also the neighboring building had break ins off the escape. I sent pictures to two glass companies and they both said most likely someone had tried to break in. My landlord said it was bird. I knew at that point he didn't care about my safety at all and was a liar. I took pictures of the window and it wasn't fixed until a month later. (It took forever because they had to special order the glass.)   After that I couldn't sleep or even shower in my apartment. I Ubered to class and had severe anxiety. I moved an hour away to live with my boyfriend and commute to school, which took a toll on my school work.   My landlord told me I could move out and get my deposit back if I found a new tenant. I have two emails from him saying this. I found a new tenant (I did tell them the area was dangerous and that they should install an alarm). My landlord signed a new contract with them.   He then refused to give me back but 200 of my 2000 dollar deposit. My deposit was so large because I was a student. He said it was because of a placement fee that's in the lease (it is there but I thought his emails overrode what was in his contract).   I was angry but too busy with school to deal with it. That happened in February. It's now been 6 months and I'm done with school. I've never filed a lawsuit before and am feeling apprehensive. Should I pursue a lawsuit? I think I still have a copy of my lease and the deposit slip and emails. I'm not sure how much legal ground I have to stand on. I'm in the state of Maryland by the way. Thank you.	No
Hello. A truck hit my car a few months ago and drove off. The car was parked and in the am we found the damage. We were able to find the company by pulling tapes from surrounding buildings, but the time I lost just tracking them down (I am a freelancer) took me over three days. I asked them to compensate me for the time, but they refused. Do I have any legal recourse? Small claims court? I am  in New York City if that helps. Any advice you can offer would be amazing. Thanks Terrie.	No
"The title wasn't very clear, I know.  Allow me to explain.  Please bare with me.  I am desperate for advice here.   I live in a duplex in a region with relatively high crime.  The lease agreement for myself and the other tenant in the house identifies that a background check is required for all tenants and that anyone who is residing in the home for more than ""X"" amount of days (can't remember the exact number but its about 2 weeks) must be processed through the background check and be signed on as a tenant of the home.  From day 1, about 5 months ago, the other tenant's boyfriend has been living here unofficially.  I have observed the trends of their schedule, to an extent, from my outdoor security camera pointed at the driveway/garage, and identified that the boyfriend does not appear to have a real job and spends nearly every hour of the day at home.  I have spoken with in briefly on only a couple occasions and he has a concerning demeanor.  I honestly don't want to judge a book by its cover, but living in an area like this, I can't help but believe he has a criminal record.  Why else would he not be put on the lease?    This next part might sound silly, but bare with me.  In our communal basement, which is where the washer/dryer are, I find several large piles of clothes regularly and I believe the boyfriend is running some sort of laundry business out of the basement.  Why is this a problem you ask?  The laundry is run constantly, the water bill for the house is split 50/50 for both apartments in the duplex, one set of laundry units he uses is hooked directly to the electricity for my apartment.  So he's living here illegally and is running a business out of the house with the help of my utilities.  I'll just list a few more things before getting to the point.  The boyfriend (or his girlfriend who is on the lease) does not contribute to the yard work, they smoke pot in the house, they smoke cigarettes in the house (violation of the lease), and they use a grill (also a lease violation).    My girlfriend moved in with me a couple months ago and has been worried about the other tenants ever since.  She is very afraid of the guy.  We have heard them yell at each other and we are we both uncomfortable living in the same house as them.  I have expressed concern throughout the last 5 months or so to the landlord and he has not taken action to investigate the boyfriend.  Note that this is an amateur landlord and this is his only rental property.  I believe he is also afraid to approach them.  I believe that because our landlord won't take action to justify the violations of our neighbor, he is essentially violating the lease agreement as well.    I want to break this lease without repercussions.  I worry that the boyfriend could be dangerous and I'm also fed up with my utilities being high due to his laundry business.  Does it appear that I have a case to break my lease?"	No
http://imgur.com/0oWgPJX  I just learned about these landlords. Apparently they have cameras on the outside of the house...and in common spaces inside (said to be turned off). Landlords also enter the house whenever they want. They left this letter tonight while I was visiting.   We're in Oregon. I had a girlfriend who had to deal with this same thing in college. But, the school had a laser that took care of that. I don't know who to contact now. Can anyone help get us started?	No
"So this is a long story. My roommates mom was is land lady so she was already always coming in and raising hell because she was mad about other things. Then my roommate decided to take a trip out of town, well apparently she didn't tell her mom. So LL(landlady) calls me and asks whats going on i tell her the truth. She proceeded to scream aand cuss at me like im the scum of the earth.   This is where the trouble starts. She tells me that i meed to bring her my RM(roommate)'s jeep. Which is not in LL's name, and also the only way i have of getting my RM from the airport when she comes home. So I tell LL ""I cant do that i have to pick up your daughter with it and its not yours.""   then i block her because i know how she is.  Well the next morning I go home to get some cloths and before I even get out of the jeep she is screaming at me from our neighbors porch. telling me i have to be moved out of there today and cussing me like a dog.  So I knowing a little bit about the law in these situations say. ""you have to give me an eviction notice if you want me to move. you also have to give me more than a day.""   which of course lead to more yelling and cussing. so I leave in the jeep. A little time passes and her husband, how happens to be a very wealthy lawyer, calls me and suggests I do what she is asking.   Im not gonna lie i cussed a few times when trying to explain to him why i wasnt bringing the jeep back and how i would have my stuff out by the first of the month since i had already paid rent this month.   Now they are saying they have people coming to move my stuff today. When my RM came home her mom told her she over reacted, especially on me but since I didn't do what she wanted she had to cme down on me.   I did a little research and in Alabama you have to give tennants an eviction notice in writing, which I obviously haven't received. It also says that Lanslords cannot evict tennants as a reprocusion. Which is clearly what is going on here.   RM has been my best friend since we were im like 10th grade so 11 years. In all that time I have always shown LL the upmost respect. I treated her juat lioe my own mother, so it blows my mind that she can be acting this way.   The police said they could make them stop if they were in the process of moving it but that was it its not like I can stand across the street and make sure no takes anything. So do i just let them do it then sue them? i have no money to hire a lawyer and i dont know if they would take my case with out any.   TL:DR My landlord kicked me out because i refused to bring her a jeep that didn't belong to her. she did so with out giving me an eviction notice, and is threating to dispose of my belongings today. Need to know what i can/should do in this situation."	No
I have already paid the security deposit and my lease starts on July 27. Today the relator notified me that there are issues with the HOA regarding a misdemeanor for a minor in possession of alcohol that I got when I was 18 years old and was never actually charged with. The charges were dropped due to completing a diversion program. I submitted my application to the HOA well over a month ago and this is the first I've heard of this. Is there any advice someone from here can give me? I have no other housing options as I'm moving from a different city for graduate school in the next few days and need to be out of my current place. There isn't time to find and get approved for a new place. 	No
" Hello, throwaway for obvious reasons. There has been some recent shady dealing at my friend's apartment building. I'm seeking advice for them and other tenants.  1. Summary of Known Wrong-Doings (some have been re-occurring for tenants' entire stay, some occasional)  -Potential future tenants referred upcoming vacant units by existing tenants. Potential tenants toured unit and wrote deposit checks to Building Manager. Signed receipts given to potential tenants with Building Owner info in heading. Building Manager cashed to personal account with no intent to lease. -Building Manager also has access to all tenants personal info/SS#'s, and requested same info from referred potential tenants under false pretenses. -Fees such as parking, security deposits, etc. requested as cash payed directly to Building Manager, sometimes with same signed receipt. -Rent requested in cash payed directly to Building Manager, for various reason given, with signed receipt.  2. Background / Context  Ex-Apartment Building Manager (live-in) did all showings/lease paperwork/maintenance requests/received rent/fees at the building - I assume employee of the Building Owner, not co-owner, contractor, etc. Shortly after learning of some of the above actions (not sure if there were any past incidents), the owners notified tenants the Manager was ""resigning,"" but did not acknowledge any wrong-doing or give any reason why, seemingly to distance themselves from manager.  Owners have been only rude and defensive. They have also accused some tenants who were misled to by the Manager of possibly being in cahoots and threatened taking action against them, legal or eviction (is this illegal?).   -Update: Owner has served a notice to vacate to at least one tenant who's deposit/last month was taken by Manager. They have all amounts included in the lease and a receipt for at least one of the fees.  3. Questions  Is the Manager liable as an individual for their actions, or are the Owners/management company liable as a business entity for their employee's actions? Is there any way for referred potential tenants to get their money back besides small claims? Would they seek from Manager as individual or Owner?  Don't businesses have insurance or contingency for their employee's wrongdoings that could cover this reimbursement? Would a lawyer work on contingency fee in the case of something like this? Is the Owner's lack of notification of criminal actions to tenants or unwillingness to reimburse potential tenants itself an unlawful act?  4. Organization?  Building has 40+ units. Above info is from network of approx only 6 units, learned from just chance encounters, so I would expect more people have had things happen to them or people they may have referred to move in.  Would it be a good idea to survey how many tenants have been potentially scammed in some way and if wrongdoing is widespread possibly take legal action as a group? This would at minimum connect those screwed over the most. Surveying/organizing would have to happen anonymously of course. In my state it is illegal to prevent tenants from posting info in public area, or meeting/organizing on their own.  Maybe just slide informational flyers under doors, with an invite to an anonymous forum/chat group to survey experiences? Any recommendations for a private chat/forum easy to set up greatly appreciated. Any advice also appreciated. Thanks."	No
"I lived at an apartment complex for 4 years (68 units.)  My lanlord and I got along well.  I paid $1300/month rent for 4-years and just recently moved.  My rent was always paid a month in advance.  My lease was up on 6/30/17, and so I was out by 9pm.  When I moved in we never did a walk-through, when I left we did not do a walk-through either.  The complex is privately owned and ran by the owner.  He owns many businesses, and does not always have alot of time; however I took a video of the apartment before I left.  I of course left everything in prisetien codition.  I took care of his apartment well, he too commented that in the past.   I have been calling and texting regarding the return of my security deposit to no avail.  I realize he has a ""reasonable amount of time,"" to return.  He normally always replies but now I have not heard a peep.  My question:  I noticed a clause in my lease:  SURRENDERING OR VACATING The resident agrees to vacate and surrender possession of the apartment at least five (5) days prior to expiration of termination of the lease or any renewal thereof.  Whatever the reason may be, and if resident does not comply with this provision, Landlord may retain the security deposit as liquidated damages and also may take physical possession of the premises or take such legal action as it is authorized in this lease or as it shall see fit, none of these measures excluding any of the others.  I did not leave 5 days prior, I left at the end of the month becuase that was what I paid my rent; until the end of the month.  I did not notice this clause until now.  Am I SOL?  Is this even legal to put in a lease.  My fault I did not anyalize before I signed; I've been renting since I was 16 years of age; I'm now in my 50's, and have never seen a clause like this before.  All my other leases state to have apartment returned as I rented.  Is this legal, its like he is now getting double rent.  I'm so upset with myself.  Should I fight this?  If he does have a right to this clause, can I at least get the intrest, because it says nothing about that; however I'd rather have ther $1300 plus intrest.  Thank you for whatever help you can give to me."	No
Could I be evicted for smoking in the open back porch or even inside if my lease does not mention anything about smoking?  Thanks	No
A teenager saw, but I don't think he saw my plates let alone cared enough to remember them somehow. I don't know what the neighbors are like there but the car looked new (at most five years old), and seems like the neighbors might know one another. What legal repurcussions do I face if ever caught? Going forward what would be my ideal actions? I don't think I can ask my friend about this.	No
Good evening,  Apologies if this has been answered already or with a simple google search but I come here because my fiancé and I are in a bit of a weird situation.   My sisters significant other wants to gift us a house for our wedding present but doesn't want to do so for a few years (he said it was until they moved for some reason ). My fiancé and I want to make sure that within these few years prior to being gifted the house that he doesn't turn around and kick us out for any old reason.   Tl;dr : can we have a contract written up where we can live in a house rent free and upon an agreed upon date be gifted the house	No
I just noticed that another website probably copied one of my site's more popular posts (responsible for about 20% of my traffic). Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:  - The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.  - It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective  - This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.  - I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains. This kinda adds insult to injury.  Now since I can't proof anything I don't want to throw around accusations, but it all seems pretty clear to me. I'm placed higher on google, so I doubt I'm losing too much traffic to them because of this, though it may be some, but it's more about the principle. I link to their site because I like their service and recommend it to my readers, and they steal my content and a chunk of traffic.  So, what do you think I can/should do about this?  My first instinct was to write them an email, politely requesting they link to my site since its contents my interest their readers of that particular article, but maybe you have a better idea?  Thanks in advance for your input :-)	No
I recently purchased a property and there is a community driveway for the  houses next to my property and the neighbors told me that my backyard was also once apart another  community driveway for the other three plots. It is no longer a community driveway because the owner next to the entrance of my community driveway blocked access for my next door neighbor and me. Is there any way I can verify that there was a community driveway there before and bring legal action to rebuild the community driveway? Thank you for your time.	No
"Hello friends, i hope everyone is having a nice day.  On 05/15/2017 i received a ticket for ""Reckless Driving 20+ MPH over the speed limit. 78/55mph zone/Distance 1341 47"" (Law Section 2.46.2.862). This happened in Virginia while i was driving from New Jersey to Myrtle Beach. I was speeding, there is no denying that. However, i spoke to a lawyer and he basically told me i was screwed and that its going to go to a criminal case. I cant go to jail for 180 days for a speeding ticket. I have my last semester of college coming up and i wouldn't be able to graduate. Is there anything i can do? i can provide more information if needed. Thanks all."	No
"My brother had given a ""friend"" power of attorney for real estate matters only. He revoked this last month and made me the new power of attorney in all matters (durable), including of course, real estate matters. The friend just submitted a Mortgage Balloon Payment document to the county where this friend is supposed to receive a large amount of money when my brother's house sells. The friend submitted it under my brother's name with the old power of attorney document. My brother was never informed and was incapacitated at the time. He already has a mortgage with another company, so obviously this is fraud, right? What charges can we bring against the friend, especially since he declared himself as the lender of this phoney mortgage and stands to get the house if it's not paid back by a certain date. This is in Florida. Thank you."	No
"In PA - I have a co worker who books travel arrangements for employees. Person is a full time employee w our company. On the side, my co-worker owns a travel agency. He collects commission from the rooms/flights he books at my job. He has contracts made out to his business's name, uses his company's ID # on all hotel reservations... To get extra money.   Does this have legal ramifications or is it a company by company decision? I always thought ""double dipping"" is illegal, but maybe it is an ethical situation decided by the company."	No
My girlfriend and I just recently had our apartment broken into and had several thousand dollars worth of items stolen/damaged. No one was hurt as both of us were at work and we have renters insurance so it's not a huge financial hit to us.   The problem is with the building management being what appears to us as negligent about security issues. After talking to other tenants, burglaries have been a problem in the building since January and nothing about security seemed to change after that. We were never informed about these problems when we signed a lease in May. There are two doors with codes and fab access. The back door to the parking lot doesn't always close completely and needs to be pulled shut by whoever uses it (defeats the purpose of a secure door). I never emailed about this but it's possible that someone else in the building did. The codes on these doors also are always the same. The elevator has a code to access your floor but this code works for every floor and there are always the stairs. Management says there are security cameras but I don't see any.  Management also isn't exactly quick if at all to respond via email on these security topics. The incident happened Monday and we aren't getting a new lock until Thursday morning (2 days, 16 hours later). Called the emergency maintenance # to get a new lock the day of the burglary and no one answered or called back. We had to email again after the first time to get a response the next day.   Wondering if it would be in my best interest to file a civil lawsuit against the building management for negligence of security.	No
More hypothetical. I am moving into a new apartment soon, and a friend told me that that same complex kept charging him random fees. He didn't tell me what kinds of fees, though. Is a landlord in Texas allowed to charge you fees that are not stipulated in your lease? I guess that may include late fees when you pay on time, maintenance fees, etc.   Thanks!	No
I recently got my first speeding ticket and called the courthouse from the county I got pulled over in to ask some questions about how and when to pay for it, and the guy on the phone said the biggest mistake people make is not attempting to reduce their speeding ticket fines. Especially if it's their first offense. He was super nice and gave me some advice about writing a letter to the judge. So I was like yeah sure I'll give it a shot.  Some websites say don't admit fault, and some websites say to apologize in the letter. Apologizing is admitting fault.. so what do I do?	No
"After three years together, my wife (32) and I (36) have decided to get divorced. This is her third marriage and my first. She has 4 children by her two ex-husbands (we have no children together, thank God). She moved out a few weeks ago, and I haven't gotten a divorce attorney yet.  Yesterday I received a settlement proposal from her attorney. I'm pretty much dumbfounded. She wants $40,000 cash and spousal support. I make a very good living, and when we got married she quit her job (working as a hairdresser) to be a stay at home mom to her children, which I was fine with. We have no joint assets. She and her children moved into my home, and I paid for all of our bills and most of her kids', although she gets a decent amount of child support each month from her exes.  I'm more or less in shock over this. I am hiring an attorney asap, but what can I expect from this, realistically? I've never gotten divorced and neither has anyone in my family, so I don't know what's standard. Would I really have to pay her ""support""?  She quit her job by HER CHOICE to take care of HER CHILDREN while I supported her to do that, so I didn't think I would have to be paying support for the decision she made. I can understand and expect it if she wanted to stay home with our children. I figured we would just go our separate ways with the things we brought into the marriage (no big purchases like homes or cars were made while married), and now I feel completely naive.  tl;dr: Getting divorced from wife of 3 years; she wants spousal support and $40k even though we have no children together"	No
The fire probably was electrical but that is not 100% confirmed by the fire investigators. Probably the most stupidest mistake to not get renters insurance but here we are. Red Cross gave us a voucher and we are relying on the generosity of our friends and family but everything is basically ruined. We were month to month after living there for over a year, can we take the landlord to civil court to pay for the costs of our belongings and moving? The fire was not our fault and the cost of living is getting really ridiculous so we are really struggling. Could we get a prorated rent refund for July back? The property mgmt company is giving us the round around so I'm turning to Reddit. Any advice is appreciated, thanks!!	No
"I have lived at my apartment since last August, with the lease expiring at the end of July. Once they started taking renewals, maybe around November, they really pushed on the theme of not moving. They posted fliers on everyone's door saying something like ""Avoid the cost of moving. Renew today!"" showing the costs of moving trucks, security deposits, etc. added up. Also, on their website, it encourages people to renew and says sign your lease to stay in your apartment for another year. Under the impression that I could avoid moving, I renewed my lease around early June.  Fast-forward to today, I get a call from the leasing office informing me that I will be force-transferred, so that they can consolidate units and turn my apartment. Their reasoning for doing this was that I was the only person in my four bedroom apartment to renew my lease. They want to move me to a different unit within the complex. I will get two weeks to clean my current unit and move my new stuff into my new assigned unit.  In the lease, it states that the apartment reserves the right to change my unit at anytime. However, the apartment had led me to believe that I would not have to move through the fliers and language on the website that I mentioned above. Are they allowed to make me move units, in congruence with the lease, even though they did many promotions which implied renewal would guarantee retention of the unit?"	No
Neighbor provided false information to previous owner and took a net 1000 sq/ft from previous owner. All surveys were input into software by surveyor indicating this is the case. - Problem is, previous owner trying to remedy something based on false information (seriously, he should have done more to verify) said neighbor could put a chicken coop on our property (2010) (oral). In 2014, the previous owner signed a property agreement reaffirming the original property agreement. It is evident that the previous owner acted on false information and at the very lease agreed via official document 4 years later that the property where the chicken coop resides is his property.  What do you think? - We're in Utah.	No
We've been renting a house for almost 8 years. At the end of the current lease (March 31, 2018) we're able to go month-to-month with a 30 day termination notice by either party. Our landlord wishes to not extended our lease beyond the month-to-month agreement when it expires so that he can move back into the house.  My question is, since he has no intent to rent the house to another party, are we liable for rent through the end of the lease if we choose to move early? And if so, does he moving back into the house effectively terminate our lease and release us from the obligation to cover rent?	No
"Looking for information and the best route of action to take for UK Immigration.  I've been here for almost 6 years as it is with a company sponsoring me on a Tier 2 (General) visa. I'm looking to segue into another company but I do not want the clock on my indefinite leave to remain to reset.  The questions I have are:  * Can I hold a position at a board or director level for another company while simultaneously being on my Tier 2 visa? I was under the impression that it was a strict ""no second job"" situation, or can they run in tandem?  * Is there a visa option that would let me segue onto being solely a board member of company 2, letting me leave my current company, without my Visa resetting or the need for me to leave the country to file paperwork?

A couple of months ago I noticed the carpet in one of my two bedrooms was wet. Upon further inspection, I saw black mold lining the corner of the carpet in the surronding area. I called my apartment complex's reality company that handles all issues and had to leave a message. In the meantime more and more area in the room began to have water coming up (with no sign of wall leakage) and the carpet was soaked to the point of squisheness so I used my own carpet cleaner to suck up as much as I could, but it seemed the water would replace itself every time I tried. Within a period of 3 weeks, they had a carpet cleaning company come out twice to remove the water. Both times the water came back. Now we are more than two months from the issue first arrising and it has still not been fixed. I have called multiple times about it, and they give me the run around. At this point, I have not been able to stay in the room for about 2 months and my bed currently resides in my living room. I am getting very impatient waiting for them to fix anything, and now I  am wondering if I'm entitled to some kind of compensation because the room has been unliveable with the smell and mold. I don't know how to go about getting this issue fixed. Please advise!	No
"Hey guys, I need your help as I am super frustrated and losing my patience with my apartment complex.  I am currently living in an apartment complex in Florida. They recently came in to install ""updates"" to my apartment. The current one involved an upgrade to my kitchen. After they finished their install, the garbage disposal ceased to work. I assume it had to do with the install as it stopped working the day they finished the work. I submitted a service request soon thereafter along with another one for an exterior light outside my apartment that is out and leaves the hallway pitch black. A week went by with no response. I placed another request for the same services. Another week went by without a response.  I decided to email the front office staff through the portal we use to communicate/pay rent etc. with a letter regarding my disappointment with the lack of communication on their part and expressing my dissatisfaction. No response but the following day they sent out a maintenance worker to check out and I assume fix the problem. He came in and took a look and said, it seems to be an electrical issue and he'd need to come back the following day with his supervisor but that he would fix the exterior light now.   It's been 4 days and no one has shown up and my exterior light is now flickering but still not at all well enough to see leaving my wife, dog, and I stumbling around in the dark where there is a set of stairs we need to go down. And the dishwasher now has a puddle of water at the bottom that won't drain.   They even had the audacity to send me an email saying the service request was completed. My wife went in and talked to them Saturday showing them all the emails and request we put in as well as pictures of what's happening. They said they would send someone out Monday to fix it. But with all the nothing they've done, I have lost all faith in them to complete it in a timely manner.  What can I do to get them to actually complete the requests. What are my options legally if any?   tl;dr: Apartment complex ignoring all requests for servicing a maintenance issue caused by their work done in my apartment and now appliance is deemed unusable and hallway outside leading to staircase is left pitch black and dangerous. What are my legal options to get them to complete the requests?  Thanks for the support. I just want to walk down my stairs with light and not have an unusable dishwasher."	No
Thanks for reading. I am a 22 year old child of two parents whom divorced when I was 2. My father never paid my mother child support, and when my mother tried to petition for some, he denied paternity. Anyway, he never paid a dime of child support. Is it possible to sue him for back child support? He lives in GA now. I have honest motives for wanting to sue as he has caused serious financial impediments to my life recently. Thank you!	No
"A couple of weeks ago, my best friend was a victim of domestic battery by her boyfriend of two years. I have never liked him, but I will try to be as unbiased as I can.  Basically, she is trying to get a restraining order against him, and I don't think he can contact her. Now he's contacting me and another friend about all kinds of things. One minute he's saying that he has a voicemail of my best friend drunk claiming to ""murder him"" if he is still in contact with a coworker that he had a bit of an affair with during their relationship. He's claiming that he's going to take HER to court over that, claiming to spend all his money to lock her up ""for good"", but at the same time telling me that he loves her and only wants the best for her. That he named a ""star after her"" and doesn't want to ""give up"" on their relationship.  I screenshot some of this conversation, mostly about him trying to ""lock up"" my best friend, but I have no idea how to continue. He's been blowing up my phone with texts for the past 30 minutes. Should I keep all of these texts for evidence? Would it be useful at all? Should I block him, or let him keep sending these texts?"	No
"I just moved from one apartment to another in Orlando, FL and received an email notice that I was going to be sent a ""refund"" check for roughly $2000 from my previous apartment's realty management company. I was immediately confused and thought there had been an accounting error. As it turns out, $2000 had been removed from my checking account. Since I was not expecting this charge, I was charged heavy overdraft fees and my account was completely drained. The check has arrived in the mail and it's for a third of the sum that was taken out of my account. My roommate received another third of it and I think my guarantor (i.e., mom) will shortly receive the last third. I am absolutely livid that this money was removed from my account without warning and sent to other people. Especially when they didn't automatically draft my last months rent (also without warning) and I barely caught it in time to pay without late fees. I know I can get my money back from my mom and my roommate, but what would have happened if I didn't have a good relationship with these people? I could have been seriously screwed. Anyway, I'm planning to make some angry phone calls tomorrow morning, but I'm not sure if there's any action I could take to get the late fees refunded. Also, I already cashed the check they sent me because I have next to no money after they took so much out. Was this a bad idea? What should I do? There a million and one other things that happened to me while living in this apartment and I wrote down everything, but this is the icing on the cake."	No
One of my roommates is moving out on August 5th. She hasn't been the most courteous person through the leaving process. A few days ago, we got the utility/internet bill and everyone was told their money was due yesterday so I can pay the bill on time. The roommate in question hasn't paid yet and hasn't answered my texts following up.   I can't cut her off from utilities, but it's not illegal in my state to cut her from from internet. If she isn't paying her share, it's stealing, and I don't want that. The internet is in my name only, so no issues cutting her off from that perspective, whether that be changing the wifi password, blacklisting her devices via MAC, etc. However, the router currently being used is hers. This is where I fear any kind of legal complications. Am I subject to any legal ramification if I change the wifi password? It's my internet, but her router.  Due to budgeting, I can't afford to buy a new router until she moves out, so buying a new one isn't an immediate option.	No
"He had previously opened a bank account in her name before, as well as accounts in my other two children's names (previous marriage, not his children). My lawyer advised me to close the accounts with his name on them and open new ones in my name. He was supposed to be putting their Christmas money into the accounts and when I went to close them I found that he never did so. He's in a financial hole and so I do not trust what he may do with her SS number. I am the primary custodial parent. What rights does he have to this information? Can I deny his reauest based on his history of stealing money from the children? He also claims he needs it for health insurance but child support enforcement is handling her medical support through him and have advised me not to give him the number. I've tried contacting my lawyer but he has not returned my call and meanwhile her noncustodial father (only granted supervised visitation for now) keeps hounding me to give it to him ""because reasons"" which just sounds suspicious to me. If he is legally entitled to it then I will comply with the law. I just need to know if he is or not in this situation. Thank you."	No
"Hello and thank you for reading. I live in Wisconsin. Sorry if the formatting is odd, this is my first time posting.  In June 2016 I signed a lease that commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017. This was my first time renting an apartment and I was unaware that it is common etiquette to provide 30 days notice before moving out. I did not provide 30 days notice, instead I messaged my landlord a few days before moving. Today (7/11/17) I just received a text message from my landlord stating that they will be sending me a written notice to pay the rent for July or they will take me to court, and that I should have given 30 days notice prior to moving out.   Here's the details:   * The term of my lease commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017   * There was no automatic renewal clause   * I did not receive written notice 15-30 days prior to the ending of the lease that there was an automatic renewal clause   * Nothing was written in the lease stating I had to give 30 days (or any number of days) notice before leaving  The only relevant wording I can find in the lease are these two statements:  * ""Upon giving written notice no later than 60 days before the expiration of the term of this Lease, the Tenant may renew this Lease for an additional term""   * ""During the last 30 days of this Lease, the Landlord or the Landlord's agents will have the privilege of displaying the usual 'For Sale' or 'For Rent' or 'Vacancy' signs on the Premises""  I feel bad for breaking common etiquette and not letting my landlord know prior to 30 days, but I'm not reading anything from Wisconsin that states I have to legally give 30 days notice prior to moving. So, legally, does my landlord have a case against me?  I really appreciate your advice and time."	No
I was on a short time frame because my former landlords were selling their condo and I decided to move in with my buddy. I didn't know the building just got bought by a residential management firm. I didn't have a problem with it at first but now the whole building is under construction, every day of the week. I can't work from home anymore because of the noise and I can't sleep past 8 am on the weekends because they start hammering/drilling away then. I'm thinking about asking for 25% off my rent, is that out of line? Am I SOL?	No
"Back in April my ex and I split up shortly after signing a lease together.  I offered her a very reasonable deal to her to pay another month of rent and half a rental credit we received to sign the lease and I would willingly let her out of the lease.  Instead of accepting, she filed a bogus protection order against me in which the worst thing that was insinuated was ""me throwing a drink at her"" and a very vague short description of me one time ""pushing her down"" which never happened. She also claimed she was scared of me cause I have guns (but have never threatened her, i'm just a lawful gun owner).   The judge determined that there was not enough to grant a protection order but instead gave a temporary extension of 90 days to the temporary order (the one that is granted no matter what just by simply filing an order , as a means of precaution).The reason the judge did this was simply because I own a gun, and she used that as a reason to extend the order to keep me away from her. I have no criminal history whatsoever and ironically, my ex has a domestic violence charge against her.  So it's almost been 90 days, she moved almost all her stuff out 2 months ago while I willingly vacated the apartment for a week for her to get her things (which was totally unneccesary. she was dragging her feet and refusing to get her things).  Now I receive a call from my landlord that she is ""excercising her rights to withdraw from the lease under the domestic violence landlord and tenant act"" in wa state. She states I must pay another deposit since apparently my ex was refunded the initial one (which I paid).  Do I have any recourse here or did she just , in my opinion, completely manipulate the law to get out of her legal obligation? I read through the RCW and maybe I'm just angry and not able to focus but It seems as though she can jsut leave, consequence free, even though protection order was not granted."	No
Hi Reddit - I'm asking on behalf of my mother, who's never used Reddit but would love your advice.   She divorced her ex-husband (my ex-step-father, XSF) in 2010. At the time, my younger brother was only 14 so they agreed to put off sorting out the financial settlement until Brother was 18 and going to university - he has issues which make him very unsettled with change and it was concluded it would be best for him to live with my mother in the family home, and then sell the home when he went to university. In the meantime, XSF paid child support, maintenance, his contribution to the mortgage etc.   Due to various different health circumstances, Brother didn't go to university until last year. In the meantime, my mother has got re-married and this has made XSF incredibly bitter. Her new husband does not live with her, they have no joint account and no financial commitment to each other. XFS is now refusing to co-operate with proceedings to divide their assets. My mother has proposed various different financial settlements (via her solicitor to his solicitor) which have either been ignored or rejected, with no counter-offer given. At one point he verbally agreed to her offer, said he would send the paperwork - and then a week later, rejected the offer and came back with a much lower one.   Around this time, my mother decided she would much rather just be rid of him altogether - XSF has become increasingly rude and aggressive via any form of communication. He refuses to respond to letters sent to his solicitor (claiming he didn't receive them although we have proof of delivery and there's no reason his solicitor would hide the letters). He's told Brother that our mother is lying about the letters, accused her of splitting up the family, said he will take her for every penny, claims that she should pay him maintenance so he can retire, etc. Finally, she decided to just accept his very low offer, for the sake of having a quiet life. She sent the acceptance over a month ago - and he's not responded to it. We know he's received it, but he's ignoring it.   Mother's solicitor has said that at this point, taking him to court is her only option - she's even agreed to his (pretty insulting) offer, just to get rid of him, and he's refusing to accept her acceptance. Presumably, this is just to make her miserable as he knows she's keen to sell the house and move out of the area (and in with her new husband) and she can't afford to do that unless she sells it. Going to court will be incredibly expensive (her solicitor is estimating up to £30k in fees, which she may or may not get back from him) and a very lengthy process, up to a year and, if he's going to be as awkward as he carries on being, possibly longer.   LegalAdvice, do we have any options apart from court? I've suggested one more letter, sent to both XSF's home address and his solicitor, saying that she has accepted his offer on [date] and is waiting for his response - if nothing else, if she has to take him to court, then she'll have proof that he's deliberately ignoring her in an attempt to drag out the process. I don't know if it's better to just leave it and go to court, or if there are other options we can take. Thank you!	No
I am writing a memoir and doing my best to prevent any sort of defamation of character accusations before I send a chapter of my book to an online publisher. The people I am writing about include the two multimillionaire business owners (one had since passed away, one is the head of a largely recognizable brand) and a person in academia involved in highly unethical practices.   I have already read about the legal topic and done things like change names, stick to facts, not opinions, and stay in my own point of view, not jump to what another person felt or was thinking.  I have emails and articles to backup that what I am saying is true. However, for my own peace of mind, I would like a lawyer to read my chapter and suggest to me if any edits need to be made to further protect myself.   I do not have a lot of money, (less than $1000 in the bank). Is this something that I might be able to get a pro bono consultation for? Where would be the best place to look for a lawyer that would review my chapter? Does it make a difference if I look for someone who specializes in whistleblower law, literary/creative arts law, or first amendment law?  I am 60 minutes from Chicago, if it makes a difference. Thank you in advance for your help.	No
Texas  My husband and I are splitting up. We have a 3 year old son together. My husband has offered to pay me $600 a month in child support. $500 would go to child care and the extra $100 would be for anything else he needs. My husband brings home around $4,500 a month. He also has our son insured through his work.  Here is the issue - I want to go through the attorney general for child support. He doesn't want me to because he says I'll get more money from him and I 'don't need more money than that'. He says that he put me through school so that I could have a career and can take care of myself and that I really don't need any more money from him in child support. I make about half of what he makes monthly.  I didn't think this was fair, so I told him that I was going to get a lawyer for all of this. His response to that was that if I went out and got a lawyer to get more child support, he would ask that I take our son to an actual daycare. My dad has been taking care of my son since he was born. He watched him every day when I was in nursing school, and he watches him while I work. He's been to every single doctors appointment, he takes him to his T-ball practice and he does 2 learning programs with him at home - ABCmouse and a program with actual books and flash cards. He's doing really well with these programs. My son is very close to him and I feel safe knowing that he's with him.  So my question is - would I likely get more money in child support if I go through lawyers? And can my husband make me send our son to a daycare facility?	No
Suburbs of Denver They live in a duplex. Both sisters rent out their own side of the duplex. Sister #2 is getting evicted for not paying rent. Landlord in a text said that the children are not allowed back on the property of Sister #1's side. Is this legal?	No
So we had just renewed our lease, which we pay 3 months at a time, and we were told that in between the leases they would inspect the house and charge us for any damages. We did cause some damage and were prepared to pay, however we found out that when the house was built they completely fucked up the foundation and the city immediately condemned the house.  It was decided they would demolish the house and our lease would be terminated. However, they are refusing to give back our June and July rent, and are saying our august rent is to be used for the repair costs. I know for a fact there are no repairs going on because they are demolishing the house and I spoke with the contractor.    Also to be clear, our damages had NOTHING to do with the house now being demolished.   Do we have anything to stand on legally? It feels really fucked up and wrong but I don't want to waste my time and money on a lawyer if nothing can be done.	No
"I have a 22ft Grumman Olsen Curbmaster bread truck with two axels and six wheels that as registered as a personal vehicle and used like one. I don't use it everyday, but frequently enough for it not to be abandoned. I park it along a back alley near my work. There is a graveyard blocked by hedges on one side, and a storage place on the other. The closest residential building is over 200 feet away and around the corner.   Today I was confronted by that homeowner 200 feet away and told me that he had called the police, twice, and that Monday, my truck would be towed. I asked him if it was against the law. He said yes, that it was illegal to park anywhere for more than 24 hours,  and then it had two be moved at least 4 blocks away. Before leaving he said, ""I'll let you know, I am an expert on parking laws. I'm not asking you to move it, I'm telling you."" which, of course makes me want to leave it there much more because I like to watch rude people squirm...  Anyway, personal matters aside, it is going to be a real pain to move it 4 blocks every day into real residential territory where people have a real right to be upset (like right in front of their house). The only laws I could find on the internet was that you cannot park a truck in front of across from a residence for more than 8 hours.   I see Laurelhurst park surrounded with full time RV livers and I doubt I'm that high on the to do list for the police even if I am parked illegally.   So my questions are,  1) am I parked illegally  2) will it really be Monday when I am towed? Isn't this city overflowing with RVers who are obviously lived in and illegally parked? (I'm thinking Laurelhurst Park) Will they have to give me some kind of warning sticker?  3) where can I park this thing if I have to move?  I am completely ignorant of all things law, and don't know even where to look for myself so I really appreciate your advice."	No
First off we three each paid a deposit to this apartment of $100. The front desk woman we gave these money orders to was just terminated by management. The new management says since they have no evidence of us paying through money order we must prove it through receipts. If I can't find the original receipt what can I do from there? Old management lost the deposits and now I'm in a confused place on this.	No
At least once per month, we get a knock on the door from individuals saying they're from Comcast or CenturyLink and they request to go into our backyard. We've heard from our neighbors that they've attempted to access our backyard when we are not home. We have two dogs that have access to a doggie door that could potentially bite if someone accesses the backyard.   I expressed my frustration to the contractor that came to the door today and he said that there are easement rights they have so I cannot refuse access. Is this correct?	No
Let's say I write a book about a now pretty unknown legend. The word has had various different meanings over the years. And if I ever make a movie I don't want the studio to be a dick. And take down other works people might make. What's the best way to make sure I can legally do that, before any studio  gets their hands on the script?	No
"Hi r/legaladvice.  Important background info: I am a minor who will be applying to colleges starting in November. I have 5 months left until I turn 18. My mom is disabled and her sole income is from SSI.  Two years ago, my dad told us that him and my mom have been divorced since 2003; however, she did not recall ever signing dissolution papers. He had also been living with us this whole time and taking almost all of my mom's money. He gave us a big binder full of unorganized papers and left us with almost no money. Upon rehashing the papers, I showed my mom her signature and she said that is was not hers. So at this point, she had been unknowingly divorced for 12 years.  My dad had paid for my brother's college education, but he told me last week that he would not be contributing anything to my education. I do not expect my mom to contribute much, however, because she has a small income. So, growing frustrated with this whole mess, I drove to my local courthouse and asked to open the file in case there were some papers we didn't have.   As I went through the file, I discovered that a judge had ordered all of the petitions and papers ""void ab initio"" only a month after them being filed. The reasoning was because they were all prepared by a lawyer who was not licensed to practice in Illinois.  I went to a lawyer to ask him to just decipher the language for me and he told me what it all meant. He was also concerned why I was doing most of this alone, and it is because my mom is deathly afraid of my dad. When he left, he threatened us to not file anything in court, or else he will kick us out of our own house.  I told her today what is going on. She is speechless but has agreed that, with my support, she will go to the court to file the petition for dissolution, as well as a petition for college expenses.   We are both wondering now if we should get an attorney before we file the petitions? Should we go file them first? What happens if this case is not resolved once I turn 18--does it all go to dust? Can we call 911 if he comes to our house to threaten us again?  Thank you in advance for any advice. I am a little overwhelmed as I am the supporter for both my mom and myself, but I would really like this to be solved and done with before next autumn."	No
"Lease wording: ""No more than two dogs and two cats are allowed at this property."" Nothing about the dogs needing to be pre-approved.  House is fairly rural. Not an apartment. Yearly lease.  When we signed the lease, we had two dogs. Landlord didn't care what kind of dogs they were or anything like that as long as they weren't pit bulls. One of our dogs passed before we moved. A couple of weeks before moving day, we were given another dog (a little guy, not a restricted breed).  I personally don't even think the landlords will notice the dog, they're not around often. But my wife is worried they'll be upset that we didn't ask permission and will kick us out. I don't personally think they would be able to do that. Initially she didn't want to ask or tell them about it, now she wants to ask but it's a little too late for that.  What do you think?"	No
Hi everyone,   Me and other tenants digitally signed a lease at the owner's insistence while we were out of state.  He never provided a copy of it with his signature. We need a copy as we are currently seeking a lawyer to help us with understanding if he is in breach of contract regarding something else, but we need the fully executable lease for the lawyer's help.   Questions: Is the landlord required to provide tenants with a copy of the lease with landlord's signature?  If the landlord is refusing to provide, what options do we as tenants have?Would a lawyer actually help us to receive a copy?  Thanks. Have learned a lot from all the mistakes we made during this current lease term.	No
"I am a landlord in Bergen County NJ in a two family house (I live downstairs, the tenant lives upstairs). I currently have a tenant who has been intermittently accusing me of smoking pot over the past few months.  At first my tenant was simply saying they were smelling smoke so I looked around the property and into the furnace to see if there was maybe something wrong. I tried asking questions about what the point of origin was for the smell (areas of room, side of houses, etc) but I only received an exasperated ""it's everywhere"".  I have suggested the tenant speak to neighbors, but they refused to even consider it could be anyone other than me. They adamantly assert it is coming from my part of the house and it has gotten to the point where one of my family members called them to state I am willing to take a drug test (so long as the tenant pays for it, my job recently shut down and I lost my insurance as a result) and that their accusations are bordering on harassment. The tenant refused to pay for the drug test so now my family member is considering pooling money with my aunt’s and uncle’s to pay for the drug test (which costs a bit under 200$).  The entire time I have maintained that I do not smoke (I quite smoking cigarettes over a year ago and I haven't smoked pot in over two years, I never smoked it at my house). My tenant is a single parent with a daughter and is claiming that they have been woken up several times at night by the smell and demanded a solution from me even after I've maintained my innocence.  I recently googled my tenant's name and discovered an incident between them and their partner, the other parent of the daughter, which involved a false report by my tenant against the other parent of sexual misconduct of the daughter and counter charges that the other parent (not the tenant) was ""wrongfully accused, arrested, charged, prosecuted, defamed, slandered, and libeled.""  The other parent apparently charged my tenant with criminal coercion, extortion and harassment. I was unable to discover how this incident ended as I try to remain at arm's length with my tenant, only helping with what needs to be taken care of in the house.  What are my rights, as a landlord? I am worried that my tenant may try to cite the text conversations as a history to display wrongful conduct on my part or otherwise continue a campaign of harassment against me. I have tried to be polite in every communication I have had with her. One of my friends has brought up that taking a drug test might establish precedent for complying with her unreasonable demands. I’m considering evicting her or otherwise ending the tenant agreement, but she has a lease and I’m aware that tenants in Northern NJ have many rights that makes getting rid of them difficult.  tl;dr I have a tenant harassing me and accusing me of illegal behavior insinuating I am endangering their daughter with alleged drug use, what rights to I have as a landlord?"	No
"My roommate and I are interns in VA. We signed a 3-month lease for May 25-Aug 25, and our lease says   &gt;""If your current lease expires and no renewal or extension more than three months has been signed, then you will be considered as being on a 60-day option. The rent during the option period will be current MTM rate for the apartment.""  Today I realized we haven't provided a move-out notice. I immediately went to  the office and submitted a notice, but I'm curious if there are any avenues we can take to escape the extra charges since we didn't receive a reminder to renew/terminate our lease. The manager said that they typically provide courtesy reminders 3 months out, but she admitted that we fell through the cracks because we signed a 3 month lease.  I have another question.  I asked the manager for a move-out checklist. She casually mentioned that there is no list and that we ""just need to clean the apartment"". When I pressed her about ""clean""--specifically if I had to clean the carpets--she admitted that we need to have the carpets professionally cleaned and provide a receipt. I cannot clean the carpets myself.  Am I legally obligated to professionally clean the carpets? The lease does not require professional cleaning.   This really frustrates me because the previous cleaners clearly weren't that professional: I've found several strands of long hair in my room and the living room. Neither my roommate nor I have pets or wear shoes into the spartan unit (air mattresses are our biggest pieces of furniture), so I'd really like to avoid a professional cleaning.  Thanks"	No
"I'm still livid from this and I will be speaking to an attorney this week but I just wanted to get this all down in writing because I still can't believe it actually happened.   So I (single male early 30's) bought a house in a neighborhood outside of a large city in TN. I moved in about 6 months ago. I got a job here and after around 2 years of living in an apartment, I wanted to get a house because my employer made a long term path clear to me. However, I think I may have been too quick to buy. My brother in law is from the area and was helping me find a place and he really convinced me to get this house and I pulled the trigger. This is mostly useless info, but some background might be helpful because -  This home was in a HOA. Honestly, the president of the group met with me when I was talking with the realtor and told me how the dues help to keep the communal small park area clean and they also act as a neutral party for neighbor disputes so I thought it sounded great. The dues were low and the house/neighborhood was great. She sent some paperwork when I bought the house, and I signed.  After this, my job got much more busy and I had to work 60-ish hour weeks. On Saturday's I would invite some work friends over and we would have a BBQ in my yard and watch some shows. This was a dream come true for me. I always wanted to own my own place and just be able to be my own landlord.  A few weeks ago I received a letter from the HOA president I spoke to saying that there were multiple complaints of noise ""after a reasonable hour"" from my home. I honestly thought that was fair so I moved my get-togethers inside and thought it was the end of it.  HOWEVER - yesterday. The HOA president sent me an email saying that my home was ready to be sold. As in she said in the email ""Your home has found a buyer and we look forward to you accepting the offer"". She immediately sent a second email from a realty company with the further info about the offer on my home. I checked that realtors website and there are pictures of my home with all of my things inside of it. Someone had been in my home when I was not here and took pictures. What the absolute shit.  I emailed her back immediately because it was obvious she came into my home, but how? And she said this: ""In the HOA agreement you signed, a concerned neighbor may enter your home if there is a risk of harm, or if it might be in the interest of the neighborhood itself"". I wish I was making this up. She then said ""Because of your repeated noise violations it was in our best interest to facilitate selling your home.""  I don't even know where to begin. Did she do something illegal even if it was in the agreement? I know I should have not signed this and it was stupid. But she was obviously just helping herself inside my home for weeks and I just feel like that cannot be right."	No
I've been in my apartment for 2.5 years and have been a very good resident with no prior issues. Due to an accident (I'd rather not get specific but it was my fault and also injured me) I put a 5 inch hole right through a bedroom door. The door is cheap and hollow. My question is can I get evicted for this? I have been upset and fearful over it and ashamed to write into maintenance. Does this come out of my security deposit or do I have to pay more money for the door next time rent is due? I am in Arizona. I don't see this in my lease contract, only a small phrase about evictions for severe damage to property that endangers others (like driving into the building lol)  Thank you.	No
Title is pretty self-explanatory, I got into an accident, my rear bumper got ripped off 2 weeks ago and I just got a ticket in the mail for careless driving. The cop did NOT see the accident and the entire encounter was overall friendly. Now I know I can just talk to the prosecutor before court and have it knocked down to unsafe driving but that's a $400 fine that I'd rather not pay if I didn't have to. Since the cop didn't see the accident and the other driver isn't gona show up to court to testify against me if that were the case, so what are my options? Any advice would be greatly appreciated	No
I'm 25 and from North Carolina. I haven't seen my 2 kids in 3 months and she keeps demanding I pay child support. Two weeks ago I sent her a formal email renouncing my parenting rights but she demands I continue paying child support. Is this legal? If so, how do I make her stop without taking her to court?	No
"So this is my first ever speeding ticket - I honestly have no idea how to approach this. I got the ticket about a week ago in Bishop, CA while driving on a road trip. From about a mile away, I saw a black SUV and knowing my brother was nearby, I sped up to see if it was him. Once I got close enough to realize it was actually a patrol SUV with the words ""highway patrol"" on the rear, I immediately slowed down. But by then, I'm assuming, the cop had already matched my speed. He pulled to the side, allowing me to get ahead of him - then he proceeded to pull me over.   The court appearance that I have is about 300 miles away from my house. I'm willing to show up if it means I can get out of the ticket - but is there anything at all that I can do or say to make this ticket go away? I know it's a long shot, but I have to try!"	No
"Texas.  Spouse out earns me by double. Just found he has not paid the mortgage in 3 months. Trying to force a short sale (mortgage is not in my name , house has joint deed).   I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about ""taking someone out."" When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality.

"My landlord for my commercial business sent me an invoice regarding unpaid CAM balances for 2013-2016.  They claim that the total unpaid amount for those three years sums up to a very big amount (5 digit number). This is the first I've heard of these charges and my lease agreement says they would provide a statement of actual CAM costs for the year within 60 days ""(or as soon thereafter as possible)"" following the end of each calendar year.  I have been paying my agreed upon CAM charges every month already so this letter regarding such a large balance came as a shock to me. I have sent my landlord a request for itemized lists of all charges and if they have proof of any CAM invoices sent to me in those years.   Can I argue for the balance to be dropped since they didn't fulfil their end of the lease agreement?  Thank you in advance for your help"	No
"So in just over 24 hours I have a ""hearing to determine dependency"" with children and youth. The paperwork I received says that ""the child is without proper care or control"" and that she will be placed in ""kinship foster care"". What do those things mean? Also, I was told that once the issue involved is no longer an issue, she will be able to go right back to me. Does it work like that, or will there need to be another hearing? I applied for and was given a public defender, that I have so far not been able to get in contact with."	No
Howdy folks, first time renter here at the conclusion of my first lease. The property owners are raising the rent $105 (from $545) and my wife and I feel we can get a better place for the price they want. Therefore, we proactively reached out in late June to talk about the lease.   On July 11th, they delivered a dated letter by sticking it into our door. This letter gave options for going month-to-month at $695 and signing a new lease for $650. The letter also said we would have to give written notice 30 days in advance if we decide to leave. We have not come to a final decision on leaving the property. My main questions are:  * Can they wait until &lt;30 days before August rent is due to send this letter? * If we decide to leave, we give them as much notice as possible, and we leave before the end of the month, are we accountable for August rent?  Thank you for your time, and any advice on how to better navigate this process in the future is much appreciated. We're still figuring things out and I certainly tend to feel awash in a sea of misinformation online and in person. Hoping to get some clarity from you fine people.	No
Hey everyone so I was at staples baught a laptop opened up their credit card and put it on there financed it for 6 months a month later i check my statement on that credit card and the laptop didnt show up on it, about 2 weeks later rep from staples calls me and said an error happened in the transaction and that they need me to come in the store with the credit card to charge me. My question is are they allowed to do that? am I legally obliged to go in and have them charge or cause they missed the transaction at the point of sale means i get the laptop for free because i think that if they cant charge it to me automatically then that means they are basically just taking a shot to see if i am gullible enough to come into the store and have them charge me cause they dont have the right to charge me now. also this is in Canada Ontario.

Today my SO recieved an email from our previous appartment company stating that we owe $1000 for stains on the carpet. We moved out before May 1st and did not recieve this invoice till today. It said we have till August 30 to pay or it will be going to collections.  Over the past year or so my health and my SO had been failing. After many docters visits we still could not figure out what was wrong with us. So in march we had a mould test done and it tested possitive for an elevated levels of mould in the appartement. We informed our property managers about this and they came in and cut up the walls looking for mould. They were unable to identity were it was coming from. We requested to move out asap. They told us that was not enough notice but since health was an issue they would allow us to move out before may 1st and they would use our last months rent for april. We moved out the weekend before the first. When I returned the keys there was no mention of a move out inspection and they had previously told us not to worry about steam cleaning the carpets since there were several holes in wall (made by them looking for mould) and they would need to be drywalled. The carpets were not stained beyond the normal wear and tear and after getting some quotes from steaming companies the average cost to have a 2 bedroom apartment cleaned in my area is between $200-350.   $1000 seems insane to me and this feels like extortion. Is there anyway to fight this?   Both my SO and my health have improved since moving out of the appartment.	No
Separated from ex for about four years now. We decided to attempt filing for a non contested divorce without the assistance of an attorney. We agree on everything with the exception of who will drive for pick up and drop off during visitation. We really can't get past this and I think it's probably going to result in a contested divorce in front of a judge.   A little background; I'm a mother of five children ages 2-10, three are half siblings and step siblings from my current relationship. We alternate holidays and he gets every other weekend with the option to see them whenever he's in the area. Neither of us is too firm on the visutation schedule, we just do whatever works.   In the four years that we've been sharing custody the kids have never been picked up or dropped off on time. He's picked them up as late as 3am and brought them home as late as 4am on a school night. It's become a huge problem and source of tension. He blames it on my location, says I live too far away but in the four years that we've been separated I've lived in one home while he's lived in several. Whether he's staying with family, friends, in temporary rentals or hotels, I can't be blamed for not consistently living within an appropriate distance from him.   Currently he lives about an hour and 45 minutes away. He wants to meet halfway for pick up and drop off. Under normal circumstances I would agree that that is fair but I've been there and done that with him. In the beginning I would meet him and we would sit in the car for *hours*, sometimes very late into the night waiting for him to show up. I tried bringing them to his house and still, I would sit for hours, waiting. Eventually I stopped meeting him and now it's becoming an issue of him bringing them back at all because he doesn't want to drive. They'll be due back on Sunday and he'll repeatedly say he's coming but not actually show up until several days later.  It's driving me crazy not having a consistent routine and I realize that something needs to be put down on paper so that everyone is equally liable.   In a contested divorce will a judge consider the circumstances before ruling on who should do the driving? Honestly the reason I've put this divorce off for so long is that I'm worried a judge will order me to share driving duty and I can't- I just can't- spend every other weekend sitting in a car with my 5 kids waiting on him for hours.

"Long story short, I ""owe"" my landlord money. I disagree with the assessment. I do want to make sure that they can't send me to collections without taking me to court first. If they can, then I would sue them over the issue first. I want to know which it is. I'll lay out what I can in chronological order  June 2016: Moved into apartment, signed a year long lease.  August 2016: Moved out due to unforeseen job change.  NOTE: I tried to fill the apartment. They had about a 30% vacancy rate, so they had no interest in filling mine. I sent about 25 people to the apartment, but apparently none of them were interested, even with discounts given by me.  January 2016: I paid my rent by check in person, and received a receipt. They apparently lost my check, and sent me an eviction notice. While I disagreed with the eviction, I was already moved out and didn't want the proceedings on my credit check, so I turned my keys in. Following some bad advice, I took them to court to get my security deposit back. I lost the case, but the judge told them that as I had a receipt, the lost check was their problem, not mine. During the court proceedings, which took about 3 months, I did not pay rent. Stupid, I know, but it's in the past. Because of that, I had some late payments. After the case was over, I paid up what they told me would bring me up to date. Apparently, they were wrong.  July 2016: Due to a misunderstanding, I paid an extra rent payment by check, through the mail.  When I moved out, they gave me the following charges: $25 Missing Toilet seat (I took the one I bought with me and hadn't had a chance to replace it) $150 Cleaning (I haven't been there in 7 months, somewhat understandable) $275 Late Charges (Apparently the number they gave me to make me even was wrong( $750 ""Missing"" Check. (This is the one I paid that they lost. I have a reciept for it. They never found it and never deposited it)  They took the accidentaly sent $750 rent check and applied it to the missing check. The other charges I am not contesting, and would have no problem paying. They used my admittedly small security deposit and had $250 in charges left over.   I would be willing to pay the $250, but I don't believe the $750 check should have been applied as it was. In my mind, $250 the $750 should be applied to the charges, and the rest sent back to me.   Every time I deal with these people I get sick to my stomach, and the rest of my day turns to absolute crap. They are an hour and a half away, so if I take them to court, I would need to file in their area and drive there and back multiple times.  So, my questions are as follows:  Am I wrong in the way I am thinking the rent check should be applied?  Would they need to sue me in my jurisdiction, or could they sue me in theirs?  Would they need to sue me before sending the debt to debt collectors? I don't want that issue.  If I sued them, given the facts as stated, what laws would be applicable?    I would be willing to eat the losses as is to be done with this. But I don't want to lose more than that. Any advice would be appreciated."	No
All names have been changed.  My boyfriend Abe and I live in a house with 7 people total right now. The house is owned by the K family, whom Abe knows personally. Abe acts as landlord by finding people to rent the rooms, collecting rent to send to the K family, repairing whatever necessary in the house, etc. This agreement is not in writing. We moved in about a year ago, before that a friend of ours who also knew the K family took care of the house but he moved out about 6 months ago. If Abe were to leave, the K family would sell the house.  The other roommates live here with no lease, no security deposits, nothing in writing and pay rent on a monthly basis.  One of our roommates, Kevin, has been living here a little longer than Abe and me. The entire time he has been here every single person has had complaints about him. He is very messy when it comes to the kitchen/bathrooms, never pays bills on time, and steals food. We talked to him about it many times and warned him that if he didn't improve we would ask him to move out, but tried to be patient with him as he is an old friend of Abe's.  A few months ago, Kevin's girlfriend Britney, who was living elsewhere, got into a fight with her roommate, who took out a restraining order against her. So Kevin asked if she could stay with us for a few days. After a week or so she asked if she could continue staying there until August, to which we said yes and asked her to start pitching in for utilities but no additional rent.  Since Britney moved in she has made a few efforts to clean but on the whole the place has been a lot messier and they continue to steal food. We have asked them many times to clean their bathroom, as they share it with two of the other roommates, but they are adamant they shouldn't have to do it.  Since they refused to clean up after themselves, and it is now August and Britney has not made any effort to look for other housing, we asked Kevin and Britney both to move out. We haven't given them written notice yet as we are able to be pretty flexible about the room and want to give them a reasonable amount of time to find somewhere else, but we told them 30 days roughly. However both Kevin and Britney have issues managing money which is the main problem with moving out. Britney in particular has lawyer fees since she assaulted her roommate, but she also hasn't been contributing to Kevin's rent at all even though she shares his room (and takes up a large portion of the common areas with her stuff since their room isn't big enough).  So basically we want to give them written notice to leave in 30 days but are concerned that even though they have agreed to move out, they won't find a place in time or be able to pay for it. I'd like to find out what exactly I need to include in the notice so that if they are still here by the end of that period we will be able to take some kind of legal action (and if it comes to that, what's the best approach?).  I'm wondering if we need to involve the K family as well or if we can give them notice by ourselves. Abe has already talked to the K family and they are fully supportive of our decision but I don't know if we need them to sign the notice as well. Here is what we are planning on giving them so far:    (Date)  (Kevin's full name and Britney's full name)  (Address)    Kevin and Britney,  Please take notice that I am ending your rental of the property located at (Address).  You have received this notice letter because you have a month-to-month tenancy and I would like to end the tenancy. You must move out within 30 days after receiving this notice.  Signed  (Abe's full name. Or K family?)     We are planning on printing this out and giving it to them in person. A few other questions I have:  Do I need to write separate notices for Kevin and Britney or can they both be on the same one?  Who needs to sign it? (Britney claims that in addition to giving them 90 days, we need every roommate in the house to sign but I don't think this is true)  To what extent does the K family need to be involved?  Do I need to provide a reason for ending their tenancy, or reference any specific laws? We live in Virginia.  Thanks so much if you've read all this and I appreciate any advice you could give!	No
Just recently transferred a car from my dad to me and they copied my address down wrong and my new title should be 2700 my street address but it is 2706 my street address. Does this really matter, and if so are they going to try and charge me for their mistake?   Don't know if it makes a difference but the address they put on it does not technically exist.	No
This is for a name change, the hearing is at 9:20 AM so not really time to run all over the city (and to a county 2.5 hours away). I planned to mail all the info to MIL who still lives in the far county and she can do the searches there, while I'm doing my searches in my county, we meet up over the weekend to trade off papers and bam, done. It sounds so stupid but this process has been so stupid that I'm just being careful.	No
Hello everyone,  I just moved to California from across the country. It's kind of a rural area so it was difficult to find a place to rent. I went out to look at properties beforehand but all the ones available for show were already rented out by the end of that day while I waited for my application to be approved of and I couldn't afford to travel back to look at more properties before deciding to apply for a place.  My application was approved for a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath, with standard kitchen appliances such as an oven, dishwasher, and refrigerator. I made sure to read the lease thoroughly and it states that the unit fits that description.   After taking possession, it turns out there's no half bathroom nor is there a refrigerator. I think the solution the the refrigerator is easy: they should just provide the fridge like the lease states. This isn't exactly possible with the half bathroom, though.  I really like the place otherwise. I'm disappointed that it's not as advertised nor as described in the lease. I don't want to break the lease, but I don't think I should have to pay full rent for something that was not as described in our contract.   Here are my questions: can I negotiate a decrease in rent for the lack of half bathroom or how can I best handle the situation? This is a property owned by a third party who has the unit run by a local property management company.   Tl;dr: lease says 2 bedroom, 1.5 bath, refrigerator included. Unit only has 2 bedroom, 1 bath, no fridge. What can I do to negotiate to make up for the lack of half bathroom?	No
"Years ago, I made a dumb decision to get a dog with a college girlfriend. We split all of the initial costs.  Que a few weeks ago when I get served for possession over my dog. I show up on the court date, go to mediation and we agree on terms.  The terms were that I give her money for her initial costs and she keeps the dog for 10 days to say goodbye. She was supposed to meet up with me yesterday to exchange the dog and now refuses to talk to me, and I'm stuck communicating with her father as a middle man.   Between her not taking to me, her father beating around the bush and neither willing to give me the dog back, I am stuck out money and no dog.  Our mediation agreement states the following terms:  ""As of 7pm on 8/10/17 (other party) give up any claim to dog.""  ""At that time (Me) will take possession of dog in permanent basis""  ""If either party violates the agreement, other party will receive judgement.""  These were terms made in mediation. Both parties, the mediator and the judge signed the document.   We had a scheduled ""follow up"" court date for this coming up Monday which was meant for two reasons. One being that if either party violates agreement, and two if both parties follow through, we don't show up and the case is closed.  It seems pretty cut and dry to me that as long as I followed through with my part of the agreement, and because she is refusing to give the dog back that I would gain judgment in front of the judge.   This is the first time I'm going through my sort of legal case so I don't want to be naive or too confident, but looking at the agreement and terms, it seems like I will end up winning judgement."	No
"Hi legaladvice peeps,  A few weeks ago, my partner and I signed for a new apartment beginning August 1. We(and our guarantors) signed the lease and paid for the security deposit, first month's rent, and broker's fee(about $7500 in total), and proceeded to start changing utilities and scheduling movers and days off from work (all with a promised August 1 move date in mind).     Our broker informs us that we won't be able to move in August 1 and that it would be safe to say we could move in August 15, because the current tenant's new apartment won't be ready. Essentially, these tenants are waiting for the tenants in their new apartment to move out(which may not be until July 31) because their management won't draft up a lease or give them a move in date until they receive keys. The turnaround will take about 2 weeks according to this management company hence the August 15 move-in date. They are currently hoping that these other tenants will move out a week early, moving their move-in date to August 7 which is still terrible imo. They refuse to find themselves a hotel and storage space for the interim period. Their rationale is ""One of us is pregnant, and it's very stressful for us, so we aren't going to move until we are ready."" They refused to renew the lease and as far we know had never asked for a month to month lease. The tenants were informed with proper amount of notice that their lease was expiring 7/31 and that the landlord already had new tenants ready to move in.     We have informed the broker + landlord that moving in after August 1 is pretty unacceptable -- we will lose over a thousand dollars because my partner will have to cancel her sublet arrangement at her current apartment (which she was set to move from on 8/1), and I will have to move in with her for some undefined amount of time (from 1 to 15 days, approximately). I will have to pay moving fees twice, take days off from work, and I've already had to cancel professional trips between the dates of 8/1-8/15.     We have informed the landlord of all of this, and they basically said they would try their best to motivate the tenants to leave on time. I suggested that they could try reimbursing our expenses via the current tenants' security deposit, or notify them that even one day stayed past 7/31 will lead LL to proceed against them. The broker has been stressing to this couple how bad this could be for them monetarily– a lot of people's money is on the linen including ours, the broker, and the landlord although we don't know if that's getting through to them.     We signed a Blumberg A101 Condo Leasing form (https://www.blumberglegalforms.com/Forms/101.pdf) which includes a clause saying that the landlord isn't liable for failure to give tenant possession of the unit at the beginning of term - basically, it says LL's only obligation in this scenario is to prorate rent for each day they can't give possession, which they have already offered to do. As explained above, however, this situation will cause us to pay rent twice in August.      NYC housing-educated people, what are our options in this case? We still would like to move into this apartment, but it would also be useful to know if this can be used as leverage to cancel a lease, in a worst-case scenario where tenants squat for more than 2 weeks. Also, I'm curious about precedent for this scenario, and what landlords are typically liable for in a case of holdover tenants + signing a lease on property that they can't actually give possession for"	No
My friend's mother is currently being taken care of by hospice and they called her mother's siblings and told them that it is time to make funeral arrangements.  As her mother has been an incredible money pit her whole life and quite the burden on her siblings, they are declining to pay for any part of the funeral arrangements, and are foisting the monetary issues onto my friend (We'll call her Alice).  Alice is a management figure at a food chain, and doesn't make the money to pay completely for the cremation of the body.  Are there any legal footings that Alice can stand on that will compel her next of kin (who are loaded by the way) to pitch in or contribute to the cremation costs and transportation costs?  Is there any financial help that she can garner to complete the burial?  She would like to avoid the state taking the body so I would like to get an answer swiftly since her mother doesn't have much time left.  Thank you in advance for any information or help you may have.  We are located in Brevard County Florida, USA.  If this is the wrong subreddit to post in I am sorry in advance.	No
"So the fledgling family real estate biz just bought a house and closed last week. Over the weekend we had very heavy rains and a large section of the ceiling (10x10 section) fell in due to a roof leak.   Here's the kicker... the sellers disclosure said:  &gt;Any Roof problems:   YES[X] - new roof 2016.   Roof leaks: Past YES[X]   Roof leaks: Present  NO[X]  There's a small section on the opposite end of the house where there was some repairs done in the last 1-2 years, but it's not a new roof, just a repair/patch on the existing.  It could be 1-2 years old, but that would make the roof around it older than ""new in 2016""    So our realtor thinks that the property was misrepresented because the seller claims a new roof, but I feel that since they checked ""YES"" under ""any known issues with the roof"" they might get off the hook.   We did see the roof before purchase, but none of us are professional roofers... I could tell a brand-spanking-new roof from one 30 years old, but I have no idea really what 1-2 years of weather would do to a flat roof (all mine have been pitched).   What say LA? Do we have a case against the seller, their agent, or are we boned?   TIA."	No
From my understanding, different states have different rules regarding marriage, in all sorts of different ways. Without getting into a story that is the length of a novel, are there any major reasons why a woman marrying a terminally ill man would abruptly change plans and want to get married in Florida instead of New York? Would it change anything when the worst happens with regards to inheritance and his children?	No
As stated above just recently two people were found dead in an apartment in the same building as my apartment in a huge complex, the place is a real shithole and I knew that going into it but its was cheap and convenient.  The police told my girlfriend and I that its a suspected double overdose, we basically told him their are always people hanging around outside at all hours of the night and if we continue to see this should we call, he pretty much told us they always get calls about our building.  My question for you reddit lawyers, would this be grounds to terminate my lease early and gtfo?  When I signed the lease they clearly explained if I attempt to break it early it will cost me 2.5 months rent however this seems like a great reason to break it early w/o penalty.  I plan to go into my leasing office tomorrow and have a discussion about this.  Do I even have a leg to stand on with this situation or will this just me venting? The leasing company is a national agency so I'm sure they will be prepared for anything I have to say, just looking for a little advice.  TLDR: 2 people over dosed in my apartment building (not my apartment) and I'm ready to gtfo, what should I say to my landlord?	No
A few months ago, I came home to my apartment and it was open. I thought I rushed out and kinda was whatever about it.  I live in a safe area, so really what was the worst it could be? Nothing was out of place, the animals were home. I just assumed I was an idiot.  About two weeks ago, I had an Amazon package riffled through. It was an IPL laser for in home hair removal, the guy stole a cartridge. I thought nothing of it and thought that Amazon messed up or the package was delivered incorrectly until my neighbor indicated the man, whom my neighbor saw, was going through my stuff and waiting out in the parking lot 8 hours later, gave up, and went somewhere else.  I got home shortly after that time.  The cops really were whatever about it. Amazon replaced the part.  I dusted off my gun.  Life went on.  About four days ago, I found a box of razor blades and rope in front of my door.  I thought nothing of it, eh people are moving so whatever, and I moved on.    This morning, I woke up and went to go feed the cats.  Now, the bin I have the cat food in is heavy.  Those monsters can't knock it over if they tried, and believe me, they try.  The bin was perfectly inverted and in a different location in the room.  The food stays in the bag, as I like to keep crumbs out of the container, and I usually fold it down, it was rolled down.  This is not something I do.  I also don't invert the food tub and as it was perfectly inverted, I doubt it was a cat that did it.  I don't go in that room except to clean the litter box and feed the cats.  My landlord nor has the management stepped foot in my apartment. There is no sign of entry.  My spare key is still in my kitchen.  Am I crazy or does this sound like something I should chat with the cops about?  This feels weird.	No
So basically my family member has an apartment. This family member is the only one on the lease. Although this family member has a now ex living there and after their break-up this family member wants the ex out. The ex won't leave so my family member called the police. The police did nothing saying since the ex has mail sent to the house then they can't force the ex to leave because it is their residence. What can my family member do to get this ex out of their home?	No
"I'm a US citizen renting an apartment in Antwerp, Belgium. I was too quick to sign the contract assuming it would be the normal 3-6-9 here. Starting my 4th year I can no longer afford this contract.

"My 3 former roommates and I recently moved out of a our Baltimore City row-house. Our landlord and property manager withheld $1,000 of $2,700 from our security deposit. The remaining balance + interest was returned to us 46 days (MD law states the deposit must be returned within 45 days) past our lease end-date with the reason listed as ""General Damages."" We requested an itemized breakdown which we did not received until ~60 days past our lease end-date.   I've quoted the law several times and have attempted to negotiate the return of at least a portion of the remaining deposit to no avail. Unfortunately, my roommates and I not having a great relationship combined with one of them being out-of-state has made any group action difficult. This has lead me to a few questions:  1) Can I sue as an individual? If so, can I claim $1,000 as damages or, since we split the returned portion of the deposit, only the balance owed to me personally? 2) If we deposit the returned portion of the security deposit am I/we giving up the right to sue for the remaining balance? 3) In general, what are my chances of success? If we were one person or collectively filed a claim, it seems pretty clear-cut that our landlord and property manager are in violation of the law. Am I missing something."	No
A sprinkler broke on the property and is fixed. The tenant receives a water bill much higher than normal and so requests reimbursement from the management company. The owner rejects the reimbursement. What happens next? Who pays for it?	No
So this is a bit of a long story but I'll do my best to make it clear. In 2015 we started working as resident managers for an apartment complex in town, owned by a real estate management company two hours away. We only lived there for about a year because the job was too stressful. The property manager expected work equivalent to a full time job (when he advertised it as 10-12 hours a week) so it ended up being too much for us. Free rent was not enough compensation.  So fast forward to when we decided to move out. We were expected to continue our duties like normal until he found a replacement, so we were busy between that, our other jobs and classes. When he found a replacement he started rushing us to move out, even though our lease was until the end of July. He ended up getting us completely out by mid July. So because of that we didn't get to do the steps normally required when moving out.  Within a month or two we received a letter that included costs for damages they were saying we incurred. They were charging us a total of $2700, $2100 of which was for the replacement of carpet. Some of the other charges were even things we marked on our diagram, but some of it is things like a lock that was installed on one of the bedroom doors (that was there before we moved in) or blinds that also had been damaged before we moved in.  All resident managers stay in a specific unit on the property. The carpet was very old and obviously had seen lots of wear. There were bleach stains and there was even poop on the carpet that we had to get cleaned before we moved in. Resident managers before us have had pets in the apartment as well. We know that some of the carpet damage is from our cat, but we don't believe $2100 for the carpet is something we should be paying, much less the charges for things we didn't do.  We spoke with a lawyer about this matter and had him compose a letter to the property manager explaining that we want to dispute the charges, what we felt we owed, and that if we couldn't come to an agreement we'd take him to court. He never responded to our letter so we thought he was dropping the charges. We didn't contact the lawyer any further.  It's over a year later and we get a call from a collection agency about our balance with this property manager. They told us our options were to pay the full $2100 or pay the lowered amount of $1800 (that the property manager was graciously offering). From what I understand, they will be calling back on Monday to discuss this further. Is there nothing else we can do? Please tell me that there are things that prevent bad landlords from getting away with this sort of thing?  TL;DR - Our property manager tried to charge us for more than we owed after we moved out over a year ago. Talked to lawyer, had letter written and sent to property manager discussing dispute and terms. Landlord never responded. Over a year later we get a call from collections about our unpaid balance.	No
"Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.  Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.  Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an ""online debit card"" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this ""online debit card"" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.  Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like ""what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc"" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.  Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.  It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.  It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.    I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...  I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn."	No
"I posted a while ago in the HomeImprovement subreddit about mold in my business, I can provide the link if necessary.  Per their advice, I have been ripping up the carpet, scrubbing as much mold off as possible from the subfloor with a broom/brush, attempting to kill it with bleach, then coating the floor with polyurethene.  I am concerned about my health and the health of my customers, I do not want people breathing in spores while they're in my business.    I contacted my landlord about reimbursing me for the cost of the remediation materials.  (I realize now I should have been more specific.)  They agreed to reimburse me, so I plowed ahead and have spent nearly $1000 on polyurethene.  (The business is 2600 feet, there is a lot of space to cover.)  They sent me less than $400, and when I recently asked for more, I was told that they agreed ""to pay for the section of the floor in need of repair from the water damage, not the entire studio floor.""  I offered to send them photographs of the mold, which has proliferated through a LOT of the space, but I haven't heard back.  (My understanding is that the whole floor NEEDS to be done, because even one surviving spore could render the entire project useless.)  I am furious and I don't know what to do.  It will be difficult for me to afford fixing the rest of the floor myself.  I've thought about threatening to contact the Board of Health, but my lease doesn't end for another 2 years and I want to try to maintain a working relationship with these terrible people.  It's even more enraging to me because the mold wouldn't be an issue if they put any effort into maintaining the property; there is water damage from a leaking pipe in the next space, and my ceiling leaks when it rains because the roof is in terrible condition.    They've said they're going to fix the roof which is good, but I'm also worried about it because their lease places far more responsibility on the tenants than usual, and their practices have driven a lot of my neighbors out, so I may be responsible for an even greater percentage of the common area maintenance than I already am.  I am feeling increasingly trapped by these dishonest people, and any advice would be greatly appreciated."	No
"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.  Last night, I was getting off of work at around 11:30pm.  I received a text from a former HS friend that he was stranded and needed a ride.  I don't hang out with this kid, virtually ever, and I haven't really even spoke to him much as of recent.  In all honesty, since HS really...  But I did run into him over the weekend, which is how we re-touched base and he mentioned to me that he was going through a bit of a rough patch, and to top it all off, didn't have a car because it was in the shop.  He texted me an address, and I figured since I was heading back toward that area it wouldn't help to pick the kid up.  I'm generally a very nice guy, sometimes too nice maybe.  Anyway, not within 45 seconds, as we were pulling away, a cop starts tailing me.  I turned once, and as soon as we approached a stoplight, his sirens go off.  Now initially I was a little confused, I wasn't sure why we were being pulled over.  Immediately my friend to the right of me goes ""aw fuck.""   Apparently, he had some weed on him (not much, 4-5 grams), and ""forgot about it"" until the cop was right behind us with his sirens on.  So, I tried to stay calm.  I figured maybe this was just a fluke, a coincidence; that I had made a rolling stop or whatever.  Well, before I could even think the officer was asking me to step out of my vehicle.  He also KNEW the kid that I was with BY NAME, immediately, and wasn't surprised when he saw him in my car (which makes me realize that he probably saw me pick him up).  Still, I tried to stay collected.  I felt that I personally didn't have anything to hide, and while I was very nervous, I was calm in the fact that if I explained to the officer my situation, I wouldn't be the one in trouble.  Then he informed me that the area in which I picked him up in was one of the ""heavier areas for narcotics trade in the city.""  Immediately my heart sank and I realized that I may have been in some deeper shit than I had imagine.   Well, he asked to search my car.  Initially I told him I felt it wasn't necessary, to which the cop to the next of him IMMEDIATELY rings in the K9 unit.  I have a vast amount of respect for law enforcement.  I have many close friends who are police officers, and my uncle himself was a cop back in the day.  I didn't want them to have to waste their time and resources for this crap, so I changed my response.  I told the officers that after what I had heard about the area in which I picked my friend up, I became a little hesitant as I did not know what my friend had on him.  (I DID not rat him out, I'm not a fucking rat)  So, they searched my car.  My friend was taken out, they searched him too, and found nothing....  Which is when it hit me.  The guy left it in my car.  It took not 45 seconds for the cops to find the baggy in my center console, which apparently is where he left it.  And what do you know after this?  The mother fucker tries to pinpoint it on me, yelling phrases like ""OWN UP TO IT BRO, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MINE"" blah blah blah, just a bunch of bullshit.  I still, stayed collective and said nothing.  I was always told growing up that ""the less you say to cops, the better.""  Well, a few seconds after that, I see him take my friend over to the sidewalk, where they empty the baggy out and crush it into the sidewalk (virtually destroying all evidence they had, which confused me).  He then, walked over, pointed at me and said ""you, get out of here.  Go home.""  I don't know how, or why the cop decided to bless me like he did, but jesus you know I got out of there as fast as I could.  I had a little aftershock about it throughout the day, but all in all I'm just very grateful that there truly are a lot of non-asshole cops out there.    I did, however, receive a call from a private number around 8pm this evening.  I didn't answer, as I was working, and they didn't leave a message (however I think my mailbox may have been full as I'm currently applying to different jobs as I intend to finish school in December).  My question is, is there anyway I can still get into any trouble for what happened?  If the private number WAS indeed the police trying to contact me (for whatever reason), what should I do?    Please help, as I may just be incredibly paranoid.  I just want to make sure that I know I'm in the clear from this so I'm not worrying about it over the course of the next 2 weeks.  Thank you"	No

"I was walking with my friends in a casino when out of nowhere some random guy intentionally strong armed me right in my pregnant belly, knocked all the water I had in my hand over.

"I bought a gun online via an auction. The auction's title, picture and description were for the ""middle model"" of this particular gun style. I was shipped the baseline model, and accepted it at my gun store (called an FFL, you must go to one of these to pick up a gun). This store charges $30 to do all the paperwork so that I could receive the gun (such as a background check). This is great, and completely fair.   When I got home i noticed the gun was not the advertised model. There are very minor differences on the outside of the gun, you would have to break in down and look at the internals to notice the differences. It was like I ordered a V8 mistang, but was shipped a V6, and I had to pay $30 to drive it off the lot.   The shipping store is willing to pay for the gun to be returned, but is not paying the $30 transfer fee I paid to my local gun store. I asked they do pay for it, because it was their mistake they listed the wrong item. The owner confirmed it was their fault that the advertisement was wrong.   Im considering canceling the charge, and telling them to come pick up the gun whenever they want (it is a 2 hour drive for them). Unless they decide to pay back that $30 in addition to the price of the gun.  Basically, I lost money because of their mistake. And they expect me to go out of my way to ship a gun back to them, which I have not done and is probably a little tough to do.   They have also tied up ~$450 of my money due to this. Should I just cancel the charge because I didnt get what I ordered, and make them come get it?"	No
I've been looking for a new apartment and got a look at one of my background checks by Global Verification Network.  In my report, there was a creditor, BANKAMERICA (I'm assuming Bank of America), that I never signed up for and it says that I have almost $5000 in balance.  What's more is that it says that I signed up for it in 2005, when I was like 16, which is impossible because I had no credit then and I distinctly remember only Discover Card accepting me when I was 18.  Should I look into what this is or could Global Verification Network be wrong?  If it is real, what do I do to close it without paying for this $5000 I never spent?  Currently, I have never heard anything about this from Bank of America.	No
"I recently purchased insurance for a year long trip that I'm taking. It was a little unexpected, so I asked my doctor for some prescriptions I have for a pre existing condition and he decided that he would tweak them a bit. This counted as a ""change in medication"" so now I am not covered for my pre existing condition. I'm not too worried, but if I remain stable for sixty days I saw some policies would cover me. I don't want to go without any insurance, so I have purchased emergency medical. But if I want to change companies partway through to get the pre-existing condition covered (about sixty days after I arrive-I know world nomad begins policies when you're already away) can I do that? I know I won't get my money back after the ten day review period, but will they cancel the policy so I can go with another company?"	No
"6/12/17 my roommate called maintenance for a dish washing machine that wasn't draining and smelled like something was burning. I have never personally used the dishwasher here but I understand that I'm still somewhat responsible for it.  6/13/17 3rd party repair guy comes in for 25 minutes noting: ""Ran through cycle OK. Lower rack was in backwards preventing top rack from washing due to spray tower miss aligned. Odor from sitting open not used."" $80 was billed to the land lord which they have passed along to us.  7/3/17 Land Lord received the bill from the 3rd party maintenance.  7/21/17 My land lord typed up a bill for $80 saying we have 10 days to pay or submit a written dispute within 10 days time- the resident accepts responsibility for this bill and must pay immediately. After 10 days Land lord will not accept a dispute letter for review. Per Section XX:   &gt;Material Noncompliance by Tenant Which Can Be Remedied by Repairs, Cleaning, or Replacement. If Tenant commits a material noncompliacne that can be remedied by repair, cleaning, or replacement, Landlord may make the repair, cleaning or replacment, and the itemized bill fro same will be submitted to the Tenant as an obligation that will be due and payable as addiitonal Rent within ten (10) days or as provided in the written notice to Tenant such obligation shall be due as additional Rent payable at the next Rent due date.  7/24/17 Letter post marked   7/29/17 Mail checked by tenant (Me)  Firstly Do I need to submit written dispute by 8/3/17 which is 10 days from the post mark. Or 7/31/17 when the letter is dated?   Secondly the roommate who made the work order months ago has since moved out and another tenant has signed the lease in his place. This is where the bigger issue is, two of the roommates currently on the lease are not legally on the lease until 7/31/17. I would have no problem splitting the bill with the roommate who was on the lease and called in the work order. But since he isn't on the lease as of 7/31/17 he doesn't feel responsible.  My other issue is that the dishwasher still doesn't drain, smells like something is burning, and has hardly been used. I wash my dishes by hand. It cleans them better, uses less water and I hardly use any dishes.   So the dishwasher is still in the same state as it was when the work order was called. If I am paying for something it better damn well be fixed not just inspected.  [Here's the Virginia Law on ""Material Noncompliance""](https://vacode.org/2016/55/13.2/5/55-248.31/)   § 55-248.31  &gt; Noncompliance with rental agreement; monetary penalty &gt;  &gt; A. Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or a violation of § 55-248.16 materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in 21 days, and that the rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice.  &gt;  &gt; B. If the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the tenant adequately remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate.  &gt;  &gt; C. If the tenant commits a breach which is not remediable, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this chapter, when a breach of the tenant’s obligations under this chapter or the rental agreement involves or constitutes a criminal or a willful act, which is not remediable and which poses a threat to health or safety, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement immediately and proceed to obtain possession of the premises. For purposes of this subsection, any illegal drug activity involving a controlled substance, as used or defined by the Drug Control Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.), by the tenant, the tenant’s authorized occupants, or the tenant’s guests or invitees, shall constitute an immediate nonremediable violation for which the landlord may proceed to terminate the tenancy without the necessity of waiting for a conviction of any criminal offense that may arise out of the same actions. In order to obtain an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the tenancy for illegal drug activity or for any other action that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act, the landlord shall prove any such violations by a preponderance of the evidence. However, where the illegal drug activity is engaged in by a tenant’s authorized occupants, or guests or invitees, the tenant shall be presumed to have knowledge of such illegal drug activity unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The initial hearing on the landlord’s action for immediate possession of the premises shall be held within 15 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant; however, the court shall order an earlier hearing when emergency conditions are alleged to exist upon the premises which constitute an immediate threat to the health or safety of the other tenants. After the initial hearing, if the matter is scheduled for a subsequent hearing or for a contested trial, the court, to the extent practicable, shall order that the matter be given priority on the court’s docket. Such subsequent hearing or contested trial shall be heard no later than 30 days from the date of service on the tenant. During the interim period between the date of the initial hearing and the date of any subsequent hearing or contested trial, the court may afford any further remedy or relief as is necessary to protect the interests of parties to the proceeding or the interests of any other tenant residing on the premises. Failure by the court to hold either of the hearings within the time limits set out herein shall not be a basis for dismissal of the case.  &gt;  &gt; D. If the tenant is a victim of family abuse as defined in § 16.1-228 that occurred in the dwelling unit or on the premises and the perpetrator is barred from the dwelling unit pursuant to § 55-248.31:01 based upon information provided by the tenant to the landlord, or by a protective order from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-279.1, or subsection B of § 20-103, the lease shall not terminate due solely to an act of family abuse against the tenant. However, these provisions shall not be applicable if (i) the tenant fails to provide written documentation corroborating the tenant’s status as a victim of family abuse and the exclusion from the dwelling unit of the perpetrator no later than 21 days from the alleged offense or (ii) the perpetrator returns to the dwelling unit or the premises, in violation of a bar notice, and the tenant fails promptly to notify the landlord within 24 hours thereafter that the perpetrator has returned to the dwelling unit or the premises, unless the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant had no actual knowledge that the perpetrator violated the bar notice, or it was not possible for the tenant to notify the landlord within 24 hours, in which case the tenant shall promptly notify the landlord, but in no event more than 7 days thereafter. If the provisions of this subsection are not applicable, the tenant shall remain responsible for the acts of the other co-tenants, authorized occupants or guests or invitees pursuant to § 55-248.16, and is subject to termination of the tenancy pursuant to the lease and this chapter.  &gt;  &gt; E. If the tenant has been served with a prior written notice which required the tenant to remedy a breach, and the tenant remedied such breach, where the tenant intentionally commits a subsequent breach of a like nature as the prior breach, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the subsequent breach, make reference to the prior breach of a like nature, and state that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice.  &gt;  &gt; F. If rent is unpaid when due, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment, and of the landlord’s intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55-248.35. If a check for rent is delivered to the landlord drawn on an account with insufficient funds, or if an electronic funds transfer has been rejected because of insufficient funds or a stop-payment order has been placed in bad faith by the authorizing party, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment and of the landlord’s intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid by cash, cashier’s check, certified check, or a completed electronic funds transfer within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55-248.35.

Hello everyone,  I am moving into my first apartment this fall near my University.  I signed a lease for a two bedroom apartment with my boyfriend last November.  On the lease it says that we can move in on August 19th.  Every other apartment complex we've heard of in this town, including his current apartment, ends their lease on July 31st and begins the following year's lease on August 1st.  This lease has us move in on August 19th and move out on July 31st.  While this is frustrating because he is without an apartment for the first part of August, we understand that we screwed up and signed for a later date.  The landlord wants the cost of an entire month, $569, due on August 1st even though we are only allowed to begin moving in on the 19th.  We have asked them to move in earlier since we are already paying the cost of a month and nobody will be in the apartment, but they have said no.  My parents think this is illegal.  Is it actually illegal?  This is in Iowa. Thank you!	No
Hi r/legaladvice,  When I was 11 y/o I moved to Aurora, Colorado from my home country in Europe. When I was 12, I found a friend in the neighborhood (let's call him Sean, 15 y/o at this point) through my brother (let's call him Edward, 10 y/o at this point) and started hanging out with him. I was culture-shocked and very shy, so I latched on to Sean as my only friend outside of my 4 brothers. Within the first year of hanging out with him, both Edward and I were bullied by him nearly constantly because of a plethora of things 'wrong' or 'weird' about us, usually to reinforce how he was better than us. This escalated to forcing us to get into fights with him, he'd tell us it was what normal kids did, and we'd go along. Since he was so much older than us, he'd just end up beating us up, then laughing and calling us names. Edward quickly got sick of Sean and after failed attempts to talk with him about his attitude, stopped hanging out with us. I was happy when he stopped, because I hated listening to him cry at night about his weight, Sean's favorite part to pick about him. I knew this was the right thing to do, but I kept hanging out with Sean because I felt like he was sad as an only child, and it was my duty to be his friend.  This is when everything Sean used to do started to escalate. Verbal abuse got worse, play-fighting grew into routine punches in my gut, and more things started to develop. As an example, while playing runescape at his house, I started talking with a friend from my childhood. Sean added him without me knowing, and started talking with him. The next day, he showed me screenshots of what my friend had said about me during their conversation on Skype, about how I was oversensitive, annoying, the such. He refused to show me his side of anything he said, and told me I had no friends other than him and that no one loved me, that I was lucky he put up with me. He also found out through my old 'friend' a long-time crush I had been holding, pulled up a photo of her on Facebook and continuously mocked me for liking a girl, telling me no girl'd ever love me, etc.  Later on came the worst parts of my time with him. He'd make fun of me for not knowing about sex or watching porn at 12-13 y/o, so he occasionally would bring it up on his phone and make me watch it, regardless of how many times I'd say no or try to walk away. Then, he would take off his pants and masturbate in front of me, then ejaculate on his couch in the basement, or on the walls. Several times I would run away from him through his house while he was peeing, until he'd corner me and pee on me while laughing. During sleepovers, I wouldn't be given blankets and would try to fit myself on the carpet where there weren't stains from his many ejaculations. Through continuous grooming, he forced me to pull down my pants, and would mock me. A couple of times, he slapped my genital while laughing about it.  There are so, so many more things that happened. He'd lock me in the bathroom, turn off the lights and hold the door because he knew I was terrified to be in there. He'd quickly cover up any of my brothers coming to hang out with us, even would hang up my skype calls from his basement with them. He'd come to my house and very respectfully chat with my parents and ask if I was able to hang out today, my parents were always very impressed by him. Several times while I was home alone, I would hear the door ring and run to hide under my brother's beds. I would hear him come around the house to try every door and look through the windows, then leave. I was constantly terrified of him.  Around two years after the worse of this started, my family moved to Parker, Colorado (30m drive) because of work. By this time, Sean was around 18 y/o. I burned every bridge of communication I had with him, finally being able to escape him without having to face him. Around a year after moving, he came unannounced to my house and asked my parents for me. My parents yelled at me for hiding in the basement when my 'best friend' was here to see me. He came back a few times after that, but I gave him the least amount of attention I could everytime he'd come, and he ended up leaving me alone. I haven't talked to him since.  I'm now nearly 20, and bought myself 6 therapy sessions a few months ago, which has helped a ton with how to cope with PTSD, and many other mental problems I deal with daily. For the record, I Do have a girlfriend! Of 2 years who pushed and supported me to get therapy, and has helped me so much through this. I have a dream job out of college and am finally tasting life again. My therapist strongly believes Sean might be a psychopath, and through experience thinks Sean may have abused other people before, after, or is abusing someone now. He brought up the idea of legal action to me, and I'm trying to find out more about it. I'd like to do something against Sean, because I want him to be finally be responsible for something, and pay for the wrong he did. I don't want anyone else to be abused by him, and feel like I could be the starting stone to make more people come out about him.  So my questions are these:  - What are my next steps, and what am I expecting (should this be a lawsuit, or trying to get him registered as a sex offender? I'm not sure how this works)? - As a greencard holder in the U.S., what can or can't I do? - Am I at risk to somekind of a turn-around in legal actions by him once this starts?  Thanks for reading this far! I'm very open to answering Any question about him, myself, or anything that happened.  Thank you so much for helping.	No
"I am sorry in advance if this is long  3.5 years ago I had some issues where I woke up and wasn't able to move my joints, this was accompanied by large lumps on my legs. I was 24 years old (Female). I was referred to a dermatologist as they thought I had Erythema nodosum. Over a month or so I was doing tons of blood work and seeing this dermatologist anywhere from 1-3 times a week. I was constantly being told it was something else and being put on new medication. During this month I was also referred to a rheumatologist. Rheumatology and dermatology had a big meeting (?) where there were roughly 50 specialists of different levels in a room (I dont know what its called) to discuss my case because it was extremely rare. I was diagnosed with something called ""polyarteritis nodosa"" which is a rare form of vasculitis. My dermatologist called me with great news that they finally new what it was and then prescribed me.. prednisone (a oral steroid). I was given it for 6 weeks. Over this 6 weeks I started experiencing dehydration, frequent urination, some weightloss, extreme fatigue. I made appointments and saw him on numerous occasions because I felt that this should not be happening and something felt very wrong. He assured me it was just side effects and would send me on my way. At the end of the 6 weeks he essentially told me I was good to go and that I shouldn't have any more flare ups. Roughly a week later I started seeing lumps on my legs again and quickly made an appointment. Without questions, blood work, anything, he prescribed me another 6 weeks of prednisone. He told me he absolutely did not want to see me for 6 weeks and to not come back in. I started taking it and within a day or two all the side effects came back.. and they only got worse. I started losing lumps of hair, losing drastic weight and started blacking out. I would leave class ( I was a student at the time) and then wake up on a couch in the hall 4 hours later. I had lost roughly 35 lbs which was essentially all muscle. I am overweight and always have been.. my legs were the size that someones upper arm should be. I started barely being able to walk because my body wanted to collapse. After 3 weeks I made an appointment. The first thing the doctor said to me was ""I said I didn't want to see you for 6 weeks"".  I started crying and told him something was very wrong. Then he said ""I think you have type 2 diabetes because you are so overweight"".  This came from a doctor that ran 15+ blood tests on me months prior. He sent me for blood work that day and I got a call from the emergency room.  My sugar levels were at 29 mmol/L (540mg/dl). I was kept in the hospital that night and had an IV of fluids going through me. The nurse I had was talking to me and was very confused as to why the doctor put me on prednisone. She went and spent some time reviewing my file. She came back and told me that before the steroids my blood sugar levels were completely normal. She told me that in that meeting with all the doctors.. every single doctor recommended he NOT put me on prednisone because of the risk of type 2 diabetes (Due to the fact that im over weight). I am in the process of retrieving all my files from the hospital. I recently moved out of Ontario to Alberta. My diabetes are pretty controlled but this is still something that will effect me for my entire life. I know it has been 3.5 years but at the time I had no energy to think of anything to do with legal, I was also a student. Now that I am in my career and still need to see numerous doctors on a regular basis I am starting to realize how much what he did has effected my life and will continue to do so. I pay for medications that I should have never needed if it wasn't for him. Although being overweight I am and extremely active, healthy person. I always have been. I played soccer for 18 years, basketball for 5. I was a bike messenger riding 60-70km daily before moving to alberta.. this should have never happened. I need to know if it is worth it to go and talk to a lawyer.   Tl;DR  - a doctor gave me a medication against the advice of roughly 50 other doctors that resulted in me developing type 2 diabetes despite me showing all signs of type 2 and him ignoring. Do I go to a lawyer?"	No
"I toured the model (a 2x2) at these apartments in Jacksonville.  It looked great so I signed the lease.  The actual apartment was not available for rent because someone was still living in it.  I just picked up the keys today and the actual unit is gross.  The carpet is mismatched pieces put together.  The front door can be pushed open a couple inches when its locked.  The place is not at all in the condition that I was shown in the model and the price they are charging for something so dumpy is rediculous.  I talked to the office staff and they said that since I technically ""moved in"" by picking up the keys, that I have to abide by the lease.  This means giving them 60 days notice and paying an additional 2 months rent.  Obviously this is ridiculous.  The apartment is definitely not dealing in good faith.  What can I do to get out of this?"	No
"Hello /r/LegalAdvice,  I recently won a trademark infringement suit against someone... however, mind you he was a college student when I sued...

Our landlord scheduled for exterior brick work to be done on the apartment I live in and work started before we were notified and able to remove personal property from our balcony, resulting in concrete dust covering our edible plants making them inedible (at least $500 in herb, tomato, other veggie plants [purchase price of plants not potential price of grown produce, not including labor cost in care]) as well as damaging furniture on the balcony that can't be washed. Landlord says that they are not liable at all, and that renter's insurance is our only option (which I do have, more than enough to cover damages). Is the landlord responsible to compensate for damages? How about the dust that got into our apartment since the windows were open and we were gone without any advance notification of the work starting? Do we have a case for compensation with that part of our property being completely unusable? Any case for health damages for inhalation of concrete/brick dust?  Long story short- we were notified about the work after the damage is done. Are we responsible to cover the damages or do we have a case for compensation for property, cleanliness, and/or health?  Live in North Dakota if that is relevant for laws or anything. Thanks!	No
"I'm currently looking to change my name, and am unsure where to apply for a name change. If I want my degree to have my preferred name, I need to change my legal name as soon as possible.  My permanent address is in Illinois, where I grew up, but I go to college for a significant amount of the year in Utah. My driver's license is an Illinois license, if that is relevant.  Utah reports that I must ""Live in the county where the name change petition will be filed for at least one year before filing."" [Illinois](http://www.illinoiscourts.gov/Forms/approved/name_change/Name_Change_Suite_Approved.pdf) reports that I must ""Have lived in Illinois for at least 6 months"".  A big worry here is the wording. I lived in Illinois for most of my life, and I have been at college at Utah for more than a year. However, I haven't lived in Illinois for a contiguous six months recently. I have lived in Utah for more than one year total, but have not ever lived there for a contiguous year.  I'm not worried about court filing fees, but the logistics of court dates aligning worries me about filing in Illinois.  What would be my best course of action? Am I eligible to change my name in Utah? Should I change it there or stay with Illinois? Is there an advantage to having a court order in one versus the other? I will be in Illinois for a short time in a few weeks, where I could do any sort of court visits, and then court visits for Thanksgiving, etc. are definitely possible. I will also be in Utah for most of the upcoming semester."	No
[Original](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6ltnlk/alms_child_endangerment_case_trying_to_obtain/)  We contacted a MS lawyer and CPS. The lawyer basically said that unless both parents agree to sign over custody, that it would be a long drawn-out battle, and we still probably wouldn't be able to get custody unless we could prove both parents were unfit. We contacted the father and offered to take over custody if he needs us to, but we will support him regardless. He was appreciative, but wants to do it on his own. The b/f who did all this has been arrested, and charges are pending against the mother. CPS knows about the issues with the father and is keeping a very close eye on his actions for the next 30 days. The CPS agent I talked to first is keeping close contact with us in case things go south with the father. We're just glad the child is doing much better and the people who abused him have been arrested.	No
"My landlord is deceptive:  1. His rent ad on the Internet said the rent is 425-400, and the deposit 250.  2. When I visited him to see the room, he said the better room (of the two that he had up for rent) is 435 (the inferior one being 425).  3. Next day I decided to rent the better room (435). But he said it's not 435 but 475. Plus, he demanded 300 dollars of security deposit. (Should probably mention that I have no pet so the deposit I payed does not include any ""pet deposit"" or whatsoever.) We argued and I ended up paying him 445 for rent and 300 for deposit. I got receipts for both the deposit and rent.  4. Later I found out that the security deposit must be no more than one half of the rent. Which means 445/2 = 222.5, not 300.  5. When I was demanding receipts for the deposit and rent, he was very reluctant and hesitant to write me them, saying he operates his transactions based on ""trust"". I'm very naive and inexperienced in life and this is actually my first time renting my own room, and he probably smelled my gullibility. Anyway, I ended up getting him write the receipts for the two.  We did not write any contract, just so you know.  Today (Aug 3) is the start date as well as move-in date of my month-to-month tenancy. I wanna give him notice to end my tenancy in a month (Sep 3) today because I cannot trust this guy. Do I have to get his agreement in order for my notice to be effective?  Also, it would be ideal if I can end the tenancy immediately today based on his deceptive overcharging of deposit. Would that be possible?"	No
"Family lawyers of Reddit (or anyone that can help or advise.). I was in a relationship with a Spanish girl 5 years ago, I am in the UK, she became pregnant almost immediately or so I thought. When we went for a scan they said the she was 12 weeks pregnant but I had only known her for 9 weeks. Things soon started to fall apart between but obviously I wanted to find out if I had a child and obviously to be there for it and support it. Despite several attempts by myself and family members to get her to agree to a paternity test she flat out refused and ultimately asked me to leave her alone. A lawyer at the time said you would be surprised how often this happens and we all assumed that there was a high chance that the child isn't mine. 5 years later, this week she gets in touch with me. Saying we need to speak about our daughter. I of course reply and ask if she is now willing to consent to the paternity test, she agrees initially. I start to organize it with her between the two countries. Then she starts to flip out, saying that I will doctor the results so that it is negative (not something I would ever do I just want an answer and to be there for my child if they are mine). She then starts the familiar insults and randomness of old. ""Maybe it's better if we don't have proof."" ""She looks like you."" ""I will tell her you want nothing to do with her."" I repeatedly ask her if she will consent to the paternity test to which I get a no, a maybe, you haven't asked about her or for more photos (a route I'm trying not go down until I know and I think that she's trying to trap me emotionally) and then I ask one last time urging her to think about the child and not her pride and to drop the insults and negativity and I get no reply, it's been about 7 hours. Now yes it certainly looks like she's not sure if I'm the father, maybe knows that I'm not or has something else to hide. But ultimately I just want to know, what actions can I take, if any, as a potential father to get a paternity test agreed to or enforced. How would me being in the UK and mother and child in Spain make this more difficult? Thank you in advance for your comments and help."	No
"Some background information: So my mother and father are currently going through a divorce. I'm legally an adult (18+) while my younger brother is a minor (Under 18). My father recently moved out of the house because of this divorce and is currently living in Chicago. My mother, who had been previously diagnosed with a personality disorder, left the house for 3 days without a word to me or my brother on when or whether she would be coming back or not. During day 2, we broke down the door to the house's office room in order to get more information or maybe a hint on her whereabouts. The actual act of kicking down the door was committed by my younger brother but I witnessed it and did not try to stop him. She is now trying to take me to court for ""convincing"" my brother to kick down the door. I don't think she has any legal standing as the house is under my dad's name and he pays for all the bills because my mother has been unemployed for years now. My dad understands my side of the story and doesn't care for the damage done. Can she really do anything or is she just trying to scare me and play mind games? I am now living with my dad in the city during summer break from college to get out of the house but my brother is stuck with her because he's still got a year left of high school back home.  Some other stuff she has done to me I think I can use against her to file a ""counterclaim"" (don't know if I'm using that word right) or just in general is: 1) Logged into my newly opened bank account (which was only suppose to be under my name) and taken $5,000 from my savings and tried transferring it into her personal bank account. I, foolishly, used an old username and password from a previous joint account with her when I was a minor to open the new one. She used that previous information to log into my new account and tried to steal my money. I called the bank and reversed it but I would still consider that some form of identity theft, right? 2) She has been constantly berating and belittling me over text message (calling me names, using every swear in the book, threatening me, etc.) for a little under a month now. I don't want to block her as I think I can use this as evidence as some form of abuse, correct? Yes, I find it very disturbing and am deeply saddened that my own mother thinks I'm worthless simply because I refuse to take sides in the divorce.   More info on her mental issues: She has obviously had this Personality Disorder for a while now and during my childhood would constantly go through bouts of yelling at me and my brother and acting like a normal mother. She use to see a therapist but I'm not sure how often she attends appointments now. I think the stress of the divorce accelerated/intensified this disorder as the abusive text messages have gotten more frequent. I've even come home one night (in the old house) to see dozens of holes in the wall across different rooms of the house which was very creepy to say the least.  Thank you in advance for all the help."	No
I recently moved in to a rental house site unseen. I saw another house in the complex instead and everything seemed fine. Upon moving in we discovered the house in poor condition, not like advertised. The dishwasher leaked, the refrigerator went out and we lost $50 worth of food, the toilet doesn't flush, the cabinets are falling apart, and nothing was cleaned like they said it would be. It was disgusting. We've had maintenance out multiple times to fix issues. Eventually the landlord told us that he'd give us the deposit back if we're out by the end of the month. Since offering this, we've discovered fire code violations (the fuse box is in a clothes closet blocked by a shelf that's screwed to the wall).   Do I have a case for getting any rent money back? What about the value of the food we lost? We're trying to move out asap, but it's hard to afford rent twice in one month.	No
"Hi everyone. My 3 roommates and I sublet 2 rooms in an NYC apartment. Our ""landlord""/roommate agreed to renew our lease until the end of the year. We do not have this documented, only in a Facebook message. Our current lease ends on August 20th. On Monday, while he is in Russia, he sent us a Facebook message basically saying he may not renew his lease at this apartment and we may all have to move out by the end of the month. He did not give a reason other than that he is involved in court case currently and depending on how that goes he will either move or stay. We then came to find out he was or is being sued by the official landlord of the apartment. We aren't sure, though, if that is the case he is currently involved in. Our rent was due yesterday and we did not pay it. We didn't pay it because we need money to put towards our new apartment and he has a significant security deposit from the three of us. Also, he revealed he put our security deposit directly into his PERSONAL bank account, not into a separate one, which is what the law calls for I believe. He is now insisting we pay our rent saying he can't take it from the security deposit. We are not sure what to do about this situation or what our options are. He is still in Russia and should return by the 10th to appear in court. Thanks for any advice you can offer."	No
My roommate and I live in a duplex with a lower and upper unit. We live in the upper unit and part of our lease agreement is taking care of the yard. We turned the sprinkler on in the evening and unfortunately forgot about it and it ran overnight. I just got an email from my landlord saying that we are being charged for having a handyman to remove water from the neighbor's carpet below us and that it is due to the water hose being on overnight. Is this something that is our responsibility to pay for? It seems to me that they have issues with the plumbing and it really isn't our fault. 	No
I stole 2 packs of 9volt batteries, got caught, now i'm doing the Crime Accountability Program. This will cost me a total of $425.00USD but i avoid police and nothing will show up on my record.   My question is, since I was told i won't go to jail for this even if cops are called, if it would be cheaper to go to court and plead guilty? The fine is only $75.00, but the fee from C.A.P is $350.00. What should I do? I feel like a complete dumbass over this. No idea what I was even thinking.	No
"I'll try to make this short.  A notoriously crooked landlord leased a property to me that was being remodeled for foundation and roofing purposes.  Contract states that the lease started on June 1st which is the day the landlord said the construction would be finished, and we are to pay rent at the first of every month of course. The property has not floor in two of the rooms and some of the roof is missing.  City wrote a notice to landlord to seize all construction for the absence of permits that were require to do construction, which I later found out that the landlord was notified of that about a month prior to leading me the property.  Three days after the lease was to begin I saw absolutely no progress made on the house, and had no way of moving in. He never even gave me keys after he told me the keys would be in a locked compartment in the house. So I called the landlord numerous times with voicemails and of course he never answered. So I knew I was going to have to take legal action.  I sent a certified return receipt letter to his office about a week and a half to two weeks after the lease was suppose to start stating that he breached contract, refuse to communicate with me and that I wanted all of my money back, fully expecting him not to answer or acknowledge anything. Upon doing research at this point, the landlord had been arrested a few times, was notorious for making crooked deals like this with many tenants and then screwing them over, and had been on the news a time or two for the attention he was getting. It was so bad that there is a Facebook group dedicated to putting a stop to this POS since he continues to do this to more people everyday.  I filed a lawsuit about two weeks after that, which was the same day I went to check the property once more seeing that still nothing had been done, and when he was served the process from the court the landlord finally called me. Landlord was shocked and suddenly so accommodating and was offering to settle since he thought it was ""unnecessary"" to bring this matter to court. I told him the parameters on which we were to settle on and then asked me to email him what he owed me. So I did and stated that he should have a check/money order mailed in five to six days by noon on the sixthish day and upon cashing in the check I would gen drop the suit and we would go our separate ways. He never replied of course, so I called him a few times those following days. No answer, but I didn't trust to settle out of court with a crooked guy like this. I texted the landlord lord on the due date of the settlement saying that if he still wants to settle I will be happy to come by his office so he can write me a check or I would see him in court, and he replied with ""busy today"".  So I then had the idea of getting him on record via phone call, knowing he had more crooked dealing to serve me and proceeded to call a few days after he texted me until he answer. I called once a day from three more days and on the third day, he returned my called. So I pressed record.  Landlord told me that I made it difficult to settle with all of my demands and due dates and said that his lawyer looked the email over and said ""we can win this no problem"". I laughed because he was obviously trying to scare me and then asked ""what is there for you to win? You've already taken about 4 thousand dollars from me thus far. What is there left?"" He said if i took 500 dollars off that amount then he would write a check for me and the suit will be dropped. He followed with, ""If the check bounced or anything then you have full recourse. My lawyer will set all of this up, but you have to take 500 dollars off for my lawyer fee."" Of course I said no way in hell knowing that the damages I was suing for were more than what I had already paid and he followed with ""you know this isn't going to be a short process suing me right? It'll take 5-6months, because it isn't just an eviction process. In fact, I can actually file an eviction against you and then put it on your credit record."" That set me off because of course I never lived there. I proceeded to curse him and told him to go ahead and evict me because I never lived in the property and the property itself is proof that no one could have lived there and that he'll have to lawyer up big time if he's going to take it that direction.   He hung up.  So I have that on record now but as far as suing and what to expect, that's my main concern. What am I getting myself into?"	No
So two years ago my fiance was attending a university in New Hampshire and she received health insurance through the university. After a year she took a leave of absence and moved to California for a job. She received health insurance through her job in California. The university did not cancel her insurance in New Hampshire, so she submitted a form to the insurance company in December 2016 to waive the insurance in New Hampshire and the waiver was refused. She repeatedly reached out to the insurance for several months to sort out why they would not cancel her insurance and she's now finding out (through the university, which has done nothing to alleviate the problem) that there were claims submitted in January, February, and March of 2017. Being in California she couldn't have used the New Hampshire insurance since it was only accepted at the university's medical network. She has proof that she was clocked in at work in California for the times associated with the claims.   The university states that all students (even those on a leave of absence must have health insurance that meets their requirements). Her leave of absence ended a month ago.   I've already read through the [FTC's medical identity theft](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0171-medical-identity-theft) page and plan to follow the instructions there. Is there anything else that we can do to solve this? What would be the best way to get the insurance cancelled?	No
"We have a small ""buffer"" between my fence and the fence separating my house from the 2 half lots beside me. Neighbor informed me he was paying to have the trees cut and brush cleared from that area. I'm not 100 percent sure, but the ""buffer"" may belong to me. I like the trees as they mostly block the 2 houses I could see from my back porch, he does not and says the city will issue a citation to have the area cleared. We have only been here a few months, so I can't verify that information as accurate or not.  Also, first reddit post. Correct me if I've made some formatting errors.  Thanks"	No
"I am a renter in Pasadena, CA. I am currently on a month-to-month lease. On July 18 I gave notice that I was vacating on August 20 [my lease asks that I give 30 days notice], but I accidentally paid for my full August rent. When I asked my landlord to return the last 11 days of rent he said that he is ""not going to be able to offer a prorate for an early move out.""  Am I entitled to the return of my last 11 days rent? If so, what California statute can I point out to him?"	No
I'm self representing right now. My ex got an attorney and asked for a continuance. He was arrested but not charged since it was his first physical, and an apparent minor, offense. I have over 70 pages attached to the restraining order detailing the abuse, however, and the statement I wrote that I was going to say today included more dates of verbal abuse and threats.   I have a few questions.   My local DV legal aid may not be able to represent me due to having so many other cases, but I'm not in the financial situation to get a lawyer otherwise. I have called a few places to see their rates but I'm pretty sure it won't be possible. I'm also 32 weeks pregnant right now, 35 weeks when we go back.   So, my questions are:  - What should I do in order to be completely prepared for what this might consist of if I cannot find an attorney to represent me?   - I've googled and googled and googled. It seems honestly hopeless, but are there other organizations that can help me? (Trying not to name drop. It rhymes with Steve.)   - What should I expect from his attorney, if anything?  - His lawyer offered me a stipulation of a 6m-1y temporary restraining order. I've heard it's not wise to take it. Why?  Thank you in advance.	No
My friend's parents are finally getting a divorce. The wife has been abusive of her husband/her kids for a long time, and the husband is finally going to file. However, my friend just told me that they're going to be settling in court since the wife refuses to agree to terms.   Most importantly, she wants her soon to be ex-husband to keep paying her money so she can continue to live in her house (the husband will move out once the divorce is final). My friend is concerned that she'll get the money because she'll claim that she was abused by her husband. My question is, is she legally allowed to do this, considering her children are over 18? (My friend still lives with her mother.) Regardless of the legality, is the judge likely to award her money? I want to reassure my friend/offer her courses of action she can take, but I have practically no knowledge of law.	No
Hello legaladvice! This is my first post here so bare with me.  In April me and 4 friends signed an apartment lease for September. Last week we got emails saying that another property management group had taken over our building.   That was fine but the problem arose today when we got an email saying that our unit was actually double booked and the people living there have renewed their lease. They failed to mention this to us when we signed the lease.   Our issue is that the they want to move us into another unit in the same building while paying the same rent but our room sizes are significantly smaller. Can we do anything about this?  All help is appreciated. Thanks.	No
Not sure if this is the right place to post this, but I'm just looking for some quick advice. Yesterday, I got pulled over in Crownpoint, Indiana for going 104 in a 70.(Yes, I know it was stupid and I learned my lesson). The officer that pulled me over said he was only going to give me a ticket instead of something worse. I'm just wondering how much the ticket would be since I have to wait four to six weeks. Also, since this is my very first offense, does it lower the price or anything? Don't know if this means anything, but I admitted fault to the officer and told him I was in the wrong. (I guess that's why I got off with just a ticket and not a misdemeanor or anything.) Thanks in advance.	No
Multiple months ago my fiancee and I signed a lease with our landlord to move to a different duplex to live without roommates. Today they called to say the family where we are supposed to move to hasn't moved out. They thought the lease ended in December. They are trying to get us to move to much shitier apartments at a unreasonable rent for them inconviencing us. They have already leased our current place to others. What do we do? They are now offering we move to the apartment for a month while they try to evict the people in what was supposed to be our new place. What should we do?	No
"I moved out of a rental property recently that had a $200 security deposit.  At the time of move out I had accidentally left a wall sticker up (think the same kind that say things like ""live love laugh""). This sticker had recently been in another friends apartment (in the same building) and we took it down we he moved out and applied it to my apartment with no problem.   After move out I was hit with a $150 charge for ""damage caused to the wall"" as a result of the sticker.  The apartment said that the sticker removed the texture from the wall and professionals had to come to fix it.  I know this is impossible because I removed the sticker from my friends apartment once with no problem and reapplied it without any additional adhesive.    I have asked the apartment complex for photos of the damage but they don't have any.  They are charging me an extra sum on top of my security deposit as a result of this ""damage"".    Because they cannot show proof of this damage I feel like this is a unverified debt, but where do I stand legally?"	No
"I'm not sure exactly how to proceed. My question is in Okaloosa County, Florida.  tl;dr - If the lease is expired, the tenant has moved everything but a few things, but has not returned the keys, and is ignoring call calls/texts, can I legally change the locks and begin prepping the home for a new tenant?  ---  The stage this eviction is at: on Aug 2/3, I could ask for a writ of possession.  On July 27th, I was notified by the tenant that she was moving out and returning the keys on July 28th. I drove by several times on July 28th and witnessed a U-Haul with people actively moving things out. She didn't, however, return the keys. I contacted her asking for the keys and she just ignored my calls/texts. On July 29th, I rode back over to the house to knock on the door and see if she was there. Nobody was home. I could smell something burning so pursuant to our lease, I entered the property without notice because I reasonably believed something to be on fire. Fortunately, nothing was on fire. While I was in there, I did notice that there was virtually nothing in the house besides some food in the fridge (it looked like junk, possibly rotten), a bag, a hammer, and some larger plastic child's toys in the back. It seemed clear to me that she was not returning and what was left was on me to clean. No problem.  I did not hear from her July 30th nor would she return my calls/texts. I decided that the house is now vacant, she is clearly not living there. I asked my local police department if I could change the locks without keys even if she moved. They advised me that I could not, but if I wait until August 1, I could because there is no longer a lease and she is no longer living there. Whether they are right or wrong, I feel like I need to take caution because police deal with criminal stuff and me getting sued would be civil.  On July 31st (today), I received a text that she was heading back to the house to clean up and she would text me in the afternoon letting me know she was done. This communication came to my surprise. I rode by my house again and the fence door was open, one of the child's toys was removed, the trash was rolled out to the street, and some garbage was in the driveway. She was definitely there today. She did not notify me in the afternoon like she said she would so I asked her if she was officially out and when can I retrieve the keys. She simply replied ""no"" and is not returning my texts/calls now.  Tomorrow is August 1st and I'm now not sure if I should be changing the locks. If I go by the police advice, I can change the locks with impunity. If I go by the vague letter of the law, I have to get her to acknowledge she is out and return the keys (preferably both).  Based on my understand of the law (which is probably wrong or inaccurate), I have two options:  #1. Change the locks, hope for the best, and if it ever came to it, argue to the courts that she had ""surrendered"" the property by way of moving out and the lease expiring.  #2. Wait the rest of the week to follow through with the writ of possession."	No
I am not from Virginia but I was pulled over while moving from Philadelphia to Atlanta. The officer said I was clocked at going 93 in a 70 zone so it was automatically a reckless driving charge and I had to appear in court. I didn't realize at the time but apparently Virginia is the worst place to get pulled over for speeding. This is my first offense, Ive never even gotten a ticket before. So my question is how do I prepare for this? Do I need to hire a lawyer? I do not have a lot of money but law offices have been sending me letters saying they could represent me. I looked online and apparently you can do jail time for this and I'm pretty young and don't want this to ruin my life. I tried to do some research but it seemed like a lot of lawyers trying to scare people into hiring them and it worked a little on me. Pretty much I have no idea what to do please help!	No
"On my lease it states ""Resident shall keep all gardens, lawns, trees and shrubbery upon the property neatly trimmed, watered and free of all weeds.  Lawn must be fertilized and weed controlled. Pest and insect control is at Residents expense. The grounds during May - September will be maintained by the Landlord who will hire a crew of their choice and will charge the Resident $45 per week, for a total of $180  rent  increase during those months. The increase is considered rent."" The first violation came in after May when they were suppose to start taking care of the grounds, to which we made an agreement that we would take care of everything right then and after that it was their problem. Now they gave us another citation stating ""The flower beds in the front and the back need to be weeded, as well as the planning ring in the back yard The lawn needs to have fertilizer applied to get rid of the weeds in the lawn, professional or you can do it The back area in the back half of the yard is your responsibility. It needs to be cleared of any and all weeds. The grass does not grow in that area and needs to be maintained weed free. The lawn company maintains the grass growing lawn part. The yard is so big after they mow, edge and blow off everything for that area there is no money left over for other yard work such as weeding, raking, fertilizing, ect. This is your responsibility.""  This is clearly against our lease."	No
Hey guys,  first of all I should say this is happening in Belgium.  My dad, after losing my mom and my sister, recently decided to move and build himself a new place, he picked a place mostly for the view in a remote village here in Belgium. Now the neighbouring farm started making plans for a giant metal barn right across the whole damn place 50 meters long, they're known to be intentionally mean here amongst locals, they told my dad it was gonna be placed in a way that would block the view much, that we would only see the width of it. Now the building permit got accepted and my dad could finally check it (he couldn't before) and it's the whole damn length of the thing, 50 meters long, right across the field. Now that the permit got accepted, we can't apparently do anything or at least that's what I'm told, on top of that in Belgium they generally let farmers build anything anywhere without much of a question's asked. These people have a lot (a lot!) of land and could place that barn virtually anywhere (including places where it wouldn't bother anyone obviously), they intentionally misguided for months my 70 year old dad and he's too nice to do anything. Is there *any* angle I could approach? This makes me sick in my stomach for him, he's just a nice old guy who wants to spend the rest of his life peacefully.  Thank you.	No

"I have been in between apartments for 5 days. I'm staying with my mom in another town and everything I own is in storage units. My roommates and I were set to move in tomorrow so we can get settled and back to work. Today, halfway through the day, we learn there is a flea infestation that will take at least a couple weeks to clean. They are offering to let us stay in another of their units in town but they will not adjust the rent to what we had agreed to pay for the original apartment. It was very difficult to find a good location that was within our budget in this town so there aren't many other options and they won't help us pay to move an additional time. They are offering to ""let"" us break the lease and walk away but it feels like that is giving up all my rights when we agreed to this lease back in March. Am I just out of luck here or do they owe us something more?  I'm willing to provide any more details needed but I'm desperate for any advice at all. Thanks in advance all."	No
"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	No
"This is a very long story but I will try to make it as simple as possible.   My husband is being asked to speak to a detective in a case against his brother ""Joe"".  We don't live near Joe, but another sibling does and is on Joe side saying that everything his ex-wife is saying is untrue.  Basically Joe is accused of molesting his five year old daughter. Supposedly, according to his ex-wife he has already lost custody of his daughter, but the court hasn't decided what will happen to their son.   When my husband was a little boy Joe molested him, and even though that's all in the past now, Joe's ex-wife is asking my husband to speak to a detective about it because she thinks it could help her case.  The problem is we don't know who's telling the truth. Joe says the court didn't take his daughter away, that it's a pending investigation, and his daughter was coached to say the things she did. According to his ex-wife she's worried that he'll molest their son too, but because he isn't  a named victim at this time the court might not take away parental visits.  My husband's having a hard time deciding what to do, because if Joe's ex-wife is telling the truth he wants to help protect his nephew. But if Joe is telling the truth he doesn't want to ruin his life. Also, if my husband makes a statement this will definitely divided the family as obviously everyone seems to believe Joe.  My question is if there's anyway that we can know, since we don't live near them, what actual evidence there are in the case. If my husband speaks to detective is he legally allowed to lie to my husband about the case?  Joe is a known liar... but his ex-wife can be cunning.  Is it possible that my husband's statement would really hold so much value?  Please help."	No
My parents passed away in 2003. My sister, brother, and I were minors at the time. In 2016, we were contacted by the state of Florida that there was abandoned property that was not included in my parent's original estate (we moved to Mississippi in 2003). We also became aware of a few Ameriprise accounts that were in my father's name that were never discovered in the original estate.  My sister contacted the original attorney who helped with the estate and helped her re-open the estate as the executor so the funds could be obtained. Neither the original executor nor the original attorney had the original estate tax ID number for the estate and we were told to apply for a new tax ID number, which we used to obtain the funds from the state of Florida and the stock accounts were transferred into an estate account at our bank.  We are worried about what taxes we will owe on these funds because they have been siting for so long and because we do not have the original tax ID number and are afraid of filing something wrong but no one we talk to can give us a solid answer. Some of the Ameriprise accounts were IRA accounts they seem to have a bunch of deadlines attached to them that we have missed but we can't really find a solid answer on what to do if we did miss the deadlines. The abandoned property from the State of Florida came from a ScottTrade account but we don't know if we owe capital gains taxes on it because we cannot differentiate what was the original amount in the account we we don't know if there was a gain or a loss on that account or even what stocks were in it, we only know the amount and where it came from.  tl:dr: My siblings and I became aware of more funds from a 2003 estate that just recently came under our control and can't get an answer on the taxes we owe.

"Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...  Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.  So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.  Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".  But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.  I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.  I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself. All I could picture were the pictures she used to send me. So without getting into detail, I got into my first fight. I regret in a way now, I didn't think I could go so far....  Tl:DR; Beat the shit out of a girls abusive boyfriend, no weapons involved. Definitely broke some bones. I am not proud of it believe me, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. I just want to know what to expect if he presses charges...   By the way, if the story is unnecessary let me know and I'll remove it, thank you."	No

Purchased a car from a dealership about 4 months ago.  Upon driving it home after parking it, it was leaking fluid (Oil and Windshield fluid). I took pictures and asked them about it, they said it was fine and that ''it heats up and causes it to overflow sometimes''  Today I brought the car to a different dealership to get an oil change, they said that its also leaking powersteering fluid is leaking. Also upon parking it home, the electrical system is cutting out. Headleads / foglights / dashboard / radio+speaker system no longer turn on.   Not sure what to do in this case.	No
So there are a million things to complain about this room I've rented, but the worst is that I'm pretty sure my landlord is breaking the law.    I paid her a security deposit equal to one month's rent before moving in. A few days after moving in, she asked if I could pay rent for next month early since she's short on bills. I said no, and she dropped it, but it was a huge red flag. I'll be moving out in two months, and I just paid rent for the upcoming month today. A few weeks ago, I brought up my security deposit and whether she'd be able to pay me back at the end of September. She said that when somebody else moves in and pays her a deposit, she can pay me. I obviously was concerned and asked what if no one moves in. She just laughed and told me not to worry, it's in a great location. (Side note, this place is an overpriced shithole and if I had actually been able to see it before signing a lease, there's no fucking way I would have lived here.)    Today, I brought up the security deposit by asking if it was okay if I could not pay last month's rent and she wouldn't have to pay me back. She said that wouldn't work. I said that it was unfair that she can't guarantee my deposit and she isn't supposed to spend the deposit. She told me I was rude for not trusting her to pay the deposit or something. Also, her English is pretty bad, so I'm not 100% sure that she spent my deposit and fully understands what I'm saying, but I'm pretty damn sure.    I was planning on emailing her that what she's doing is illegal, citing the law, and letting her know that I would not be paying last month's rent. Is there a better way to go about this? Thanks.	No
Little backstory is important.  We obtained our green card (mom and her son (me)) through marriage with him. He has started drinking last months more and more and he is just gettibg more aggressive. We don't know what to do. This morning he threatened my mother and she was able to record it. He said he is going to her work place and drag her out and that today we will see who he really is. I'm currently in my car couple blocks to where I live and I'm scared I don't know what to do. This isn't the first time he blows up but I just can't keep it. He keeps threatening my mom since we got our greencard from him and we want to stay here ( they've been married for almost 5 years). I'm afraid to escalate but how am I supposed to sleep knowing he is living in the same place as us?    How can I protect my mom's and I's status? He keeps saying he will say the marriage was a sham (it wasn't). How hard is it to win if he does this (we do have photo evidence and many people that can probably testify).   I'm sorry This is probably not the right place to have a meltdown but I can't keep pretending this isn't happening. I know this will make it way harder for us financially(if he leaves) but at least we can sleep fine	No
"I've recently made an offer on a home.  In the listing for this home, there was no mention of a solar panel system installed and I didn't even realize it had solar until the following morning when I was looking at the photos of the house.  I made an offer that stated the panels were to stay with the home.  I received a counter offer stating the solar panels would not be included in the sale of the home.  Since I didn't even know it had solar, and I loved the house, I accepted this contingent on the panels being professional removed and the roof repaired as needed.  Today my realtor, at my request, contacted the seller's realtor to ask about a timeline for this, as I'm going to have to get a 2nd follow up inspection to make sure the work was done correctly.  My concern is that we are only 4-6 weeks from closing and being in the construction business...I know how busy everyone in town is.  I don't see how he's going to get the work done in time.  Their reply was asking if I, the buyer, might be interesting in taking over the payments for the solar system at $70 a month.  That is all the information they provided.  I've requested more information as far as what the amount owed is, how much the savings is per month on the utility bill, what is the APR, warranty, etc.  So, I have some questions assuming I said no.  Does he have an avenue to back out of the offer or is he committed to either removing the panels or leaving them and eating the cost.  I'm also assuming he received a tax credit for the installation, which makes me wonder if he's even allowed to move the panels to his new home (I assume that was his plan).  My biggest question is regarding the wording of the counter offer.  They specifically stated       5. Per section 2.5.1: Solar Panels WILL NOT be included in the sale of this property. The wording states solar panels and nothing about the electrical system that goes with the panels.  Am I splitting hairs or do I legally have a right to any electrical, inverters, batteries, etc or would that logically be part of ""solar panels"".  I love the house and don't want to do anything that would prevent us from getting it.  I'm just wondering about my options as this is a situation I am not familiar with.  Thanks r/legadvice!"	No
Hi, my grandmother rented her house out through a management company to some tenants. They left saying that the house was 'unsuitable for living' citing various minor things that had broken while they were here (e.g. a sliding shower door came off the track). They sent the management company a letter saying that if we gave them the full security deposit, they would not take us to court over being forced to live in those conditions.  The house had suffered major damage due to a large pet they were not supposed to have breaking through porch screens and destroying blinds etc. We spent way more than the deposit fixing this damage.   They moved out in December 2017. We didn't think they had a case so we told our management company not to release the deposit. We moved in in January 2018 so we are no longer with the management company.  Eight months later: We asked the management company what happened and they said the tenant's lawyer never contacted them. They said they would reach out to the tenants again. The management company called us later saying that they would offer for the tenant to keep half of the deposit and for us to keep half of the deposit.   Today they called and said that the tenant refused this deal and that my grandmother is going to have to appear in court to fight it, or hire an attorney to fight for her.   My grandmother is inclined to do whatever is easiest to avoid a problem, but I worry the management company is lying to her. The company is acting a little suspicious and I think they may have already released the deposit to the tenants to avoid a problem. (For reference, it's a small company of 2 people). At no time during their tenancy (or now) did we have any contact with the tenants. We know their names but we don't have any contact information with them. We have never met them.  Sorry for the long post, I tried to keep things vague because I have 1 question:  Is the dispute really between the tenants and my grandmother, or is it between the tenants and the management company?	No
This is pretty simple really I just would like to know how to move forward. So initially last year I signed a lease with a agency and three months later it was bought buy another rental agency. The building manager was never to be seen or found or really had anything to do with the property until this week. I was headed to vacation when I got a call asking why I had two unauthorized pets on my premises. The building manager finally came around to ask if i was renewing my lease or moving month to month.    pets are not allowed in the building. The one is my GF's who doesn't live with me here, but the other is mine.  So really what I would like to know is would registering him as an emotional support animal protect me from eviction? I have already given my 30 days notice that I am leaving.   I know I'm pretty stupid for getting a dog when the lease says no pets but I guess I just got lazy and saw other people with animals in the complex so I went with it. I figured I would be in the clear since I'm leaving so soon.	No
Recently, my roommates and I contacted our landlord after our downstairs neighbor let us know there was a “screw” coming out of the ceiling below one of our bathrooms. Our landlord sent somebody over. Turns out this was termite excrement (ewwwww). Landlord let us know that they would be sending somebody over to repair the damage.  A couple of days later, we got an email message from the landlord after he received pictures from the contractor who did the repairs saying that the shower was dirty, mold was growing, and that that there was a leak between our unit and the unit downstairs. He claims there were thousands of dollars in damages, and we should have identified the leak sooner. He states we could be personally legally liable for damages.  As you can imagine, we freaked out when we read the email and started investigating and gathering documentation. The contractor who retiled the shower says we could not have identified the leak, and that the mold was unrelated. The contractor also recommended the shower be replaced years ago and it was not. The shower has leaked in the past. When our water bill spiked a year ago for no good reason, we advised the landlord to come out to the apartment and check for leaks and he did nothing.  We consulted with the Tenants Union in San Francisco and a lawyer. Both told us the same thing. Say nothing. He probably doesn’t have a strong case. Do not admit fault. He’s fishing to try and pin the fault on us. Maybe pay the lawyers to write a letter in advance stating that you know your rights.  Anyway, a couple of hours ago, the landlord sent another email asking us to confirm that we read his last email and to confirm that repairs were made. Does confirming receipt of an email where our landlord claims we could be personally liable an admission of guilt? Should I just ignore that portion of the email completely and just confirm that the shower was retiled? I feel like staying completely silent isn’t the way to go, as it may aggravate him more. Sorry if my question seems stupid. I’ve never dealt with anything law related besides jury duty.	No
I'll try my best to keep this brief, but I am looking for some direction.  I was born in 1978, by 1979 my parents were divorced and my dad bailed on us and moved to Florida. My mother re-married several years later and had 2 sons with her new husband. In the early 90's when I was 12/13 years old my mother asked if I wanted to be adopted by my step-father. I agreed, and they took the legal steps to adopt me and change my name.  Now, one important factor here is that step-father was extremely abusive to me specifically. I have no fond memories of this man. In fact, I chose not to burden my children with the same last name as it's synonymous in the town I grew up in.  Also, when I reached the age of 21 my real father reached out to me for the first time. I've since built a good relationship with my real father and have come to regret the adoption that occurred when I was young.  The adoption took place in NJ, where I was born. I currently live in PA and would like nothing more than to reverse the adoption, or at the very least, get back my original name.  My step-father died nearly 15 years ago at this point. My real father is very sick and I'd like to get this done ASAP but I have no idea where to start.	No
"Have scoured the internet for this one, but all information only mentions BAC or rolling retest violations being reported or forwarded to VASAP/court system.  Are the ignition start/end times data being analyzed as well for possible restricted license violations? Or can you only ""get caught"" for that by being pulled over? Just want some clarification. Thanks!"	No
Hi r/legaladvice,  I was helping my grandparents organize their finances and 1 item that stuck out was that my grandmother has a credit card exclusively in her name with a balance of about $5K. She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.  I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).  Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail? I haven't had an issue like this before and want to do things the right way here.  Thanks!	No
"I have a [previous post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/6kcqte/can_he_actually_get_that_or_a_lesson_in_why/) that outlines the whole background, if anyone would like to peek at it.  But I have a specific legal question:  My ex believes he's entitled to half of our home's passive value increase due to the market demand.  We bought the house in 2012, but didn't marry until December of 2015.  When we bought the house, it was worth $148k.  When we married, it was worth $155k.  A month ago when I told him we were through, it was worth $160k.  And now, it's worth $168k.  (These are Zestimates - yes, I know they aren't accurate, I'll be getting an appraisal to get the right numbers).    So - for what time frame is he entitled to the increase in value (marital property)?  During our marriage?  Or the whole time we've owned the house?    Also, the value keeps rapidly climbing - what's the ""stopping date"" for the equity owed?  (Hope that makes sense).  Thank you for any help."	No
"I have lived in the same apartment for 1.5 years and my renewed lease began July 1 (1 year lease). Coincidentally, I have been having bug issues since the beginning of July. I think it begins in early June when I heard an animal crawling in my wall. I made a service request to get it removed and the response was along the lines of, ""yes we have received multiple calls on multiple buildings with animals but there's nothing we can do this evening."" I think it died in my wall. Fast forward to early July, I begin to see big flies in my apartment, 1-3 at a time, as days past upwards of 5 flies. I keep killing them and think maybe it's the Texas heat bringing flies inside. I go buy fly strips, request a pest spray in my apartment and hope for the best. The repeat flies go on for a week or so and I continually look for cracks, open windows - nothing. My girlfriend starts to complain about a musky smell, I may be used to it at this point. Then one night I come home late and there are over 30 flies in my apartment! I couldn't believe it. I pack a bag and go to my friends house.  The next day I make an online service request and go to the office face-to-face. I bring up the fact that I made an animal request because I heard one in the walls a month ago and maybe it died. She said they could be it, they spent over $15k to patch holes in roofs and set traps (I want to call her fib because I don't believe they did) and the best they say they can do is go in my apartment and cut holes in the walls and maybe find something. They do and ""don't find anything"". The flies are swarming toward the window, and before anyone asks yes I am fairly clean as I don't leave food out, clean my dishes and occasionally leave a dish to be cleaned later in my sink. This is 30 flies. I have to stay at a friends for the next few days, and tomorrow (Monday) they are going to fog and clean my apartment, I have stayed one night because the flies are now gone I find that strange and now I'm worried they've laid eggs everywhere.   Now I'm dealing with carpet beetles. Small bugs keep poking up from the carpet and I keep vacuuming them up. I've had enough of this, I truly want to leave this apartment. Either a new complex or new apartment. What are my rights in this situation? Or, if I can't move, how do I make certain these issues are resolved?   I apologize for any odd formatting as I typed this on my phone. If any more description needs to be added about this situation please ask."	No
My SD(11) would like to live with us full time. Her mom has a long history of being physically and verbally abusive, but we've never been able to prove it. SD is very unhappy and has mentioned suicide. DH and I have been fighting this for years, but BM is very good at convincing judged and CAS that she is a good mom. She also makes the kids lie to make herself look good.   We are trying to see if there is a way to change custody so SD can live with us without making her go in front of a judge. We aren't even sure if a judge would take her seriously at 11 years old. Does anyone have any advice or resources we can use? We are very concerned for SDs safety and wellbeing.	No
"As the title states I'm 22. My mom got the no contact order when I was really young, no older than 4. I met with my dad, mostly out of curiosity but partially because I wanted to fill the void I felt during my childhood.   My whole life he was called my ""sperm donor"" and as I grew up and saw my mom for who she truly was I became more and more curious about my father and what really happened. (Feel free to stalk my comment history for more backround on my mom and our relationship)   The short version is I spent my entire life being the villain in my mom's story, even as a young child. I was blamed for everything wrong and the constant abuse I endured was ""my fault"" as well.  So when I heard that my dad wanted to meet me, I jumped at the chance. We spent 2 hours talking, about our cats, my mom, our childhoods, anything that came to mind.   I would love the opportunity to meet with him again and to possibly have him involved in my life but the no contact order worries me.   My questions are:   Would the no contact order still be valid even though I'm an adult?  If there are different types, how would I go about finding the information as to what exactly the order entails?  And finally, if it is still valid, how would I go about getting rid of or ending it?  Thank you for taking the time to read this and I look forward to being able to move forward with my life, out of my mom's shadow."	No
My sister (23) and myself (24f) were sexually assaulted by our older cousins (I'll use their initials, E, L, C) when we were younger. The youngest E is 3 years older than me, and C the oldest, is 6 years older than me, L being the middle child. My sister had reported to my mom that E had done something to her when she was about 10 and demanded my dad do something about it. My dad couldn't believe that his nephew E would do such thing and decided they would no longer stay over. At the time, I was also going through some questionable things with the older sister L  and because of the lack of support, I never spoke up about her and I've suppressed those memories (for the life of me I cannot remember what she did, but that it confused me). Two other aunts, my father's sisters, contacted my mother about their daughters suddenly showing sexual behaviors at such a young age. These cousins are about 6 years younger than we are. Those aunts didn't report it, again, because it's family and denied it when my mom did decide to call the cops.  All of this caused strain between my sister and dad, and of course my dads side of the family. Recently I spoke to a counselor about a memory in which I woke up to my pants being pulled down and my cousins L &amp; C hovering above me, to which they giggled and said they were playing a prank. They stopped, but in my sleepy haze, I could see my other cousin E at my sisters waist with her pants down. I fell back asleep and always beat myself up for never mentioning that. My counselor reminded me that I wasn't the adult and what happened wasn't in my control. I eventually came and told my sister this, to which she responded that she knew I knew something this whole time but didn't remember that specific incident. She waited for me to be ready and she understood why I stayed quiet. I told her that if it would help her quality of life and help her move past her fears that I would be with her every step (as much as distance and work would allow) of the process if she decided to press charges. She did, or is trying to. The detective says none of the other victims want to speak out. I'll be talking to her next week and will be giving my account of one situation no one but myself can remember. Not having correct dates and ages makes me hesitant it'll do anything.   When dealing with old situations with little to no evidence, what can one expect in Illinois? It scares me like no other that they won't have any repercussions for taking my sister's innocence and then tormenting her, her whole childhood. One of the cousins got a lawyer, and the other two won't speak to the detective.  Any advice would be great.	No
I've already got the ticket dismissed. Just want to know if there's anything the law can do ? 	No
Trying to make this short and sweet. My husband has two sons from a previous relationship (not marriage). The older one lives with us and the younger one lives with their mom. This was her choice. Before my husband and I got together she decided she no longer wanted the older boy to live with her, she gave no reason why. My husband told her that he wanted both but she would only give him the older boy.  She makes no effort to visit with the older boy. She'll call him and tell him how much she loves and misses him and promise that he can come spend the night at her house soon, which never happens. She just gets his hopes up then crushes him. I really want to adopt him, but I don't know how to do that. If his mom has to sign some sort of document, it won't happen. She cares about her image too much. She's always posting pictures of him on facebook (pictures that my husband and I take, she takes them from our profile) and saying how much she loves him. She just does it so her facebook friends will praise her on what a good mom she is. I really don't think she cares about him at all.   My husband and I regularly pick up the younger boy and he stays at our house for a few days. Whenever we go to pick up the younger boy, the mom gives the older boy a quick hug and maybe a cheap toy that breaks in an hour, and sends us on our way. Also, the younger boy is absolutely filthy every single time we pick him up. He stinks of urine and feces, and his skin and hair is always sticky. His teeth are yellow so I don't think she ever brushes them. (Side note, the older boy only has 7 teeth because she neglected to brush them and they all rotted out, and she always had him sleep with a bottle of formula). He has horrible manners, he hits and bites everyone. Her home is full of cats and dogs and the entire house just smells like urine. She lives with her boyfriend, her mom, and her two brothers. One of her brothers has cerebral palsy and no one takes care of him. He always stinks because no one bothers to change his diaper. They lock him in his room where he soils himself all day and they all ignore him. Once she called my husband in a panic because her boyfriend hit the child brutally, then later said it was nothing and he's fine and its none of my husband's business. She is still dating that same guy. My husband desperately wants to get him out of there but he doesn't know where to start, because she won't willingly give him up like she did her other son.   TL;DR: I want to adopt my older step-son but I don't know how. My husband and I want custody of my younger step-son but we don't know how we can because their mom won't willingly give him up like she did her older son.	No
2-3 weeks ago my neighbor's dog started coming on to my property. We live in the city and the dog used to have an electric fence, but it seems that is no longer the case. The dog is on the larger side (40-50 pounds) and very aggressive. Several times my mother has had to run for the front door while out gardening because the dog will run towards her and begin growling and trying to bite. Tonight the dog attempted to bite her and she kicked it several times until it ran away. We have told our neighbors on three separate occasions about the issue and they keep saying they'll handle it but never do. We have also called our local police department whenever we see the dog on our yard, but because it is not an emergency, it usually takes 10-20 minutes for them to arrive, by which time the dog is back in it's yard/house. The police knock on the neighbor's door, but they never answer. The officers we spoke to last said they could do nothing until there was evidence the dog hurt someone or was dangerous. My mother is beginning to fear working in our yard because of this animal. I love animals, but this dog is becoming a threat to my mother's safety, so I was wondering if it was legal to shoot it the next time it tries to hurt someone in my yard. Between the police and lack of problem solving by my neighbors, I feel like I am running out of options and it is only a matter of time before someone gets hurt by the animal. However, if shooting is illegal, what other steps can I legally take to resolve this situation?	No
"Reposting for clarity.  Nearly three years ago, we had two garage door openers installed by Bill. Over the next year or so, Bill came several times to work on not only the new openers, but also on an opener that he had installed for the previous owner of the property. The work on the two new openers was covered under warranty.   Over the last year, all three openers stopped working. Due to Bill's deteriorating health, we opted not to call him and instead to just open the doors manually.   Bill died this spring and his widow sold the company and the customer list to two guys with no previous experience- just general handyman experience. The new owners called my husband to introduce themselves, and my husband told them that they could come give us an estimate on fixing the three openers, and also to see if they were under any type of warranty.   The first day, one of the partners was met at our property with someone who seemed to know what he was doing. They spent time looking at the openers, but didn't actually do any work.   A couple of months later, the partner came out. He told me several times that he had no experience with openers and was learning as he went along. He spent a couple of hours here. He got one opener working, and told me I would have to replace the second new opener. I expressed to him that I had no interest in a new opener and would just open it manually. He ended up ""trying one more thing"" and had it working 15 minutes later. He also worked on the third opener and told me it was in working condition.   Before he left, he told me that they had 5.5 hours of work in. I nodded uncommittally, remembering that my husband had told him that we needed an estimate, and also that the new doors may have been covered under warranty.   Instead of receiving an estimate, they charged us $60 an hour so they could learn how to fix garage doors.   I am planning to call and dispute this ridiculous amount (can I charge him $200 an hour to listen to how horrible his ex wife was?), but wasn't sure what my legal options are. Thanks."	No
So I'm hoping someone here has some advice for me in regards to renting a room. I will be attending school in Toronto in September and due to my low budget ( 500 - 850 ) I'm going to have to rent a room in a shared unit instead of a apartment. I'm having a really hard time finding something as I have poor credit, no references as I've always lived at home and I'm patting with OSAP so I currently don't have employment in Toronto. The only thing I can think of that would help me to get a room is to offer to pay all 4 months rent up front. My concern is that if I'm just renting a room from in a shared house then I don't think I'm covered by the LTB and could be licked out any time without reason and could then be out 4 months rent. Could I get a contract or somthing stating the money is for rent and if I'm kicked out I get it back?   Not sure what my options are so if anyone has any suggestions on a contract or even advice on how to find a room in my situation I'd really appreciate it.	No
Hey! If your reading I thank you so much because I need to clear something up in my mind. So I basically shoplifted a few months ago, at sears (ik it's dumb) in April. The police were called as there're policy states. Anyways the police interviewed me and decided not to charge me. They took my info down (DOB,Adress,name) my concern is whether if it would show up any check for any type of employment in the future for event if they didnt charge me (police encounter)! Am I good?	No
My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	No
Hey Legal Advice! First time poster... This advice isn't for me but for my Sister in Law.   She and her friend rented an apartment. Leased it for a year. Both of their names are on the lease.  Her friend ended up losing her job and could not afford her end of the rent. So my very wise SIL decided she wouldn't pay her half and they just agreed to live it out until they got evicted.   Now they have finally been evicted and both have moved home.   My question is what kind of legal issues will my SIL run into? She seems to think that once she is evicted that's the end of that and life moves on. Front what i've heard from a Co-worker is that the Landlord can sue for the rent owed and potentially get wages garnished.   In all honesty this is for mostly my curiosity, however if there is any actual good advice I will pass it on. I just like to sit back and watch the show  This is in Alberta, Canada.	No
He was served a pay or quit notice and then surrendered the keys. There was a court date he didn't know about and I assume a default judgment against him for $3500 or so.   My question is; was he actually evicted? I can't seem to find an eviction record anywhere, just a court case ending with a writ of possession.  Also I guess it may have expired? But I thought that took 7yrs, it's been 3.	No
Can a screenshotted snapchat of a little bit of weed (like maybe an 8th) be enough for police to come do a search? I have been threatened by an ex and I would really like to know if this is possible. He says he will report the photo to the police.	No
"A young friend of mine is 19 and has been bouncing around from house to house since she was around 17 because of her father and brother abusing her. She's constantly worried he'll find her and force her to come back like he did when she'd run away as a young teen. I've let her know that as she's an adult, he now has very little legal control over her. That was a relief to her, but her big fear now is he'll find a way to change that. I know that an adult can take the actions to legally have ""custody"" so to speak and control over another adult if that adult is mentally disabled and unable to make their own decisions and care for themselves. That's where the problem is. Part of his abuse was convincing everyone she's crazy. He would talk to her friends behind her back to tell them she's crazy, talk to all the adults she might report to with a sob story about her manipulative nature and tendency to lie, even talk to the therapist he got her after each session and tell her ""his"" side of everything and how it ""really"" happened. He had her on tons of meds with tons of diagnoses and going to a bunch of doctors. He covered it up when her brother sexually abused her and told everyone she made it up/ asked him to do it. Bottom line, she's got a VERY small circle of people who believe that she's NOT completely unstable. Right now she's lives with her boyfriend and is safe. Her fear is that he's going to convince everyone that she's so unstable that she can't care for herself and needs him to still be her guardian even as an adult. Is this legally possible and if so what should she do? She currently has very little money as she's been on the run and does not have a license (her dad wouldn't let her get one - he told her years ago she was going blind and could never drive because of it and that one day she'd loose her vision entirely. She only discovered she isn't going blind a year ago after an eye doctors appointment as an adult)."	No
Specifically Fairfax County, VA  Our landlord has physically lost our lease. Does this mean we can get out of it? Can someone give me some statutes to quote for the landlord? She is saying she needs to see the lease before she makes any decisions about letting us out. But she doesn't have the lease. I'm tempted to put in my 60 day notice and peace out.  Also, I have the lease but she doesn't know it. I'm not going to give it to her.	No
Hi there!  I'm looking for anyone who may have gone through a similar situation to what I'm about to go through and can tell me what my options might end up being.  Here's what I have now: A husband who at best doesn't care about me and at worst is emotionally and verbally abusive to me. A young daughter who relies on me for everything, and who my husband and I both love dearly. A job lined up 2000 miles away in AZ (my home state). Two amazing friends who are willing to help me get from here (GA) to AZ and get me set up there.  My biggest issue now is that if I make the move and take the job, I'll have to leave my daughter behind.  I won't be able to immediately afford to take care of her, and I know long-distance divorces and custody battles can be particularly nasty.  What I'm worried about is that it will look like I abandoned her- otherwise, I can almost guarantee I'd get custody.  I've been wanting to get away from my husband for a long time- my anxiety and depression have run rampant here with him, and I'm at the end of my rope.  I have no family here I can go live with, they're all either just as toxic as my husband or in no position to be taking me in.  I haven't left previously because moving takes money, which requires a job, and this job is the first I'll ever have, if I take it.  My options here are to stay and be miserable until I can manage to get a job that will support myself and my daughter, or I can go, be happier with my life, but leave my daughter behind.  Any perspectives on the legal aspect of all this?	No
So, my family rented a lakefront cottage in Ontario for a week. We have a young 10 month old daughter (who is crawling up a storm!), and we were looking for a cost effective way to get away for a summer vacation, that we could still enjoy once she went to bed. We packed food for the week (carnivores delight), and delicious beer, and headed off to our getaway. Upon our arrival, we found the cottage was absolutely filthy, and somewhat in a state of disrepair, which was not represented by the photos posted in the ad we saw. The inside was carpeted, covered in dog hair, and sand. There were browned, grungy hand towels in the kitchen and bathroom, and an overwhelming odour of dog and mice. After over an hour of cleaning, Febreeze, airing out the cottage and burning a candle they had, the smell was strong as ever.  The deck had a couple badly rotten boards. One of them my husband almost put his foot through, but it didn't give all the way, it just was crushed. The railing was a bench all the way along, with a 1.5 foot gap from the deck surface to the seating surface. There was a minimum 10 foot drop down to stone. The drop distance increased as you went along the deck. This isn't built to code (4 inch gaps maximum), and this was not disclosed prior to renting. With our daughter being of crawling age, you can imagine this not being ideal. The rest of the property was steep rocks and gravel, so we wanted to spend most of our time on the deck with our wee one.  The fridge wasn't keeping our food cold, and the freezer was so warm all of our meat thawed out within our first day. I had food and milk packed for my daughter, which I had to discard.  Needless to say, we left after the one day because we found the conditions unsuitable. We are by no means high maintenance, we're from the country, and were looking for a simple, rustic, no frills cottage to stay at to get away with our little family. For the record, we paid $850 plus $300 deposit. So it wasn't all that cheap!   I guess what I'm asking is, what are our rights? What can we do?  We've contacted the owners telling them what we found, and that we had left. They were reluctant to give any money back. They told us they would be in touch yesterday or today to discuss further, and now we can't get ahold of them at all. Please help! Our summer holiday budget is out the window, and we're not sure what to do. Not to mention we're feeling a little ripped off.  TL/DR: disgusting conditions found in a cottage we rented, we bailed, and now can't get in touch with the owners who have our money + deposit. HELP!	No
"I purchased a home in October 2006. At the time I thought the house looked like a modular or trailer, but the appraisal came back as ""standard built home"" and listed the value at $85k. I purchased the home for $72,500 with a 9.65% ARM. (I had some bad credit at the time, but I figured I could pay on the house for couple of years, sell it, and move into something bigger for less interest)   As you all know, in the spring of 2007 the market crashed. Everyone lost out. I tried to refinance in 2010 and this is when I was told the home was worth $70k and it was a manufactured house. I found a bank to go through that did manufactured housing loans. I had to get a retired title in order to refinance or sell it. Unfortunately, I owed more than $70k so I wasn't able to refinance. Earlier this year I tried again. This time I owe $64k but it's valued at $57k. I put over $42k into fixing the house up over the last 5 years..........I know that money is gone. At this point, I do not want to put 1 cent into the house for improvements, but I am stuck with an interest rate of 9.65%. (Other than dumping every extra cent I have into paying down the principal) Does anyone have any advice?"	No
I received and email from my schools financial aid office notifying me that my low GPA from last semester could possibly put my financial aid in jeopardy. This email was sent with a open mailing list of every other student who received poor enough grades to have their financial aid threatened. From my understanding my grades are supposed to be private from other students and this may be a violation of something called FERPA. Should I or can I pursue legal action?	No
Last year I made the poor decision to live with randoms. It went horribly and the other two don't speak to each other. We just moved out and we're waiting for our move out fines to come in. I already know it's going to be at least 300 or more because one of them got caught with a cat and we got a 250 pet fine. Unfortunately we're all on one lease and that technically means that all three of us are equally responsible for all the fines.  This is where I'm worried because both of them are irresponsible and I don't see them trying to take responsibility of the fines and probably doesn't care if they get sent to collections. They also know that I really care about my credit and would probably wait for me to eventually pay it.   I want to know if there's anything I could do legally to encourage them to pay the fines?   I looked up small claims court and it costs almost $120 to file in my state which at that point I'd have to decide if it's worth it (which I won't know until the 31st of this month).   Could I get a lawyer to maybe write them a letter? What are my options? 	No
Our air conditioning stopped working sometime last night while we were asleep, and we woke up to a house at 83° at 5 AM. We contacted the property management company at 5 AM to let them know about the issue. We have been getting the runaround all day, and now they say they can't get someone here until tomorrow.  The major issue is this – we have a nine-month-old daughter and a dog and a cat, all listed on the lease. The house upstairs is now up to 99°. This is obviously an unsafe environment, but they are still refusing to send someone.  What are my options?	No
I've got a large oak tree along my rear fence and the people on the other side are complaining to me that it's pushing into their pool cage, I'm inclined to tell them to stop bothering me about it but won't until I know whether it's my responsibility or not (I'm curious so I know how to respond, they're probably unable to legally pursue this since their pool cage comes right up to the fence so if they brought the county in to force me to cut that limb off it's likely they'd be told their new pool cage isn't to code!  That said, if it'd be my responsibility legally, I'd still go and deal with it, so want to find out for sure!)  Oak tree is ~30' tall, branch in question is ~15' up and growing directly at the top of their pool cage.  Tree's trunk is right against my side of the rear/shared fence!  Thanks for any help!	No
Should I be getting my parents to proactively contact the health insurance company to see how to pay or is there some out of this world reason that they don't have to pay anymore? They had cancelled the insurance through calling the Obamacare phone number stating that they didn't realize their insurance had autorenewed and got mail a month later with the results. The result was that we would have to pay anyway but the health insurance was cancelled. We haven't received mail from them anymore, not even a bill. Should I wait until a bill comes in through the mail or should we be proactively calling the obamacare hotline or the health insurance company to get further details?	No
"I am an Amazon Seller.  I sell various products, and I work hard to position them as high in the search results as possible.  I've been working on some products for months or years, and they slowly gain position in the search pages leading to more sales - but it takes time.  Lots of time.  Recently a competitor started selling a similar product.  (When I say ""similar"" I really mean ""exactly the same"", but with their label on it.  Which is fine, that happens all the time.)  The problem is that this seller generated dozens of completely fake five star reviews, getting his product in the top 10 search results within a week. That's right.  On exceptionally high-volume search results, he got to the top 10 in a week.   The reviews are obviously fake.  The people leaving the reviews have never reviewed any other product except for this guys.  They all left over-the-top, gushing reviews about how the freaking product ""changed their life.""  Each left pictures and videos.  Me and a friend traced back all of the accounts, and believe we mapped out a pretty decent network of sellers that work together creating fake accounts and leaving fake reviews.  The evidence is strong.  So we reported them to Amazon.  Two months ago.  Nothing has happened. Our sales have suffered.  This practice is in direct violation of Amazons terms, but they don't seem to have any interest in enforcing their own rules.  I've read that Amazon is going to bring a lawsuit against these types of buyers/sellers, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Is there any sort of legal action we legal sellers can take against the illegal sellers?  I believe that leaving fake reviews is in violation of some federal laws, is that correct?  Can we report them to a federal agency?  Can I have a lawyer write up some scary-sounding/threatening letter?  What are my options?  I am in the US.  Thanks you."	No
"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	No
"Hi, Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post, but here's my story.  My mom hears some flipping noise when driving, so she takes her car to firestone tires.(where she bought her tires)  1. Firestone- recognized that 2 tires were recalled, so they replaced 2 tires for free. Problem still persisted.  2. Mobil- So then she takes the car to the gas station the next day and the guy says the problem is the AXLE BOOT and STRUTS. Left side on the front was leaking. They said they would have to replace all 4 axles for total of $780. She says nope too much.  3. Valero- next my mom takes the car to the Valero gas station down the street and repeated everything that just happened, and he said that he will order the front STRUTS(not the entire axle) and get the problem fixed, and he won't do the back ones.  So at the end, he replaced the entire left axle(leaking)(which never told her he was gonna do) and front struts, total $480.   THEN AT THE END, HE SAYS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE BACK TIRE WAS THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. The other used tire in the back was ""feathering"", causing the noise. ($50 problem)  So he misdiagnosed, overcharged, and replaced parts that never needed replacing in the first place.  So tomorrow we are gonna get the original parts as evidence that they were not the problem nor they were damaged.  Also, the receipt invoice does not say anywhere the diagnosis of the problem. He never looked at the car, just did what he felt like basically.   So she wants a refund of her money. Any suggestions??"	No
In Kansas, you receive a temporary paper driver's license when you go apply for one. It's supposed to take 10-14 days for them to mail the real thing, but it's taken longer than that. Are private persons and businesses required to accept the paper license as if it were the real thing?	No
All vehicles our parked at owners risk. No liability is assumed by management for loss or damage by fire, theft, or any other cause to, or by the vehicle while in custody of management. All claims must be presented before vehicle is taken from facility. Any person driving becomes the agent of the owner solely. We are. It responsible for articles left in vehicle or mechanical problems.   Background: left car with hotel valet to park for a few days. I came back and car was stolen and then impounded. I'd like to not pay the $275+ obviously. Do I have any recourse or am I SOL?	No
I'm a 14 year old girl in Mississippi. My parents have been divorced all my life and family for a long time have had a good friendly relationship. The custody agreement was that I would stay with my mom on weekdays, and I would stay at my dads on weekends, but it has always been very, very loose. The past year or so my mother has become more and more touchy, and she yells at me quite often. She gets mad over the tiniest things and starts yelling, and then I start crying, and then she'll yell at me for crying, and then I cry harder, and then it kinda keeps going from there. Usually after that I go hide in my room and cry for at least another hour thinking about how much I hate her and stuff like that. My father is literally the perfect parent. He actually has a job(Mom doesn't), gets stuff done(Mom doesn't), is actually responsible, gets me to school on time, volunteers for all of my band stuff, etc.  and most importantly he never ever yells. Not once in my life have I been yelled at. I practically idolize him and I respect him, whereas I lost respect for my mother a long time ago. About a year ago, I was practically suicidal because of her yelling at me. For the past year, but especially this last week, I've been thinking about going over to dad's and simply telling him that I'm not going back. Today for the first time I actually said something when my dad told me to pack up, and he really does want to help in any way he can. What would happen if I refused to go over to my moms? With the fact that she has yelled at me this much, is a pretty bad parent in general, and that I'm an older kid who has a clear opinion, would there be any chance of changing custody to primarily if not completely my father? Are there any other paths we could take? Can someone help me please?	No
"I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.    My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?  What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?"	No
TL;DR: Is the landlord responsible for a high water bill if the bill is due to broken lawn sprinklers on common property in an apartment building?  I live in a multi-unit property and due the sprinklers being broken we have an excessive water bill. All units are being charged almost 500% of our typical water bill (the bill is usually divided equally among the tenants of the building).  The lease explicitly describes that in the event a high water bill is issued, we must pay in the same timely manner we normally would. But, it describes examples such as leaky faucets within a tenant's property. The sprinklers are are apart of the common exterior property and there are no references in the lease that we have a responsibility to maintain that property (just not actively damage it).  I'm hoping to find a statute in Colorado or something that makes explicit that, since it is not written in the lease, an excessive utility bill due to something occurring in common spaces of the building is the responsibility of the landlord. Any help is appreciated!	No
I live with a married couple to save on rent. I literally just signed a new lease with them last month until next August and found out tonight that the wife left this morning and they're getting divorced. The husband wants me to sign to let her off the lease but I literally cannot afford to pay for half of this place plus all the other miscellaneous expenses. Am I right to refuse to sign on a lease release form until they can find me a replacement who will pay what we agreed to? Furthermore the  husband is a permanent resident of Mexican origin who is planning on taking a trip to Mexico in October and I can't risk him never coming back and me being the only one holding the bag on the lease. Wife moved back to Massachusetts I assume and my only legal recourse is if I keep her on the lease so they know where to find her. Anything else I should be aware of?  P.S. Is it also too late for me to throw myself at the mercy of the leasing office in terms of getting out of the lease? 	No
I will be leaving the country for six months for work. I have a few roommates who pay me rent. I have one who I feel comfortable putting in charge of collecting rent and paying any handy men if they are needed. Should I give her a limited power of attorney for these matters? Or is a written contract enough to hold up in any suit should things go south? Is there anything else I should consider to ensure rent gets paid while I'm away? 	No
Yesterday my mother was checked into ICU for multiple complications, most importantly liver cirrhosis. She has recently become somewhat stable and we are continuing to fight for her life. It was brought to my attention that she does not have any health insurance whatsoever. Her current prognosis is 6-12 months and it is quite unlikely she will make it past the year without one of her children giving up a part of their liver. Over the course of the past 24 hours she has had multiple surgeries and what we're estimating is well into the 6 figures of medical expenses. We expect many more expenses in the coming days and likely into the millions of expenses when it's all said and done at this rate. My rough guestimate of what her estate is worth is around $700k-$1000k it could be slightly more, but that is unlikely. My question is will her children end up being liable for the expenses in excess of her estate? She is divorced. All of her children are above the age of 18 (5 of us). I've been looking into Filial responsibility laws(we live in a state that uses these) and I am pretty terrified we might be footing a huge bill by the end of the year if she doesn't make it. Does anyone have any experience with something like this or any advice? Thank you all very much.	No

"Hey!  My mom and dad seperated legally back in November of 2016 and my mom was awarded spousal support checks from my dad's income. My dad is salary and gets a constant amount every two weeks. My mom's spousal support checks from my dad's workplace have varied in amount by $100 to $200 each check, and that's when they show up. Currently it has been almost 2 weeks since my dad's last payday and no check has arrived. This isn't unusual and has been on going since the checks started coming. We tried to get direct deposit but his workplace refused and will only mail out a check when they remember to.   Now my parents agreed outside of court to some things, such as my dad continuing to pay the mortgage on the house, while my mom has taken it on to pay pretty much everything else. The checks coming late puts a massive amount of strain on her when trying to pay bills and maintain things around the house. Her divorce lawyer (original plan was full divorce) has been completely unhelpful and extremely expensive to do minor tasks. When the checks being late or coming in different amounts was brought up they sent a letter which cost way to much to do nothing. This was back in March. So my question is, what can be done here? My dad has gone in to HR at work to inquire about missing checks which they've claimed ""were sent out weeks ago"" only to show up next day via priority mail and they won't really tell him anything either way.   So is there anyway to get these checks in on set dates or maybe verify they are abiding by a court order? I know one other thing is my dad works for an Indian casino and there seems to be some odd understandings regarding their abiding by said court order, so any advice would be greatly appreciated."	No
Should mention before I start where I live. I live in Southern Arkansas, in the US.   I turn 22 in September, and I was recently talking to a friend who was able to get several years worth of missed child support from his father. As far as I know, my father hasn't paid Child Support at least since I was 6-7. I've been hurting for money for a while, and I was wondering if it were possible to actually do that without knowing where my father even is currently. Does anyone have any advice or any tips on where to get started?	No
Hello LA, My girlfriend has been really upset by this recent turn of events. Her sister has a criminal background and has been in prison before. Likely, to avoid showing up again for warrants, she used her sisters name (my GF) to avoid a Jay Walking Ticket. Afterwards, she has been placed back in prison for a burglery charge and is currently serving time.  The issue is my GF received the $551 ticket from the tax recovery service because penalties have been acruing since my GF hasn't been served notice of the ticket because the wrong address was used when the Jay Walking citation was issued. How can one get the charges and penalties be taken out of my GF's name and her credit ratings restored? Thank you for any help.	No
"I recently purchased a home with my fiancee, and we moved out of the apartment we were living in after about a year give or take a month.     This past Friday(7/28/17), we received a collection notice in the mail for damages to the apartment. It stated we had 30 days to respond with a written request from the posted date(7/21/17) or the charges would be considered accepted. The charges are as follows:  * Cleaning Fees - 275 * Removed Stickers from walls - 60 * Repair Walls in living room and dining room - 390 * Repair walls upstairs - 350 * Carpet Cleaning	- 160 * Repair walls in bedroom - 150 * Repair walls in entry &amp; leading upstairs - 110      Total Damages:					1385.00      Credit for Security Deposit:	-250      Total Paid by Debtor:			0.00      Total Amount Due:				1135.00  Now, this came as quite a shock to us. We didn't expect much back on the deposit, there was an area where the cat tore up part of the door frame and we expected a fee for leaving the decorative stickers on the walls(we moved all of our stuff out an realized we couldn't reach the top ones). We, however, were not expecting this kind of bill.  The only ""damage"" left in the walls were holes from screws were we hung up picture frames. They told us when we moved in that this would be considered ""normal wear and tear"", or however they phrased it, and it would not be counted against us when we move out. Hell, there were still screws in the walls from the last family that lived there.  What I'm worried about here is that they are trying to overcharge us. They did several shady things while we lived there. Like charging us $7 for a missing 9-volt battery, that wasn't missing, they replaced during an inspection, that they did not do. They did not inform us of this charge, then gave us a bill for the 9-volt, and a late fee for not paying them.  Basically, are we in the wrong here? We're not sure how to respond to this notice since we don't have the funds to just ship out to these people that we feel are trying to rob us."	No
My aunt and her long-term boyfriend (father of her kids) received food stamps or EBT from August-January (the food stamp people also claim they gave them money for February but aunt says nothing showed up on the card) she would get about $150 a month until the food stamp use was discontinued. Her boyfriend failed to report the overtime her made in his job and now they had a letter sent to their home asking him to sign a letter and authorize for them to ask his work place for his pay stubs. Is there a possibility that they go to prison or will they just have to pay the money back? Its urgent. Thank you!	No

"We purchased a new build home under a year ago. We have water damage and mold caused by an AC unit leak. The installer has admitted fault and restoration efforts have begun. I have two questions regarding the matter: 1.	We are concerned about future mold issues. Can we obligate the builder to warranty against mold?  2.	We have lost use of a bedroom, a bathroom, and occasionally lose use of our living room. We are also taking extensive time off for numerous restoration and electrical appointments. Are we able to seek damages for inconvenience/pain/suffering as this is resulting from builder negligence?"	No
So this is a throw away account since I'll be giving away a bit about my location here. I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.   I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.   Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.  So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.	No
"Hi all,  supload.com is a site where you post images and get paid in bitcoin for every view. The guy has posted this site on /r/beermoney and other places a while ago and I ended up trying it out in March. Since then I have been contacting the owners via twitter/email etc and get absolutely no reply regarding why my ""earnings need to be finalised"". Now this happened in March and I completely forgot about it but my images are still earning money, I have 25$ worth of bitcoin to check out. Now I know this isn't much at all but this is more about the fact that me (and likely many others) were scammed by this site and I'd rather get to the bottom of this.

Hello,  We are 2 months into a 12 month fixed term lease. Our landlord continually emails us stating she wants us to leave so she can move back in due to personal circumstances.   We are aware this is illegal during a fixed term, she can only give us the boot for her to take possession back AFTER the lease, we spoke with the Landlord Tenant Board, and relayed this to our landlord but she CONTINUES to email us alternating between begging us and threatening us.  What can we do to make her stop? Do we have to hire a lawyer to send her something like a cease and desist? Do we call the police? As far as we are aware she has not been entering the unit or showing up - so I don't think trying to get a no trespass order is possible.  We just want to live in peace without constant bombardment and empty threats. She needs to be put into her place but clearly us pointing to the law and how her attempt to evict us contravening it, is not enough to make her stop.  Any suggestions are truly appreciated!	No

"California.  So me and 2 other friends were eyeing this great 3bdr/3.5bath (or so we thought) place. Listed as such. I went and looked, the landlord kind of was rushing through the showing, I saw the 3 bedrooms and only saw 2.5 of the bathrooms. (The 3 bedrooms are upstairs, master has one in suite, and I only caught one of the other bathrooms, assuming a closed door was the other. The downstairs has a half bathroom).  Lease mentions nothing about # of rooms / bathrooms, just the address. We moved in and there it's only 2.5 baths (1 in master bedroom, 1 upstairs, and the .5 bathroom downstairs).  We have a screenshot of the ad that states ""Each of the bedrooms has its own private bath""  Is there anything we can do? Grounds to break lease or no? We all wanted a private bath. We will make due - but think we should get a reduction in rent."	No
Kankakee, Illinois   Me and my fiance lived here for 3 months, the roof was leaking also the ceiling was leaking into the stove, which would smoke when turned on the oven part of it so we're scared to use it. The porch is also water damaged along with me almost falling through it.  The wall at the part of the house thats leaking is taking in water also, i put my hand on it one day to walk down the 1 foot apart death trap steps to the water leaking basement only to have the wall cave in a bit and i could hear stuff falling down it, the house wasn't inspected or anything before we moved in, we had to buy a steam cleaner and clean the nasty carpet, also painted the bedroom and re-did the flooring as well.  They never fixed anything other than putting a tarp on the roof, and has never done anything about it for a month now.   Every time we have asked our landlord (daughter) about anything she just told us to talk to her dad about it, and then he woudn't want to do anything. We were promised gutters and a back fence that never got put up, not worried about the fence but the gutters would prevent all the water leaking into the basement and the chance for mold and whatnot, we can't use the entire house as it is and they haven't fixed anything.  We've decided not to pay rent this month and have a lease being printed out for us on the new place and are using that to put down on the deposit and rent for the new place.  They just showed up asking for the rent and we told them we didn't feel we should have to pay this month being that i can't even use the entire house and that we're moving out soon around the end of the month.   I have taken pictures of everything and have tried to also save any conversations me and my fiance have had with this guy and his daughter.  Are we in the wrong? Should we pay rent, even though nothing got done?  My fiance is scared about going to court because they're saying they're going to put up a 5 day notice on our house and then start the eviction prosess, i mean we're gonna be gone by then but we will still have to deal with them in court.  Do we have a case or should we pay the rent and then move out?  Any help, advice, and/or information about this would be absolutely appreciated please and thank you.	No

"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	No
"Hello I am a Disabled Veteran that recently Bought A house knowing it had a sulfur problem with the well, during the purchase of the home the seller agreed to the conditions (in writing) of fixing the sulfur problem and selling the house to me with clean supply of water.  A set of expensive Culligan filters (water softener and salt exchange) were included as a condition for the sale and the problem was temporarily solved but BEFORE agreeing to buy the house from the seller, I had personally visited the nearest Culligan shop and spoke with the person in charge and explained him about the high levels of sulfur on this house and invited him to send techs to evaluate what equipment was best to COMPLETELY solve the sulfur issue whatever the cost since the purchase of the equipment was agreed to be paid by the seller at closing. culligan ""sold""me the most expensive of course but i did not care since i covering these costs. the seller agreed to cover the costs and i bought the house. This was in NOVEMBER 2016 (important)  Constant high levels of sulfur require my maintenance costs to be high, mostly from the salt and chlorine I am slaved to add to the water reservoir (chlorine is used to eliminate sulfur from water) or else the water will be intolerable. the culligan filters do the work but can barely keep up. I contacted Culligan to tell them this and they casually offered me an equipment that GETS RID OF SULFUR! for 500 bucks or so which made me furious because I had specifically told him to ""sell"" me whatever equipment was necessary to fix the issue before closing because i wouldn't be able to afford buying anything else afterwards.  During the last winter frost, my pipes, pressure tank and water pump exploded. ($1400USD bill) I contacted a company that does this kind of repair service and the tech that came to fix it casually told me he knew this house and the problem, that the previous owners had such a huge problem with the sulfur that one day their kid passed out in the shower from the sulfur fumes and had to be rushed to the hospital! (not disclosed as a safety hazard on the sale) The plot thickens... I requested my well to be evaluated to see how they could help me find a solution and their best answer was to drill another hole in my property... for around 10 grand. -.- Later after requesting a quote the owner of the company called me to tell me he noticed something strange about my well. that he found records of the well drilling company that originally drilled my well of a ""legal battle"" or some kind of litigation with the previous owners where the state authorities got involved and the drilling company was forced to drill a second hole but when he noted the new position of the well he told me that they drilled the hole A FOOT APART from the first one (for those that dont know about wells...this is ridiculous since drilling a hole right next to the one with a current problem is just masking the issue temporarily and plain stupid) The owner of the company told me also that this other company drilled the first hole wayyy to deep and the second hole was half the dept. He told me that what he believes they did instead of actually drilling the second hole was to collapsed the first hole to half the dept and recorded as if they drilled the second hole a foot apart. I contacted the company that drilled the hole originally to ask about what they had done with the issue and that i was a new owner and the lady that answered was super rude and speaking with a angry tone she said ""her husband"" had done all he could and they were no longer doing business in my area because ""its hard to find good water"" and hanged up on me.  That's the story so far, Could someone tell me how can I start something that will ultimately help me have clean water in my house?.  I'm tired of smelling rotten eggs every time i wake up, brush my teeth or shower. and my respiratory medical conditions are not getting better.  I want to thank you all for reading."	No
This has been an ongoing battle since we moved in three months ago. I'll try to keep it short however and just hit the high points. However there will be a tl;dr at the end.  I live in Alabama, and it gets hot here in the summer, like really hot. This list week it got up to 101 with like 70% humidity. So it is very important, not just to have an AC, but to have one that functions properly.  When we first moved in, I noticed the HVAC unit inside was making a sputtering noise like it was leaking coolant, or possibly had air in the lines. We notified our landlord, and he came out to take a look. He said it was fine and not to worry about it. I just let it go as the air conditioner was still able to keep pace with the outdoor temperatures. Although side note, I know my landlord know nothing about HVAC because on the day we were supposed to move in we found him in our apartment tapping on the thermostat saying that it was broken and he would have to call someone. All that has happened was the float switch had fallen and was triggered, cutting of power to the unit. I pointed that out to him and reattached it to the drip pan.  Now, a few months have passed and the unit is no longer keeping up with the outdoor temperatures. It runs constantly during the day and nearly constantly at night. Also, it never brings the indoor humidity below 60%. Our power bill has skyrocketed and is truly unreasonable for out small two bedroom apartment. I always keep the filters changed and even used a bottle of coil cleaner on the condenser could inside. So I feel I have done my due diligence as a tenant.  Now our apartment gets afternoon sun, and the outdoor side of the heat pump is on the roof getting the same afternoon sun. So, I know it's not an efficient setup, but I've requested that our landlord have someone take a look it to make sure everything is operating correctly and efficiently. I'm sure the coils on the unit on the roof are badly in need of cleaning. And I want to hear from a professional that everything is in good working order.  So here's the problem. He refused to send anyone qualified. As I mentioned the first time I had an issue he came and looked at it himself. He said he would send an AC company, but never followed up. I just asked him again yesterday to send someone out and outlined the issue. He said no problem he would get someone out. The person he plans to send is our new downstairs neighbor who is a general contractor, but has no kind of HVAC certification. I'm sure he also won't be getting on the roof or checking refrigerant pressure. Besides that's just awkward. I will not be letting h enter my home.  So, finally the question. What can I do? I know Alabama landlord tenant law says I am entitled to having an AC in good functioning condition. But that's the problem, technically the AC is working, just not very well. Can I demand that he send a certified HVAC tech, or can he just laugh that request off. I'm really not sure what to do, but I'm really super frustrated.  tl;dr: My AC is not working well. It runs all the time and is costing me a lot on energy bills. My landlord refused to send a qualified HVAC tech. What can I do?	No
My seventeen year old daughter made some poor decisions and ended up passed out in the back of a taxi last night with some friends who were apparently trying to get her back to one of their homes. At one point, it seems she need to vomit and the driver stopped the car. Somehow, the car door was opened and my daughter, who remembers nothing, ended up hitting her head on the ground and suffered a major concussion. At that point, instead of seeking medical attention, the driver simply put her back in the car and finished the route. We only found out about this later the next day.   Is there a cause of action here? If I find out the driver was responsible for opening the car door and causing my daughter's injury could she/he be found liable?	No
Hello community. I live in NY, Queens. The woman I rent from is so cheap that she and her son are trying to evict me for 9 months now, so that they can take advantage of the crazy rising prices in my neighborhood. They gave me a rent stabilized lease and now they claim that the building is not rent stabilized, while they forced me into month-to-month tenancy by refusing to renew my lease twice (that is, they asked for a raise twice already). First they tried to scare me for months (cutting my internet cable outside my window at 2 am, while the son is the only person who has this access, cursing by the mother, turning off my heat in December), so I took them to court first for harassment. They tried to do it the legal way after this, so I closed the harassment case to focus my resources on the eviction case after they served me with a 30-days notice back in December. My lawyer managed to get the case dismissed twice already because they can't even hire and pay a proper lawyer, this meaning that he always messed up with the correct paperwork and documentation. Now they are trying for a third time and I'm determined to report them to IRS because they are declaring 4 units while they receive income from 8. They never gave me a receipt, but I pay with check every single time, so I have proof of payment. I don't want to damage them but obviously they want to cause me damage, so I'm seriously thinking of doing this. My question is, can they be in Housing Court trying to evict me if and while the IRS investigates them?  Thank you for reading this, I'd appreciate any insight and information you have to share!	No
How can my wife, who was arrested nine days ago for assault against me while I was holding our daughter, get an ex parte judge to quash my protection order keeping my daughter safe and protected and enforce a temporary visitation arrangement that only gives me every other weekend and one night a week until the family court hears my case? How is this reasonable in any way, considering her assault charge? Washington State, btw.	No
Paid application fee, first month's rent, security deposit/fee/nonrefundable. Do I still have to accept the unit? First one was on a great floor at the front of the complex. This one isn't and at the back and pretty shady. They are sending over a new contract with the new unit #. At what point is my money gone if I don't want this unit if I can break the lease?	No
Hello Legal Advice, Thank you ahead of time for your time and help.  In short, my mother is going through a divorce with her abusive husband, and is at the stage where discoveries for both parties has been made, and before any court dates.  The strange circumstance is that her husband gets away with lots of different crimes due to his mother working in the courthouse. This is a small county with a very small county courthouse, and everyone there talks to each other. I realize that it sounds slightly outlandish, but both lawyers and judges have been swayed by her, and it is not a fair court system for my mother to get divorced in. He has been pardoned of his fifth DUI today, and my mother is now that she is afraid to talk to this county judge about having what is fair to her from the divorce.  Therefore, is there anyway she can have her lawyer move the case and any future court appearances to a different county courtroom, with different personnel?   Thank you all again, and have a good day!	No

Hello! So my girlfriend has received a traffic citation on Friday from an apparently hit and run accident on June 18th. It's a misdemeanor failure to stop property damage citation with no insurance/registration(She has proof of both)  She is very unsure of this whole deal, I'm just trying to find some answers to help ease her uncertainty. I know the basics of never talk to police, get a lawyer etc. but I don't have much knowledge and feel bad I can't help more.  She is claiming not to remember any accident, or damage to her car. I believe there may be a scratch on her mirror that's about 2cm but she says it's been there before.   Anyways I'm wondering what to tell her to do besides getting/talking to lawyers, what's the worst case scenario outcome, no criminal record, first offense, one speeding ticket 6 years ago etc. and since there is only the failure to stop property damage citation(well no insurance and registration C/I's that she has proof of so no biggie), does that mean it's just the only accusation we have to worry about? Reckless/careless driving or other things at a later date from this incident isn't a concern right?    Just want to give her some clarity on everything and what she's facing, thanks so much. Let me know if you need anymore info.	No
My grandfather died about 6 months ago and left all of his assets to his recent wife and made her the executor of his will. The one exception to this was my grandparent's house which he left her in a life estate.  Before his death he and his wife co-signed on a loan for several tens of thousands of dollars against the house. This past week I started getting calls from a debt recovery company asking about his finances. I know from my research that my family and I can't be chased down for his debts as we haven't received anything from and have no control over his estate, so I am not concerned about that.  Ideally we would like to sell the house ourselves and pay off the loan or take over the loan and rent out the house so it is not foreclosed on. I checked with my family and the deed was never updated to indicate the remaindermen he had described in his will so the first thing I am doing now is making sure that happens ASAP.  What are our best steps forward after that? Since she was on the loan can they even come after the house as part of the estate? We were thinking of calling the debt collection company and seeing if we could work with them directly, although we are not the executors so they may not even talk to us.	No
"We've since moved out of state but the property in question was in Eastern Washington. Landlord sent a proxy for the walk through who was in our opinion completely over the top with the walkthrough, but despite that we thought it went okay. We were expecting for the landlord to find ways to chip away at most of our deposit with stuff here and there (for instance, there had been an ancient, cheap garage door opener which disappeared; we got charge $50 for it, but whatever). So even though we thought we had done a very good job taking care of the place and prepping it for the next renters, we were prepared to kiss our 1200 goodbye.  The landlord sent us a bill for $5,000 in ""damages"". That's it. No explanation, just ""tenant damages"".   There was no damage whatsoever that was caused by us that wasn't repaired before we left. There had been some severe damage caused by a freak windstorm a year prior that the landlord had never fixed. There had been damage that had been there before we even moved in, but the landlord claimed they didn't have our damage report on file and that they were going to go off old photos from ""before we moved in"". We had completed that when we moved in, sent it in, and wrote it down separate in a notebook since it was a single page form that they said they would copy and send back and of course never did. We completely repainted, we completely rebuffed and waxed the floors, we made every bathroom sparkle cleaned the chimneys, etc. We can't think of anything else they could possibly be charging us for.  What can we do to dispute this? They said we had ""ten days from the time of this letter"" to respond before it would be escalated to collections, and the date on the top of the letter was clearly marked two weeks before it was even sent. I've never had a landlord try to screw us like this before so I don't even know where to start."	No
Hello Reddit,    Thank you for reading my post. This is a throwaway account. I’ve been renting from a 60-year old retired man for a bit over 4 months now. August is my last month in town (I’m moving to a different town for college in September). Yesterday he got extremely angry (details are included 2 paragraphs later) and started an argument with me, yelling, cussing and insulting me before telling me “You are bugging the sh*t out of me, I want you out of my f****** house by Sunday.” When I told him he couldn’t do that even though we don’t have an official lease, he said “this is my house, I can kick you out whenever the hell I want. All we have is a handshake”, before he pointed at my face and yelled “F*** you, and f*** whoever wants to f*** with me like that, you can lawyer up and you’re gonna get f***ed.”     That was about 14 hours ago. I don’t think I want to be around him anymore, but I’m not sure whether he can actually screw me over completely. I have already paid full rent for my remaining time here (Aug 1 - Sep 15, 1.5 months’ rent) in cash. He did say he’d give me my money back, but I don’t know if I can trust him. Also it feels like the way he treats me is almost harrasment -- the reason he got so angry is because I was cooking in the kitchen instead of on the grill in the yard, which “heats up the house”. The next paragraphs are a more detailed description of his reasoning.       Starting from the first day he’s been coming up with random rules. The first week he told me whenever I cook meat I have to wrap the meat packaging in a plastic bag and put it in the trash can outside of the house, because he doesn’t want the meat wrappers attracting mice and bugs. Then he complained about me not being social with him: he “didn’t like the way I set up my room as an efficient apartment”, because he wanted “someone to have casual conversations with”. I have a computer desk set up in my room. I’m not home that much -- I get off work at 5 and am usually out and about until 8pm. I’ll get home, make food and go to my room to eat / play video games. He complained about me not sitting down at the dining table with him to eat my food and not making enough small talks with him (which I do whenever I run into him in the house). He also complained about having my girlfriend over -- I used to have my ex-girlfriend over before we broke up, and now he’s saying I should have talked to him before I started to bring over my current girlfriend, even though I asked him if I could have overnight guests before I moved in and he said yes. Last week when I asked him to help me with a landlord’s reference for a rental application I’m filling out for my new place, he told me he did’t have time for my personal issues and got very upset.     The worst of it all is the kitchen access restriction. Early July he told me to stop using the kitchen inside the house and instead use the stove on the grill in the backyard, to “keep the house cool through the summer”. So I got a pressure cooker thinking it’d be a good alternative. He still repeatedly yelled at me whenever I do the minimum amount of cooking in the kitchen, like frying an egg in the morning. After a week he told me to stop using the pressure cooker and rice cooker inside the hosue and take them outside whenever I use them. And that’s what triggered him yesterday. I had the pressure cooker running in the kitchen around 7 pm and he just flipped out. He was cussing, yelling and flipping me off for about an hour. I even thought about calling the police on him because I felt harrassed and threatened.     If you’ve made it this far, thank you for your time. Any input is appreciated.	No
I filed for custody for my 2 year old daughter in June 19. I received a letter from respondant's attorney stating that I failed to provide blank forms for a continuance. After going back to court they confirmed that I did not include it and advised me to contact a lawyer on how to respond. I do not have $2500 to hire a lawyer and they don't allow a payment plan. I'm not sure what to do. Please assist. Thank you.	No
The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	No
Hi everyone   Long story short.  I was living in grand rapids Michigan.  I got an opportunity to move to new York city and I took it.  My landlord did not accept subleasers so I paid the last two months of my lease even though I wasn't living there.    I did NOT notify my landlord I had moved out.   The lease expires on July 31st.  Today I got an email saying per my lease agreement my lease had automatically renewed.  The lease does say it will automatically renew without thirty days notice.  I had no memory of this until I received the email.  Is there anything I can do?	No
As the title suggests, the gas meter stopped working a couple of years ago and my dad never reported it and no one from the gas company ever checked or inquired. I told my dad that he could get into trouble sooner or later but he is too stubborn about this. He believes that it is their duty to check it and correct the issue. So i guess this is how it will go on. What could be the legal consequences of this if they find out later? Will my dad be held accountable?	No
My low income (not section 8) apartment building nickels and dimes us for every single little thing. There are some built in lights in the unit, but none in the bedrooms. You're expected to provide your own lamps for your bedroom. The apartment wants to charge us $10 each for these odd lightbulbs that don't screw in, they plug in. They claim that they cost $10 so we're only paying for the cost of the bulbs. Now I haven't been able to find these bulbs in stores, but I found some online and the most expensive one was $5.51 each. I have never been charged for lightbulbs in an apartment.  Since these lightbulbs are replacing burnt out ones that go in the lighting fixtures built into their property, and the tenants are expected to provide their own light source in certain rooms, I don't think the tenants should be paying double the cost for the bulbs. Thoughts?	No
"Hello and thank you for reading. I live in Wisconsin.  In June 2016 I signed a lease that commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017. This was my first time renting an apartment and I was unaware that it is common etiquette to provide 30 days notice before moving. I did not provide 30 days notice, instead I messaged my landlord a few days before moving. Today (7/11/17) I just received a text message from my landlord stating that I must pay the rent for July or they will take me to court, and that I should have given 30 days notice.   Here's the details: * The term of my lease commenced on July 1st, 2016 and ended on June 30th, 2017 * There was no automatic renewal clause * I did not receive written notice 15-30 days prior to the ending of the lease that there was an automatic renewal clause  * Nothing was written in the lease stating I had to give 30 days (or any number of days) notice before leaving  The only relevant wording I can find in the lease are these two statements:  * ""Upon giving written notice no later than 60 days before the expiration of the term of this Lease, the Tenant may renew this Lease for an additional term""   * ""During the last 30 days of this Lease, the Landlord or the Landlord's agents will have the privilege of displaying the usual 'For Sale' or 'For Rent' or 'Vacancy' signs on the Premises""   I feel bad for breaking common etiquette and not letting my landlord know prior to 30 days, but I'm not reading anything from Wisconsin that states I have to legally give 30 days notice. So, legally, does my landlord have a case against me?  I really appreciate your advice and time."	No
So In January I signed a lease for an apartment with three of my friends. In February I was diagnosed with GBS. A rare spinal cord disease. Now I'm unsure on my ability to return to school (3 hours from home) this semester. My university wants me to wait one more semester before I return. Can my medical status be used to get out of my lease? 	No
"Alright, folks. I am a single mom who was renting a townhouse apartment in Beaverton, Oregon. Trying to cut costs a bit, I decided to get a roommate. I posted an ad on Craigslist and got a hit from a woman (let's call her Ally) who came over to view the place. She seemed relatively normal, passed a criminal background check, and was able to provide me with recent pay stubs. I agreed to let her move in and told her that she just needed to get her name on the lease within two weeks (per my lease agreement).  A week after moving in, I received a call from Child Protective Services, stating that they were concerned for the safety and well being of my three year old daughter. Obviously, I was super confused, so the caseworker explained that she had been informed by Ally's mom that Ally had moved into an apartment providing childcare in exchange for rent and that Ally has a long history with DHS due to child abuse and neglect charges against her own two children that have been removed from her custody. I immediately explained that a) my daughter comes to work with me everyday (I work at a preschool), b) I had NO idea that Ally had that type of history (Ally has never been arrested for the abuse and neglect, so it didn't show up on a background check), and c) that I was under the impression that Ally had a job and could pay rent that way.  Right after that phone call, I sent a text to Ally telling her that she needed to find a new place to live in the next two weeks. In the meantime, my daughter and I stayed with family. Ally wasn't happy about it, but she agreed. The night before Ally was supposed to be out of the apartment, she sent me a text stating that she had rights and that she wasn't going to be leaving anytime soon. I called the police, but they told me that even though she wasn't on the lease, she had ""established residence"" and that I would have to file for a legal eviction notice with the courts (and pay the hefty filing fees). I called my apartment manager and explained the situation to her as well, but she told me that since I had an ""unauthorized tenant"" living in the apartment, I was going to receive a 72-hour eviction notice, but if I broke my lease ($1600 fee), I could save myself from having an eviction on my record and the complex would handle the eviction process of Ally. So, that's what I did and I terminated my lease on April 1st by handing in my keys and giving a written notice of my intent to terminate the lease.  Meanwhile, after I moved my daughter and I out, Ally moved in her boyfriend (whom she has a no-contact order with due to prior domestic abuse issues), her two dogs, a parrot, and her 3 adult bunnies (who quickly multiplied).  Well, after eviction notices, court appearances, and finally changed locks, Ally and her boyfriend moved out on June 30th... nearly 3 months after I moved out. I am now being footed the bill for those three months of rent (1150/month), the apartment's electricity (even though I turned off the electricity from the electric company), storage fees (due to the things that they left behind when they finally moved out), and an estimated $8000 in damages (upstairs carpeting and downstairs kitchen linoleum has to be completely replaced, due to massive amounts of bunny feces and urine, several doors and walls need to be replaced/repaired due to holes, plumbing repair due to them flushing something down the toilet that busted a pipe, and a new refrigerator, since the door was broken off) because she was not on the lease.  I have spoken briefly with an attorney, but he said that since it was my name and I ""violated the lease agreement"" by moving someone in that wasn't on the lease (even though she was supposed to get on it within the two weeks), I probably don't have much of a chance against the apartment complex. He suggested that I could sue Ally, but she doesn't have any money to speak of (apparently she forged the pay stubs she gave me and hasn't worked in over three years) and I don't want to dig my hole deeper by adding on a bunch of court and attorney costs.  What do I do...???"	No
She talked me into staying with her because she said I had commitment issues.  She made herself my personal caretaker isolating me away from professionals, church, friends and family.  I trusted her more than myself because of dogmatic Mormon views of Husband and Wife and benevolence of mental health professionals.  She talked cryptically about gas lighting, life insurance and suicide protection but ducted out at the idea that she pay it incase I am instituted and can't.   She lastly brought up a polyamorous marriage. I said she was cheating when she left for weekends without contact. She gave me 30 days to get out of her parents house (she was already pushing her parents into nursing homes for).	No
I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this	No
"I don't think this is reasonable, but I'm not sure what I can do to counter it! This is in Boston, MA.   A few weeks ago I ordered a shirt in support of a charity involving veterinary care for neglected and abandoned animals. My workplace was having a special event where everyone would wear things like that and others would donate. I know it doesn't sound relevant, but surprisingly it is. Unlike other ""brands"" that have promotional products made by outsourced companies like teefury, the founder of this charity is involved in the firearm industry and apparently got a company that usually sells things related to that to make the shirts instead. Not a big deal, if anything the shirt itself is much nicer quality!    Unfortunately they shipped the shirt to me in a box with the firearm company's name/logo on it.    Unbeknownst to me my apartment complex has a set of rules (that I was never told, I rent from a different management company) that restricts the possession of firearms of any sort. Again, this was never mentioned to me in my lease or any paperwork regarding the building. It never really mattered since I don't own any weapons but it'd be nice to know.   Packages are dropped off beyond the first set of locked doors but still within a common area. It's just a big pile and you dig through and take what has your name on it. I work long hours so I got the delivery notice after I got to work and was excited to pick it up when I got home that evening. Much to my dismay my box wasn't there when I finally arrived. I figured it might have gotten stolen since that was an issue in the past. When I went upstairs to my apartment I found a note slipped under my door explaining that a ""concerned tenant"" recognized the company name and reported my box to the building's management. They came and confiscated the box before I got home. I called my own property manager and she admitted that she forgot to call me but the box was dropped at their office by the building manager that afternoon.    I headed over to the office and picked up my box which was, surprise, opened. I was a little shocked by that since I was under the impression that it's a felony to open someone else's mail. My property manager said that she didn't open it, the building manager did in an attempt to ""catch"" me buying firearm accessories. Naturally they found a charity tshirt instead.   I was (and am) still annoyed but it was just the shirt and it was totally undamaged. However I ordered some tea from amazon earlier this week and had the same problem again. They ""held"" my package when it arrived since I'm now a person of interest. This time they didn't open it and just passed the box along to my management company and insisted that it be opened with witnesses to prove that it isn't gun related. It's tea. Sleepytime tea, probably the least threatening thing possible.    I don't understand why they're doing this, I've been in this apartment for two years with absolutely no issues. Why they think I'm ordering firearms online is beyond me. This whole ""monitoring"" of my orders seems like it'll be a huge pain, my management company is too far to walk so each time I have to go to them I have to take an uber. Those costs add up!    Do I have any right to demand they leave my mail alone? From what I can tell they don't look in my locked mail slot since a tiny package that was put in there the same day wasn't taken while the tea was. It also sounds like it's the building management, not my specific apartment's management that's doing this. I talked to my manager and she said she can't do anything since they give the packages to the secretary. If I do have a case to get them to back off, are there any actual laws I can cite? Do the bylaws of the building trump the city/state laws? They aren't taking my packages intending to keep them, they just seem to want me to open everything in front of someone else. Does it still count as witholding mail if they aren't asking for anything in return? I don't know how this would deter me from just buying things in person though, it doesn't make much sense it they intend to prevent purchases.    Any help would be fantastic!"	No
I was moving into a new apartment building and received an email from management that due to delays in building, I will not be able to move in September 1st as per my lease. Obviously this is frustrating considering not only does one expect a unit when you sign a lease, but they also only gave 1 month's notice when I signed the lease about 6 months ago.  They offered two remedies:  1) Break the lease free of consequence and not live there  2) Move in January 1st and receive $1,500  Luckily, I can stay with my parents who live nearby if I have to so I'm not homeless. The situation seems ridiculous.   Am I owed more than this by the management company? $1,500 is just slightly more than one month's rent and this is a massive inconvenience. Per the lease, if I had been living there and moved out prior to the terms of the lease, I would have owed two months rent, but they're not even offering that. The lease obviously says nothing about them not holding it up, but I'm assuming there's some kind of renter's rights.	No
I'm just wondering if I'm opening myself up to anything here. I bought a car last year and was told that it had a clean title. When I asked if it had been in any accidents they avoided the question. I Carfaxed the car a couple months ago and found out it was a total loss rebuilt that is somehow not marked on the title.   I submitted a BBB complaint and the owner has done nothing but make up lies, saying I was told about the damage and repair before purchase, and even lying by saying I hadn't driven the car prior to purchase.  It's ridiculous, and at this point if I'm not going to be compensated I will make sure others know about their practices.	No
Is there anything against selling an appliance or device that has roaches? A friend of mine bought a ps4 on Facebook group and it stopped working the next day and found out it was full of roaches. Previous Owner blocked us.	No
"Good afternoon. I am a family friend of a disabled person who is in a bit of a pickle, and I'm wondering if you can point me to relevant information on how to proceed.    Quite a mouthful: My family friend has cognitive disabilities that are evident. He went to the mall on a day trip, where a third party salesman at a kiosk talked him into buying more than 1500 dollars worth of gift cards (rather than using his card or cash, which raises alarms since gift cards are notorious liasons for fraud) which were then used to purchase a multitude of accessories, two phones, and a new line of service. A new account was set up under his name. The kiosk entered their own email into his account though, he was not told his username or how to access it, and the security questions were not asked. The store must have put random information in, because when trying to access his account with common answers he gives to those questions, they are all wrong. I believe this was purposeful as the incorrect info made it very difficult to access the account or petition for a refund.   When he arrived home and this was all discovered, the phones and accessories were returned in full with ample time left on their return conditions.   He took back everything to the same kiosk and was told to expect a ""corporate check"" in a few weeks to his home address (we don't know if the address they have is correct, since the information on the account is not accessable due of the incorrect info filled in by the kiosk salesman...) Unfortunately when he returned these products, they handed him one return reciept which was folded- it shows only the return of the accessories, totalling about 185 dollars. The phones he returned are NOT listed on this, and this was not found out until later. They kept his orginal purchase reciept when he made the return.   It has been 2 months and no refund has been received, no corporate contact will speak with us or confirm that they have the reciept of this phone purchase in their system. They refer us only the the kiosk. The third party kiosk has not returned our calls. I am starting to worry that he was the victim of opportunistic fraud and that this is not a civil case.   So, what do you think of all this? Should we pursue civil action/arbitration over the untimely refund, or does this sound like a criminal matter to involve police in? We are unsure what to do and are very unsettled. Thank you!"	No
Ok, so I'm going to use 'wife' b/c that's how we considered ourselves, but we never filed a marriage license.  My wife moved out June 21 and took our nearly 5 yr old daughter with her.  I've seen my daughter less than 8 hours since then, spread across about 3 widely separated days.  Tuesday I had a massive panic attack due to everything that's going on, and apparently my texts to wife were too much for her. She cut off all communication and told me not to contact her.  Previous to this, even that night, she would have our daughter call me almost every evening ranging from about 9-11pm.   Well, last night, no call.  My wife has untreated depression, and while were together she would often stay in bed all day, barely, if at all, supervising our daughter during the day. I have multiple people who can attest to this.  She has also said to me that she has had suicidal thoughts, but she doesn't act on them due to not wanting to abandon our daughter.  I have reason to believe this is still the case where she is staying.  I have been told that I have enough reason to call 911 and have her committed. I have not done this b/c I believed she was not a danger. But w/o contact, I am much less sure.  I do not want to take such drastic action, as I believe that would destroy any possibility of us reconciling, but if I become convinced that our daughter may suffer, then I must.  She currently has my car, b/c when she left she did NOT tell me she 'was leaving' but that she was going to spend a few days at her dad's, which isn't unusual. I haven't asked for the car back yet, b/c I love this woman, and I believe that we could rebuild the foundation of our relationship and work things out.  My basic question, however, is that w/o having daily contact with my daughter, I do not know what level of care she is getting, and that worries me. What can I do?!  Super stressed, so this was a bit rambling. I'll answer any ?'s I can.	No
My grandmother is currently in the struggle of becoming the new executor of her family's property. The property was left to all five of her siblings, only three remain alive. This is not the main issue here however. While she has been working to get the situation resolved, there has been a man living on the property taking care of it as a favor to her now deceased sister's daughter. My grandmother does not live in the state anymore so she can not live on the property herself.   Ive heard that after 7 years of living on a property in California, a squatter can legally claim ownership of the property. Is this true? From what I've gathered from my grandparents (they are getting old and hard to talk to) he has been living there for 5 years now almost. What can she do to remove said squatter? What can be done to get someone to take care of the property without them claiming it?	No
In 2013 my boyfriend  was working at a gas station. They were short handed and he was the only one working in the store and it was quite busy. He wasn't paying close enough attention to an ID and ended up selling cigarettes to a minor that was a few months from being of legal age in a sting. Obviously we expected a ticket and probably for him to lose his job which did happen but he also ended up being charged with a misdemeanor and the charge was endangering a minor. His lawyer told him that basically he can never get this expunged and its been hindering his search for better paying jobs. He only has a job right now because he knew someone in the company and they let him explain the charge. He feels like anytime someone sees it they automatically think hes a child abuser and bad person. Is there anyway to make this go away at some point or will he be stuck with it forever? 	No
So back in April I got a new prescription for my glasses. The doctor tells me that due to my eyes needing two different prescriptions I may feel a little crossed eyed for a few days. I take his advice, go next door to the glasses store to pick out new frames, etc., and I'm told they'd be ready in about two weeks. Two weeks later I pick them up and notice the cross eyed sensation immediately but think nothing of it. A couple more weeks go by and I still feel crossed eyed while wearing my new glasses when I get into a minor accident while backing up my work truck. I honestly didn't put two and two together until I got into yet another almost identical accident soon after. The next day to go back to store  where I got my glasses to have them checked and they say it must be the fault of the eye doctor. Lucky for me both places are next door (I don't think they're affiliated though) and they deny it's their fault saying this store has had this issue before. That being said, I walk back into the store, tell them what my doctor's office said and they say something along the lines of if they had known I went to this particular doctor they wouldn't have sent me away due to this guy being a super hotshot eye doctor or something who's apparently never wrong. This time they actually bother to look at my glasses and it turns out my prescription is focused in the lower corners of my lenses instead of over my pupils. As you would expect they replaced my lenses (another couple of weeks). I recorded the whole ordeal (audio not video) on my phone but didn't mention anything about the accidents to them so not to spook them but now I fear this whole mess may effect my career later on down the line. I had to beg my employers to allow me to keep driving, not to the financial penalties(a whole other story I'm not worrying about right now unless you guys suggest otherwise). My main concern is my driving record. With aspirations of pursuing a new career that also requires me to drive a work vehicle I fear this whole mess may have stunted my professional growth.   TL;DR I got into a couple of of work related accidents within a short period of time of getting a new pair of poorly crafted glasses and have an audio recording of  the company admitting thier mistake. Now I fear this may hurt my career long term due to tarnish driving record.   Do I have any opitions or am I screwed for life?	No
So my fiancée went to Alfred Angelo for her dress, paid in full for dress and alterations. Receipts are all documented paper copies. The seamstress (outside contractor)  just called to tell us about that and now she is wanting payment for the alterations because Alfred Angelo never paid her. Called Alfred Angelo local store and they said they could do nothing. Customer service line is already shut off. It's only a matter of $279.00 USD but the point remains. What can we do?   Location: Pittsburgh PA  Edit: Cleared up who the seamstress works for	No
I'm a minor in Virginia and a few months back I got caught with a guy I met off of Grindr who I was trying to buy meth from. At Juvenile and Domestics court, I was told he took the plea deal and everything was done and if they needed me, they would call me back. I just got a different subpoena today for circuit court. Between the time I thought everything was over with and the subpoena for circuit court I have traded pictures with other guys and hooked up with other guys as well.  I currently don't have any charges on me and was considered a victim in the case. Is it possible for them to place charges on me for hooking up with other guys without telling them my age?	No
Hello, my name is logan I am fifteen and about to turn 16 in two months and I have a very important question. Me and my mother have been constantly fighting for three years she has put me through abusive relationships with boyfriends, took my money, did drugs and slept for a whole two weeks while I got raped while i was walking to gas station and much more that has ruined my life due to her immaturity. She lost her job for pepper spraying me and she blames me for ruining her life all the time. I suffer each day and I just want to be free at this point. I am about to get a job at wall mart and I get a social security check each month (haven't seen a dollar of it since I was born). My plea to the judge will be that I want to be Emancipated so that I may be released from my pain of having to live with this monster and start my life. She has not had a job in 8 months and isnt getting one and just lives off my social security. I also have a sister who is 31 and is willing to give me a place to live till i can get enough money to go on my own. Yes I know this sounds like every teenage plea that their parents are horrible and that they are mature but this is different. I have attempted suicide many times and my childhood is basically over and I dont really see a point to go on at all but either way I just want to get out. Do you think I will be accepted for Emancipation in your opinion or not I just want some sort of reassurance. Thank you for the read and im willing to answer any questions.	No

Tim and Barbara have a marriage ceremony in 2007 in South Carolina, and fill out the applications for a marriage license (one for the judge, one for govt agency, and one for their own records), but do not file them because they want to continue receiving social security benefits from Tim's first wife who passed away. Instead, they opt to store those filled out by unsubmitted documents in a box in their closet.  The two live together, but do not file taxes together, do not share bills for many years, and have almost entirely separate finances.  Tim has recently passed away. Would they be considered married by common law in South Carolina, or would their not filing a marriage license application and continued receipt of social security for Tim's previous wife be sufficient evidence that they did not intend to marry? If so, how would this be presented to the court that makes this determination?  I apologize if my understanding of common law marriage is lacking, I'm still researching the subject and don't have any legal knowledge outside of what I've picked up on Reddit and a few other sources. Thank you for your time!	No
"Hello /r/legaladvice, so one day this past week I came home (we live in Raleigh, NC) in the evening to find that a pipe had burst on the 2nd story of my town home and flooded the entire thing. My SO and I do not have rental insurance but, luckily, almost nothing of ours was destroyed. We immediately contacted our landlord and water damage contractors came out the next day to rip out all of the carpet/tiling on the first floor and take out lots of the sheetrock/drywall throughout the townhome. Also the HVAC is pretty trashed. I am also lucky to have lots of family in the area so we have easily found places to live temporarily for the foreseeable future. Our landlord is just now beginning to get quotes for contractors to repair the place (once the water damage is under control/no mold) and its somewhat looking like September before it will be live-able again.  The general question I have is am I entitled to request money for certain things from my landlord?  Our landlord is just ""some guy"" and we are lucky to have a pretty good relationship with him (we only know him from renting the place). I have already had a conversation with him that we are not paying rent until the place is live-able again (obviously) but I have not discussed any other matters. Also, because we do not have a very accurate estimate of when the place will be live-able again, we have not discussed potentially breaking the lease with our landlord and finding another place.  After reading our lease, this is the most applicable section for our problem:  &gt;**Destruction of Premises:** In the event the leased premises shall be destroyed or rendered totally untenable by fire, windstorm, or any other cause beyond the control of Landlord, then this Lease shall cease and terminate as of the date of such destruction, and the rent shall then be accounted for between Landlord and Tenant  up to the time of such damage or destruction of said premises as if being prorated as of that date. In the event the leased premises are damaged by fire, windstorm or other cause beyond the control of Landlord so as to render the same partially untenable, but repairable withing a reasonable time, then this lease shall remain in force and effect and the Landlord shall, within said reasonable time, restore said premises to substantially the condition the premises were in prior to said damage, and there shall be an abatement in rent in proportion to the relationship the damaged portion of the lease premises bears to the whole of said premises.  Some more specific questions I have:  * Is my landlord supposed to give me money to live somewhere else (via his insurance)? Or is this something that rental insurance would cover? Landlord already knows I have lots of family in the area and am staying with them for free.  * Is my landlord obligated to pay our utilities while we are not living there? I'm pretty certain he should be obligated to pay the huge water bill and huge electrical bill from the damage &amp; repair of the place.  * I feel like the lease is very vague with regards to ""repairable within a reasonable time""... do both us and our landlord basically just have to agree that the repairs are not going to happen in ""reasonable time"" if we both want to breach the lease? What happens if the landlord disagrees with us thinking it is not ""reasonable time""?  Any other tips/suggestions would be much appreciated!  FYI, posted in /r/personalfinance but was recommended over here."	No
Good day /r/legaladvice!  I desperately seek advice in family law. My 'boy'friend had a girlfriend last year who - when he wanted to leave her - stopped taking the pill and got pregnant without telling him early on so then she couldn't have an abortion. Fast forward to today - she got the baby and he still lives extremely unhappy at her place not knowing what he should do, as this is also a financial matter for him. So to this point they are not really together anymore but he just keeps things up as they are - he has his own room in her apartment and also takes care of his baby. Now this takes place in switzerland where we have a law since this year that men don't only need to pay for the kid but also for the kid's mother even if they were not married before. Now for what she has done to him (and even more in the past) he doesn't want to pay money for her but only for his kid. Also because she works currently 60% and still earns more than he does when he works 100%. She could be completely self sustainable. Now she told him, if he leaves her for real, she will stop working just so he will have to pay her shitloads of money. He is now completely devastated and doesn't know how he wouldn't also become financially ruined by her.  Now I had this idea and I don't know if it would work and here I need your advice. I just bought an apartment and therefore I basically have a debt of 800'000$ - and as he and I anyway want to be together in case he manages to finally leave that place, I thought I could bring my 800'000$ debt into more use.  Now if I would let him join my debt, would he still have to pay her or could he get out like that? I mean he would probably not be able to get a loan after she would go after his money, but if he joins my debt before she has the chance to do so, he wouldn't be able to pay her aswell?  Or do you have any other idea what a guy could do to save himself from a corrupt girlfriend like this?  Also, what happens if he would leave, but gets at one point a new family. Will this reduce the payments to his current girlfriend because he needs more money to sustain his own family?	No
Ok, so a few months back I met this white girl from GSU on Tinder. I fucked her ONCE but nothing serious and haven't heard from her since. Now she messaged me on Facebook and says that she's pregnant and that I'm the father which is BS and she wants me to pay for the expenses and pay child support. She's a huge slut and has probably slept with dozens of guys and there's no way I'm the father I used a fucking condom. Anyways I'm broke and here on a scholarship and can't afford nothing and even if I could I wouldn't as I'm not the father. She said she'll get a lawyer even though I don't know how her redneck ass can afford one. So how can I deal with this bitch?????	No
[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6lw36b/bicyclist_runs_stop_sign_hits_my_bike_breaks_her/) for some context.   If a lawyer sends me something in the mail but I never received it, can they keep going forward with some process without my knowledge?	No
Our landlord was a super friendly guy, until we told him we were buying a house and not continuing to rent his condo. He doesn't live in our state, had his brother show us the condo prior to our moving in. We asked about damages and the brother said that the damages were previously addressed but couldn't be resolved without pulling up carpet. We wanted the condo so decided it wasn't a big deal. We have rugs. Bought a house. Moved in. As of last week landlord, who happens to be in town, is saying these carpet issues were due to us. Also saying that we smoked in the unit. That is blatantly clear and the unit smells like smoke. Neither of us are smokers. Claims I told him my SO was a smoker and I was trying to get him to quit. That conversation never happened...becuase neither of us smoke! Wants to keep over half of the deposit due to smoking in unit and carpet damage. He also never gave 24 hr notice of when he would enter condo. Also doesn't have designed person in our state to deal with legality, said brother was just helping out by showing....	No
4 people moved into a 4 bedroom 2 bathroom house. 2 were a couple sharing a master bedroom/bath. The 4th bedroom was to be used as an office for all our our computers. Rent was decided to be split evenly with utilities since two people were staying in the master bedroom we thought it would be fair. $1800/4 = $450 + Utilities each. This was our initial agreement moving into the home together. This topped out the budget of 3 people, but we agreed to move in under these conditions regardless.  About a month into the 1 year lease the couple broke up and one moved out but is still paying rent. The one that moved out didn't want cause any problems so they said they would pay rent but not utilities until we could find a suitable roommate to take over. This put two of them almost at absolute max in terms of budget. Well after 3 months we are not able to find a roommate, definitely not a lack of trying. No one just wants to pay the money for the space offered.  The ex-roommate that moved but that is still paying rent wants to try and figure out a way to reduce cost for themselves. The options the ex-roommate suggested:  1)They offered a solution to increase our rent $50 dollars each a month and they pay $300. This would eliminate the need for a new roommate, but would put the current roommates over budget. 2)Opt out of our lease for $1800 x 3 month rent = $5,400 opt cost  /4 people = $1350 each to get out of the contract early. This doesn't seem like an option for 1/2 the parties involved and the other 1/2 just don't want to burn the money. 3) Get a roommate to completely offset cost. 4) She will just quit making payments and let the housing management / legal take it from there.  None of these options seem great, but at the end of the day the person giving the options was the same person that encouraged us to go top end of our budget. We don't want to increase cost, but we also don't want to get hurt legally.  Can she just simply get out of the lease and leave us with the burden?	No
I apologize in advance for this long post. I'm located in North Carolina and am a student at a public university. When I transferred in, I applied for on-campus housing but was told that due to the extensive wait list I most likely would not get a room. So I looked for an apartment. I met two people who needed another roommate because theirs was moving out. I signed the lease the morning of July 21st, and later that day I got an email from campus housing after 5:00pm notifying me that I had been assigned to on-campus housing. I called the housing office on Monday and was told that all I needed to do was send them a copy of my lease and it would be taken care of. I did so, and heard nothing. I went into the office yesterday to make sure everything was taken care of. The lady at the front desk admitted to me that she looked at the email and forgot about it, admitting that she didn't do her job. I explained the situation and was told that the date on my lease was August 1st, I already knew about my housing assignment and they were going to charge me a $3,000 cancellation fee, half of the entire years rent for half of a dorm room. I explained that since it was a sublease, I was simply added to the lease and I signed it on the 21st. I showed the people in the housing office texts that I had signed the lease on the 21st but they said that they needed something official from the apartment complex. I went to the complex and explained my situation and they printed out an email exchange with their official email on it that proved that I had started the process and signed the lease on the 1st. I took that over to university housing and they said that the cancellation fee would be waived based on this. I went online to cancel my housing and got an email asking for proof that I had already signed the lease by the time that my on-campus housing assignment was available.  At this point I believe I'm being given the run around by the campus housing to get me to pay the fee. Do I need a lawyer to contest this?	No
Hello. My father is abusive not physcially but is down right evil and awfull.  We are stuck in this shitty situation. My parents never taught us how to drive. And we never went to college. Cuz no money. Now im wondering the house was given to my mom from her father. All the bills are in my fathers name. My mom and dad have a shared bank account but hes the holder. I dont think if we went to any law for help it would be in our favor because of that. Any help? Do i need to start recording his crazy antics? 	No
"For as far as I googled, you only can really change your name if youre a) getting married/divorce, b) on the run, or c) are transgender. I just really hate my name, and pretty much every nicknamed derived from it for my entire life. It's not an abnormal name, I just feel like it doesn't fit me AT ALL and hearing other people call me it/derivations of it always makes me cringe. It has been and still is really hard for me to imagine the rest of my life hearing others calling me that, thinking about that name being the one on my degree, and seeing it on my IDs and associating it with me. Is there a way I can word or a name change request form for a judge to not think I'm being stupid or having a phase. The name I want to change into is fairly common (I'm thinking ""Cody"" or ""Ryan""), but I am female so I don't know if it will be taken seriously."	No
My girlfriend and I were wondering if in Indiana state she can transfer the deed to her house that's only in her name into my name so we can force him to stop coming over and causing trouble. Little background  State is Indiana  County is Allen  City is fort Wayne They have been separated 2 years, he's an abusive stalker with tons of money from a settlement from a death in his family.  Twice now he has put protective orders on her to get possession of the house temporarily and go through and steal our stuff.  The divorce is still a ways away as there is a lot of fighting of tons of assets.    Is it possible to put the house in my name to keep him from coming over?	No
Hi all,  I've recently renewed my lease read over it several times and saw that the management increased the rent from what was previously discussed. They argued price includes utilities the lease however only said it included pest control. I told the entire office this(4 people) this and all of said that the total lease amount is all I'd pay. I was dumb, too trusting and signed the lease electronically. Today I got an email that said that my lease did not include any of the utilities including pest control.   Can I legally break the lease without financial penalty for them charging me a dollar a month for pest control when it was explicitly said in the lease that it was included?  I live in Florida.	No
"We live in NC and currently the temperature is mid to upper 90's every day. Yesterday, I smelled a burning in our house, like a plastic burning, but could not find any source. It happened once or twice over the next hour or two then stopped. I thought it was weird, but didn't fret too much. The wiring in this house is very ""eccentric"" and I wrote it off.  That happened around 10 am. Around 1 pm I looked at the thermostat. It was ~84 F in the house when the temperature was set to 74 F. This had happened before so I wasn't super concerned. Last time it was because I had left the blinds on our large glass sliding doors up and they let a LOT of sun in. I shut the blinds.  The temperature didn't go down. At the behest of my fiance (I wanted to see if it cooled down over night) I called the land lord and told him that we needed an AC repair. This was thursday night.  Friday morning, the house had stayed the same temperature overnight. My fiance left to take an exam and I stayed in the house. By 9 am it was 90 F in the house. By noon it was 94. Through this I kept texting the landlord saying that this was an emergency and that we needed the fix asap. He stated that he had called the company his home warranty group contracts with and they were just waiting for the service number to come in.   (An aside: we rented this house specifically for this warranty. It was a selling point. ""You call me (landlord) and within 24 hours they will be in contact with you."" I checked the lease, he doesn't mention it. Of course.)  I call my fiance and organize taking our pets to her veterinarian office (she is a vet and works there) for the day, thinking that we'd get it repaired quickly. Around 3 pm the landlord tells me that due to large volume they wouldn't be able to come until 9 am to 1 pm MONDAY.  I tell him this is unacceptable. It is 99 F in our house. (It is hotter but our thermostat doesn't go into triple digits. Why would it?) I tell him that I know it's not his fault but he has failed us and that he needs to contract with a new repair company. He goes into some platitudes about how he knows it's hot but that he and his family have had to deal with it before. Just open the windows and reverse the fans. And he won't get a new company because it won't be under warranty. And this is an emergency call. The soonest anyone else could get out there was wednesday.  I then let my fiance handle him for a bit. She's chomping at the bit. After more runaround he gives her the same spiel about it being hard. She calls another repair company ""OurCityName Heating and Air"". They say they can be out here on Saturday (today) and it will cost $50 plus the cost of repairs.  We ask our landlord if we can hire them and prorate the rent for the repairs (assuming it's less than our rent). No again. Out of warranty. We try and explain that this is very expensive to us. We're in a new town and having to stay in hotels AND board our pets and that we need help.  Doesn't care.  So what can we do? Our house is literally unlivable right now. It's summer in the south. It's not getting cooler any time soon. We are having to pay out of pocket for lodging and board for our pets."	No
So back in January I decided to sign a lease at an apartment that was going under construction. Come today, I get an email saying that the apartment wont be ready for me to move in, and the move in date has been pushed back three months and I have no place to live for a while. They gave us two options; Option 1: Move out, cancel our lease and collect our security deposit like nothing ever happend. Option 2: delay the move in date, and then upon moving in in December, collect $1500 dollars as compensation for the three months of waiting about. I'm saying that option 2 is a no go just because we can't find a place to live for 3 months. I also think that we would still have a clime to some money because of the inconvenience that they are causing us, it is getting very hard to find a place here on the university this late in the game. I'm wondering if we can claim something as an inconvenience. No where in the lease does it say that they can cancel our lease. What do you think?	No
We had an argument over a pizza since I realized I forgot my wallet when we got to the restaurant. So we drive back home and I'm trying to de-escalate the situation. I accidentally spill his drink and bend over to place it upright, but while I'm bent over he picks me up, walks over to my car and throws me against the car door. He picks me up again, I'm scratching at his arms in an effort to get him to let go, he throws me on the street and kicks me in the leg. He then gets on his hands and knees over me and I'm biting and scratching to get him off. When that doesn't work scream for someone to call for help. When to cops get there they arrest us both because we both had injuries and they don't know who started the fight. The only witness was the neighbor who called the cops and told them they saw a male on top of a female. We're both being charged for class 4 misdemeanor domestic assault. I've never had any legal troubles in the past and I'm mainly just worried that he will try to spin the story to make me look bad. It's pretty much just my word against his, aside from our injuries. What is likely to happen in this situation?	No
"Alright, so I was just recently a room mate with a female friend. She has bipolar disorder and tends to blow everything way out of proportion.  So we were not on good terms anymore and she began to act irrational lately. I had been experiencing increased stress and losing sleep because of this, so I wanted to talk to her as little as possible. Well, she got angry about how our trash cans were near the dining room. She began banging stuff around and yelling at me. Then I here a loud banging at the door and she goes to open the door. My neighbor comes in walks quickly up to me and grabs my face. He then attempts to put me into a rear naked choke. I keep telling him to stop and leave our apartment. I ""lead"" him to my room and he makes me kneel on the ground right next to my desk drawers and sits in my chair. He punches me and asked if I liked getting beat too. He kept yelling at me why I was hitting my room mate. To be clear, I was not doing that, at all. I said I was not and he yelled saying I was calling my roomie a liar. He asked if I feared for my life and I did. He said he would kill me and bash my skull in  multiple times. While this was happening, his wife was telling me that I need to leave or she would call the police to take me away.  I made sure we went to my room because my phone was there and my handgun was in my desk. I remained as submissive as I could to defuse the situation as much as I could. I was very scared and was crying pretty badly. He allowed me to call the police and he, his wife, and my roomie left the apartment to wait for the police to arrive.  Now, I was pretty fucking scared and experiencing bad panic attacks. I reached in my desk and grabbed my gun while I was on the phone. I let them know what was happening and that I needed cops right away. I let them know that I had legal justification to use deadly force and would use it if he tried to come after me again. I'm very glad he didn't because I did not want to shoot him.  When the cops arrived, I hide my handgun and slowly walked out with my hands up. They cuffed me and I was confused by that at first, but understood after calming down a bit. They asked what happened so I told them who I was and what had happened, but also said I need legal counsel. They made sure I was alright and they took off the cuffs took pictures of my injuries and helped me to the ambulance.  So I went to get my cut glued and my family came to make sure I was alright. I got a ride from them to get my vehicles from the property, but I stayed with my folks that night.   The next day we went to get all of my belongings from the apartment and I moved in with my previous room mate.  So far our case is open as I wish to press charges. I am waiting to here back from a DT. So the reason he assaulted me, is my room mate was telling them I had been hitting her. I called the property owners to tell them I was evicted without notice and a victim of a crime, therefore I needed my rent back. The district manager said no and that from what he heard, my neighbor was responding to a woman in trouble. So hopefully Western Union will refund my rent some time in the next month.  I have currently begun a search for attorneys to help with both the assault and issue with the property owners. I am still doing a lot of digging on what my actual rights and specific laws there are. I have a good source in Travis County to help with this, but the burden is still on me in the end.  Finally, I was subletting with my roomie and was not officially on the lease. She worked as a leasing agent for the property which netted us a good rent. I moved out due to my safety, but APD said I had a right to be there and didn't have to move out. They did recommend that I get out for my safety and to make sure nothing else would happen.   I have not and will not contacted my former friend after this. I never hit her. I just felt like I got shit on here and I really wanted some solid advice. If you need me to elaborate I will, but I will not provide names. Thanks in advance."	No
I am renting a room on a month to month lease and as it turns out, the owner had defaulted on the loan in 2008 and has been fighting it in the court system since.   On Saturday (7-22-17) the owner, informed me of this legal battle, that the judge had ruled against her and that she was going to lose the house on Tuesday (7-25-17).  I all currently paid up on rent until 8-18-17, and I have asked for a refund for the last 30 days of rent, the remaining days I have paid for and my deposit, in exchange for voiding the contract and moving out today. She refused, offering one months rent and my deposit back.  Is this something that is worth fighting, or should I just accept her offer and focus on finding the most comfortable couch to sleep on tonight?	No
After a routine cleaning with a dentist they informed me that I need five fillings in my mouth. I come in a week or so later and get the fillings done.  PRIOR to the fillings I felt absolutely no discomfort or pain in my mouth. AFTER the fillings my mouth is in constant extreme pain and several Advils a day barely mitigate the pain.  I believe this dentist did something to mess up my mouth and I was wondering if there is anything I can do in the form of legal action against her. This is the state of Illinois.	No
Me and my partner broke up recently, we are in the unfortunate situation where we are renting a house together for the next 3 weeks.   As you'd probably expect the breakup wasn't a great experience, but I would rather we be civil for the next 3 weeks than purposely make life harder for each other.  Unfortunately she is not having any of it. Making spiteful comments, to try and get a reaction I suppose. The main concern I have is that she's told me she's going to bring random guys round to our house so she can have sex with them while I'm in.  I would prefer not to have random men in my house having sex with my ex girlfriend in the next room. I'm wondering where I stand legally on this. Can I have someone removed from the house if they do not have my permission to be there, despite having my ex partner's permission?	No
Backstory: My girlfriend and I just moved from CT to AZ for her work and my school. We agreed to use a moving company to transport our belongings to AZ. We contracted Radius Moving and Storage Corp for approximately $3200 based on assumed square footage of boxes. We agreed to the date of 6/25 at 0900-1100 arrival time for pick up of boxes that we packed. Radius did a no call no show. I attempted to reach out to them via a number on their website once they were late. Neither my girlfriend or I could reach someone until around 3 hours past their designated time slot. This individual informed us that they don't know what happened to the first truck so they were going to send another truck with an ETA of 1600-1800. 1800 comes and goes, once again we try to reach out to them and get the same no pick up or direct to voice mail treatment we were exposed to the first time around. Around 2000 we finally get ahold of someone. He said that the 2nd truck was involved in an accident. While unfortunate this still leaves us without a moving truck. After a lengthy back and forth conversation the individual said he would get us a truck for 0700-0900 time slot tomorrow (6/26). I get up around 0630 to ensure everything is lined up for their arrival. 0900 comes and goes no call no show. The next couple hours are filled with the same phone call avoidance and general neglect for our situation that we had become accustom to. Finally around 1300 a car and truck arrive to pack up our things. They left around 1630 with our things.   The overall treatment of company and the lack of professionalism in their response and customer service was deplorable. I was in the military for 9+ years and moved a bunch of times, i had never received this kind of treatment. Due to this and the fact that they were over 30 hrs late past our agreed time, my girlfriend and I believed we should get some money off of the final cost of the move (4300$). They said that 100$ should suffice, which is a slap in the face. Over the last couple weeks my girlfriend has been on the phone with them every day to try and track down our stuff which hasn't even left CT. Reading through their contract it says they can take up to 30 working days to deliver our things. Which is same time then it takes to get household good delivered from Hawaii to NY. After all this we asked for more money off. They told us that since we had written a negative review of them on the internet they would not give us any additional money off. We had not written anything yet which means we are not an isolated incident. As such they said they would give us 300$ off but we had to sign a contract prior to receiving the money.     The question: How is the below contract even legal? What can be done legally to this company? We are already planning on writing up a formal complaint with the BBB.    It feels like this is blackmail to ensure we don't write a scathing review of their practices.          RELEASE AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF CLAIM  Date:    07/11/2017                                                                                         Job#:XXXXXXXXX    Upon receipt by the undersigned of a check for consideration of the undersigned or his agent heirs, administrators, executors, successors, and assigns here and completely release and further discharge Radius Moving and Storage, it’s past, present or future officers, directors, stock holders, agents, representatives, employees, affiliates, partner(s) and successors from any and all past, present or future claims, demands, obligations, actions, rights, damage costs, expenses and compensation of any nature whatsoever, whether based on tort, contract or other theory of recovery, which undersigned or anyone entitled to any recovery, now has or which may hereafter accrue or otherwise be required on account of, or in anyway going out of the contract for services rendered and entered into between the parties named here within.

Hello, I had an apartment in Richmond, VA, with 3 other people.  We were all on the lease.  One decided to leave the state with no forewarning and another got pregnant and moved out.  after the two left, the other decided to not pay rent anymore.  I was the only one paying my quarter.  It has been 3 months now of just me paying and we have officially been evicted.  I know this will hurt my credit greatly.  I was wondering if there was anything I could do to change my credit.  Can I sue them and have my credit changed, or am I just screwed?  I have kept all my receipts from my payments, but I am not sure how to proceed.   Thank you	No
"Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos.   He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	No
**To the point**-  My Grandmother is at the time where she needs someone to take over her finances and care.  She distrusts most of the family, for a long time.  She has decided that she wants me to handle this if I am willing to.  What is the preferred way for us to accomplish this. I am thinking that a poa at first will work, but I am unsure what means to use for a more long term solution that is more difficult to contest. I would like to be able to eventually prohibit any significant access to her assets without my approval.  Potential problems are a few money hungry worthless relatives who I will no doubt have to eventually fight when the gravy train stops.  Second, what sort of 3rd person can I use to do a periodic financial audit to show proof that her money is being used for her and her alone. A CPA?  I am thinking this could help insulate me from the greedy relatives if I can show proof that everythings ok.  Assets are for sure &lt;$1M.  I would guess between $400K and $500K.  So I am not sure if there is really enough there for something like a trust.  **More detail** -  My grandmother is in a bad situation currently.  She feels threatened that someone is going to get her placed into a nursing home and steal her money.  Unfortunately one of her kids has tried to do exactly that in the recent past.  For whatever reason she feels like its going to happen again.  She and another family member she trusts contacted me after they refused the offer to take over this position.  This family member is dealing with their own severe medical problems and isn't in the position to do it.  So they discussed it and determined that I was the best option.  So I was surprised when she asked me to do this.  She is estranged from her kids for various reasons and one of them is a terrible choice anyways.   I feel like there is real potential for one of the relatives to take her for a ride around town and clean out her bank accounts.  Just to give you an idea, one of them recently gave her a sob story and talked her out of several thousand dollars which he promptly blew on season tickets to a NFL team and bragged about it on fb.  Real piece of work.  Another one got a new car.  In short I am willing to do this because I care about her and I see a real potential for elder abuse or at the very least her being taken advantage of.  I think the long term solution is what I am most concerned about.    The kicker to all this is that I stand to inherit zero from her will.  The person that does stand the most to gain isn't interested enough to take care of her and my Grandmother doesn't trust them anyways.  Thats fine with me, so I stand to gain nothing from this but trouble and assurance that she will be taken care of.	No
So, my sister met someone online who had a shit life, so she invited her to come live with us. It was alright for awhile, but she slowly started showing more and more of the fact that she's an awful person, until it finally blew up and my dad kicked her out, and told her to never come here again. My sister has been talking with her, offering to give her her things somewhere not on the property, but she's refusing to, saying she has legal squatter's rights to come get her things, since she lived there for over 6 months and has proof, and that she can't be evicted without a full months notice. However, she never lived here and paid rent, it was always as though she were another family member. Does she actually have these rights?   I did some Google-fu, and it said that when evicting squatters they need a month's advanced notice like any other tenant, but is she even a squatter since she was living with us in our house?   Thanks for your help.	No
New to r/Legaladvice  just wanted to ask what rights do I have as a parent vs my child's doctor? Recently I had a lovely baby girl, she's healthy and beautiful what else can a parent ask for. But our pediatrician has been messing with us for the past 4 months. First problem came from when the mother took my baby for a check up and the mother filled out a mental health survey. The doctor told her she needs to see a therapist, if a referral is fine for the same day, the doctor calls me while I'm at work to come pick up the baby, I was confused I thought the mother was with her, apparently when I got there they needed me to take my baby home so the mother can be transferred in an ambulance with cops without our consent. We told them if it's a referral we can do another day. They insisted and took her to another hospital. I find out later that they admitted her to a psych ward. They needed to see her for a few days for evaluation. She was scared all over a misunderstanding, At the time the mother was having a problem at where she used to live(now lives with me). It was a heated fight with her mom and some piece of shit bf that came out of jail. That whole event was putting her down and the doctors were quick to say it's mommy blues. Fast forward to a couple weeks ago, go in for another check up they misread her height and weight again. We tell them to check again because event the doctor knew that was silly that she suddenly lost some height. Come yesterday it happened again. They misread her weight saying she's 10.6 lbs now, the doctor calls her friends in another hospital to transfer her. The emt gets here, they see we don't she a car seat , so they take seat out of the baby stroller and strap her on to the stretcher. The emt didn't want to do it. They said its against procedure they knew something was up, in the ride they tell the mother to be carful with what you say to them, they have been known to prescribe unnecessary tests and try to charge us. When they get to other hospital, they check again for her weight 3 more times. Until they came to the consensus that she was 11.1 lbs now. They kept insisting that the mother had baby blues if she had any plans of hurting herself or the baby, they didn't want o hear anything we had to say, im with the mother 24/7 we love our daughter make sure she's happy and being fed every 3 hours. So we try to take her home they refuse to let us leave. We have to admit the baby and if we refused more they threaten with acs . Our baby was in no danger, except for the dangers of healthcare. What can we do?	No
I've lived here for over a year, and I've been paying 2100 every month without fail. Recently I came home to find notice of foreclosure. I called my landlord, john* and asked what was going on. John told me he let the property go off, and has not paid the mortgage for at least six months. What can I do about this? Can I get all my rent back? What is the process of foreclosure when you're renting? I've no idea what to do next.  (LI, NY)	No
I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?   I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.	No
Hi all! If I was parked in a parking lot and I open my door as another person drives into the spot next to me (fairly quickly) and my door creates a deep dent in his bumper, who is at fault?   We're currently trying to settle this through cash and haven't notified out insurance agencies, but I feel like it might not have been my fault.   I do recognize that I erred in not checking to make sure it was completely clear next to me before opening my door, but I would think that a pedestrian getting out of a car would take precedence over a vehicle driving into a spot, no?   This is my first time in an accident so I could be ignorant.	No
(Ohio, USA). Despite being a minor, does the kid have any rights or privileges after the divorce is said and done? i.e. can they decline going to the opposite parents house, choose whose house they want to be at, etc.	No
"Hi there, my friend recently purchased ""African Black Soap"" from Shea Butter. She followed the directions for using the soap and it caused her to have chemical burns. She has been treated by a doctor who indeed said they are chemical burns. The ingredients seem to be a lie as well. Is there a lawsuit here? If so what is it?"	No
My ex girlfriend is around 8 weeks pregnant.  My mind is racing, so please excuse the brevity of this post.  Here is my question:  If the child is mine, I will fight to be a part of the childs life and perhaps even for sole custody.  My ex girlfriend has past legal issues and past drug use.  I am concerned for the well-being of the unborn child.  What can I do now to prepare, legally?  I want to protect myself but I also want to protect the child.  It is also possible that the child is in fact not mine, I am just trying to prepare for the scenario that I am indeed the biological father.  She will not talk to me at any capacity, so I am completely in the dark in regard to information coming from her.    What I know: -She is pregnant, I could be the biological father. -She has had two abortions and has stated she is keeping the child. -She has legal issues and recent drug/alcohol abuse.  In short, how can I use the legal system to protect myself, the child in the event that I am the biological father and can I use the legal system to gain any information on the child before birth?  Thank you for taking the time to read this.	No
He freaked out on her and then tried to cover it up saying he was giving the cards back to the respective customers in an effort to get them a better deal on their phones/plans. Shady as fuuuuck. I am certainly not a lawyer, but this smacks of fraud to me.   Question: legally, what specifically is this considered? I'm telling her to seek legal advice, but I need her to understand the gravity of the situation (if there is indeed gravity).  Thanks in advance.	No
The setup: Roommates A,B,C signed lease and roommate D agreed to move in a month later and add himself to the lease.  B+C are a couple. A is me.   A+D paid 2/3rd deposit under A's name (D didn't have a bank account or credit) and C paid the other. B has no job and asked ACD to split three ways for two months until he gets a job and then we'll split four ways.  Two months later, B has no job, and A confronts him  A and B have a fight, B threatens A and A is forced to move out for safety concerns. (Still with me?)  The lease is an all for one, one for all lease meaning since I left I'm still responsible for all of it if they stopped paying rent as well as they've responsible for my portion since they kicked me out. It was never changed to update tenants or anything. Rent has been paid and it's now almost up. D is still not on the lease.  Landlord knows the situation but let everything play out as long as he got paid.   I want my security deposit back (remember I technically paid two thirds of the deposit), B and C will probably state since I left (they disagree about kicking me out or if I left willfully, I have texts to prove the former).  BCD want to continue the lease for another year but I want to end our lease and they can sign a new one. The landlord stated he doesn't want to get in the middle of it and wants to just roll over the security deposit and have ABC figure it out on our own. However B and C have no intention on giving me any money back.    How does this get resolved?	No
One of my friends is a stoner and keeps his stash and paraphernalia in his car (not the wisest decision, I know). Sometimes I ride in his car. If, while I am in the car, he were to get pulled over and searched and his stash was found, what would happen to me, even though none of the items are mine?  I'm completely unfamiliar with marijuana laws in Maryland as I never have and never will use it, and this situation came to mind. Wondering if I'm making a mistake by riding with him.	No
Is there an online form I can use to file a judgement against him?  Or a way to garnish wages?	No
"Hello everyone I was wondering if any one had legal advice for contesting a will. Sorry if this is very long winded and not the right subreddit, let me know if I should cross post it somewhere better.   Some background, there is this woman ""J"" that my father my sister and myself feel have been taking advantage of  my  grandparents.  J was  ""bought"" (male order bride and what not) from the Philippines by her first husband who was friends with my grandparents. She had two kids by the time my sister and I were past the ""cute"" stages. My grandparents have a weakness for cute children and have been drooling over this woman and her kids for the past 16 years, including the new 6 yo kid with a new husband. This kid think my grandparents are hers and has no idea me or my father were relatives, so idk what J has been telling her but that could be paranoia talking.  We honestly have felt J has been taking advantage of my grandparents to try and be put on the will, and sure enough a few years ago they put her and her three kids on it for a very very gracious amount compared to the three blood family members that are on it. The grandparents refused to show us the will because J was on it. Since my dad in the executor so he was recently able to get a copy and it is split as follows:  30% to my dad, 10% to my sister 10% to me  20% to J 5% J kid 1 5% J kid 2 5% J kid 3 And the rest to boyscouts/church/stuff like that.  I guess our main concern/question is is there a way to contest the will effectively? I know there is a less then 1% of it happening historically. We think she should be on the will but this is extreme in our opinion. Her family, who's only been close friends essentially, gets more then their only son.   Also I guess we need a sanity check. Are we paranoid or are we justified in our feeling in your best opinion?"	No
Hi all,   I am a sublessor who signed a sublease (month-to-month) with a subtenant (found on Craigslist) who agreed to move in on August 1.  The sublessee signed a contract, but didn't pay and just backed out the last day.   I used the [California Sublease Agreement](https://rentallease.net/wp-content/uploads/california-sublease-agreement.jpg) as a template.   Because I held the room for the tenant, I am now eating the cost as I search for a new roommate.  I trusted this person, and obviously realize fully my mistake, and in the future will always get the money upon contract signature.   Is there nothing I can do legally to get some sort of reparation, or to file a claim for breach of formally signed contract?  The roommate is no longer completely dark, so if I could even convey some sort of realistic legal claim to him it could help my cause.	No
"We got a letter telling us about the deductions from our deposit. Most of the stuff made sense but one item was ""Cleaning of unit 36 hrs @ $35/hr."" Is that normal? The rest of the list was   Replacement of broken door on northwest bedroom - $200.00   Cleaning of uniy 36 hrs @ 35.00/hr - $1,260.00  Carpet cleaning - $250.00  Replacement of broken glass at covered carport - $75.00  Reparing of patched holes on sheet rock walls and painting of same areas after patching. 3 hrs @ 35.00/hr - $105.00  Disposal of items left in house (this one we previously discussed) - $550.00  Replacement of broken blind - $40.00  Reparing of garage overhead door. - $150.00  My main question is is the cleaning hrs just the total from all the other listed cleaning and thats just the pay for labor?"	No
"Hi, I have an apartment with the lease in my name. I also have a roommate who is not paying rent and I want them to leave. She will not communicate with me, so I ca't even ask her to leave. She only comes back to the apartment when she knows I'm at work. She won't answer my calls or texts.  At this point, I don't care about the back pay in rent; I just want her gone. I'm scared that she will hurt my cat or steal my stuff.  What I want to do is have the locks changed and put a note on the door that says, ""Call me and I will let you pack up your stuff to leave"". Since she is not on the lease, the main office won't be able to let her in or give her a key. I'm worried that this is illegal though? I'm not trying to keep her stuff; I just want her to talk to me.  Could anyone give me some insight as to what to do?"	No
Received a refund for my security deposit and received another mail with a new revision with extra charges. How do I approach this?  Some of the charges that I received from management were arguable, but was too much of a hassle to consider so I let them go.  For example: The apartment keys were returned in the security box that they have in their office and apparently they don't have all the keys even though I specifically returned all four keys that they gave us. They charged that into our security deposit.  Other one was reglazing our kitchen sink. We lived in the premise for 2 years and the sink was never glazed in the beginning. I figured that this was also a lost cause because we never mentioned it in the beginning when we first moved in because we weren't too concern.  We received a check from them and have not cashed it out. We now received a revision from the mail and the new invoice charged us with more damages as well charged us for the refund.  We plan on calling them tomorrow, but they literally ignore our requests and claim that this and this happened and there really isn't much to argue against because they'll completely deny it.  The fee isn't much, but I feel that the property management is trying to take advantage of us.  TL;DR- Received security deposit refund- weeks later received revision with extra charge along with a charge for the security deposit that they refunded me	No
Tenants stopped paying rent, abandoned property and left behind suspicious materials? Most likely not drugs, but maybe... can we privately test substance to determine if it is or is not illegal or do we legally have to involve police right away?	No
A year and a half ago, I lived in a horribly run, somewhat notorious apartment complex in Queens. They kept about a thousand dollars' worth of my security deposit, saying they needed it to repaint the apartment (wtf). I took them to small claims court and the paralegal they sent told me in front of the arbitrator that they'd settle out of court and pay me the grand. She said she'd contact me shortly about sending the check.  Fast forward a week and she hasn't contacted me. I called for days and she kept ducking me but today, she finally answered the phone and told me that the decision to settle was overturned. I had to hunt them down to even know that I wasn't in fact getting my money like I was promised.  Obviously I'm going to continue fighting in court about this but is it fair for me to sue now for punitive damages? I'm taking way too much time out of my day dealing with these people. I'm so annoyed I'm also now half-tempted to start a class action lawsuit with my former neighbors for the winter we endured without heat from these people.  I'm just wondering at this point if it was even legal for them to tell me one thing in court then secretly change their mind, and if I can sue for a bigger number at this point.  It's hardly about the money, I just hate that they get to get away with this because most people they screw over don't have the time to chase them. Any advice or insight would be appreciated!	No

Does it only change when one partner moves out?   We are going to be living in the same home at least another year for our child and for financial reasons. 	No
"My sister's roommate gave us her old washer and dryer to replace our older washer and dryer. Sunday afternoon, the moving company that the roommate hired brought them to us and installed them both, but it felt like they were rushing things to get out of there. They left and forgot to turn the water back on, which I realized when I tried to give the washer a test run.  Today (Tuesday), I discovered that the floor in the laundry room had water under it. In addition, the wall of my bathroom was wet, and a puddle has formed behind the toilet (laundry room and bathroom are back-to-back). I turn off the washer's water valve and my sister called a plumber for me. He found out that the washer's connection to the house's water valve wasn't tightened and was leaking water when turned on, and he was able to turn it a good 5 or so times to tighten it. My sister also had to call a carpet cleaner company to come dry the affected floors and walls, which they're doing now.  My sister called the movers and told them the situation and asked for reimbursement. They refused, saying that it wasn't their fault since they weren't the ones that turned on the valve. They also said that if they really didn't tighten it, then it would've leaked while they were there (it didn't leak while they were there because they forgot to turn on the water though). My sister decides that she'll have to take them to small claims court.  So I'm not exactly familiar with how these proceedings work, so what exactly should we do here? I feel like we have somewhat of a solid case, but I don't want anything to go wrong. Do they have a case for anything with the point of ""we didn't turn on that valve, we can't be responsible?"" I want to say it sounds stupid, but I could be wrong. Any advice?"	No
