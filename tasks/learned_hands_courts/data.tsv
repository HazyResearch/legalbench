[TL;DR I have an assumed bench warrant out for my arrest because I failed to show up for an out of state court summons. I was offered a chance to pay a fine after I emailed the Colorado DA but couldn't afford it at the time. Now that I'm wanting to go back to Co, I need to figure out if I even have a bench warrant or anything to pay]  I'm from California and have (had?) a bench warrant out for an unfortunate event that I was ticketed for in Breckenridge, Colorado. I got the the ticket about six years ago and have never taken care of it because I thought I would never be going back to Co.. that is, until a month ago. I was just curious if bench warrants expire after a certain amount of time? I'd like to get this taken care but was curious to know if there'd be anything to even take care of any more. I googled whether or not b.w's expire and I read that after 180 days they fall off, is this true? IF they don't, I'd like to take care of it and was wondering what the best way to do that would be.   For the backstory: A close friend and I were snowboarding and were riding down a groomed trail when we (stupidly) got the urge to ride down an unmarked section. There was a big gap in the boundary line so we veered off and started down some back country. It wasn't anything insane, just a densely packed forested area with some pretty heavy powder. We ended up going a long way down and basically got stuck as there were no trails or roads at the bottom and going all the way back up in heavy boots was impossible because of how deep the snow was. Finally got a hold of ski patrol who managed to find us from a service road which was literally about 100 feet away.. just couldn't see it from our vantage point (face palm of the century). Shouldn't have happened to begin with though and I certainly learned my lesson.  Ski patrol and police were obviously not very enthused with our decision and we were promptly issued with a summons for a court date set for a few months later. I ended up sending an email to the DA asking if there was anything that could be done so that I didn't have to go all the way back to Colorado and he basically extended an opportunity to just pay a fine (somewhere around $400 I believe). However, I was young and didn't have that kind of money at the time and after a while, just decided to not pay it as I chalked it up to not ever having to go back to Colorado again. Now that I actually want to, I'm worried that I could get arrested on the off-chance I get my id checked. Regardless, I'd like to handle things now that I can afford to pay the fine (if that would still even be an option).  Apologies about the novel, just wanted to be clear. Format might also be messed up because of mobile	Yes
"Hi guys, sorry if this takes a while to read. I thank you for your patience.  To make a long story short: two months ago, someone messaged me asking for help with an investment fund. He said that he had spend 13 years working on an software trading program that accurately predicts the foreign exchange market. I realized that he was woefully unprepared to run or manage a fund and consulted him on how to set up a fund. He likely was not going to pay me but that's fine, I wanted him to succeed as accomplish his goals. I later realized that it was very unlikely he had programmed an worthwhile arbitrage code, as he claimed to have, because he showed a lack of understanding for basic macroeconomic concepts. Furthermore, his trading policies involve SEC violations and using boiler room tactics for obtaining funding. Additionally, he nonchalantly expressed that he could choose however much to give back to investors, whenever--indicating a ponzi scheme like distribution. When I expressed my disagreements, he commanded me to get back in line and told me to get him ""operating capital"" for his fund. He had also mentioned knowing cartel members (with implied threat), and saying that he wanted to work with them, thus signaling a money laundering scheme. I requested that he stop what he was doing and told him that I will not be providing him with operating capital. He then told me that he had recorded all of our conversations and will release all my information public (where I work, live, etc.). He will then call my workplace and pretend to be a client being harass by me, as well as actively seek out my clients and harass them. The gist of his intent is that it'd be easier for me to bribe him to stop, then to file all the legal proceedings to sue him. Furthermore, he is seeking out attorneys to assist him in harassing me as well as file a lawsuit for having called what he was doing a ponzi scheme.  --- My question is this: Assuming that he finds a corrupt attorney willing to assist him, do I have the grounds to sue this attorney for morality clause violations?"	Yes
I'll keep this vague, to prevent doxxing.   So let's say, my Dad is a local business owner and he's being bullied by a lot of people in my hometown for basically nothing - cutting ~~good~~ the best deals with people the next town over. People are whiney babies but that's besides the point. Now, people get bored of attacking him with false accusations, so they start coming after me with some heavy stuff. Now let's say a local news anchor calls me up and let's me know that they're about to do a story on some pretty bad things that I may or may not have done, and want to see if I would like to comment.   To nip this all in the bud, I dump everything I have to prove them wrong but now it looks like what they were saying was actually maybe not entirely completely false, so I might have maybe kind have proven a little bit of what they were saying true.   Theoretically, if you supply evidence to your own crime, you can essentially plead the 5th and then they can't use that evidence so you're golden right?	Yes
I'm a 21 y/o male from SD just for reference. So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through. Anything at all will help thanks.  (Also sorry for formatting and grammar issues I'm on mobile)	Yes
Dear Reddit,  I really need your help!  A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.  Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.  I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.  How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?  How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?  And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?  Tbh, I've been really scared of this day. I've been trying to avoid even talking about it but the 2-year limit is ending. I really do need you guys' advices.  Sincerely,	Yes
"I received a summons for divorce and it has a part that states "" for an order awarding plaintiff reasonable attorney fees and cost of suit."" What does that mean and what does statutory amount of Child Support mean? Any help would be great. "	Yes
"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
I've been on probation for the last three years. I got caught with a fair amount of weed a couple years ago and got put on 2 years deferred adjudication. I violated once last year, but got re-instated with one year added. Today I saw my probation which he said would be the last time. So my question is will I go before my judge before I'm off or what exactly happens now. My official off date is August 22.	Yes
I was charged with a few serious but meritless crimes. I did the whole song and dance for over a year and finally everything has been np and now expunged.    I wanted to know how long does the final(?) step of expungement take? I have copies of the signed Expungement Orders from the judge which have been filed (last week) and sent to the state police.    Different attorneys I spoke to in passing gave me answers ranging from 48 hours to 6 months. Does anyone know when these charges will disappear? 	Yes
I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended license, and completely spaced the court date. I'm fairly certain that means I will now have a bench warrant for failure to appear, in addition to having to take care of my original charge.   I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker.   I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next? I take care of a parent and kid so it would be really bad to go to jail. (Otherwise I'd just bit the bullet and go for a short period.)   TL;DR: What's the best bet for getting my warrant cleared, without spending time in jail, and can I do it on my own? How likely (approximately) is it that I'll get arrested if I go in on my own?	Yes
 I have a spouse who's an ALT(English teacher), and we're moving to Japan in the near future. I have a 16yo criminal conviction (non-drug related) that I'm in the midst of expunging, and I've been granted a dependent Visa.  Is it worth waiting for the expungement to go through before I fly, or is it safe to assume that the age and circumstances of my situation would make it a nonissue?	Yes
"Hello reddit!   So basically my friend needed to find out some regulations regarding a certain immigration topic in Belgium. She sent an email to a  belgian lawyer asking for help and she wrote ""please let me know how much your help would cost"".   After they exchanged 2-3 more emails(the lawyer completely ignored the request for a fee). In the latest email he just wrote saying he'd like 275 euros for the information his given so far.  So my question is can a lawyer ask for payment over this? With no written contract or agreement to pay? My friend is willing to pay but she feels that the lawyer was shady over his fee discussion and does not want to pay 275 but since this is a lawyer she is afraid of maybe some loophole she might be caught in Belgium laws. "	Yes
So 4 of us are trying to rent a house together. 1 applicant was living with his relatives when they were evicted, his siblings were counted as unknown tennants while it was counted that he was  evicted twice, the renter said we just need it signed by a judge that he's not liable. We have no idea what's required to start the process, do we need to set up a court date? Or contact the renter? Or is it just something you can go up before a judge and knock it out? How long would the process take?	Yes
I just got caught going 108 in a 75 on a deserted highway in Colorado; just under the 40mph cutoff. I read that it carries a six point penalty on the license, which is fine, but being unfamiliar with the law in Colorado I was wondering if anyone knew what I could expect at my court date in Burlington; or if there is any way I can avoid traveling back to appear (I'm from the east coast). Are they typically lenient with out of state drivers? Is there anything specific I should say to the judge? Where I'm from the court will virtually always plea it down to something else. Is that how it works out here as well? Do I face jail time? I have some money, but not a lot, and the plane fare both ways is going to kill me this year.	Yes
Hello!   My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment. We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force.   Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	Yes
So I hired a lawyer last year to help me with my child support case. Back story, I was a SAHM for three years and also a full time student. Ex and I decided to mutually split and split our times with the kids as well. After the separation, ex was acting childish and stupid so I started getting my evidence together to take him to court to get primary custody of the kids and child support as well. Of course, I had to get state support since I was not working after the separation and they referred me to their 'go to lawyer'. I contacted said lawyer and her paralegal. They assured me it would be an easy case and to send everything their way.   Long story short, I didn't get primary custody, but shared.  50/50 was what the judge ordered. Even though I had multiple proof of him not being fit to have the children for 50% of the time. Anyways, after the judge ruled the shared custody, we were supposed to go over child support. Here where I'm at, the child support services will not talk to me since I'm being represented by my attorney. They will only speak to her and will only accept documents from her. I've tried calling, emailing and even stopping by the office but they've cut me out cold.   What can I do? Our contract is different because I was referred to her by the state. I paid a one time fee and she said it would cover ANYTHING and EVERYTHING. Even if I needed her a few years down the line, as long as it was about my case with my ex. I feel like she's trying not to help me since she's technically losing out on money.  Any advice?	Yes
In the courthouses i have been to you are not allowed to bring cell phones into the court room. You can give them to cop at the front door and he will put it in an evidence envelope and five it to the valid to five to the judge.   My question is how do I present the evidence to the judge for her to listen to it? Do I just just cue up the video and play it on the phone?  Do I transfer it to a differnt device? Do I bring speakers to make it louder?	Yes
I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother.   Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.  I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge.   Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three? Im just wondering if this is worth doing or if I am going to be doing the same thing wether i manage to get the weed charge off or not.  All input is appreciated, Thanks	Yes
My brother got into some trouble with the law in Dec. 2015 and he got arrested. My cousin and I went to bail him out everything went well, we paid them as agreed. I thought it was all over then but now they're saying that my brother skipped court one day in Apr. 2016 &amp; which forfeited the bond and cost them $450.  They want $668.99. $450 demand amount, $55 filing fee, $14 service fee &amp; $149.99 attorney fee.  Is there anything I can do? I have until 7/31 to respond.	Yes
My former landlord in Missouri is wrongfully withholding my security deposit (not seeking advice on this, I'm well aware of all the statutes they've violated) and I need to take them to small claims court. How do I make this happen from where I live now? (Chicago Illinois)	Yes
I'll preface this by saying I've been ticketed for this before, went to court, did a day's community service, wiped my hands of it. So recently I was at a park drinking, some officers came around and ticketed me. Especially since I only thought it was a ticketable offense, mixed with the fact that it was dark out, me and my friends were not yelling or playing music, I stuck around after the cops left. Not even a half hour later some new cops came around and arrested me, telling me I shoulda listened the first time around. Now I'm facing a real court date.   Will they probably just give me a ticket in court or am I facing a real problem here? I had no other charges in the system when I left (I double checked). Should I get a lawyer? This is my first arrest ever so I have no idea how to handle this.	Yes
First I'd like to say how much I hate Atlanta police department and their court.   July 7th got a ticket coming straight off the highway onto a 35mph zone in Atlanta Georgia. It's a speed trap, they had so many ppl pulled over using a lidar gun. It's not fair that we get no time to slow down coming off a ramp, but whatever. I get the ticket and it's only 10days away from court date. Is that even legal? They say even on their website it can take up to 2 weeks (10 business days) to process. That would be passed my court date.   I called the municipal court. This lady insisted I was reading the wrong date. I'm not. Even the cop was like 'call if 10days is too soon'. Uh yeah. So I check every day to see if it's processed. I asked the lady what do I do and she just responds with 'uuh, I guess you're just gonna have to wait til it's processed'   I have a feeling it still won't be processed by the court date. I wanted to sign up for the Pre-Trial Intervention to maybe get the ticket dismissed or lowered, but even that you have to sign up before court. I cant even request to postpone court date without it being processed! I can't even pay it if I wanted to avoid court.  What can or should I do? I'd like this to be dismissed.	Yes
Seeking some legal advice as well as wondering what to expect for my case.   Im 23, and I was arrested when I was 18 for possession of a controlled substance (one Xanax, a felony) in the state of Florida. I made bail, and didn't show up for my court date. A year and a half later, I turned myself in and three months later was released on probation. I violated my probation a month later and moved across state lines out of fear of going back to jail. This was almost four years ago, and I feel like it's time to go home and deal with my problem. I was a different person back then, and since I've been gone, I've had zero encounters with police and have been a productive member of society, got married, and became a chef. I'm wondering what to expect..   Is my best option to get a lawyer? What is that gonna cost me? I have some money saved, but only around $1,000. Is that enough? I'm hoping since I've completely turned my life around and it's been four years that a lawyer could get it thrown out, or at least get me off with probation/little to no jail time. I support my wife and myself and she wouldn't be able to make ends meet without me around. What should I do? How effective would a lawyer be in my situation? This is my only legal trouble as an adult, I got in trouble when I was 16 but had it dismissed. Any advice is greatly appreciated.   Thanks!	Yes
My husband has decided to leave me. Even though I don't want or agree with a divorce I have to accept that it is happening. We don't have kids, house, etc. Very little in the way of assets and we mostly agree on how to split everything.  We have decided that an uncontested divorce is best. My husband thinks that we can share a lawyer but I wasn't sure. I have extensively googled and not gotten a definitive answer. Any idea?	Yes
Went to a court hearing, where it was vital that the doctor send the medical records to prove my case, but the clinic sends a blank disc to the court.  I was give the blank disc from the court that day.  I was told in court that because the disc was blank with no records on it that I was going to lose my case in court that day. I was to recover no reward for my case.  So the doctor or the clinic messed me out of thousands.  No justice for me at that time.  Well I haven't given up hope that I will fix this.	Yes
I'm currently in a volatile relationship that is toxic and destructive to me. However, I've just started a new job and I'm undergoing training that is rarely offered, so I can't miss a day of work. I need a restraining order against my former significant other. If I fill out the paperwork and give them to a friend that is free during the court's normal hours can they submit the paperwork for me?	Yes
I purchased a website about 6 months ago, however the website was not as described, and does not have the capabilities that were promised (such as a fully functional shopping cart with integrated payment processing). I've tried to work with the original owner to get these items done, but she is very slow to respond and always has excuses about her health, her child's health, and how she is traveling.   I'm in Northern California. The woman that I bought the website from lives in San Diego, but the LLC that she does business through is in Pennsylvania.  Can I file small claims court in my local court, or would I have to go all the way to San Diego or Pennsylvania?  Thanks for your help.	Yes
I'm a minor in Virginia and a few months back I got caught with a guy I met off of Grindr who I was trying to buy meth from. At Juvenile and Domestics court, I was told he took the plea deal and everything was done and if they needed me, they would call me back. I just got a different subpoena today for circuit court. Between the time I thought everything was over with and the subpoena for circuit court I have traded pictures with other guys and hooked up with other guys as well.  I currently don't have any charges on me and was considered a victim in the case. Is it possible for them to place charges on me for hooking up with other guys without telling them my age?	Yes
I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	Yes
I'll save you the time: was pulled over, police found a small amount of cannabis.  On top of getting a lawyer, any tips/links on how court works, what I should do etc?	Yes
After three years my finance and I are finally able to afford and have a home together in Canada. (I'm American) We are getting married in November. We initially met with the lawyer at the end of June. The consultation seemed to go well but I have serious concerns about his retainer.   The email he sent me took a week. Is this typical? Within the email there are serious grammar and spelling issues and the retainer has my name spelt wrong. It's also 3500$ CAD not including he actual processing fees. This is only payable by cash or money order. Is this normal?  The reason why we wanted to get a lawyer is because I was denied entry to the border in 2015 for insufficient evidence to return to the states. I was going to stay for two months, didn't say my exact day of return, was in my car with my fiancé, and had my dog with me. I have been to Canada at least 4 times since then with no issues.  I also was previously married and sponsored someone to become and American permanent resident. They have been a permanent resident since 2015.  We divorced in 2015. The lawyer said this shouldn't be an issue at all. Is this true?   Thank you for the help. I live in Colorado if you need that info as well.	Yes
"So in just over 24 hours I have a ""hearing to determine dependency"" with children and youth. The paperwork I received says that ""the child is without proper care or control"" and that she will be placed in ""kinship foster care"". What do those things mean? Also, I was told that once the issue involved is no longer an issue, she will be able to go right back to me. Does it work like that, or will there need to be another hearing? I applied for and was given a public defender, that I have so far not been able to get in contact with."	Yes
Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	Yes
I received a Petty Misdemeanor about 5 years ago in New Mexico for shoplifting under $30. At the time I was homeless and hitchhiking through Albuquerque on my way back to Florida. I was never arrested but they took my information, banned me from going to any Kmart's, and gave me a court date. I talked to a public defender and she told me if I never plan on coming back to New Mexico that I should just leave. So I did. I ignored the court date and headed back to Florida without a second thought.  It's been 5 years, I have my shit together and I'm living in Colorado now. I haven't heard anything from the state of New Mexico since I left and forgot about the whole deal until I applied for Lyft a couple months back and was declined because of that charge from New Mexico. How should I go about dealing with this? I now regret just leaving like I did and feel like I probably made it worse. Does this mean I also have a warrant out for skipping a court date? The way the public defender talked about it made me think it was no big deal but obviously you can't just ignore stuff like this. Any guidance is appreciated.	Yes
Dunno what's really pertinent here but I have a record in two states living in a third. I'm a pretty stable schizo with two jobs and a BA. I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb. I received ~$200 pair of tickets for operating w/o insurance and driving on a suspended registration. I paid the tickets well ahead of deadline but came home to find info staying that a bench warrant was put out on me but apparently according to the clerk's website I'm good. So what's the deal with this type of situation. I'm not even clear on if these are simple tickets misdemeanors or whatever (WI). 	Yes
Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
Since I had posted bond for both charges, from both of the 2 counties, when I appear in court for sentencing after court appearance has been scheduled (plead guilty), would I be incarcerated? Or would that only be the case if that was my sentence was incarceration and not fines?  Feel free to ask me further questions - I'd prefer minimal admonishing, since I'm doing that to myself enough.  Thank you, community	Yes
"So I pled ""no contest"" to a shoplifting charge I received after a night out drinking with buddies 3 hours away. I appeared in magistrate court and the judge cut the fine to $1 not including court cost, which I paid on the spot, but also had to pay $50 in resitutions to Sheetz. I wasn't given any information on how to do that when I was at the courthouse and haven't received any mail about it. What do I do? The magistrate judge said it wouldn't be difficult to get the charge expunged and wanted me to follow through with it quickly since I'm a medical student and this can affect my residency. How do I pay the restitutions? And is it necessary to have them paid by the time I file for expungement?"	Yes
How do I get proper legal advice on this? do I approach a tax attorney or an accountant? I used TurboTax to file taxes for the past two years.  Is getting proper legal advice going to be more expensive (or close) to paying this debt directly?  If I can get advice on this directly that would be great, but I am almost more afraid and need advice on getting the proper legal advice itself.	Yes
"Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos.   He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
"Is it normal for a California court to fudge up your records?   I was supposed to have 2 previous arrests ""dismissed"" via expungement and well, they never did I guess. It took me being denied a really good job 3 years later to figure this out too.   I have the court documents that say my charges have here by been dismissed but my DOJ record is saying something different. What do I do? Do I have any sort of recourse against the court house for not getting that job. (I'm sure I don't, I'm just pretty broken up about it)  Thanks Legal Advice!"	Yes
I'm 15 and got caught stealing at Walmart I know I'm really dumb so don't bother commenting saying I'm dumb i know I am for this but in all honesty I need to know What my options are here . I stole under $30 worth of merchandise (2 iPhone chargers) and they caught me and took me to a room and officers came and wrote me a ticket or whatever . I gave them my first and last name as well as the first initial to my middle name but keep in mind this happened in Texas and I live in Florida. I gave the officers my old house address which is a rental house and they said I have until august 7th to go to court and pay a fine or they will put out a warrant for my arrest. So the question is should I tell my parents or just leave it alone and don't worry about them trying to find me back in Florida ? since they don't have my real address. Will they be able to put a warrant for my arrest in Only Texas since this all happened in Texas or Florida too ? or would they still be able to find me? can I pay this over the phone without showing up to court since I leave Texas tomorrow ?  	Yes
Quick question for everyone here. I just got a speeding ticket via photo enforcement in Washington DC. I was going 16 over so it's a 150 dollar fine.   I have two questions for everyone here.    1) If I go to contest the penalty is there a judge that I speak with or is it a random person behind a desk? I ask this because it looks like the address is just a suite and not a court house.   2) What are the odds that the judge lowers the fine if I've never had a moving violation before? (Been driving for over 6 years) Is it even worth me going in? Or should I just pay it.    I am obviously guilty of speeding. I'm not contesting the ticket itself. I am wondering if the fine can be reduced though.	Yes
"Hey everyone!  I'm a Canadian, wanting to attend a professional degree program in the US. I have some questions about US Education Law and would like to find a lawyer, but I'm currently in Canada where I'm assuming most Education Lawyers will be experts in law that is specific to Canada. Is it possible to ""meet"" with a lawyer remotely and where would be a good starting place to find such a lawyer?  Thank you."	Yes
Last July I was sentenced to two years supervised probation, an alcohol awareness class, and 100 hours of community service. Since then I have completed my hours and class. My probation officer said I am able, after the one year mark, to reappear in front of my judge to have my charges dropped. Although it is not a guarantee that the judge will agree to do so. I do not want to hire an attorney and put myself in (more of) a financial hole based on chance. Any advice or experiences that may help me as I go forward besides dress nice, be polite?  TLDR: Reappearing in court to have probation dropped, need advice on appearing in court by myself in front of judge.	Yes
Is there any ways I can fight this in court? They didnt find any actual pot but the pipe itself was dirty. Does that actually count as possession of marijuana in virginia? And if I Wasnt distributing the bowl to anyone and only had it for personal use, what would the correct charge and penalty be? Having trouble finding this information online.  I was given Asap and a 500$ fine but if theres any way I can get this reverted to a different charge and a lesser fine that would be really helpful.	Yes
Hi all, I am not directly involved, the guy was an ex from 15 years ago who went to jail for a terrible thing against his now ex wife, got out on a technicality, initiated contact with me and over a 6 month period threatened repeatedly to harm her family. I was asked to submit the proof by a mutual friend to police and I did. Ex wife got restraining order and seeking a harassment charge. He did 3 months in jail waiting on trial, and was released last week as trial date was pushed back into next month. His sentencing guidelines for the new charge are 1-3 months of jail time, credit time served. Confirmed with prosecutor's office, that there will be no jail time and they can offer me NO protection order, nothing. Basically they just want me to testify so they can slap him with a felony that will prohibit his job search and he can put blame on me.   I have a baby, no time off work, no reliable transportation to cross a mountain pass to GET to this trial 4 hours away... this is all so irritating. Should I be getting a lawyer to try to get out of this? CAN I get out of this? They have no ability to skype, legal assistant says they want witnesses present to jury can read body language.... I feel like Im being used here for nothing and they cant protect me and I just need some advice man. Can I get out of this?	Yes
My friend was/is on probation for a DWI. He had a month left and he got violated because he tested positive for alcohol twice in a row.  He is currently in county jail and they haven't given him a court date yet. He's been there almost a week. My question is how long can they make him stay and can they sentence him with a full prison sentence even if he paid his restitution and has been on probation for 5 1/2 years.   We reside in New York State. 	Yes
He has an attorney. There is proof of drug use by the mother, proof of her leaving him home alone when he was 7, 8 and 9. Her not taking him to school. She moved him schools twice in the past year. Moved him to 3 homes in the past year. There is no stability. Has him in a terrible neighborhood because it is convenient for her. Any input would be great (There are recordings and Text messages that are the proof)	Yes
I have weed possession on my record will the courts and judges definitely be aware of it when I go back in to court for another weed possession charge or what are the odds that this can fly under the radar 	Yes
"I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.    My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?  What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?"	Yes
Hi r/legaladvice,  I have a question regarding the enforcement of a judge's ruling, and provincial jurisdictions in Canadian courts for small claims.  So to give some short background info, I want to file a case in Small Claims Court against an ex-girlfriend who I lent a lump sum of money to for a week. It's been years and she refuses to pay me back, so I want to go the legal route to get my money back from her.  The issue is that I live in Ontario (whereas she now lives in Alberta) and would like to file the case here, in an Ontario court. The incident also happened in Ontario, so the courts here will accept the case. The problem is that if a judge rules in my favour and she must pay me back, they can't enforce the ruling in Alberta where she lives now, because it's out of their jurisdiction.  So the person I spoke to for information in the Ontario Small Claims Court said I should find out if Alberta courts will enforce rulings made by Ontario courts? I did a lot of online research and couldn't find an answer, so would anyone here know if they would?	Yes
"A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.  State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.  The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.  Now this is where it gets really shady. Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.  So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!"	Yes
How can I be treated as if I'm on probation, have to report every 2 weeks, and take random drug tests, If I haven't even been convicted of a crime or sentenced probation?  Also does an adac assessment count as a drug test? My probation officer said in court under oath that I received and failed a drug test, when in fact I've never received one and could have passed one at any point. When I asked him about it he said that since I said I had smoked weed in my adac assessment it's the same thing. I call bullshit. If he commited perjury by saying I failed a drug test, I'd really need/like to know.	Yes
As the title says, my girlfriend made a huge error in judgement the  other day and tried to  only pay for some of the makeup she had gotten off the shelf. She has a spotless record and is even hoping to  work for a very well known animation company and park. She immediately knew she'd made an awful and idiotic mistake and is completely remorseful. I'm trying my best  to help her through this with as little damage as possible to her employ-ability and record. What steps should I take, should I be out looking for an attorney? Any questions  I should know to ask? Any help is appreciated, thank you all for your time.	Yes
So we sub leased a room and the landlord was only aware that one of us was living there (my gf and i so 2) everyone moved out over the weekend without notice. We were gonna take over the lease then we got kicked out too. And the landlord Said she was given $800 (what we were told our deposit was) from the sub leaser but not told it was for our room.    How should I go about taking it to small claims court when I don't know where he moved to? We signed papers when we first moved in (don't have copies, stupid I know) and the paper said it would be refunded. Also I have a picture of our rent+deposit (cash) in an envelope with our names and date. We have texts from him saying to sign the contracts when we first moved. We just don't have the Craigslist ad that said $800 deposit otherwise we have it all in our favor.   What should we do next?	Yes
"Yesterday I received 3 notices of traffic tickets from Florence (Originally perpetrated in March) where I ""was driving within the limited traffic area without authorization"". Two infractions were within 40 minutes, and the other was 2 days later. I don't recall seeing signs, or being on a road that seemed like I shouldn't, but I don't speak Italian either!   I am an American citizen living in the US that was using a rental car. It's important to note that these notices seem to be from the city police directly, and not through the rental company. All 3 notices are for 81 + 37 Euros for procedures.   It ends up being $403 USD. What are my options and what would you recommend? Can I just not pay? Will I not be allowed to go back to Italy?"	Yes
Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	Yes
The title says it all. If someone could PM me with help deciphering this thing that would mean the world to me. I really don't want to go to court. I just turned 18 and it'd be really nice to get this out of the way over the weekend, so I don't need to take off work.  Thanks, P03	Yes
So I am wanted for a pretty serious crime, like probably the first or second biggest one. There is a international warrant for my arrest. I want to look at my options with a lawyer and see what the best way to approach this is. Say I meet up with one, and tell him my situation, can he tell the police.. Lets say I dont pick him, can he call the police and say hes in this state.. etc.	Yes
[Previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6lw36b/bicyclist_runs_stop_sign_hits_my_bike_breaks_her/) for some context.   If a lawyer sends me something in the mail but I never received it, can they keep going forward with some process without my knowledge?	Yes
So recently I got a DUI and the lawyer was able to get me an agreement on a suspended imposition. This is only in a couple of states, South Dakota and Missouri I believe. Well my question is, will I still be found guilty under the courts judgement or convicted?	Yes
This happened a year ago, but right after it happened, I moved from New Jersey to Michigan, and next week I will be living in Ontario. I recently got a subpoena in the mail to appear for the case. It's not against me, it's state VS the guy, but I'm just going to be there as a witness. I will be 8 months pregnant during the time of the court date and I won't be able to travel, especially since I don't think I will be able to travel to the States while my citizenship paperwork is being processed in Canada. I've tried contacting the detective a few times but haven't heard anything back yet, my next step is to call the court house even though the subpoena specifically says to just contact the detective. Is there any way they can try to force me to go considering my circumstances?	Yes
i can't seem to find it in the handbook...i find every other form and how it needs to be served  https://www.attorneygeneral.jus.gov.on.ca/english/courts/guides/Guide_to_Serving_Documents_EN.html	Yes
 From what I understand, they go easier on first-time offenders.  Let's say somebody accidentally rear ends another car.  There are no injuries.  A ticket is issued for failing to stop.  The court reduces his offense to impeding traffic, due to his clean driving record.  Four years later, the same driver commits the same offense.  Is he considered a first-time offender, as the points only stay on record for 3 years?	Yes
In early May, I got a speeding ticket in Magnolia, Texas. According to the ticket, I'm entitled to the evidence against me. I also could not make my assigned court date due to work conflicts. I sent the Municipal court a letter requesting evidence and a court date conflict. Never heard back. Court says letter never arrived, and now my ticket is in 'default' cause I didn't showed up for my date.      I sent a second letter, certified, via USPS. Tracking number says it made it the Magnolia post office, but after being 'out for delivery' for ten days, the post office opens an investigation. They tell me that because of the huge volume of mail going to the court, not all of it gets scanned.  A clerk at the court cannot locate the letter. They tell me to get a DVD of my ticketing incident, I have to submit a written claim in order for them to send me the form to request the evidence. They cannot accept the request over the phone.       I call a lawyer for help at the end of June. He tells me I may have a warrant out for my arrest now, and that my fines may have gone up. Offers to call the court on my behalf to see what's going on, and to see if they'll accept a fax instead. Is unable to get a hold of them for three days. Oh, and he keeps forgetting to call me back.  I've given up on him.      I sent a third letter via UPS earlier in July, which *was* filed as delivered. I've been calling the Court three-four times a day for four days now, and I cannot get anyone on the phone to confirm they actually have it.       It's now been two months since my ticket. I'm going insane, and I don't know what to do. I haven't received any mail from the Court. I feel the ticket was predatory, and I don't want to spend $250 for allegedly going 51 miles per hour from a stopped position in less than one mile of travel time. I don't live in Texas, which makes my options limited.      Can I file a complaint against the court? Because this is a fairly rural area, ticket lawyers are really hard to find.	Yes
I need to file a small claims proceedings against a large national chain. The location I dealt with is now closed permanently (part of why I am suing). How do I determine who exactly I file the action against? The main corporate office (national)? A state or regional office if i can find that? How does that work?	Yes
"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	Yes
This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	Yes
I was the victim of a discrimination suit several years ago in the US. Due to the organization being so high profile they were able to shut down the case in summary judgement and spread misinformation (the judges admitted that they didn't understand the nuances of the case, and had very strong ties to organization in question).  I don't understand it 100% but I was told that I would be responsible for some legal fees if I lost. They tried to cut a deal with me by asking me not to appeal the case and then they wouldn't charge it but I appealed anyway. From what I understand the fees are capped to bare basics like filing fees etc so I wouldn't be responsible for something like 200k+ but more like 700-800 dollars. This is a drop in the bucket for them but very costly for me.  I understand that I am legally responsible for these fees, however as a direct result of this case and the emotional trauma I suffered at the hands of this organization, I lost that job, became almost unemployable due to Googling my name shows this failed court case, had to move in with family because I was desperate to have somewhere to live, had to flee that situation because of domestic abuse at the hands of my family, and have been homeless since the beginning of the year. For some reason they are deciding to try to contact me regarding those fees now of all times when I am literally homeless.  This has really reopened my trauma and I think it's deeply inappropriate for them to try to do this at this time especially when they had a part in creating this situation. I understand that legally I promised to pay those fees. I wanted to ask a) can I appeal to a judge about my situation or did I already promise all that time ago? and b) can I tell them that I will go public with this story and create negative PR for them if they decide to move forward?  This whole time I went the legal route instead of the press route because I didn't want to be in the spotlight but I wonder if things would have turned out differently because there would have been pressure for them to be held accountable. If they are choosing to really push to get those fees after all this time when I have hit rock bottom I don't see why I shouldn't reveal what they are doing to the press.  Also please be kind with this post and don't put down and disrespect my situation or my trauma. I understand this is just one side of the story but please take it at face value without judging or victim blaming. I have been through a lot with this and I will report and flag comments that are cruel and unhelpful. Please just answer the question as asked, I do understand that I agreed to this, but is there any leverage I can use with the judge or with the organization itself to pressure them to drop it?	Yes
Sorry for being vague, but who knows who is on Reddit? I have a longstanding case against someone who fled the state and has been avoiding service for all legal matters. I have reason to believe they are back and I have a possible address for them. Going up and knocking on the door isn't an option. What is a good way to verify that this person lives where I suspect they do so that I can serve them?	Yes
"Hi guys, any help would really be appreciated. I'm going to be sentenced to 29 days in jail for carrying a loaded firearm in a public place. It is a deal offered by the DA for dropping two other infractions that happened at the same time with fines up to $3000. Here are some mitigating circumstances that may or may not help me.  -I'm a teacher and a very productive member of society -I have no criminal record, no priors -I was far away from anyone else, camping, when I was detained -I have 11 very-well written letters of reference  Here's the situation, my lawyer has determined the case to be unfightable (and I got a second opinion from a second attorney too, money going down the drain -__-) been trying to convince the DA to reduce my sentence with letters of reference, to no avail. Only positive thing is the the firearm will be returned to me, obviously I'm not a threat. So why the strict jailtime? The 29 days is pretty much set according to my lawyer; he also mentioned I can make a statement in court, but strongly advises against it because the judge may overrule not in my favor and request the firearms to continue to be withheld. Is there really nothing I can say during court to sway the judge?? Please help!!! The ""statement"" is literally the last thing I can do to avoid jailtime, I'm scared :( Anybody have any experience talking to the judge in court? Anybody know how much influence the judge has in deciding proper sentences? My lawyer told me that the strict jailtime punishment is meant to be something along the lines of ""setting an example"" for these crimes- which I feel is pretty cruel. I feel like going to jail will make me really bitter and turn me into a delinquent..."	Yes
A friend of mine is facing a serious felony assault charge, his lawyer told him he may be able to plead down to a lesser assault but it could go to jury where he is risking 2-8 year prison term. He asked the lawyer about if a person leaves the state for the coast since he hasn't been served a warrant. The lawyer said if he did he would never be extradited but would spend 30 days in jail and released basically any time he got a ticket. He also said that once this happens a clock starts and that after seven years there would be a statute of limitations. This doesn't sound correct to me, but if that's true it honestly seems better than risking his life being ruined. Any legal experts here that can verify this? Thanks. He is from Ohio.	Yes
Hello all, I received a PI in the Travis county area in Texas and have yet to even go to court for the misdemeanor. I have no blemishes on my record and wish to expunge the misdemeanor ASAP. However I have no idea how to go about it or what to even say when I walk in the court room in a few days. All advice is welcome, thank you!	Yes
"I've been searching google for the answer and am having difficulty finding the answer.  I only found one website that directly addresses this but don't know if it's accurate:  ""The parties’ property settlement agreement, while completely enforceable as a contract, is not filed with the court."" http://www.divorceforgrownups.net/karins-blog/2011/9/13/keeping-your-divorce-information-private  I'm trying to help my mom by getting her divorce property settlement, but I don't know if it was filed with the court.  My mom's divorce took place about 13 years ago.  I'm trying to figure out the answer to this question so I don't waste an entire day going down to the family law courthouse which is far from my home and finding out that the divorce property settlement is not there."

I am in Oregon, sister in trouble is in WA. Her public defender is terrible. Our family is kind of shitty, and I have no money for an attorney. She has been waiting for trial for a very complicated case for 2 years. Her court-appointed attorney has ignored all of the resources and advocate options as well as contact info for expert witnesses I have provided. He has condescended to me, yelled at me over the phone. I told him that I will only communicate with him via email.  He has been often rude and aggressive toward her, then seems to have compassion on their next visit. He has told me to send the information and contact info of the people I have spoken to, they have tried to contact him, and no response. I wrote to him and told him she felt bullied and disregarded. He seemed to be on her side for about a month, then back to the roller coaster approach.  She said she has written a letter to the judge and told me it had been ignored. I have so few details, her self-worth is shattered, she has lost her fight. She told her psych doctor she wanted a new attorney and she was condescending and dismissive.  I have contacted another public defender in WA because I think she can switch easily if someone else is willing to step in? That person did not contact me back, and I don’t want to continue barking up the wrong tree. I also am afraid that the next one might be worse.  What might my best strategy be? We have contacted all of the legal aid resources we could find, and have gotten very minimal response.  I really appreciate all of the great info here. Thanks for your time	Yes

I have a petty misdemeanor for shoplifting in New Mexico from 4 years ago. I left the state without dealing with it and now I'm living in Colorado. I finally have my shit together and I want to resolve this but have no idea what I'm doing. I looked into it and obviously I have a warrant for not appearing in court. I talked to a criminal lawyer in Albuquerque and he would charge 1000 to represent me and would first file a motion to quash the warrant.   So I'm wondering if this would be my best option or is there some way I can deal with this myself without having to get an attorney? Maybe a public defender? I'd like to not have this on my record but I'm mainly worried about this warrant. I'm currently trying to find an apartment in Colorado and I feel like this is definitely going to cause problems when I start applying. As it is I don't have very much money so paying an attorney 1000 on top of whatever other costs I'll have is going to be hard. Should I call the Albuquerque court house and try to deal with this myself or will that just make things worse? Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.	Yes

10 years ago I traveled to a far away state I didn't live in and was caught with a small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia. Of course the court date for the charge was months after I was caught, and by that time I had already returned to my home state. I was also very poor at the time and could afford neither a lawyer, court fees and fines, or the money it would have cost to travel back to the state. Over the years I had forgotten about it, but now I have remembered and I am wondering what will happen if I hire a lawyer to deal with the charges. Lets say I hire a lawyer and go to court to deal with the charge. When they convict me, how will that conviction look on my record? Will it show up as a conviction in 2017? How will this impact background checks for jobs? I know most checks only look to see convictions that have have occurred in the past 5/7/10/etc years. Will the fact that I waited this long to deal with it make it look like a crime that was recently committed, and hurt my chances to pass background checks? I have had background checks done since I was originally charged with possession, and had the warrant issued against me, but these never showed up on any of the checks.	Yes

Home state: MA New state: NJ  Hello.  I am trying to divorce my husband. He is emotionally and financially abusive. I have proof that he had an affair with a 16 year old girl while we lived in Boston. I am going on vacation to my family's home in NJ. Would I be able to stay and begin the divorce process from there? I have a daughter so I am prepared for the reality that that may not be possible. I am just asking out of desperation because being here with him is driving me into a deep depression.    Here are the facts:   * Married for 4 years * He is a green card holder/non citizen * I have picture proof of his adultery and abuse in text form * Daughter, age 3, was born in NJ * We lived in Boston for almost 2 years * He doesn't want me to divorce him and has made marriage counseling appointments  * I have 0 support system in Boston * I have no job, he works under the table     I know this is a shot in the dark question, as I feel like I definitely have to return to Boston to divorce because of custody reason. But I am asking anyway. I just wish to get out of here as soon as possible. I am numb right now but want to make the smartest decisions possible before I break down.	Yes

Allegheny and beaver courts, PA. So I've finished my dui suspension length and have satisfied all my requirements, aside from paying off all my court fines. Under act 122 the court will not release my completion of treatment to the DMV until I have paid all court cost/restitution. I went back to school shortly after my duis (3 almost 4 years ago). Since then I haven't been in any trouble legally but I haven't been working because of school. So my license would be very helpful with travel requirements for work/internship. I've made regular payments over this time, but they aren't enough to cover all of my costs. Is there a way to petition for certification of my completion to be transferred to the DMV from courts, without paying all of my fines?? Thanks for any advice!	Yes
Minnesota: Feel free to delete this if it's not allowed. Obviously this isn't a question, but I think it's information that could be helpful.  After years of butting heads back and forth with someone, we got to a point where a restraining order was put into place. We have emails back and forth for almost a decade fighting- never any physical threats, just verbal assaults. Eventually, I filed a police report against this person. In retaliation, this person filed a restraining order against me.  I got a lawyer and we had our day in court. For anyone who is in this position I want to give the most broad synopsis of what happened, and what I firmly believe will likely happen with your case. The judge doesn't listen to any reason as to why you have contacted the person who requested the order. None of that matters when you are in a position where someone is claiming any level of harassment. In my case, if I had filed first the judge would have granted the order for me against the other person. The fact that you have responded to someone else's initial actions doesn't matter, only what the judge sees as harassment against the original filer. It's safe to say the judge probably realizes there are actions on both sides and doesn't need to waste time listening to it all if they can see any sort of harassment one way.  To make it even more simple, it's like this: Person A punches person B. Person B punches person A. Person A files a restraining order. The likelihood of that order being granted is high. Both people don't get along and one restraining order will keep these people from contacting each other and in the eye of the law it doesn't matter who files because a restraint order is universal. The court doesn't care what it looks like as far as who filed against who. Only the fact that there is any proof of animosity that is patterned and has potential to escalate.  The fact that you were antagonized or provoked into hitting Person A doesn't matter in a court of law- the judge won't hear it. It *only* comes down to who is filing the restraining order and what the defendant did.   I hope this saves someone a thousand dollars in legal fees- I wish someone had told me this, it would have saved me quite a lot of grief in the last few months. If you have a different opinion I would love to hear it, because it certainly seemed like my case would be universal to how all of these issues are handled by a judge.	Yes
I'm 16 about to get my drivers license in Florida if I have a bench warrant in Texas for not appearing in court ( I took something that wasn't mine and got caught it was under $30 and got a citation but didn't show up to court because I left the day later I got the citation) am I able to get my drivers license with no worry ?

Abusive husband knows i wont report him to the police because due to reasons CPS gave us two strikes. (first time was during the time after i gave birth, he lied to the doctor and told her tht i didnt feed him- had to be investigated by the CPS; the second time one of my kids told her teacher that she was hit - she was talking about when you slap a kids hit for trying to touch a hot stove- but she didnt understand that scolding =/= abuse) and so we have 2 strikes on our house.   I finally decided to go through with the divorce but my husband wants to keep up with his abuse (he left the house for 2 weeks taking his stuff, now he is threatening to call the police if he isnt let in) He knows fully well that if his domestic abuse is reported or if the police get involved the kids will be investigated and there is a highchance of them being taken away.... i have 6 kids under the age of 16.  Any advice on what to do when he calls the police? how to handle CPS? the divorce process hasnt fully began cause im still waiting on legal aid.... plz any suggestions are appreciated.	Yes
A bit of background my aunt in the past use to make good money sending clothes to mexico and china she owned a warehouse though it was a joint thing between her and her husband she did most of the work and handled most of the details this job involved sending alot of money to mexico among other places and through poor management and a decline of demand for clothing their busness went under and they beacame broke a few years pass and some federal employee manages to track them down and my aunt gets arrested and held in prison to await her court date the main problem was this court date never came beacause we didnt have enough money for the bribe the judge asked for and her husband spent a year paying her lawyer so he could sit around beacause he trusted the lawyer then they fired him when they found out he was just milking them for money. My question is can they make some sort of an appeal to someone to speed up her court case?	Yes
"I own a property in New Orleans that has 4 units near Bourbon Street. I had issues with two tenants who would rented two units. They would rent one unit out on AirBnB, and then stay in the other unit. This was not an issue until damage occurred and the City of NOLA started fines for unlicensed AirBnB rentals similar to Denver.  After removing the tenants, the city received an ""anonymous"" tip that my units were being rented on AirBnB. During the hearing, the lawyer that represented these previous tenants happened to be at court, and mentioned that he heard the owner (myself) planned on renting the units via AirBnB directly.  I ended up getting fined $3500. I never said this, nor did I ever intent to rent via AirBnB. I obviously plan on appealing, but I did manage to find a previous AirBnB listing for my property that was removed here: http://airbnb.com/rooms/12874458  I'm honestly wanting a little justice, and was curious what you all might recommend.  Their attorney obviously sticks out for malpractice, but if I can get this listing info from AirBnB, then I can show the previous tenants were renting the apartment and not me. I just emailed AirBnB to try and get this basic info like the listing, description, who rented it, and the reviews.  I'm not sure what else they would disclose without law enforcement etc.  Any advice what to do?"	Yes
Texas - I am representing my self in a small claims lawsuit brought by a former landlord who is suing me for damages in excess of my security deposit. I also have a counter claim against him for failing to act in a timely manner (No contact for close to 90 days after vacating the property). Last week I was notified that he has requested a Jury Trial which means our next court appearance will be a pre-trial hearing. The landlord does have an attorney representing him in court but for the amount we are being sued for, I'd likely spend more on an attorney if I went that route than I'd avoid paying if I lose the lawsuit, so I am sticking to representing myself. What should I expect to happen and what can I do to be prepared?  Thanks in advance for all of your help.	Yes
My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.  My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?  Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.   I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!	Yes
Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	Yes
"As a preface to this story I drive a truck for the nation's largest retailer and they pay me very good (six figures good).   I was on my off day and took an out of town trip with my wife and kids in the family minivan. We started to approach the small town of Uniontown AL and I was immediately pulled over by a police officer (he passed me going the opposite direction then proceeded to do a unturn to get behind me). I'm puzzled because I always drive safe and legal, my wife always gripes at me for this habit. Before the officer approached my window I had done decided that I must have hit a 45 mph zone without realizing it and I never slowed down from 55 mph. When he approached my window the first thing the officer told me is I was doing 70 in a 55. My jaw dropped because I know I was going 55. I didn't argue with the officer and I didn't confirm or deny doing 70. I pretty much remained silent. He gave me my citation and I carried on. My wife did research on this town's police force and found a message board with so many other horror stories just like mine with people getting pulled over for doing 70 in a 55. So I think it's obvious that this town is running a scam.   I know the obvious answer is to ""lawyer up"" and I'm planning on doing that this Monday. But my most concerning question is, will that even do any good in a corrupt jurisdiction? I mean if the cops are going to flat out lie and say motorists were speeding then does that mean the staff of the municipal court could be in on it as well?   And to revisit my beginning statement where I drive truck for the nation's largest retailer... They will not tolerate a serious violation on my mvr. So I'm possibly facing a $100,000/yr job loss. Who knows, they might be understanding and give me a slap on the wrist but either way I'm scared!   Where do I go from here?"	Yes
I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	Yes
Hi all, got arrested for possession of marijuana under 50g. I requested discovery including the dash cam footage, (what they sent me isnt even video from my arrest, it's of some other traffic stop that isn't me) and of course lab results. I am hoping that the lab results will take a long time to come back and eventually the court will be pressed to dismiss the case.  It is actually a significant prejudice to me having to take off of work for the morning only court and drive 1.5 hours away to this courthouse.  In addition to all this, I also received a ticket in the mail for possession of CDS in a vehicle, signed 34 days after the initial arrest. It is my understanding that there is a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic violations , therefore I am submitting a motion to dismiss that ticket.   I am representing myself pro se, and would like to know basically how long is reasonable enough to wait for lab results before I ask for dismissal, and is there in fact a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic tickets?   Thank you all in advanced!	Yes
I recently got a bike citation for failing to stop at a stop sign while riding my bike. The fine is $257 &amp; after reading up on some other posts on reddit about other citations and fine amounts, I find this a bit excessive??? I do not have the money to pay at the moment. I requested a 30 day extension, but what are my options? Is it possible to get the fine reduced? Do I have to show up to court?	Yes
I have been assisting a family member (the respondent) with a separtation. I have all correspondence and pleadings to date. Some letters and emails are between the respondent and the applicant's lawyer. Some are between the respondent (or myself) and the respondent's lawyer. Legally, can I make these letters, emails, and forms public online? The application, answer, reply, affidavits, and financial statements are part of a continuing record that is already a public record, is it not? And I have the respondent's (since all of this information was mailed or emailed to him or myself) permission to do so. We are hoping to change lawyers. Until we find a lawyer who is a better fit, I thought that by sharing all of this information online, anyone who has the time can read the information and offer advise. I thought there may be legal professionals who are retired, or suffer from insomnia :), who may be interested in helping. That is my reason for wanting to make this information public.	Yes
"Just got a call (well and I ignored about 8 calls over the last couple of days) from some sort of ""processing unit"" saying someone had filed a civil case against me and I should call their lawyers office at 1-844-###-#### to get more information.

Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
New York here. Ill just state the whole situation, so on July 3rd, officer caught me &amp; friend urinating behind a car by the beach (no bathrooms nearby). We talk to him at the car and asks us for our ID, I stupidly give him my fake ID name as i am under  the legal drinking age. He starts to type in info and i realize how stupid that was so i give him my real info. Officer cuffs me &amp; pats me down (was never read rights?) and driven back to station . I was charged with PL 245.01 (exposure of a person), was told likely an ACD for ~6mo.  Just a few questions, is it recommended to get a lawyer for this or is it something i could handle? i only ask because in my position a lawyer would be hard to afford. Am i entitled to a court appointed defender/lawyer or anything of the sorts? also if the only charge was the exposure of a person is a judge able to see anything reguarding the fake ID.  Any help is appreciated &amp; sorry for the wall of text guys, just bugging out seeing as my court date is the 17th and trying to figure out what the next move is.	Yes
"Got in an accident a while back.  Sought legal assistance.  The lawyer I found dropped my case after a month and I felt they wasted my time.  I left them a single negative review online containing hard facts, all of which were true. I can back up any of my claims with evidence from multiple sources.  I settled with the driver on my own and figured it was time to move on.  The lawyer felt otherwise.  Since our ""falling out,"" the lawyer has taken the following actions:  * Called me to threaten legal action against me if I do not take down my factual review * Called my employer to try to convince them to fire me, saying he knows their business partners etc. * Called various family members of mine and made them feel harassed. * Has emailed me countless times threatening multiple lawsuits. * Has emailed me threatening to employ a private investigator for the situation. * Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false. * Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer) * Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident * Is threatening me with lawsuits, again  I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.  what do you think?  1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment? 2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since. 3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?"	Yes
"Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18.  - What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?  According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case. - Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?  So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
"After a bit of digging I found out my lawyer did not have a license to practice in Texas, only in Kansas also found out some of the money orders that my parents gave him weren't even cashed in yet so I was able to retrieve half of the money they had spent! There were a few others involved in this case out of the many he screwed over as well.   I followed some of the advice some of y'all gave me and am really glad the letters and calls I gave helped out on this case in the end.  Here's what the final letter they sent to me said.  ""This letter is to advise you that Uchechi. N was disbarred by the Kansas Supreme Court on July 7,2017. I am enclosing a copy of the order disbarring Mr.N  The discipline of disbarment imposed by the Court was effective on the date of the Courts order pursuant of Rule 212(g) of the Supreme Court  Thank you for your support and cooperation in this matter.""

* There were (2) periods of time where he was unresponsive * One instance was being unresponsive for (4) weeks where I was asking for an update multiple times via email/phone * The second time was when I was asking for a financial statement for the services, he took (3) weeks to respond.  After he sent the statement, I terminated his counsel and then he made another statement and used up the retainer. * Are these complaints worthy of getting the bar involved?	Yes
I have no idea where to begin looking for a labor attorney in San Diego, CA.   Do I look online in Yelp? How do I go about finding one?  The situation involves a company, specifically her direct supervisor, acting very unprofessional towards my girlfriend. On top of that they penalized her for the government arranging to go to a mandatory meeting for her green card.   She wanted to go to HR but other supervisors have stated it will compromise her career and discouraged it. In that case I think it's necessary for her to see an attorney before she goes to HR, or sees what the labor attorney has to say having heard the full details.	Yes
Hi /r/legaladvice, throwaway here.  I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options. On my separation agreement, they extended my exercise period from 90 days to 2 years, which made me not buy the shares and wait for an exit or something like that. Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.  Around 10 months after the separation agreement, my options were cancelled, and the CEO said this was because the extension wasn't allowed under the stock option agreement. A few lawyers went through the agreements and said this was BS. Despite this, she (the CEO) tried to make a monetary agreement for a fraction of what the shares are worth for me to give them up.  I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.  Should I try emailing the directors explaining my story, or go straight to a lawyer and send a letter of demand?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
"I am in the process of gathering information to find an attorney to bring this up with, and I can't figure out what type of firm this fall under.  I am located in Oklahoma, the company I have an issue with is located in Pittsburg, PA, and has servers located in Costa Rica.  The developer in question I believe is also located in the new england area.  The issue involves an online game that has a MLM type incentive structure, you get returns based on the people under you. It also has a vibrant economy that has real world implications as to results of some games/minigames which are promised to be ""fair"" and ""random"".   Issue 1: The lead developer changed the incentive structure and cut the earnings from downstream in half.  He justified this as saying it prevents people trying to steal downstreams by profit sharing, as now he ""automatically"" gives the profit sharing back to the downstream. Even though some people did not profit share and so realized a very real 50% or more cut in income.  Issue 2: Over the past few years the developer has made many statements of things he would ""never do/wont happen"" that were then used to make economic choices, but then he does them a few months/a year later to the economic detriment of those who took actions based on his statements. Given that the lead developer and employees have not changed in this time period, it's felt he's still liable for the contradiction.  Issue 3: The lead developer has made several statements about the fairness/programming of some of the minigames in this game, that are either provably false, or probabilisticaly unlikely to be true, that has similar economic damage. While randomness is hard to prove/disprove, deviations can be shown on results in-game vs an out of game programmed simulation with the same ""rules"".  So my questions are:   1. What type of firm should i be looking for?  Civil litigation? Fraud?    2. What jurisdiction am I looking at/will i need to get a national/out of state firm or is it not an entire waste of time to check in-state consultations first?  Sorry if this just seems so basic, I just don't want to be wasting peoples time barking up the wrong tree. Thank you for the help!"	Yes
"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."

"I am a resident of Massachusetts. I am going on a vacation to Utah. I am planning to rent a vehicle in Utah for personal use for the duration of my holiday. My insurance company is Arbella and I have comprehensive coverage from them on my car. I called and explained to them about my plan. I asked them that if I rent a car and decline all insurance coverages offered by the rental company, would Arbella cover all the damages as listed in my policy document in case I do happen to get into an accident while operating the rental vehicle. They ""said"" that the insurance will cover the liability and the rental vehicle but did not send me a written confirmation. I am wondering if it is necessary to get this in writing from them that they are going to cover the damages in case of an accident. Is this a standard thing nationwide to use personal-car insurance on the retal vehicle? Is verbal confirmation from Arbella enough regarding this matter? Can you please guide me how to proceed in this regard?  Thanks in advance"	No
Hey guys, I'm a musician that knows only the side of law that covers things like copyright and trademark and sampling (audio).   I'm trying to make the release of my next couple of singles as professional as possible, with all bases covered on grounds of copyright and terms of ownership. I've got a song finished and I drafted up artwork for the song using a picture of a friend of mine.  I'd like to write up a Work For Hire contract concerning the picture I'm using and the model in the picture. I basically just want the contract to cover ownership of the song, the model's permission to use her likeness with the song and promotional material of the song, as well as being distributed online with her picture attached to the song.    I don't want the contract to include any sort of royalties to the model as 1. We aren't trying to pull in large sums of revenue from this release and 2. She did not have any creative involvement with the creation of the song.  Do you guys have any pointers and/or clauses that I should include in the contract? Or any advice as to the best possible way to go about writing the contract for the model?  Thank you in advance	No
I moved into an apartment in Kalamazoo Michigan last June, and this month my job wanted to transfer me to a different city, so I began the process of finding someone to sublease. My landlord made me aware that there had been a fire here and that's why the last tenant left. What they didn't tell me was that the fire marshall had told them that they could not legally rent this apartment because it's too close to the fence next door. There are two large fences, a chain-link and a wooden one running right along the side of the apartment. According to the mire marshall, that can't be that way if they're going to have someone living here.   Right after I renewed my lease back in March, the company that owned the building sold it to an individual, who I assume still has no idea that they/he have been renting this apartment illegally.  Now that I know this, I don't think I can go any further trying to sublease, but I'm moving at the end of the month and need to be done with this place by then.  What are my options for dealing with this?	No

   I live in an extremely small town, and apparently I've pissed off the wrong people. Now I can't leave my house without a bunch of people following me and even trying to beat me up and possibly kill or disfigure me permanently.    Is there any legal recourse I can take, I know all their faces but not all their names. I'm pretty nervous.	No
My father had already paid for this month's rent in the beginning of this month, when a week ago our landlord sent my father an email asking him when he was planning on sending him this month's rent.  My father informed the landlord that he had actually in fact paid the rent for this month for he had placed it in the landlord's mailbox the beginning of July (My father's bank account also shows that the check was in fact deposited)  Despite this our landlord claims that he has never received the check nor cashed it in.  So far my father has reported this to the bank and attempted to inform the police about this too, but they told him to report this to the postal police instead (which my father has done as well, but I'm not so sure about whether or not my father's landlord has done).  The bank informed my father that he will most likely receive a response in regards to this situation in about 30 to 90 days and that if my father is NOT in the wrong, he will be compensated the check amount in credit  (Can anyone confirm if this will truly happen?)  Does anyone know what to do in this situation???   My father is afraid that this will develope into a huge legal dispute that will involve hiring a lawyer and all , which my family cannot afford to do.   My father's landlord requested that he just send him another check since he had not received the rent and my father in fear of eviction actually sent him another check, but only covering half the payment (My father's landlord claimed that once the bank figures this out, the check my father sent him again will go into August's rent payment)  Does anyone know what my parents can do to avoid turning this into a huge legal fiasco and resolve it peacefully? Is the only thing that my parents can do is just wait until the bank gets back to us?	No
Hi all, My local elections bureau has on its website a count of votes by precinct for every election back until 2011. However, after talking to the bureau on the phone, they said they have records going back much further. The problem is that the records are in a storage facility, and they don't want to get them. I've asked four times over the past year. Each time their said they were busy. I can't file a FOIA because it's a local bureau. Any ideas? Thanks!	No

So my town does angled parking spots on some streets. Town ordinance (though it's not actually posted on any signs on the streets) states you have to park head-in in the angled spots.  I was pulling out of a lot onto a 2-way street with angled spots on the right side. Before I did, the person in the angled spot immediately to the right of the lot exit I was using left the spot.   The proximity of the spot to the lot exit was such that, instead of turning right onto the street, reversing, then pulling forward head-first into the spot, it was faster/easier/safer to just pull forward and back right into the spot.  When I got out of lunch, I had 2 tickets. One for $30 for violating the head-in ordinance - that one I understand. Ignorance is no excuse, etc. However, I also had a $54 ticket for a Section 39:4-135 violation. Here's that text:  39:4-135. Parking; direction and side of street; angle parking; one-way street The operator of a vehicle shall not stop, stand or park the vehicle in a roadway other than parallel with the edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the right-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway, except as follows:  a. Upon those streets which have been designated by ordinance and have been marked or signed for angle parking, vehicles shall be parked at the angle to the curb designated and indicated by the ordinance and marks or signs.  b. Upon one-way streets, local authorities may permit parking of vehicles parallel with the left-hand edge of the roadway headed in the direction of traffic, on the left-hand side of the road and with the curb side of the vehicle within six inches of the edge of the roadway.  I think that violation is in error. In (a) it states only the angle of parking in reference to angled-parking ordinances. I took photos of my car, it's at the correct angle and between the space markers, it's just backed in.  What do I do here? I doubt it's worth it to fight the head-in violation since that one's pretty cut-and-dry, but the 2nd violation really seems like it's not valid. I've literally had 2 non-parking tickets in my life, one was speeding that I hired a lawyer for when I was like 17, and 1 was driving without an inspection sticker on a car I bought on eBay that same day, so I'm pretty green to this. If I plead not guilty, am I gonna have to go word-against-word with some douche traffic cop? This is also the town I live in, and it's a very quiet town with a ton of bored cops, so I'm worried that making any sort of waves is gonna mark me and my car to every cop in town forever. $54 isn't going to break my bank account or anything, but it really steams me. We literally went out for lunch, and it went from a $50 meal to a $134 meal.	No
My girlfriend and I went to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico this past week. Went great, until I ate something bad and came down with severe fever, chills, pain, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Worst infection of my life. I ended up needing medical transport and was hospitalized for 3 days, where they pushed all sorts of drugs and antibiotics. Ultrasound revealed my colon was super inflamed, and I had a condition called gastroenteritis. The hospital stay cost $16,000.  We contacted the resort, asking for a refund. We know for a fact it was something that I ate from there that made me sick, since we didn't leave the resort at any time. If they refuse, do we have legal grounds to sue?	No
Leased a commercial property about a year ago. A couple of months ago the utility bill got too high and couldn't pay on it anymore. Stopped paying rent around same time (3 months approx)   Landlord asked for keys back, I told him as soon as I had time to clear my stuff out. I let it go and he would message me here and there asking for keys back and I admit I should have done the right thing and gave them back.   I drove by on Friday and there was a notice taped to the door. Notice of eviction dated the previous day. Said I missed court and default judgment made against me. I was never served and was never even mailed a certified letter. Had literally no idea there was a court date to defend myself at.   The very next morning I received a text stating my belongings were on the curb. I called non emergency to speak to the deputy that I was told was there, never got a call back.   Long story short, it seems like 2 days is a very short period of time to be notified all the way to having all my belongings on the curb. My questions are is this a normal time period for eviction and if not what is my recourse?  Thank you to anyone for your advice.	No
I just signed a lease that I was very hesitant to sign, even after speaking to the property manager.  This complex, in San Antonio, tx, is going to charge me $41/ month for cable.  I have to sign the addendum in order to move in.  I spoke to her (prop. Manager) about how I don't want cable and don't own a tv and she said since they do bulk cable deals with the local provider, every apartment in the complex got discountes cable even if we didn't want it. As much as I want to ask is this legal, or how do I work around this, I'd prefer some links so I can research on my own. Thank you.	No
"I know next to nothing regarding land lord laws. My (ex)roommate (hereby RM) and I rent a house from a close family member of mine. A lease has been signed. RM has been late with rent before but has eventually paid it back. RM and I work together, it sounds like work may use this as a reason for termination, and for good reason. I am not really looking to get into the nitty gritty of RM's legal issues as they don't really concern me. RM's nonpayment of the current month is an issue. Luckily my family member has another potential tenant lined up after I get back from a 2-week vacation at the end of the month. I really am curious about the eviction process or if we can just ""break RM's lease"" for some other reason that wouldn't involve any legal dealings like eviction. Really not looking to burn bridges/fuck up RM's life beyond getting RM out of my life, for good reason.   RM's property is still inside of my house so I haven't changed the locks yet. I have bought new locks and garage door receivers for the appropriate time. RM still owes $400 for the current month of rent and is 6 days late on it as of right now. RM was arrested less than 24 hrs ago for a felony charge and may be gone for awhile. Do I need to send RM written notice if I intend to break the lease for nonpayment? How do I do that if RM is in jail and I can't physically talk to RM for a week or so? I know there are appropriate ways of doing this and I don't want to make any mistakes where RM can sue me for holding onto his property or anything like that.    Also, I have someone watching the house while I am gone and everything is insured if he chooses to break in after locks are changed. The first thing I did when I heard RM was going to jail was getting new locks.   First time posting (ever)  on this sub so hopefully, no rules were broken.  TL;DR: Roommate is in jail, owes me rent in a family (my family) owned property. I just want him out. How do I do so without breaking any laws or giving him any channels of legal recourse."	No
I live in Madison. My lease states that I pay a full month's rent by the first of each month, and this applies for the full calendar month. I moved in on a sublet this January, if that is relevant. The lease also states that the final day of my residency is Aug. 14th (at noon).   On Aug. 1st, I paid a prorated amount by day [ (14/31) * my monthly rent amount.] Today, I received a notice that I still owe more money; it appears that the landlord simply wants half of the monthly rent. I do not see anything in my lease agreement that governs this situation.   Am I legally obligated to pay this extra charge? The difference is about ~$50, so it's not a huge deal, but I'd like to avoid it if I don't have to pay it.  Thanks.	No
Hello and thank you!  I recently tried to start driving for Uber/Lyft for some extra income, and they told me no due to my driving record... About 5 years ago I got ticket for driving with no insurance. Car wasn't mine, so I paid the fine and continued on with my life. Unbeknownst to me, the moment I paid the fine, my license was automatically suspended until I got an SR22 on my insurance. Well, a year goes by, and I get pulled over... now I have a driving while suspended. Once i figured out that nonsense, I got the SR22 and they reinstated my licence. I maintained the SR22 for 3 years and haven't had a ticket since. Is there any way to get this crap off my record? Please, I need help! :(	No
Hello, I'm not quite sure if this is the best place but I need to start somewhere. I, 24, have been living with my dad, his wife, and 4 kids (ages 4 and under). I am about to move out and my dad needs help with handling these children. The mother is almost non existent (stays in room and makes minimal contact), as she has a prescription drug problem... He is out of money, out of time, and almost out of his mind trying to find a helping hand somewhere to turn this situation around. My dad can't go out and make money because he is stuck at home taking care of the kids full time, almost 15 hours a day.. this situation is ridiculous and I don't know where else to go. Obviously she needs to get out but what is the fastest way to do so. My dad is afraid of reprocussions for calling CPS or setuing similar. The wife is a master manipulator.   We are in North county San Diego  Thank you, anybody, for your help.	No
This just happened. I rent a single room in a house, and have a lease agreement.  About a week ago, my landlady asked if I could temporarily move up to the attic (which is a finished, but very small space) so her son could stay in this room (which is a spacious, nice room) for a few weeks while he visits. I was a little taken aback, and told her no. I thought that was the end of it.  I came home from work today to find maybe a third of my possessions packed up in cardboard boxes, and sitting outside the door. She was out at the time, and still is out. I just brought the boxes back in and unpacked them. Nothing broken, but I'm very uncomfortable.  My agreement requires 48-hours notice if she wants to enter the room for any reason.  I'm not sure where to go from here, aside from searching for a different housing option immediately. Do I have legal recourse? It feels like she's trying to forcibly evict me.	No
Hi!  I have a lease on a townhome but am not currently living there. My lease is up July 31, but the landlord has allowed new tenants to start moving in. Their stuff has been there since at least July 22. Once I found out their stuff was still there I called my landlord demanding a prorated amount of rent to be returned to me, as well as an estimation for utilities. This will total to approximately $500.  The landlord is now threatening to withhold my security deposit, stating that we broke a door (despite giving us the ok at the walk through).  My husband and I have again reiterated that we only want our prorated rent for the time that we know we had left the house and now our landlord is ignoring our calls.  Is it within my legal rights to seize property in the home that I currently still have a lease for? That is the next step we were going to take. Thanks for any advice.	No
Here's my situation regarding my marriage..  I am American-Vietnamese, born here in the United States in the state of Georgia. My husband was an international student I met when I was 17. We started a relationship in which lead to our marriage when I was 18. I had our son when I was 19. We went through paper work to change his status and attempt to get his green card through marriage. I am not familiar with what the correct terms of the whole process. During the process I was pregnant with our son, so the initial interview happened to confirm if our marriage was real or not. We definitely passed really easy because of our baby. Since then he got temporary USA resident and temporary work permit (I think that's what it is), and the application for his actual green card applied for. We got lots of confirmation letters that the application had been received. We lived our lives as we waited. During this wait time our relationship went downhill. It was a very unhealthy relationship in which I needed to escape in order to recover myself and to do everything I could to provide for my son. He was arrested when I was 21 for domestic violence. It was an accident on his part but I was scared so I called the police. He had to pay a fine, take family violence classes, and was on parole for a few months. That was the end of our relationship.. the last straw. I immediately moved to Florida with my son to get away and start my life over. I left with nothing but our clothes. I've since then built a life for my son and I here. I am about to turn 23, he is 29, and throughout these two years I have let his dad see him many times. I am grateful for their father-son bond and do not ask much from his father. His dad asked me to continue helping him getting his green card because he does not want to be sent back to Vietnam. Out of fear that he would be sent back and my son would not have his father here in the states or him not being able to help with child support, I agreed. I am in a very healthy relationship right now with a man who loves my son and I for about six months now.  Now that I live in another state and in a relationship, I'm worried. He called to tell me that he got a letter asking for an interview next month. It's been almost two years since I left and this is the first letter. He asked me to fly in for this interview. Let me also add his family here in the states are the ones handling all the paper work and they are the ones going back and forth with the lawyer.. I pretty much have been doing what I was told since this whole process begin and I have no knowledge of what goes on.  All I know is I have to attend this interview and I am nervous. He was arrested and I moved out of state and am in a new relationship. I honestly want out, but I do not know where to start. I no longer care about getting his green card and don't really want any ties to him anymore besides our son. I want to get a divorce and move on with my life. Should I go to this interview and tell them our relationship didn't work out? And I don't want to do this anymore? And is there any chances I can get in trouble?	No
"This ""Dog Shelter"" is threatening legal action against my sister and her husband for supposedly ""killing their dog for no reason"", or ""because they were having a baby"", and posted on their facebook page resulting in people also sending hate messages and threatening to kill my sister, and her husband. My sister has official documents from the animal hospital explaining why the dog was actually put down due to an unknown problem that had started leaving the dog blind, deaf, and suffering. We are pretty sure it started from a text my sisters' husbands' adoption sister got from my sisters' husband about them not being sure if they should give the dog away or try to train him around the baby, resulting in the adoption sister assuming they put the dog down because of that and knowing someone at the adoption center? The Center claims to have ""proof"" even though my sister has official documents. Can the shelter actually ""take them to court/sue them"" as they say, and can my sister do anything about the shelter posting their images and profiles online threatening them?"	No

Ok, so the deal is my previous real estate agent wants me to pay for damages to one of the doors in my previous house. This has been a tiresome issue because the damage was ALREADY PRESENT when I had begun the lease. Being a young, ignorant first-time renter, I had neglected to bring this up, thinking that the agent already knew the damage was there.   Apparently not. Now, the landlord wants me to pay over $1000 to fix this door that I had no part in damaging. I understand now that it was my responsibility to bring this up when the lease began, but since the damage wasn't brought up in subsequent inspections, I assumed it was already a known issue.   My question: would it be adequate to write and sign a statutory declaration before a witness to prove that I was not responsible for the damage, and that it was already present when I moved in?   Would this be acceptable evidence to provide?	No
I recently rented a house in Maryland (Prince Georges County) for a month while waiting for my next lease to start. It has been a week since I moved in and I found myself covered in bug bites. To my surprise I find that the carpeting and box spring that were left in the room are infested with bed bugs (I clearly didn't do a thorough inspection before renting). I notified my landlord about 3 days ago with picture proof that I wasn't the one who brought the bugs in with me. Unfortunately he hasn't given me a straight answer on what he's going to do about it. My question is: Is there anything I can do to either expedite the process or break my lease? 	No
I'm not actually involved in this, but people from my university are posting online asking questions and for advice.   A new apartment complex has been under construction and was offering tours in the spring. They leased out rooms telling people they would be ready to move in by September 2nd. A friend of mine actually toured the place and asked what would happen if the building wasn't completed yet and was simply told that it would be and was brushed off.   Tenants received an email today stating they won't be ready by the move in date and have two options: they can either delay their lease to December 29 and receive $1500, or cancel their lease outright. Either way the tenants need to suddenly find new housing fast.   This is in Minneapolis, MN, and I was just wondering what the policy on something like this might be. Can the owners really lease out rooms that aren't built yet and fail to provide by the move in date?	No
I am in Idaho, USA.   I've been working at this bar/restaurant for about three months. It is a corporate chain. It is unlike any other bar I've worked for in that the managers count and distribute the tip money amongst the bartenders. I actually never even see or held in my hand the entirety of the tips for any shift that I've closed.  Tips are distributed by dividing the total tips for the night per hour, then dividing that among the bartenders on shift for the hours they work. This makes it important that the managers look at the bartenders' exact hours/minutes each shift to make sure everyone is being paid exactly what they are owed for that shift.   I close the bar 3-4 shifts a week, usually getting there around 5:30 and leaving anywhere from 1-3 am.  I recently realized that my managers had the tips for the shift already divided and put in our individual tip folders before I even clocked out. (While I was doing cleaning and such.) Which would make no sense, since they don't yet even know the hours I worked for that shift.   So for the past three shifts I have compared my clock out slip to the tip sheet that we sign to say we received our tips, and on average I am being shorted for 30 minutes of work per shift. If this has been happening the whole time, it is at minimum $100 a month that I've been shorted, and probably more like $150.   My question is, do I have a leg to stand on here? I've signed the tip sheet every time I've picked up my tips. The hours and tips for that shift are clearly written on there. I've always just counted the money I was given, and made sure it matched what the paper said I was supposed to receive. It never occurred to me to check the hours worked to make sure it was actually accurate. I am planning to confront my GM about it tomorrow, but I want to at least kind of know if I have some good footing here.  I have a few clock out slips that can prove maybe 3 times this has happened. Other than that, I don't know if they can print records of my shifts and how many hours they were. I don't know how far back they log the tip info either.   I hope this all made sense!   Thanks for any advice	No
"to start off, my landlords are terrible people. They own roughly 40 rental properties in my town of around 10k people. I have know many people who have rented from them, and have spoken with various city officials who all agree that these guys are slumlords. In the almost 4 years I have lived in my house, the roof has never been leak free, and the only time they have ever gotten anything minor repaired was the afternoon they sent an unlicensed handyman/meth dealer (who i later found out was about to be charged with child abuse) to my home. why do I stay? Well, since finding the house I am in (3 bed, 2 bath, fenced yard, 2 car detached garage) rent has skyrocketed in my town. I would be lucky to find a shitty 2 bedroom apartment for the amount i pay- which is $650.  About me: I am a newly single mom. My ex left right after our 3rd son was born, and I am trying to make the best of it.    Where I am going with this: my 4 year old son had to have a physical to start kindergarten in the fall, he tested positive for lead poisoning. I then had my other two boys checked, and my oldest son also has elevated blood lead levels. their levels were 8 and 9... which is serious, but not serious enough to start living our lives from inside hazmat suits. So, I bought some lead paint tests. .. Well, there is a lot of lead paint in my house. its everywhere, and all very unstable (cracking, crumbling, peeling). And most of it is in places where it can easily become airborne, inside window sills, and door jambs. I am a in shock.  I must be so naive. I never received a lead paint disclosure (which i have in past rental situations). And shortly after i moved in I found out that the house had in the recent past, burned.. and had (as far as i understood) been gutted and remodeled, while salvaging the pretty painted victorian woodwork. I thought the chipped paint inside the window sills was just caused by rainwater entering over the years. because typically you find lead paint underneath many many coats of newer, safer paint. but here, there is only one layer.  Anyway, after telling my landlords, who have never given a shit about anything.. they are all of a sudden my new best friends, but keep showing up at my house without notice to confront me and ""iron out a plan"". they told me to just keep sweeping and vacuuming up the dust which, the EPA, poison control, and the health department have specifically told me not to do. that i needed to remove the dust by wet wiping as to not create airborne dust particles.   My landlords are hiring a painting company that as far as google shows, has been permanently shut down... and when i asked my landlords if the company was EPA lead-safe certified, they immediately showed up at my door and offered to move me to another property, a much nicer 4 bedroom house, and match the rent i pay now, and that they would give me my deposit back outright, and waive my deposit there. But they never answered me about whether or not this company is certified to safely treat lead paint in a home where children reside... these guys keep ambushing me, to talk when i don't know what I am doing, and furthermore I have no options. I am literally at their mercy, because i have no where else to go. and I know that they are going to further endanger my kids, so that they can save a buck.  so, in addition to my problems, I started thinking about what their other tenants may be going through without realizing... I have asked a couple former tenants and they never received disclosures either. Most of the properties they own were built in the early 1900s so, I am sure they do contain lead paint. could we potentially have a class-action law-suit? Should i go knock on doors? I am morally obligated to report them to the EPA, my kids and others' could have life long injuries due to their negligence.  but i am really really scared of doing it.  like I said, I have nowhere to go, and I am afraid they are going to start working on the house just to make me uncomfortable and eventually force me out. I have in the 4 years definitely violated the terms of my month to month lease. I have cats, and have made improvements to the house without permission..  but they have done nothing but compliment me on what a model tenant i am, and how well I keep the house... so.  any advice is greatly appreciated. I apologize for the rambling and altogether disorganized thoughts. I likely have much higher blood lead levels than my kids, so that's my excuse.  please ask any questions you may have, and thanks!"

"Hello Reddit: I recently received the verdict for a trial by written declaration I submitted regarding a traffic citation I received in California.   On the Decision paper there is an unmarked checkbox that says ""The evidence submitted by defendant is enclosed.""  I guess that they aren't required to show me the officer's evidence.  But, I am filing a Trial de Novo and I would like to see the evidence is possible.  Does anyone have any advice for getting this, and also any general advice for fighting a Traffic Light violation in court?  The light was yellow when I was in the intersection and the officer wrote me a ticket based off of his visual assessment of the situation (no camera).  Thanks for your time."	No
Just received a letter from my old college landlord asking for $1k on top of my $300 security deposit for damages at my last apartment.  I only stayed there for the fall semester and subleased the spring semester out.  These damages are ridiculously overprice.  $180/person for carpet cleaning (there was 4 of us), $200/person for general house cleaning.  We did do some damage but this is insane.. I didnt take any photos when we moved in but a lot of these damages were there before.  I need to get out of paying the majority of this.  I was thinking asking for proof of all damages and receipts of all cleanings/repairs, and then threatening a lawyer if I was forced to pay for pre-existing damages.  What should I do? This is a sleezebag college landlord that is very sketchy.  The letter I received threatens the bill will be sent to collections if payment is not received in 10 days but I'm not sure he'd even do that.	No
Got a memo stating the following:  This memo is to inform you that the soft story retrofit project for the building is going to start on Sept 1st, 2017. It will take approximately three months to finish. The garage will not be accessible during retrofit construction. No parking &amp; no laundry machines will be available for approximately 3 months.  The parking is part of my lease. It doesn't really state if there is any compensation being offered. Is there any I should expect?	No
My friend is in the process of getting a divorce. My friend moved back home in the mean time.   Her ex lives in Florida. She lives in NYC. He has been opening credit cards in her name and so far has spent more than $25,000 under her name. The ex has stopped all communication with her.   What are the next steps.   Thank you.	No
Got caught with a drink at a bar and i'm underage (18) the cop took me outside, wrote up a citation and left a number for me to call for a diversion program before she sent me on my way. I was also given a court date. If that number can't help me and I go to court, what punishment should i expect? Do i need a lawyer? I violated section 4301-69(e). Feel free to ask questions if i left anything out. A friend bought the drink and I had no fake on me	No
Stockton - California (USA)  Let me just get to the core of the situation. My friend and her husband are sharing an apartment with her husbands Mother and Sister. All costs are 50/50. Mother wants to move out with daughter so she went to turn in a thirty day notice with her (mom's) name and daughters name. She was told the notice wasn't valid unless all names are on the notice, so she promptly put the names of my friend and her husband without their consent on the notice. Now the leasing office is refusing to listen them about how the signatures were put on the notice without consent. The leasing office is now refusing to allow my friend and her husband to bring on another qualified tenant to help pay for the apartment even though they wish to resign a lease. What legal actions does my friend and her husband have since the process that started this was void to begin with? The leasing office is refusing their complaints. My guess is because it is due to rent control and by releasing to new tenants they can raise the price.	No
"I'll try to keep this short since as probably all marriage endings go, this is complicated.   My wife and i (of three years, together 9) have had problems for a while but I thought things were getting better. End of June we had a fight and she left to stay with her family in TN for ""space."" We talked every day and things were getting better. The 30th of July she came home. I thought things were good. Long story short she said she needed more time. She left August 2nd. I tried to talk and message but she was kind of distant. August 5th she told me there  was someone else. Cue start of drama.  Since then, I've tried to reconcile, now on to divorce. Now I just want this to be over as quickly as possible. There are no assets. We lived together in my mom's house at the time, so no house. No kids together. The only thing we shared was a car loan. She has the car in TN. The car is upside down on the loan so no value. All our credit cards are individual. We have health insurance under ACA but I'm paying the bill.   I packed her belongings and asked what she wanted of our shared things from a previous apartment. She said nothing except one of our TV's which is fine by me. She wants to trade the car in but its upside down and I'm the primary on the loan. Anything that happens with the car has to happen here and she and it are still in TN.  I tried to get some info for the lawyer, she stopped responding to texts the night before last. I texted her this morning and now she wont speak to me directly. Her new ""boyfriend"" responded in her place saying now they are hiring a lawyer as well and to not try to contact her again.   I thought I could get her to sign an Appearance, Entry, and Waiver so we could move this along fast and each be on with our lives. I have no idea what they expect to gain from making this more complicated. Like I said, there are no assets and we haven't been married long enough to warrant her really getting anything from me, besides the fact I don't really have anything to give her. Plus well, she's the one that cheated.   [TL;DR] Wife left for ""space"", cheated, divorce, now won't speak to even communicate what she wants out of divorce. There are no real assets and debts are individual. How does this work beyond just letting lawyers take time (equals money I don't have) to fight over stuff that's worthless? What can I expect from the process? Any insight or advice is appreciated."	No
If I signed a lease with a property management company, and a month later the property management company changes, am I still held to the agreements made by the original lease?	No
I'm currently waiting the 21 days until I can request for a default decision to be made for the complaint of annulment I've filed (my STBX has been served and is not signing). We had no children, assets, nor debts to share, so it should be straightforward.  Has anyone ever either filed to move forward in default for complaint of annulment or divorce in Nevada, and how long did the turnaround take to get the decision? Were you requested to appear in court to verify anything? I have evidence I will submit with the affidavit to prove the annulment is valid--is there any chance that for some reason it wouldn't be granted to me? I want this over asap and I'm just trying to gauge what kind of timeline I should expect to continue having to deal with this.   Also, if there is anyone out there who knows how I can add divorce as a backup option within my affidavit, like an addition within my complaint statement, maybe in an exhibit, that would give me a bit of reassurance. Thanks so much!	No
"USA / Texas  The person that owns adjoining property to mine is considering selling it.  They say that all the other adjoining owners on other sides have also expressed interest.  I'm especially interested because my home looks out over this adjoining property, and I'm interested in keeping this great view that none of the other adjoining owners have.  I know there is a ""Right of First Refusal"" and ""Right of First Offer"" that I can potentially offer to buy from the adjoining owner.  But, is there such an agreement that would allow me to make a final counteroffer on any offer the adjoining owner is considering?  I really don't want to lose this chance if/when it comes up, but don't want to back myself into a corner either.  Thanks"	No
Spouse and i are still technically married, nothing has been filed yet. (I plan to, can't afford it right now even with the reduced fees i was offered)  Spouse abandoned us and now lives in a different state halfway across the country and has pretty much left me with sole custody. Are there any legal hiccups that would prevent me from moving my child and i to a different state to be closer to my family?	No
Quick question: we received a letter from the real estate company that manages our rental house. It stated that we are responsible for the landscaping of our house per our lease (true) and that we haven't been maintaining it (untrue).    So, since they've warned us about this before and they've been receiving complaints, they're sending out landscape themselves (the week of 7/31, the day after we received the letter) and billing us. The problem is, they haven't warned us, this is literally the first I've ever heard from the guy who wrote the letter.   A tree came down a month or two ago in front of the house, so I'd had an extensive back and forth with the property manager (someone else) and they did have the tree removed. Nothing about this issue was mentioned.   I sent an email yesterday disputing that the  landscaping wasn't being maintained and that we had previously been contacted about this. I told him we weren't going to be financially responsible for landscapers they hire without further (or any) communication.   I'm aware standards for this kind of thing are subjective, but the lawn is mowed every week or two and the hedges and plants are contained if not meticulously manicured. They claimed they've gotten many complaints. Maybe they have, but we haven't gotten any.   So anyway, they clearly sent landscapers out today, less than 24 hours after we got the letter, which is a violation of the lease itself. There was no response to my email.  Any suggestions about my next move? I expect to get a bill from the realty office. I do not intend to pay it.	No
I'm in Texas.    Is a text message from a landlord considered a legally binding notice to vacate the premises?   Long story back here, but I'm not scared of posting this on my main anymore.    Brother, boyfriend, and I have been renting my mother's home for $500/month.     Mother planned a fight with the boyfriend, she got what she wanted in the argument. Boyfriend agreed to move out by August 1st. Later that day, mother sends a text to me, brother, and boyfriend that boyfriend is to be out by 5 PM on July 31st.     This all happened on July 1st.     Yesterday, July 13th, her fiance attempted to force his way in to the house after boyfriend denied him entry. Boyfriend was assaulted by my mother's fiance. Police were called, and reports have been made. My brother informs our mother we will all be leaving by the end of the month. Later in the day, mother sends a text to brother and I acknowledging our leaving the home.    Today, July 14th, my mother told my brother she will be initiating eviction proceedings against my boyfriend.     Here are the facts so far, as I know them:  1. My mother has not provided a written notice to quit or cure, nor has she done so orally.  2. My mother has failed to maintain the property. There are major foundation issues that may inhibit her ability to rent the house out again, if she so chooses. These foundation issues threaten the habitability of the house.  3. She's wasting her time trying to file an eviction since the courts run on their own schedule, not hers and since boyfriend has already notified her that he'll be moving out.   What else might my brother, boyfriend, and I need to know in this situation?	No
I gave my friend money to lend and believed her story. Today, I thought I was dropping her off to see her mother, but I drove her to pick up heroin from her drug dealer. I had no idea this was happening, and I'm scared and worried for the child. The grandparents are likely to get CPS and the police involved.   I just would like to know what to expect from my end; will I be called in to give information or have to testify in court, if it happens? What is the process involving opiate addiction and pregnancy? Will I get in trouble?  Thanks.	No
Location is Alaska. My friend is 17, his brother is 20. Two nights ago they got drunk and his brother beat the shit out of him multiple times. Brother would let him walk away, then go beat him up again. My friend eventually got away, went home and got his AR15. He then spent an hour or so hunting his brother, chasing him around town and shooting at him when he saw him. He chased him through the woods behind my house, heard him unload 40-60 rounds at his brother. He was blackout drunk so he missed every time. Troopers came in yesterday, couldn't find my friend so they left. He's still hiding out. What will he be charged with? Attempted murder and evading arrest? How long will he get when he's caught?	No
"I live in Texas first of all. My 5 year-old son just told me that he ""snuggles"" and sometimes co-sleeps (my language, not his) with his stepfather. He also told me this happens nearly every morning after his mom goes to work and that his stepfather is only wearing underwear while they're under the covers. Apparently, they also watch videos or play games on his phone in this state.  He continued to say that he sleeps between them some nights and his mom is ""totally naked"". I'm more than a little disturbed by all of this. He sleeps in his own bed 100% of the time when he's with me, which is 50/50 on a week on week off basis. Clearly he doesn't ""need"" this.   Where does the law/judges/cps stand on this behavior? It seems like alienation at the very least to me."	No
"TLDR; Can I recover a portion of my ""lease termination fee"" (equivalent to 2 months rent) through small claims court, if my landlord fills my apartment within those two months?   Background: My wife and I purchased a new home with 4 months remaining on our apartment lease. We asked for leniency, offered a fair deal (full month of rent + security deposit), etc. but were ultimately shot down by our apartment manager.  The two options presented were:  1) Pay a two month lease termination fee.  2) Prepay the remaining lease (4 months), then be reimbursed any amount once a new tenant was found.   We put in a 30 day notice in mid June and received our monthly rent bill for July 1 through our move out date. Moved out of the apartment in mid July without issue. Today received a final bill, which included regular cleaning fees and the lease termination fee. We weren't ever given the chance to select option 1 or 2, I think he just went with the cheapest out of pocket route. I'm wondering if we should just tell them to bill us for the 4 months instead of the two month ""fee""? It's more out of pocket, but we would be reimbursed later.   The apartment is in a very desirable location (&lt;1 mile from the beach) and is a relatively good deal in terms of other options in the area. Our now vacant apartment is the only one available in the 70 unit complex. I don't think there will be issues renting the place and the manager is telling people it'd be available as soon as 7/24 (seems like he's trying to get someone in ASAP).   I know in California that the lessor can't collect double rent. I'm worried that since it is stated as ""Termination Fee"" that we wouldn't be able to collect anything in small claims court if they were to have someone move in on say Aug 1.  Any help is greatly appreciated."	No
"I've recently made an offer on a home.  In the listing for this home, there was no mention of a solar panel system installed and I didn't even realize it had solar until the following morning when I was looking at the photos of the house.  I made an offer that stated the panels were to stay with the home.  I received a counter offer stating the solar panels would not be included in the sale of the home.  Since I didn't even know it had solar, and I loved the house, I accepted this contingent on the panels being professional removed and the roof repaired as needed.  Today my realtor, at my request, contacted the seller's realtor to ask about a timeline for this, as I'm going to have to get a 2nd follow up inspection to make sure the work was done correctly.  My concern is that we are only 4-6 weeks from closing and being in the construction business...I know how busy everyone in town is.  I don't see how he's going to get the work done in time.  Their reply was asking if I, the buyer, might be interesting in taking over the payments for the solar system at $70 a month.  That is all the information they provided.  I've requested more information as far as what the amount owed is, how much the savings is per month on the utility bill, what is the APR, warranty, etc.  So, I have some questions assuming I said no.  Does he have an avenue to back out of the offer or is he committed to either removing the panels or leaving them and eating the cost.  I'm also assuming he received a tax credit for the installation, which makes me wonder if he's even allowed to move the panels to his new home (I assume that was his plan).  My biggest question is regarding the wording of the counter offer.  They specifically stated       5. Per section 2.5.1: Solar Panels WILL NOT be included in the sale of this property. The wording states solar panels and nothing about the electrical system that goes with the panels.  Am I splitting hairs or do I legally have a right to any electrical, inverters, batteries, etc or would that logically be part of ""solar panels"".  I love the house and don't want to do anything that would prevent us from getting it.  I'm just wondering about my options as this is a situation I am not familiar with.  Thanks r/legadvice!"	No
"My mom is looking at declaring bankruptcy.   However, 7 years ago she helped me with a car. I paid for everything but it was in her name. It has been paid off for 2 years and we did a ""gifting"" at the DPS and the car is in my name now on the title.   She started having financial troubles about 3 years ago so I paid off her truck so it wouldn't get repossessed. Again did the ""gifting"" and it's in my name. This has been for 1.5 years now.  So if she declares bankruptcy could I lose these vehicles? I paid the entire car loan and about half the truck loan."	No
My ex-husband and I have been divorced for two years. Communication has always been challenging. I feel I have tried and tried to take the high road and handle any conflicts we have had in a mature manner. As long as I keep my mouth shut, things have gone smoothly but anytime I speak up at all, it becomes a massive problem.  He was verbally/mentally abusive when we were married. Controlling and angry. He is still very angry at me for things that happened while we were married, things that happened ten years ago are still brought up and thrown in my face. He calls me names, cusses me out, hangs up over and over only to call me right back to continue berating me for various things.  Right now we have joint legal custody, I have primary physical custody. He sees them fairly consistently, every Wednesday for 4 hours and every other weekend from 4pm Friday - 4pm Sunday.   I am strongly considering petitioning the court to modify our arrangement in hopes of following a parallel parenting plan. I am regularly taking our oldest child to therapy as it is and the kids are being negatively affected by our inability to communicate.   We've never modified anything since our divorce in 2015. What do I need to do to request and be granted a parallel parenting agreement?	No
So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
"7 of my friends went camping on a Monday night, I had work unfortunately. They were camping at a site where camping isn't allowed but many people camp there anyways. After being there for a few hours, a man and woman came to the camp site and held a gun(later revealed to probably be a pellet gun) to the back of my friends head. He started saying things like, ""Are you prepared to die?"" And remained there pointing the gun from person to person for about 10 minutes. From this I have found out his name and I am wondering what sort of action, preferably legal, we should take against him. Is there anything we can do considering they were camping illegally?"	No
"She got a PFA against him for sexual battery or something along those lines. He was told in the paperwork for the PFA that he isn't allowed to contact her, their kids, or her family members. I don't recall if it said that he can't contact us to inquire about her or just at all.   Well I have been ignoring his texts and calls because I don't want to be involved but I have watched her mother and sister continuously respond to him.   He is very clearly violating the PFA by showing up there and dropping off coloring books for the kids. He texts and calls her. He also thinks that he will be able to return to her when the PFA ends.   Then he is texting her mother asking things like ""is she working today?"" ""Can I come by and see the babies?"" (When she is gone from the house). ""Can I go and mow the lawn?"" And just today he asked if her mother could text her and ask if he could have some money. Her mother has been responding and she said today that he could not because she (his wife) had to pay bills. Then he asked what bills.   Her sister gives him rides to work and gives him pictures of the kid and tells him how they are and such.   My question is, are they breaking the law by doing these things? I have already talked to both of them and told them that they aren't supposed to be doing this because he is violating the PFA.  They insist they want to keep him talking to find out if he has a lawyer and see if he files for divorce or not. Because apparently if he files for divorce first he gets the house and more pick of what he wants??  TL;DR Are you breaking the law by being a line of communication between someone who has a restraining order against them and the person who got the order?"	No
Up-front, this a very strange scenario, but it's true.   A friend of mine found himself in a very bad situation when he was living as the boyfriend in his long-time girlfriend's house when she decided to leave him. She disappeared and left him sitting in a house to which he had no legal claim. (She makes a lot of money.)   My friend had basically saved the life of another close male friend of his, and this friend, who was also looking for a real estate investment, offered to buy the house from his ex and let him continue to live in it if he simply paid the costs of owning the house. This was about a year ago, and I warned my friend that after his last debacle, he should insist on some legal agreement guaranteeing his right to continue occupying the house. I had suggested using an instrument like a Life Estate, which I knew about via family history.   I thought he had done this (He gave me reason to believe he had.), but he is stupid about these things and too trusting, so he didn't obtain any kind of legal agreement that would guarantee his right to occupy this house. He has nothing but a verbal agreement about his living situation; his friend assured him that he could live there for as long as he wanted, the rest of his life.   Fast-forward: he and the guy who bought the house have had a falling out, and the owner of the house is making rumblings about kicking him out.   Is there anything my friend can do to avoid being evicted from a house someone told him he could live in for the rest of his life? I'm afraid he's screwed. He has lived there less than seven years if that makes a difference.	No
"I'm in Indianapolis. I have a rental house and the sewer line has a partial collapse. It will have to be replaced but the lowest estimate is $6,500 and I cannot afford that.   There is a clause in my lease stating: ""Clause 24. Partial or Total Destruction of the Premises by Acts of God / Casualty or Untenantable Conditions; If the premises are partially or completely destroyed or rendered untenantable by a fire, earthquake, tornado, explosion, terrorist act or any other occurrence or Act of God that is not caused by Tenant’s negligence or willful act (or the negligence or willful act of Tenant’s family, agent, or guest), the Landlord, in its sole discretion, may elect to: (1) repair or rebuild the premises during the period of untenantability, refunding the rent proportionally that had been paid in advance for the period starting from the date of the damage; or (2) not repair or rebuild the premises, terminate the Lease effective as of the date of the occurrence and refund the rent proportionally that had been paid in advance for the period starting from the date of the damage.""

I moved into the landlords property 5months ago, when showing me the house the back gate was closed and I saw no reason to go into the communal alleyway.   After id moved in the landlord gave me a list of things that need repairing and told me if anything else needs doing then to add it to the list. I could see that the back gate leading to the alleyway was being held up by a brick so I went outside to check what work needed doing on the gate.   When I opened it there were huge trash piles bin bags,general waste,child items and broken chairs etc. There were child items and bits of trash leading to the back gate, I assumed it was either the last tenant or the landlord himself that had dumped waste behind the gate. I text the landlord about the waste and he said he'd see to it, a few weeks later I noticed rats in my garden entering and leaving through under my backgate so I rang the local council and informed them about the flytipping and rats and never heard anything back other than they'll send somebody out.   Now months later someone from the council knocked on my door telling me that I need to move the waste or i will see legal action. I informed them of the situation (they were very sceptical) and passed on the landlords information. I rang the landlord and informed him about the council arriving and he asked to see pictures of behind my gate (I sent them) and I didn't hear back.   2 weeks later i get another letter from the council saying the rubbish needs to be removed so I rang my landlord to ask what is being done about it. He said he had spoke with them and that he knows nothing of the waste and then proceeds to tell me that if they find out it was me I will be fined.   My landlord is denying all knowledge, I have pictures that were sent through facebook to my mother of the waste all behind the back garden but I dont know if that's enough evidence. Since I've moved In the waste has grew larger and larger to the point where i can't get out of my back garden as the neighbors are now flytipping behind my gate. I'm a separate note ive just recorded a neighbour throwing waste multiple times behind my gate, but I still don't believe that thats enough evidence to prove that I haven't dumped there.	No
Title is pretty self-explanatory, I got into an accident, my rear bumper got ripped off 2 weeks ago and I just got a ticket in the mail for careless driving. The cop did NOT see the accident and the entire encounter was overall friendly. Now I know I can just talk to the prosecutor before court and have it knocked down to unsafe driving but that's a $400 fine that I'd rather not pay if I didn't have to. Since the cop didn't see the accident and the other driver isn't gona show up to court to testify against me if that were the case, so what are my options? Any advice would be greatly appreciated	No
Nyc here.   I painted my cabinets in my nyc apartment. My super off the books told me that they were renovating the studio into a one bedroom after our tenancy was up, and not to worry about it as they were gutting the place. This is my fault, I know this and I accept this.   These cabinets are clearly quite old, although I'm sure they had many years left. I made sure that the paint was easily able to be scraped away, (not relevant I'm sure).   How much can the landlord charge for these damages? Can they charge for a complete set of new cabinet doors? I've found a source that says that cabinets last 50+ years. If these cabinets were, say, 30 years old, wouldn't the value depreciate?  Thanks for the advice!	No
Throwaway account. I am a fully insured driver, was driving to church (honestly) this morning and went to make a right turn. There is a bicycle lane on the road I was turning off of. No light at the intersection, it is a suburban area. I passed the bike rider on my right, and went to make a right turn. There was enough time that if I continued my turn without stopping, I would have been gone before the bicyclist got to the intersection.  As I was turning, there was a female waiting to cross, so I stopped and waved her across the intersection. I was stopped in the bike lane while she crossed, and as she was about halfway across the bicyclist hit me in the rear. He immediately said that I hit him, but I don't think that's in dispute since the lady crossing gave a statement that she saw me wave her across and I was stopped when the guy hit me. He got up and walked to the side walk but said his shoulder was hurting. He thinks he hurt his clavicle, but refused an ambulance trip to the ER.  Cops came and took statements, they gave me a ticket for failing to yield the right of way to the cyclist. I am going to fight it in court because I feel I was yielding the right of way to the pedestrian. I also feel that since the guy hit me when I was stopped, he should be at fault for not stopping or avoiding me as I think there was enough time (he hit me in the rear, not the side, so I didnt cut him off with no chance to react). Is there grounds to fight the ticket? If the insurance companies get involved and he tried to sue me for damages, am I already going to be liable since the cops gave me a ticket? Any advice welcome.	No
Background info: My mom is an alcoholic and has been for about 4 years. She got arrested about 3 years ago for a *dwi* and earlier this year she got a TIPS surgery because her liver is shit.  6 day's ago my mom picked me(16) up from the cinema and my sister(14) who was in the car along with my step-sister(15) and cousin (8) told me that my mom had bought some alcohol when she when nobody was watching her (this is like the 5th time she has relapsed since her surgery). I got in the car and she drove off, heading home. I called 911 and told the operator the situation and an officer pulled us over and arrested my mom. She stayed in jail for 24 hours after her parents bailed her out. Now, 4 days later, she is getting her license revoked for 5-10 years and going to jail for a year if she doesn't get a lawyer. What do we do?	No
Firstly, we're located in Oregon. It's been a long road and there's so much information that I'm not even sure to begin, so I'll just list the facts. My SO impregnated his (now ex) girlfriend after a couple months of seeing each other. He already had a son from a previous relationship and has shared custody of his 8-year-old with his son's biological mother. His son's biological mother is a heroin addict and is not in the picture at all.   The newly impregnated girlfriend (who I'll refer to as Megan for this post) and he decided that they're going to try to make it as a family because she wanted to keep the baby. SO's relationship with Megan lasted a little over 3 years and during that time, Megan attended a community college and was a stay-at-home mom for both the 8-year-old and their shared son. SO worked full-time and paid a majority of the bills. She used her refund checks from student loans to pay the rent only. The 8-year-old was encouraged to think of Megan as his mom. The end of the relationship seemed amicable and mutual. They even hugged after the breakup. Megan requested that SO not stay at the house anymore, so he started to stay with me. He and I were best friends and I lived in a small one bedroom apartment. There wasn't enough room for the 8-year-old and SO didn't want to leave Megan financially devastated because she still did not have a job. He continued to pay all of the bills for Megan which was about $1,100 a month and he would go to Megan's house each night to put the boys to bed. They were trying to keep up consistency so that the routine didn't change that quickly. He even spent his days off over there so that the boys didn't miss any time with him; he was at Megan's house as often as he was before the breakup. This pattern continued for about 6 months and during that time, SO and I became romantically involved. As soon as Megan discovered he was moving on, the entire situation became very hostile and ugly. Turns out she was harboring love for him still and had deluded herself into thinking they would get back together. Fast forward about a year and SO and I have moved into our own two bedroom place. The 8-year-old is in our care. His little brother is now a toddler and he lives with Megan. We have countless harassing texts, voicemails, emails and FB messages from Megan who has been a continued nightmare. She even went as far as to attack my SO's professional profile on both FB and Amazon. We have screenshots and countless prints of her erratic behavior. She became very fixated on me and insists that I'm taking her life away from her. She's convinced that I'm an evil mastermind and said she was going to make sure that I never got to be around either of the boys. A little about Megan, she's a very intelligent person, but she's also conniving, capable of delusions and has an obvious superiority complex. SO and Megan are still in an ongoing battle for their shared toddler and that trial will take place this September. SO recently received an email from Megan where she informed him that once the battle for their shared toddler was over that she fully intended to take him to court over the 8-year-old. She's not legally or biologically connected to him, but they did develop a mother-son relationship for a little over 3 years. We were still letting the 8-year-old see her every weekend until she threatened to take him away from him father. Her email wasn't stating that she wanted parenting time or visitations, she wants take custody of the 8-year-old and have him in her home. Can she legally do this? I'm baffled as to how she could. The attorney we spoke to said that her chances of winning were nonexistent. Megan has been very confident and stated in her email that the attorney she spoke to said the state of Oregon does recognize her parentage and she can take SO to court over the 8-year-old. Please help. We're stressed and quite frankly, I'm not sure what to believe.   TL;DR My boyfriend's ex-girlfriend helped raise a child for 3 years. She is not related to the child nor did she and my SO marry. We have a lot of documentation that she's not a rational or reasonable person. Can my SO's ex-girlfriend win rights to a child that's not hers?	No
"The title is self explanatory. My ex boyfriend's pre-trial court date is tomorrow regarding violating the order of protection I have. In CT that is a class D felony. I checked online and during his last court date he plead ""not guilty"", so I'm assuming tomorrow the judge either decides if he is found guilty or not. If he is found guilty, is there another date scheduled in the future for sentencing?  I know nobody can 100% predict what the judge will decide, but what are the chances he receives jail time? He was arrested for harassment in the 2nd degree (class C misdemeanor),  conspiracy to harass (class C misdemeanor), and stalking in the 2nd degree (class A misdemeanor). Since it was his first offense, he was allowed to join the Family Violence program and take some counseling. But, during that time he broke the no-contact protective order the court gave me.   I'm really worried if he receives jail time he will try to harm me. I know his family and him own weapons, but I obviously have no proof to show the court. During his court date tomorrow I have to take an exam and there is no way I can change the date. I'm so worried about leaving my baby sister and family alone in the house in case he comes to my house after. I'm not sure if I'm just thinking irrationally because of fear. I already have bad anxiety and OCD, so my thoughts are a mess right now. I keep on having a tick where I'm imagining him hurting my family and I can't get it out of my head no matter how much I try to fight it. I'm really unsure of what to do. Any help is appreciated."	No
"Hi Everyone,  I'm in the middle of one of the most messed up situations I have ever heard. As a  start I am BP1 and dependent on my wife . About 10 months into our marriage my wife started constantly skipping work to meet up with a friend's brother and fool around in our car. She got bold enough to rent a hotel room to have sex with him and I caught her. This is the time she exposed herself as a narcissist as she really couldn't show any remorse.  The day I found out her parents just showed up and her mom was very angry. They went on a short walk and Upon returning her mother completely changed and said that my wife has been living in fear of me and that we should be separated. My wife talked privately with me and cried and pleaded to stay and I said whatever you told your mom obviously was taken very seriously. Her mom went into Super protection mode and did not hold my wife accountable whatsoever, while my wife blocked me out of everything.  I start living at the house alone with my dog and two cats and start losing weight and making positive changes. I talk daily with my wife with a lot of communication that was always attempting to be positive. Fast forward a few weeks her brother has a wedding near our one year anniversary. After the wedding she went to her friend's house to meet up with her Affair partner and ""see how each other feels."" I snapped the picture of her car and his car and texted her that I was done and to feel free to stop by the house and talk. I was then completely mind f***** for about 5 hours until I finally realized she didn't want to come back she just wanted that as an option. I asked her to leave and she claimed to go home to her mom's but lied and admitted later she went to the""domestic abuse shelter."" She continued by saying that she was going to commit suicide and the counselors at the shelter wanted her to go to the hospital. My best friend died November last year from suicide, looking back I see now she was playing on that to keep me roped in.  A week later I stop by Petco after a therapy appointment and see the affair Partners vehicle. So I stop and wait about 5 minutes because I wanted to ask him if he was still seeing my wife / aware of suicide threats. She had been playing this oh my phone randomly shuts off game like I'm retarded for days before this so I had very little contact and was desperate for a smidgen of Truth. I was shocked when out of the corner of my eye I see my wife driving in our car with him in the passenger seat. She saw me and turned around in the parking lot so I jumped in my car and caught up. I videotaped so that way she was unable to narc her way out of it. I foolishly thought she would pull over and say okay The Jig Is Up.  Of course her Affair partner called the cops  and they pulled over into a parking lot and so did . They asked if I was following that car and I said hell yeah that's my wife and her Affair partner and she is supposed to be in a domestic abuse shelter and suicidal. Her response to them was oh I am terrified of him he carries a gun. The police asked I said no and it moved on very quickly. They said it sounds like it's time to move on and I said no crap dude. They were super cool mostly because I was obviously taking a video and not trying to physically do anything at all and it was apparent. She felt she was completely untouchable, but had finally been caught red-handed publicly. Several days later I get served with an order to appear in court for one of those blasphemous ex parte orders of protection which is early next week.   She is claiming I was stalking her because I ""knew of her whereabouts"" and that I was carrying a gun around the house and that she was in fear of her life. She has explained over and over to her mom dad myself and anyone that I have and never will harm her in any way. But for it to fit the statue it has to be fear of her life. The third thing she referenced was from a year-and-a-half ago and she claimed when she bailed me out after a bar fight I was in a rage and try to Veer her car off the road. This was about a three-minute drive on the way to my pdoc / therapist. It even reads like complete b*******. I believe completely that I am about to walk in there and get crucified. Her narc is so strong in so many ways. She is the queen of isolating me and telling one side of stories. It's clear to me that she wants the house to herself without me around so she can move her boyfriend in and also get revenge for being caught red-handed because that's basically criticism and that's not something she deals with. Sorry for the wall of text there are more details but I try to keep it short. I will probably come back through Andrea edit. Any help advice anything would help at this point."	No
Uh hello guys, so this very crooked media group is talking about my son doing some things that they claim are illegal and he didn't do these things, but he just posted some content on twitter that says he did do these things. Now I know some very big lawyers, the best lawyers, let me tell you. I don't know, but people are telling me all sorts of things. I have so many people working on this, the best people, but you can never have too many of the best people.  What is collusion? Let's say a member of a not low-level US campaign, you know, offered to throw out some nasty regulations in exchange for some TRUTH about crooked Hil... about another candidate. Would that be not legal?	No
So I worked for this company and left after 5 months but they are asking for £200 for training me. Is this legal? 	No
Hello, I entered into an illegal sublet agreement with the lease holder in February, 2017 who had taken a security deposit and overcharged us on bills. However, while moving in we were notified by the landlord that the lease holder had no permission to do this and we signed under a new sublet agreement with the landlord with an additional deposit.  We had to end our sublet earlier than the termination date and the lease holder doesn't want to come back to finish her lease, wants us to remove all of her furniture and items, and is refusing to give back our security deposit.   We found out about the bills when we found out from the landlord that the rent is $400 cheaper than what the lease holder demanded, but after discussing with her we relented to just paying her that amount, even without proof of receipts. Stupid, I know, but I was naive and she was adamant and pregnant so we just dropped it.   Can we sue them for the overpaid bills and the lack of security deposit or is it null because we signed into a sublet with the landlord? As a subletter am I responsible for terminating the sublet early? I have the lease agreement (with the landlord because I'm assuming the one signed with the lease holder is void) and to me it seems like there isn't a clause about such an event except for one part which I'm not sure if it says that I am the responsible one for the termination or if it is the lease holder's responsibility. From websites I've looked at it seems that it's not the subletter responsibility.  Other than ending early, we've been as helpful as we can and the landlord initially told us she empathized with us and that she would give back our additional security we had given to management, but now I think that the lease holder lied to her and now the landlord is saying she can't guarantee it. They've been coming in and out with repairmen and showing the apartment while we've been here busy packing so it's been a bit of a bother as well.  We're both not well off financially so I don't know how much it would cost to sue or how we can go about getting our security back, if we even can.  Very sorry about the long wall of text. Any information and advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.	No
She's got BPD and bipolar with mental trauma from being molested as a toddler by her parents, and she's recently been put on new meds which caused all sorts of psychosis and delusions until they kicked in.  Three years ago, her 8 year old nephew was staying the night with her and bugging the he'll out of her. She put half a MG of klonopin in his drink so he would go to sleep. Her new meds are making her feel guilty for all her past wrongs, but she told her therapist about this and was told it has to be reported to the hotline on Monday.   We're in Arkansas, what can we expect? She's on disability and her mental health can't handle jail. I'm freaking out, she's calm.   During a bout of mania she told her sister, the boy's mother, a few weeks ago when she went to the hospital to try to be checked into behavioural health while her meds were asjusting. The mother didn't press charges, and those doctors didn't report it. What is going to happen? It's not like there's proof, and maybe the statute is up?	No
"After almost two years of giving the landlord the benefit of the doubt and not making serious repairs, we finally draw the line. City inspectors come out and say it's serious. The city is filing criminal charges. Now we're waiting on the magistrate's decision on how much rent we get back out of escrow because they say they can't make the repairs.  Three times in the last two weeks, twice before the hearing, and once after, associates of the landlord have stopped by to ask us to leave. Now we have a notice that they're going to enter the premises today and tomorrow, and that it would be convenient for them if the house is empty. (delivered to a minor daughter) As far as I can tell, Ohio law states that once we've filed for escrow, they can't ask us to leave.  The wife is writing a letter to the magistrate as we speak, outlining what she believes is a serious transgression.   My only concern is that the judge is going to think we're just digging for money or something. But I think, as we've payed on time diligently for two years and have given them wayyyy more latitude with repairs than most would, we're probably on the safe side.   Should I be asking for something specific? Cease and desist? Protection order? Or just leave it as extra information to add to the case?  The letter is ""signed"" by the landlord even though he's out of the country for three more weeks. The requests for continuance were also ""signed"" in such a manner. Should I press the issue of forgery?  If they do try to enter the premises, am I right to tell them to f%^&amp;* off? and call the police?"	No
"I live in Dallas, TX.   The mother and my child and I have a standard visitation court order. We got it made in Beaumont, TX because that's where she was living at the time. My rights are I get standard visitation: weekends, certain holidays, summers, etc. I also pay child support. Since our court order, my child's mother has been on a downhill slope. She's a stripper, a prostitute, she's on drugs, constantly getting new numbers/addresses/boyfriends. My son (4 years old) stays with his younger half-brother's (2 years old) grandparents and dad. They do not even live with her at this point. He's not potty trained, can't speak that well, hits himself when he's angry, isn't in school, has marks on him from her hitting him with a wooden solo on his butt. She isn't aware that we know all of this and have been keeping tabs on her. We've had multiple people tell us she's suicidal and need to take my son away before it's too late.   Today when I went to get him from her, I secretly video taped her giving me permission to keep my son while she ""takes some time to get her life together."" Now, what steps do I need to take from here? I want to get primary custody of him and have this documented so she can't have him. I'd honestly like to limit his visitation from her until she gets her life together. Do I call CPS, the courthouse where we got the court order? Also, if she wants him back sooner than we expect (we imagine she will change her mind quickly), do we have to give him back since she stated on video we can keep him or are we forced to abide by the court order regardless? Please give me advice on where to proceed from here. Thank you."	No

"Hindsight is 20/20. I realize now my mistakes: Holding rental property with out deposit or signed lease or any money what so ever.  The wife of the couple 23f and 23 m military put me on the spot several times.    Things I've tried to graciously provide but is turning and in fact turned into a nitpicking negotiating, bulldozing nightmare.  ""Reduce the pet fee since one pet is emotional therapy but will not prove it""  ""Let us paint (before even seeing the house it's recently been professionally painted for 2k)""  ""Let us meet you in the middle of the night, give us directions for an hour, invite all our friends and bang on the door,oh we forgot the money, we didn't bring the signed lease, we couldn't find a printer, we don't want to sign the lease until we pay and didn't want to pay until we found out your a real person not a craigslist killer""  Everything screams (I'm an idiot me the op and they are entitled)  They've been in the house since 1am Saturday, can't get them to answer to meet up for the lease and payment, they promised they would but like everything else they just end up doing what they want.  When I called this evening they finally answered and instead of giving me a time to meet they say ""we don't wanna pay the full month and want you to take off money from the deposit we have a list of discrepancies, and instead of 865 we want to pay 500""  I explained I already did the walk through with them every appliance is new, we did not provide a washer and had warned them that, now that is a bargaining chip for them.  I saw the writing on the wall and said  ""You've not paid any money you've not signed a lease and you've not stopped making demands-it's clear I'm not going to make you happy this isn't working""  He says ""I need a week"" but also cusses me out and threatens me that they haven't signed anything so he doesn't have to do ""jack S----""  I say ""please no hard feelings but this will never work you've not jumped through any of the hoops that tenants are supposed to and I've had to do every single thing what your asking me to do now is too much special treatment""  The house could pass a military inspection it was spotless ontop and behind appliances professionally cleaned.   They are not in the same reality... I know really shouldn't have let them move their stuff in but they were ""please don't make us get a storage unit tonight just for one night"" and he is a marine who just got back the beginning of the month, I didn't know things would get so out of hand but they kept pushing.  I ended the conversation by saying I might be able to give you 48 hour but I need you guys out because I really did hold the house for you and this has gotten out of hand, your not wanting to pay and your taking advantage of me (my stupidity in reality).  What do I do? I need to know my rights, I am getting a property manager but I would like to get them out since they have no intention of really paying and keep stalling.  I have his commands number but I do not know legally if they are squatters or what I have done. We only want them gone with out retaliating in the form of damage."	No
Hi all,  I've recently renewed my lease read over it several times and saw that the management increased the rent from what was previously discussed. They argued price includes utilities the lease however only said it included pest control. I told the entire office this(4 people) this and all of said that the total lease amount is all I'd pay. I was dumb, too trusting and signed the lease electronically. Today I got an email that said that my lease did not include any of the utilities including pest control.   Can I legally break the lease without financial penalty for them charging me a dollar a month for pest control when it was explicitly said in the lease that it was included?  I live in Florida.	No
There was an offer for 499 a month on rent and I tried signing the lease online the day after the offer expired and online it said the lease was unsigned. Now I am being told that I do have the lease but I do not want it anymore. Do I have any right to get out of this lease? They're telling me it is legally binding and won't break it.  This is in Illinois	No
Hi, Here's a quick timeline of what went down: June: House is listed for sale- we make a cash offer within 3 days. The seller accepts our offer. We go through with various inspections to get through all the contingencies set forth in our contract.   After a few weeks we find out that there's an issue with the title- the seller's husband had died a year ago and they were both still on the title. Apparently they never got his assets taken care of/divided? They go to probate court in CT, and it's listed in the court's case-lookup as about 3 weeks after the initial listing and about 2 weeks after the accepted offer.   According to the seller's attorney, they expected the probate court process to take 4-6 weeks. I don't believe it because I haven't seen a single instance of anyone's probate court matter being that expedited. Moreover, since the probate court has the case listed at the end of June, and it's already almost mid-August, that timeframe isn't correct.  Our contract has it outlined that if by November they don't have the matter resolved, we can walk away from the purchase.   My question is whether or not there's anything legally wrong with what either the seller, or the seller's listing agent did in this matter. It seems a little strange to me that a listing agent would accept selling a house without proper proof of ownership. I understand that sellers can being a sale during probate, but have found nothing regarding what happens if they put it up for sale before going to probate. It seems excessively misleading to do this- as we expected to have a standard closing timeframe, well within weeks and not within 12 to 18 months.  At this point, we'd be lucky to have the probate court ready by next July.  Any ideas/input? Thanks	No
"Location: Allegheny County, PA  I am the non-custodial mother of a 16 year old daughter. Due to a very complicated back story, I was alienated from my child for the past 11 years and she has always lived with her custodial father.   I have recently began a relationship with my daughter (i lived in a different state for most of her childhood) which is going very well. I don't bring up the past or bad mouth her father (my ex husband) but I also will not lie to her if she asks a question. We have formed a very nice mother-daughter relationship after many years of me being forced away from one.  Well, now my daughter wants to live with me, which I am 100% okay with. She said that she hates her school (she goes to a very rough school district) and has stated that her father hasn't been treating her well and has alleged abuse. I have no proof of that, but she has said that he hits her. When her father remarried there were also allegations of abuse by her step-mother that was investigated by child services but step-mom is long gone.  Long story short, she wants to live with me. I want her to have the best chance at life and will do whatever it takes to ensure she has every opportunity to achieve her goals. She asked her father (my ex husband and I do NOT communicate) and he flat out said ""no"", which was fully expected. 24 hours later she texts me saying her dad is kicking her out because she wants to have a relationship with me, her biological mother, and that I have to come pick her up. She shared text messages with me between her father and her and her ex step-mother (no idea why she's still involved) which were absolutely inappropriate and quite threatening towards my daughter.  She was allowed to pack up a few of her belongings and by the time i picked her up he had already changed all the locks on the doors and she was waiting with her minimal belongings at the end of her street.  She's 16, going on 17 in October...what do I do. I don't want the police banging down my door because they report her as a runaway. He absolutely kicked her out, I saw the conversations. I assume I have to file an emergency custody motion, I just want some advice on how to go about this. I don't know how any parent could just kick their child out of their house, especially their MINOR child. I don't want anything from him, I don't want child support, I don't want anything other than the rest of her personal belongings, and even then, everything can be replaced. But I have to get her enrolled in my school district pretty fast and I have absolutely NONE of her identification (social security card, birth certificate, etc). He doesn't have any type of health insurance for her, so it's not like I can even ask him to do that minimal bit by keeping her on his plan. Sorry, I'm rambling....  Basically, what do I need to do to cover myself and protect my daughter's best interests in all of this. She's more than old enough to have some say in all of this, i assume. I'm just working with a very limited time frame with school and everything and I guess just need some advice on where to start first.

"Hello! So here is what happened:    Back in April I paid $250 to have a self-employed stylist (she goes to people houses to do hair) to give me a ""brazilian blow-out"". For those of you who dont know what that is, here is the definition:    Brazilian hair straightening (also called Breezilian straightening, Brazilian Keratin Treatment, BKT, Brazilian Blowout, Escova Progressiva, Keratin Cure) are a semi-permanent hair straightening method done by temporarily sealing a liquid keratin and a preservative solution into the hair with a hair iron.   Typically this is supposed to last 10-12 weeks.   Well I paid her for this service, and awoke the next morning to discover my hair was a giant frizzy poofy mess (my baseline). I have had these done before in the past at salon's so I knew what to expect (not this); this was the first time I had used this individual.   I contacted her via facebook, as that was how we were communicating, informing her that her treatment did not work whatsoever and that I either want a refund or a treatment that actually works.   She blocked me.   I attempted to contact her via telephone and got no response.   Seeing as I didn't want to pay $250 for someone to shampoo and straighten my hair for an evening and given that I attempted to get a refund from her, I contacted my bank to dispute the charge on the basis of not receiving services I should have. (Of note, there was no 'no refund' agreement with this individual)  The bank decided in my favor and returned the amount to my account.   She has now charged me $250 again, without my permission and without contacting me.   Where do I go from here? Thank you in advance!"	No
"I live in an apartment complex with my SO and roommate. We called just about 3 weeks ago due to some small water damage on our ceiling following a rain storm; we are on the 4th (top) floor. The first call was just to report it and there was just a small amount of discoloration. The next day it rained again, however this time it was a different spot and the drywall had become very soft and discolored. A second call was made to report this new damage. The following morning/afternoon mold had formed on the 2nd wet spot, a third call was placed for someone to come out and check the damages to repair whatever was causing the leak.    Fast forward a week and no one has come out with a couple more calls and messages left for maintanence to come out. It rains again and 2 more wet spots show up, making 4 total, another call was made reporting new damage and we demanded someone come out immediately to check all the leaks and for the mold issue. Someone comes out to check it all and tells us that it is caused by condensation forming on the AC ducts. Cool no problem someone should be out to insulate the ducts to stop that from happening anymore. ""Okay well what about the mold issue?"" ""oh well yea I guess we can have someone come out and check on that aswell."" A couple days later we found a much larger spot of mold in our pantry opposite where the AC unit is stored.    So now we are around 3-3.5 weeks out from the initial incident and thry are aware of the amount of mold in the apartment. What are our options legally? We would like to leave without cancellation fees since this is not our first issue with maintenance. Its a standard month to month contract for 12months ending in November.    Thank you everyone if you need any information or pictures let me know and I can try and upload them, I am currently on mobile at work."	No
"Hey friends, would love the community's thoughts on my situation.   I own and operate an ecommerce store. We're currently talking to a well-known artist about licensing his work to use on our merchandise.   The artist's licensing people have asked for a proposed royalty, advance, and guarantee. I'm trying to calculate these figures in a way that makes sense. In the last 30 days, our top 400 products generated a total of $1900 in sales per product (over $20k annualized). We plan on licensing over 500 designs from the artist. What sort of calculation needs to happen here?   My understanding is that a royalty of about 15% is appropriate give the fame of the artist and the fact that I operate a sort of ""specialty shop."" I've heard a $25k advance for an artist's catalog makes sense. But what about the guarantee?   We only have an online presence (only retail, no wholesale).   Does anyone have any experience in this area? Many thanks in advance."	No
"My girlfriend and I moved out of our apartment in Washington on the last day of May this year. The rental office did a very cursory walkthrough with us about a week before we moved out, but there was no official itemization of security deposit deductions. When we left the apartment, we took pictures of a single small spot of damage we had left on a closet wall, but beyond that saw no damage or noticeable scuffing worth documenting.   About two weeks after we left (mid-June), we received a bill which, in addition to cleaning fees and some maintenance things, included a $225 painting charge. The included checklist, which was filled out after we had left, noted that ""12-20"" walls would need to be repainted, citing ""rubbing or scuffing through the paint"" as the reason. To the best of my memory, there was nothing beyond the spot in the closet that would warrant repainting whatsoever.   My question is this: is there any recourse for us to dispute this charge? Is the burden on them to prove the need for that much repainting, or on us to prove that there was nothing beyond normal wear and tear on the walls? We also had two roommates (who moved in later and did not pay deposit fees) who agree that there was no damage to the walls."	No
I have a question about disabled parking in a residential area. I live in an apartment complex in Ohio that provides only street parking. I'm disabled from arthritis and myositis (a chronic muscle disease) so I have difficulty with standing up and with walking very far. Because of this, I do need room to open my car door all the way and to lift my legs in and out of the car. Lately I've had trouble getting a close enough space, or sometimes people will be parked too close to my door for me to safely get myself and my legs in even if I'm displaying my disabled placard. I'm afraid of falling because I am also pregnant and therefore even less steady. I'm wondering if there is a way to ask for a reserved space and who I'd have to ask because of it all being street parking - is this something I'd ask apartment management or someone else? Is there even anything that can be done?    Thank you for any advice.	No
Hello! So my girlfriend has received a traffic citation on Friday from an apparently hit and run accident on June 18th. It's a misdemeanor failure to stop property damage citation with no insurance/registration(She has proof of both)  She is very unsure of this whole deal, I'm just trying to find some answers to help ease her uncertainty. I know the basics of never talk to police, get a lawyer etc. but I don't have much knowledge and feel bad I can't help more.  She is claiming not to remember any accident, or damage to her car. I believe there may be a scratch on her mirror that's about 2cm but she says it's been there before.   Anyways I'm wondering what to tell her to do besides getting/talking to lawyers, what's the worst case scenario outcome, no criminal record, first offense, one speeding ticket 6 years ago etc. and since there is only the failure to stop property damage citation(well no insurance and registration C/I's that she has proof of so no biggie), does that mean it's just the only accusation we have to worry about? Reckless/careless driving or other things at a later date from this incident isn't a concern right?    Just want to give her some clarity on everything and what she's facing, thanks so much. Let me know if you need anymore info.	No
Long story short: my ex wife broke my wrist and I am almost 2k in debt because of it. We had TRO's on each other and she had a harassment charge against me. Everything was dismissed, the deal was I drop everything if she drops her TRO and harassment charge and pays my medical bills.  She agreed and my lawyer sent her lawyer my bills. It has been 2 months and I still havn't gotten a dime. My lawyer is an old dude and I just dont wanna bother him anymore about it. He gave me copies of the agreement, I talked to my ex-wife but as expected she completely ignored it.  What legal course can I take?	No
So I worked for a pretty decent company for the past 6 years, I was part of particular department (we had 4 staff members and 1 outsourced IT personnel, that we picked up a few months back).   I was brought into the office of my VP this past week and was being told I was laid off, nothing more. I never had a negative review, never had any work performance issues. I was brought in and told my position was being outsourced. Now what has me wondering is, my title was the same as the rest of my team and we all had different responsibilities. They are currently hiring for the team (but as a different title).. and when I brought this up they told me I can put a resume in and if I qualify for the position they would consider me. I am completely livid, they offered me two weeks of severance after 6 years of working there and that is all.   I am located in Long Island, New York. I just don't see how it can be legal to lay me off (I have been in the company the 2nd longest).. when they are hiring for a position under the same supervisor - while having 4 people with the same title - and they state that its because they are outsourcing my position.	No
"My roommate and I were living in an apartment complex and just recently moved out into a different place. We made the mistake of renewing our lease way before the end of the one we had, but we found a better place, forfeited our security deposit and moved out. Before we moved out, we discussed with the main office about damage to the living room carpet and decided to get it replaced. Fast forward to a couple days ago, we receive the itemized damages in the mail. The carpet replacement cost was a lot more than we expected. Attached to the damages report was a summary of the work order done by their maintenance crew on site (their direct employees). On it was the cost of the materials (carpet cost per linear foot) and what specifically was done, how many workers accomplished the task and how long it took (6 man-hours). They charged us $34/hour for labor. I know for a fact the maintenance workers don't make that much as an hourly rate, so wouldn't every bit above what it costs to pay them an hour just be revenue to the apartment company? I don't know much about law, but I couldn't find anything super helpful online. The only thing I found was [this US code](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/24/982.313) which states: ""After deducting the amount, if any, used to reimburse the owner, the owner must refund promptly the full amount of the unsued balance to the tenant."" So if we're only required to reimburse them for the work done, nothing more, then we should just have to pay the worker's hourly wage."	No
My husband and I are a young couple barely starting to build a life. We bought a trailer home for $500 with the idea of repairing it slowly since it's a bit run down.   We needed somewhere to put it so we got a property which was $1000 of downpayment and would be $250 every month.   We paid someone close to $2000 to move the trailer home into the property. He did and its been there for about 2 weeks now.   Today my husband got a call from the lady who sold him the property saying that she wants to break contract and move our home elsewhere into another one of her available properties all because the man who lives right next to our property is complaining that our home is too ugly to be next to his or in his immediate vicinity. The lady is siding with him because this man turns out to be the city commissioner.   The other available properties are not the same as the one we have now. They are by a creek and they pretty much get flooded every time it rains. The lady did offer to pay for someone to move our home again and use the first downpayment for whichever other property we get so we wouldn't have to pay twice but we don't want to settle for less just because this man feels superior to us but we don't know what to do.   Please help us. Your advice will be greatly appreciated.   	No
Hello /r/Legaladvice,  I guess i'm not sure where to turn here. 3 months ago I completed my graduate degree. Upon doing so the owner of the company I work for told me that everyone was proud of me for doing so, but he felt that the company may not be able to pay me what I am worth, and encourage me to go fourth and find somewhere that would be willing to pay what they felt my degree deserved. I was very appreciative of their honesty, and up until that point loved my job. So i've been job hunting for a few months, found another great opportunity and accepted an offer. I went into my current job and told them immediately because I wanted to give them as much notice as possible, because they've been so great to me. This all happened yesterday. I came in today, and was basically told to pack my shit and that today was my last day. Do I have any recourse here? I would have started the new job next week had I known that giving my notice would just turn around and bite me in the ass? I have nothing in writing as at the time I didnt consider it would be necessary. Now i'm liking going a month without pay (both company pay bi-weekly, and new job is a cycle behind). Am I entitled to any form of payment, as the owner very clearly verbally stated that I would be able to work out a 2 week notice. Does being let go today, negate the chance of receiving unemployment in the mean time? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Apologies if this is the incorrect subreddit for these types of questions.   Location: Minnesota, US	No
I recently was signed power of attorney to sell a house that my grandmother left to her remaining children in her will. The arrangement was for the house to be sold immediately and the money divided between the three remaining sisters. After what has been almost a year, my aunt who was left with power of attorney has done nothing to settle the issue by carrying out my grandmothers will. After pleading with my aunt she agreed to sign over power of attorney so i can sell the house. Of the three remaining children who are entitled to a piece of what the house sells for one does not want the house to be sold. This being the case she has gone to the property broken the locks on the house and her daughter moved in to claim the house for her own. A week before power of attorney was signed over to me i went to the house with a officer and requested that she leave. The officers told me there was nothing that i could do unless i had power over the decisions to be made in selling the house. I was told to leave and escorted off premises. Now that i have power of attorney and spoken to a lawyer. I have been told that i would need to give two weeks notice of eviction and bring along the proper paper work. I have the deed, will, and Power of attorney over all decisions made from this point forward. I dont know what my next steps should be? I Live in San Antonio Texas and am 21 years old and not well versed on these issues. My main concern is that they destroy the house in the time they have to evict. The main reasoned iam worried about it is because they are known to pour quick cement down the drains and ruin the utilities before they move out. I need to write a eviction notice but dont know were to start. If anyone could give me some advice i would greatly appreciate it.	No
I applied for my drivers license and have a scheduled appointment for the driving test, and everything seems to be in order, no hold ups or issues. After getting back home and looking over the huge packet that came with my parent taught drivers ed I realized that I did not complete all the classroom hours required for the license, I noticed my mistake but the DMV doesn't seem to notice the problem. What do I do? For more info, I turned 18 this April.	No
How do I find a name for the eviction papers?	No
"The title wasn't very clear, I know.  Allow me to explain.  Please bare with me.  I am desperate for advice here.   I live in a duplex in a region with relatively high crime.  The lease agreement for myself and the other tenant in the house identifies that a background check is required for all tenants and that anyone who is residing in the home for more than ""X"" amount of days (can't remember the exact number but its about 2 weeks) must be processed through the background check and be signed on as a tenant of the home.  From day 1, about 5 months ago, the other tenant's boyfriend has been living here unofficially.  I have observed the trends of their schedule, to an extent, from my outdoor security camera pointed at the driveway/garage, and identified that the boyfriend does not appear to have a real job and spends nearly every hour of the day at home.  I have spoken with in briefly on only a couple occasions and he has a concerning demeanor.  I honestly don't want to judge a book by its cover, but living in an area like this, I can't help but believe he has a criminal record.  Why else would he not be put on the lease?    This next part might sound silly, but bare with me.  In our communal basement, which is where the washer/dryer are, I find several large piles of clothes regularly and I believe the boyfriend is running some sort of laundry business out of the basement.  Why is this a problem you ask?  The laundry is run constantly, the water bill for the house is split 50/50 for both apartments in the duplex, one set of laundry units he uses is hooked directly to the electricity for my apartment.  So he's living here illegally and is running a business out of the house with the help of my utilities.  I'll just list a few more things before getting to the point.  The boyfriend (or his girlfriend who is on the lease) does not contribute to the yard work, they smoke pot in the house, they smoke cigarettes in the house (violation of the lease), and they use a grill (also a lease violation).    My girlfriend moved in with me a couple months ago and has been worried about the other tenants ever since.  She is very afraid of the guy.  We have heard them yell at each other and we are we both uncomfortable living in the same house as them.  I have expressed concern throughout the last 5 months or so to the landlord and he has not taken action to investigate the boyfriend.  Note that this is an amateur landlord and this is his only rental property.  I believe he is also afraid to approach them.  I believe that because our landlord won't take action to justify the violations of our neighbor, he is essentially violating the lease agreement as well.    I want to break this lease without repercussions.  I worry that the boyfriend could be dangerous and I'm also fed up with my utilities being high due to his laundry business.  Does it appear that I have a case to break my lease?"	No
Location Vic/ Australia  I received a caution/ drug diversion for possession/ being under the influence of LSD along with a caution for possession of a air rifle last year (I'm young and stupid, that's a cop out but that's the truth).   I'm currently trying to apply for a working visa for Canada and for jobs. They ask about previous convictions and cautions including driving offences. I understand it's in my best interest to be truthful but I also know it could ruin my chances to mention these offences.   What I want to know is will they show up on a background check for my visa? I was told by police they wouldn't show up on police records checks for work as they are only cautions but I don't know if the visa application is more in depth.   Tl;dr received cautions in aus, will they show up on visa application for Canada?	No
Background: my building has a bad roach/water bug problem. My unit has it the worst because I'm right in front of the trash chute. Every day when I come home from work, I see at least 1 or 2 in my unit (dead, alive and/or dying). I also see them in the trash chute area, I see them in the stairway, I see them in the parking garage.  I have all of this documented with complaints and video/images.  In November 2016, they were so bad that I complained to the landlord, which resulted in them spraying my unit. They entered my unit without permission back in November, which I complained about, but I forgave.   The pests are back, and in greater numbers. Once again I wrote my landlord a certified letter on 7/14/2017 explaining the situation and asked that they **schedule** an exterminator for my apartment, or at least communicate with me what they plan to do to remedy the problem.   I had a feeling they wouldn't comply, like last time, so I put up a security camera. Sure enough, they came into my unit without **any** communication whatsoever.   I want out of my lease. Does this constitute a violation in the Chicago RTLO that is serious enough to allow me to *break* my lease?  Thank you for any help!	No
I'll try to keep this short and sweet. Significant other and I are moving in together. We signed the lease and our official move in date is August 1st. I am 27 weeks pregnant so LL has been allowing us to slowly move stuff into the house because I cannot lift or move heavy things so it will be a slow process. We have already paid landlord security deposit, first month's rent and the pet fee for our dog.   LL informed my SO via text last night that the previous tenant was still receiving mail and utility bills at our new address. LL stated in text that he opened one of the utility bills from the water company and saw where previous tenant owes utility company a past due balance of $806.31 and the total balance is $1016.78. LL said we must pay this utility bill or else the water is scheduled to get shut off on August 11th.  Obviously, SO and I do not want to pay this large utility bill for someone who is delinquent. We have already given LL $2500 and we haven't even spent a night in our new house. LL is saying we must pay it. I don't know how much truth that holds, hence why I'm coming to LegalAdvice.  I plan on calling the utility company when they open at 9 am and explaining my situation. But can the LL / utility company make us pay the previous tenant's past due balance? There is absolutely no way we can afford to pay the full balance at once but if we must, is there a way we can set up a payment plan? LL did not provide us with a stove or air conditioning unit, so we are also having to provide that for ourselves, along with furniture and other necessities.   If we are not responsible for the past tenant's utility, what will the company need to disconnect the previous tenant's bill and we continue to get service at our new address? I have a copy of our lease in my email but no printed version.   Any help at all would be super appreciated. Thank you!	No
I got into a car accident the other day where I rear-ended the person. I know you're not supposed to admit fault but it was definitely my fault. Anyway, I asked them if we could not go through insurance and I can just pay them cash. They agreed and said it would be fine, because it's a very minor accident. But how can I be sure that they don't go through my insurance anyway my my back? I gave them my contact information and insurance information. What can I do to protect myself so that way I'm not paying the money and then they just go and file a claim anyway.	No
"My husband and i bought a house a few months ago. We didn't get a termite inspection and in our state we didn't need to. We are now being told by our mortgage broker that the laws have changed and we must get one. We already own the home though, we closed a few months ago. I am curious if we don't get the inspection if there is anything legally they can do. I know it is ""in our best interest"" to get the inspection but can they legally force us to get one on a house we already own?"	No

My cousin is currently going through a psychotic break.  He has relapsed on drugs and alcohol since his best friend over dosed last year,  and has completely lost his mind.  He has admitted to being back on crack and drinking to the point of black out, but his actions also point to meth use.    He went missing for 4 days,  his sponsor went to his apartment  to find everything smashed,  all his money and belongings left behind and located him wandering the streets.  He was able to get him into a hospital but after giving him ativan, was released.    I want to make the drive from Ottawa to try and get him admitted,  but what are my chances of them actually keeping him against his will? Is there anything I can legally do with him being 40?	No
"Me and my friend are two students who enter college this year, and it is rather hard to find an apartment in Berlin where we want to study, since we live 6 hours away from it.  So last friday I find a fitting apartment on one of those websites where you search for apartments etc, and contact the person who put it on there. The text about the rooms sound good, but there is only an email adress at the end without a name to contact him. He replies the same day, telling me some details about the rooms in englisch (not in german, which I rather expected because the description of the rooms also where in german). I reply in englisch and ask for pictures of the rooms because there werent any on the website, and I also tell him that I can talk to him in german if he wants, because I thought he may be only writing in englisch because there are many foreign students who come to Berlin to study.   He then tells me ( still in englisch) that he Is in America until the end of the year, and asks me about details when we want to move in etc. This conversation goes on for a bit, notice that I still dont know his name or anything, but he sends me some pictures, which look good for a student apartment and seem to be connected to each other ( meaning they belong to the same apartment), although He said doesnt have a layout plan of the rooms.  I then agree and say that I like the apartment and ask on how to make it official. His response is:  He will send me a contract which I have to sign and send back to him, then transfer the deposit and the rent of the first month, and then we will send me the keys per mail.   He doesnt want to send the keys to a friend so we can visit the flat at first, because of ""past experiences"".  ----This is where I thought this may be suspicious.  I started to do some research on the Adress of the object, and found out that the same rooms where put on multiple apartment websites, but unlike the one which I found it on, these ones had a name at the contact part. I searched it up and it seemed to be an artist living in Berlin who even said on a website that he makes his rooms available for tourists to live in.   The next day I get the contract after he asked for some of my personal Information. Now this one is finally written in german but there are  obvious grammatical Errors in them which suggests that it is a rather poorly translated contract. It also Turns out that its not the person whose name is on the other websites, but the adress on them and the description text is the exact same as the one i applied for.  I ask him if its possible that we visit the rooms to make sure everything is as we discussed it and then we would sign the contract immediately.  Now he replied with the following:  ""As I told you earlier I only have the keys of the flat with me here so there's no way I can show you. I told you about this things previously and you agreed that I should send the contract to your email. Well, I understand if you cannot proceed but I assure you of safety with your money because the contract is legal from my lawyer.  My suggestion is that if you can pay just the rent alone I will post the keys to you and after you receive the keys and move in you pay the deposit. If this is satusfy with you or not please tell me immediately so I won't keep waiting for you all day as I have other interested applicants too.""    Is he trying to talk me into making a quick decision by lowering the price I have to transfer? Or is he a maybe a legit person who wants to get this over with?"	No

The title says it all. My sister's probation officer is as negligible as a law enforcement professional can be.   A bit of a back story on how my sister ended up on probation is needed. My sister at 7 months pregnant decided to drive heavily intoxicated with my 2 nieces. She was arrested, charged with 3 counts of child abuse/endangerment and a DUI. Even after being released from a short stay in jail and giving birth to my nephew, she continued to drink. Her PO gave her an option - 3 months mandatory in rehab or 3 months in jail. She decided to go to rehab and things were going pretty well.   Fast forward to today and she has not done any of her mandatory parenting classes or DUI classes and she is continuing to do drugs and drink. And this is not my opinion. If you took one look at my sister, you would know. Her behavior has caused my nephews and nieces assigned social worker to contact her PO and tell him that he needs to take a closer look at what is going on.   To top it all off, she has committed fraud 2 times already. First time she stole a check from a mailbox, went to a cash checking place and cashed it. The business found out what went on and filed a police report. Just today my dad's accountant made him aware of 3 stolen personal checks that my sister cashed. My dad filed a report with police but they stated that they can issue a warrant because it's hear say even though my dad had images of the stolen checks.   My parents called the PO and let him know they are extremely worried about her and his response was that he is aware of what is going on and that  he's going to give her a week to get it together! It's a joke. My parents response was that she could be dead in a week with how fast she is spiraling out of control. Yet she goes to probation today and nothing happens.   Somehow she has managed to pull one over this guy and it's sickening how oblivious to everything this guy is. He is completely negligent. She has somehow passed her drug/alcohol tests for probation (which are scheduled by the way and only a mouth swab) but she has not done any of her mandatory random drug tests for social services because they are random urine tests that she will fail.   My family and I want to file a grievance because the man is not doing his job. To be honest, I think he's sleeping with her. He doesn't know where she lives and she is lying about having a job. It's mind boggling. What do I do? I'm in Orange county, California.	No
Hello everyone I am 28 years old and when I was 17/18 I had a troubled youth and was arrested on 4 different occasions resulting in 7 charges.  All convictions were for 5 misdemeanors and 2 violations.       For the violations and 3 of the misdemeanors I was given youthful offender I believe.  For the other misdemeanors I believe my record has been sealed / expunged.       I got my life straightened out and I went back to school eventually and just received my masters degree.  I have been offered a position which will require a background check.  On the application it asks if I have ever been convicted of an offense that HASN'T been expunged/sealed or given youthful offender status.  I answered NO here as I believe my records are sealed and given youthful offender.      Honestly i'm not sure what the background check will show up.  These charges happened so long ago and I believe the records have been sealed as part of my plea agreements, but I cant be certain. I submitted a free background check on myself however I may not receive the results in time.       My question is what should I do in this situation?  Tell the employer about my past criminal history before I accept the official offer?  Or should I just not admit to it and hope my records have been sealed?	No
My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	No

She is not 21 yet. She bought a car and had been wanting to in awhile. I did not know about this but I am willing to help family unconditionally.  I just need to know why they need me. I think it's because she is under 21 and since no one else is currently able to sign, I will have to. I leased my own car years ago, so I am murky about the process.  Do I need to watch out for anything when I go to the DMV and sign my name to it? What do I do after she turns 21?	No
I'm aware that prenuptial agreements cannot decide child custody. However, is there any type of agreement that an unmarried couple (with plans to get married in future) can have drawn up stating that Spouse A won't actively seek primary physical custody and will cede primary physical custody to Spouse B given a divorce or separation as long as the court doesn't see this as not in the best interest of the child?  If not, what steps can the couple take to ensure Spouse B would get primary physical custody upon the event of a divorce or separation?	No
"Time is of the essence here because my savings is dwindling. I applied for unemployment benefits for the state of Ohio about 3 weeks ago, after being laid off May 30th from a company I worked for about a year and a half.   The status was ""pending"" as it takes about 3-4 weeks for them to begin paying. I filed each week, and met the requirements dictated by the state.  I was told by someone at the unemployment office that my company had until 7/13 to respond and that a determination would be made by 7/14. I was unable to check the status yesterday. When I logged in today, it appeared my claim has been closed out. I was unable to view the status of my previous claims filed, or file my weekly claim. There was a determination in my correspondence inbox.   This is where my confusion arose, maybe I'm reading thing wrong, but the determination said that the state had ALLOWED my claim, and listed the weekly amount payable. However, when I click on the payment summary, it list my claims as ""DENIED"".   I created an album so you can see what it is I am seeing. If anyone is familiar with this any advice or clarification would be greatly appreciated. I'm just looking for answers. I'm completely broke, and was counting on that money to see me through. I found a new job and will be starting next week, but I was counting on the $1200 from unemployment claims to get me through to my first paycheck.   Thanks in advance for your responses.

Hi all,  My mother in law was just at the casino playing slots when she hit a $1,200 jackpot. When they came to pay her out the manager told her he would only give her $800 because she did not have a good social security number (she is undocumented)  they then told her that if she made a big fuss about it they would ban her from the casino. Can anything be done here?	No
Family law cases, including domestic violence and child custody, represent the largest category of cases closed by LSC grantees each year. Millions of women, men, and children experience domestic violence in the U.S. every year. Legal aid is essential to protect domestic violence victims and their families and to help them overcome many associated problems that can endanger their safety and stability.   In 2016 LSC grantees closed 115,977 domestic violence cases involving nearly 282,014 victims and their families. This represents nearly 16% of all cases closed by grantees nationwide.  Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. On average, nearly **20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States.** During one year, this equates to more than 10 million individuals.   Often survivors face additional legal problems. Ninety-seven percent of low-income households with survivors of recent domestic violence or sexual assault experienced at least one other civil legal problem in the past year, including 67% that have experienced 6+ problems.   A study by the Institute for Policy Integrity found that civil legal aid is more effective than access to shelters or counseling services in reducing domestic violence—by as much as 21%. Increasing a woman’s chances of obtaining a protective order is the most effective way that legal assistance can reduce domestic violence. Survivors of domestic violence rate the filing of a protective order as one of their two most effective tools for stopping domestic violence, second only to leaving the abuser. Representation is critical in these cases as **83% of victims represented by an attorney successfully obtained a protective order, compared to only 32% of victims without an attorney.**  LSC grantees help clients [provide safe, stable environments for their children](http://www.lsc.gov/legal-aid-helps-domestic-violence-survivor-save-her-home), [build violence-free lives](http://www.lsc.gov/protecting-mother-six-domestic-violence-alaska), and [reunite with their families](http://www.lsc.gov/helping-father-reunite-his-children).

The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	No
So my story starts in September of 2016. I was laid off at my Insurance firm and went on unemployment. On May 1st I went back to my old job after the contacted me back. I hate to feel this way but last week pay  cuts got brought up and it kinda felt like it was suggested to take to cut or your going to be let go. I'm just wondering what my rights are. I think I exhausted all my unemployment before so I'm not sure if he lets me go I will have anything to fall back on. Serious advice only please 	No
Minnesota.  A couple of months ago my tenant gave me notice that he wanted to move out after the lease automatically renewed for a year term. I decided to be nice and allow him to with no penalty. Tenant said he'd be out by August 1st.   August 1st arrives and he asked for an extension of a week I had to give him extra time because I had no other choice even though I have new tenants lined up and they're mad at me. I told him he had to be gone Saturday. And just pay the amount of rent he would owe for that period.   I arrived home from vacation early this morning to find he STILL has stuff in the house. I stupidly do not have fines laid out on the lease. And I can not find how much I am allowed to fine him for breaking the term. Is there any way I can fine him for this huge inconvenience or am I just screwed?   Thanks for the input.   	No
"My landlord is deceptive:  1. His rent ad on the Internet said the rent is 425-400, and the deposit 250.  2. When I visited him to see the room, he said the better room (of the two that he had up for rent) is 435 (the inferior one being 425).  3. Next day I decided to rent the better room (435). But he said it's not 435 but 475. Plus, he demanded 300 dollars of security deposit. (Should probably mention that I have no pet so the deposit I payed does not include any ""pet deposit"" or whatsoever.) We argued and I ended up paying him 445 for rent and 300 for deposit. I got receipts for both the deposit and rent.  4. Later I found out that the security deposit must be no more than one half of the rent. Which means 445/2 = 222.5, not 300.  5. When I was demanding receipts for the deposit and rent, he was very reluctant and hesitant to write me them, saying he operates his transactions based on ""trust"". I'm very naive and inexperienced in life and this is actually my first time renting my own room, and he probably smelled my gullibility. Anyway, I ended up getting him write the receipts for the two.  We did not write any contract, just so you know.  Today (Aug 3) is the start date as well as move-in date of my month-to-month tenancy. I wanna give him notice to end my tenancy in a month (Sep 3) today because I cannot trust this guy. Do I have to get his agreement in order for my notice to be effective?  Also, it would be ideal if I can end the tenancy immediately today based on his deceptive overcharging of deposit. Would that be possible?"	No
"I have worked for this company since 2009. In 2015 I left for 8 months and when they asked me to come back we negotiated terms. As part of this deal I was now a salaried employee and working mon-Thursday. All was well and fine so I thought. Two months ago I put in a ""time off request"" for 8 working days in late June. The request was accepted and signed by the owner who is my direct boss. And nothing more was said. A week after I got back my boss told me that because I was gone so long I had to ""make up"" days I missed. This bothered me because he never mentioned it before I left or before he signed and agreed. It was only after I was back and he ""realized"" how long I would be gone. That's his fault. So he said I had to make up the days I was gone. He said he would pay me for 40 hours but the rest was on me to make up. I was bothered by it but ok whatever I'll work a Friday or two that's fine.    But then I got an email sunday asking me to fill out a new time sheet for the time I was gone and submit a plan in writing to him to make up the days I missed. Also He wants me to go through all my time sheets since I came back and document any other days he approved for vacation and document those on time sheets and show what days I will make up as well.    Then he is telling me that he is going to give me different vacation allotment because I work 4 days a week (32 total vacation hours per year when everyone else gets 40 hours no matter what) because I am salaried.   So do I have any room to say to him that I am not going to make up time because he did not require me to until after the fact?"	No
