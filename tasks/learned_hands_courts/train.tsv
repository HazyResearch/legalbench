So 4 of us are trying to rent a house together. 1 applicant was living with his relatives when they were evicted, his siblings were counted as unknown tennants while it was counted that he was  evicted twice, the renter said we just need it signed by a judge that he's not liable. We have no idea what's required to start the process, do we need to set up a court date? Or contact the renter? Or is it just something you can go up before a judge and knock it out? How long would the process take?	Yes
This is my first post to reddit so sorry if I seem a little lost, this just seemed like a good place to get advice. As mentioned in the title, I'm only 16, I live in West Virginia, and I already have a speeding ticket. I was caught going 40 in a 25. The reason behind it seems very generic, but basically I was trying to follow a friends car. We had been split at an intersection and he was barely in my pov so I sped up to try to keep up. Low and behold, a cop was set up right on the street I chose to speed up on. He pulled me over, handed me a ticket, and gave me a court date. I've never been to court and I have no prior moving violations, which is why I'm here. I have zero knowledge as what to expect to happen and what to do. I believe I show up well dressed, sign in, and then wait for my name to be called while waiting in a courtroom. I think I then walk up to a stand, the judge reads off my conviction, and then I give my plea and a reasoning. I'm thinking of saying No Contest as I feel I was speeding, but I'm honestly not sure if I was going as high as 40. To be frank I don't even know what speed I was going, as I was so focused on keeping up with my friend, but generally my car shakes at around 35+. And my car had not been shaking when I got pulled over. So does anyone's know what to do in traffic court? And what should I expect my outcome to be? I'm expecting to lose my license, but as said I have no idea. Also do remember I'm from West Virginia. I do know states have varying laws about this stuff. Thanks for your time!	Yes
I am in Oregon, sister in trouble is in WA. Her public defender is terrible. Our family is kind of shitty, and I have no money for an attorney. She has been waiting for trial for a very complicated case for 2 years. Her court-appointed attorney has ignored all of the resources and advocate options as well as contact info for expert witnesses I have provided. He has condescended to me, yelled at me over the phone. I told him that I will only communicate with him via email.  He has been often rude and aggressive toward her, then seems to have compassion on their next visit. He has told me to send the information and contact info of the people I have spoken to, they have tried to contact him, and no response. I wrote to him and told him she felt bullied and disregarded. He seemed to be on her side for about a month, then back to the roller coaster approach.  She said she has written a letter to the judge and told me it had been ignored. I have so few details, her self-worth is shattered, she has lost her fight. She told her psych doctor she wanted a new attorney and she was condescending and dismissive.  I have contacted another public defender in WA because I think she can switch easily if someone else is willing to step in? That person did not contact me back, and I donâ€™t want to continue barking up the wrong tree. I also am afraid that the next one might be worse.  What might my best strategy be? We have contacted all of the legal aid resources we could find, and have gotten very minimal response.  I really appreciate all of the great info here. Thanks for your time	Yes
My ex and I were living in North NJ for 4 years, and have been separated for 8 months with a separation agreement that we are both fine with. All our money is currently separate except that he's still on my health insurance.  My ex moved back to NYC, and I've been living here in NJ still, but want to move back to NYC as well. I just got a lead on an amazing deal for an apartment in NYC, but the catch is that I'd have to move in 6 weeks, when I was planning on moving in like 3-4 months after I filed the divorce papers in NJ. Should I go ahead and file in NJ in the next week or so? Is that enough time? I am fine with traveling back for court dates. Or should I wait and file it in NY after we meet the residency requirements (it would be February 2018)?  Are there any legal advantages to file in one state versus the other? Our divorce is super simple so I was planning on just doing the paperwork myself with a lawyer consultation/review. And as far as time from filing to divorce, is there anything that could prevent me from moving? If worse comes to worst, I could keep my mailing address in NJ if necessary.   I'd rather not pay his health premiums for the next 6 months, so if I can file easily in NJ, I'd prefer to do that, unless there are advantages to waiting. Thanks for your advice!	Yes
In the courthouses i have been to you are not allowed to bring cell phones into the court room. You can give them to cop at the front door and he will put it in an evidence envelope and five it to the valid to five to the judge.   My question is how do I present the evidence to the judge for her to listen to it? Do I just just cue up the video and play it on the phone?  Do I transfer it to a differnt device? Do I bring speakers to make it louder?	Yes
So I am wanted for a pretty serious crime, like probably the first or second biggest one. There is a international warrant for my arrest. I want to look at my options with a lawyer and see what the best way to approach this is. Say I meet up with one, and tell him my situation, can he tell the police.. Lets say I dont pick him, can he call the police and say hes in this state.. etc.	Yes
I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	Yes
"Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18.  - What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?  According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case. - Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?  So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
