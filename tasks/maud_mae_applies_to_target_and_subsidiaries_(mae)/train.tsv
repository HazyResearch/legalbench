A	“Material Adverse Effect on the Company” means any effect, change, development, event or circumstance that, considered individually or together with all other effects, changes, developments, events and circumstances, has had or resulted in, or would reasonably be expected to have or result in, a material adverse effect on the business, operations, financial condition or results of operations of the Inphi Entities, taken as a whole; provided, however, that an effect, change, development, event or circumstance shall not be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a Material Adverse Effect on the Company if such effect, change, development, event or circumstance results or arises from: (a) any adverse change in economic, financial, capital market, political or social conditions in the United States or in other locations in which the Inphi Entities have material operations that does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on the Inphi Entities relative to other participants in the semiconductor industry (it being understood that the incremental disproportionate adverse impact or impacts of such adverse change may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a Material Adverse Effect on the Company); (b) any adverse change in conditions generally affecting the semiconductor industry that does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on the Inphi Entities relative to other participants in the semiconductor industry (it being understood that the incremental disproportionate adverse impact or impacts of such adverse change may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a Material Adverse Effect on the Company); (c) changes in the stock price or trading volume of the Company Common Stock (it being understood that the facts or circumstances giving rise to any such change in stock price or trading volume may be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on the Company has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur, if such facts or circumstances are not otherwise excluded from such determination pursuant to this proviso); (d) the failure of the Company to meet securities analysts’ published projections of earnings, revenues or other financial metrics or the failure of the Company to meet internal projections, forecasts or budgets of revenues, earnings or other financial metrics (it being understood, however, that the facts or circumstances giving rise to any such failure may be taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse Effect on the Company has occurred or would reasonably be expected to occur, if such facts or circumstances are not otherwise excluded from such determination pursuant to this proviso); (e) any adverse change that is effected after the date of the Agreement in Legal Requirements or other legal or regulatory conditions, or in GAAP or other accounting standards (or the interpretation thereof), that does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on the Inphi Entities relative to other participants in the semiconductor industry (it being understood that the incremental disproportionate adverse impact or impacts of such adverse change may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a Material Adverse Effect on the Company); (f) any act of war, sabotage or terrorism that occurs, worsens or changes after the date of the Agreement in the U.S. or in other locations in which the Inphi Entities have material operations and that does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on the Inphi Entities relative to other participants in the semiconductor industry (it being understood that the incremental disproportionate adverse impact or impacts of such act of war, sabotage or terrorism may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a Material Adverse Effect on the Company); (g) any act of God, earthquake, hurricane, tsunami, tornado, flood, mudslide, wild fire or other natural disaster, weather conditions, epidemic, pandemic or disease outbreak (including the COVID-19 virus or the continuation or worsening thereof) or other force majeure event (including actions taken by Governmental Bodies in connection with such events) that occurs, worsens or changes after the date of the Agreement and that in each case does not have a disproportionate adverse impact on the Inphi Entities relative to other participants in the semiconductor industry (it being understood that the incremental disproportionate adverse impact or impacts of such event may be taken into account in determining whether there has been or would reasonably be expected to be a Material Adverse Effect on the Company); (h) the public announcement of the Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions (including the public announcement and identification of Marvell as a Principal Party or any public communication by Marvell or any of its Affiliates regarding its plans or intentions with respect to the business of the Company or any other Inphi Entity) or any loss of customers, suppliers, distributors or other business partners or employees suffered by the Company as a result of such public announcement; or (i) any stockholder class action or derivative litigation arising from or relating to the Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions commenced against the Company after the date of the Agreement and alleging a breach of fiduciary duty of the Company’s directors relating to their approval of the Agreement or false or misleading public disclosure by the Company with respect to the Agreement.
