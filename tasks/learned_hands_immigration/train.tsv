"Looking for information and the best route of action to take for UK Immigration.  I've been here for almost 6 years as it is with a company sponsoring me on a Tier 2 (General) visa. I'm looking to segue into another company but I do not want the clock on my indefinite leave to remain to reset.  The questions I have are:  * Can I hold a position at a board or director level for another company while simultaneously being on my Tier 2 visa? I was under the impression that it was a strict ""no second job"" situation, or can they run in tandem?  * Is there a visa option that would let me segue onto being solely a board member of company 2, letting me leave my current company, without my Visa resetting or the need for me to leave the country to file paperwork?  Thanks in advance"	Yes
So I recently was kicked out of my house in Ontario, and housing here is expensive and there aren't too many Computer Science jobs, which is why I wanted to move to the US. I hold US citizenship and a US passport. In Ontario, we do not have an emancipation process so I'm not sure if I'd be able to sign legal contracts here or in the United States. I'm sure I'd be able to get a CS job but signing a contract is slightly confusing.  Thanks, Ashar	Yes
"Hi! My question is related to visas/immigration stuff/employment. I am not a U.S. citizen and as an international student I completed a bachelors degree in education at an american college. I have a valid teaching license from a state. Currently I'm teaching at a private English-speaking school in South America and I'm thinking about wanting to return to the states and continue my teaching career there.  I'm not looking for some sort of teacher exchange/""cultural experience"" for myself... I am perfectly fluent in English and fully part of the culture (minus the rodeos; went to one and was terrified #peta). Ideally I'd like some sort of permanent resident situation but I'm not quite sure how to get there. All I've been seeing online is a lot of lists of forms but I have no clue what the actual process looks like.  I'm not sure if this is a common or uncommon thing, but if anyone has any advice please comment below!"	Yes
Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	Yes
"I'm on mobile at the moment so please excuse my formatting.   One of my uncle's ""friends"" is offering to pay him about 1,000 dollars to sponsor his new mail order bride from China. Obviously this is the biggest red flag you can imagine. However my uncle is really naive about this and is leaning towards accepting it because he needs the money. If the husband married the mail order bride shouldn't thag give her a green card? Why would they need a sponsor for it? I just want to get ahold of some information and facts about this issue to help me convince my uncle this is a very bad idea."	Yes
Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	Yes
Hey guys, first time posting so here goes...  Backstory: My family has permanent residency status for the US from Canada, and everybody minus my dad have moved here and lived here for at least 2 years. My dad had to stay back because of delays in my brother's approval process, and after it was finally approved, he still resides in Canada due to our property not selling. He has visited the US frequently, but never stayed longer than a month.  The current situation: Dad's mother was in a coma, and her condition is deteriorating, so he intends to visit her overseas, then visit us before going back to Canada. Before leaving Canada, he was stopped by immigration and they interviewed him because he has never remained in the US since green card was approved 3+ years ago, apparently not following the rules. They said they were notating the account, and though they cannot take away the green card, they could send him to court to appeal. He took the flight, but they said he is taking a risk, and the US airport might withold the card or prevent him from flying. His cousin (immigration attorney) said he could fill out a travel request application, but it could take 6 weeks.  He's in the NY airport currently, and likely will continue to fly overseas to visit his mother, but that may jeopardize the permanent residency process my parents have spent so many years and money working on. Is this a possibility, and what can we do to minimize the risk?  Any thoughts?  tldr; dad is flying overseas and may not be granted re-entry, or have green card revoked due to non-residency since being approved. What scenarios may play out?	Yes
I'm a Canadian citizen studying in the UK. I'd like to come back to Canada (and more specifically to Quebec -- I don't know if this makes a legal difference) in a few years (2-4) with my girlfriend, who is a British citizen. I'm under the impression that we could both benefit the legal advantages of being married (which I'd be happy to know more about; I'm thinking visa, scholarships, etc.), but we don't have the money or time to organise a wedding (my girlfriend's parents live in Australia).  Q: Can we get married now (in secret) and get married once more (not religiously) when we arrive in Canada?	Yes
