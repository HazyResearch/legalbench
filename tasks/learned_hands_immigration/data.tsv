Hey legal helpers, my brother-in-law just moved to the USA a week ago and is approved for his Green Card but we're still waiting for it to be sent along.  In any case, he got unexpected Misdemeanor citation when he was caught swimming at a county quarry by sheriffs in Iowa. Does anyone have any experience in guessing how this could affect his immigration status? His record is very clean excluding this one screw up.  Thank you much for any advice or ideas!	Yes
"I got my 2 years green card through marriage to Citizen, and it is expiring on August. I need to apply for the 10 years green card soon.  I will participate a diversion program, and my immigration lawyer is modifying the contract for immigration reason.  The lawyer said : “It means that you are not saying the facts are right UNLESS you break the agreement. Its lawyer terms, but in immigration it makes a HUGE difference” I attach the original and the modified diversion, and want to see if anyone can check it for me and I have a few questions regarding the diversion contract Original: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/m9cgzuw4t3pkp73/AACQ5aRktPbq5Ayn9DyIop-Xa?dl=0   Modified part: STIPULATION OF FACTS STIPULATION UPON VIOLATION OF FACTS: Defendant stipulates that he/she is the individual named in the complaint, and that the offense(s) charged occurred within the city limits of Lenexa, Kansas. The Defendant ONLY UPON VIOLATION OF THE DIVERSION AGREEMENT stipulate to the facts as they are contained in the complaint, police reports, written witness statements, and to any lab or other test results prepared or taken in connection with this case. Defendant acknowledges and agrees that if this Agreement is revoked, the matter will be set for trial based upon the original charge(s). Defendant further stipulates UPON VIOLATION OF THE DIVERSION AGREEMENT that the police reports, written witness statements, lab or other test results, and any other evidence, including this Agreement, shall be admitted into evidence without further foundation, and said trial will be conducted solely on the record based upon the stipulation UPON VIOLATION of facts as stated herein.   Questions 1.	Immigration Status – Would it impact my green card renewal or any future immigration status? 2.	Travelling to oversea(short term vacation) – Am I able to return to US while I am on one year diversion program? Do I need to do anything before travelling to oversea? 3.	employee background check? – Would this charges shows up on my employee background check? Can employer reject me after offering me a job and found this charges on the background check? Should I just go ahead and apply and wait until the diversion is over? Would it impact my chance for getting a job in the future, if they found out about the changes?"	Yes
I'm currently on a J1 Grad visa from Ireland and trying to figure out what other options I have for extending my stay other than the H1-B?   Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.	Yes
We were hoping to ask anyone with good knowledge on US immigration law on how we should proceed as a couple? I [20F] was born in the USA [MO] and have a passport, birth certificate and a SSN but moved when I was just a baby. I do not have family in the USA and don't have established residency in any state.   My partner [23M] was born in the UK and we now want to eventually move to the USA. However, I feel like I'm currently too young to get married and will probably be aiming to get married in 2-4 years.  I will be moving home to Hong Kong this year whilst he will be staying in the UK to finish the final year in his degree.    1) My partner wants to know how he can live and work in the USA legally without a marriage green card/visa. We are looking into him getting a masters in the USA as we know some masters courses allow their graduates to stay in the country to find work for the next 3 years but we know that chances of scholarships are slim.    2) I have read about how it is easier to get the marriage green card if he was already in the states at the time. Would him not being in the USA when applying for the green card/visa be a detriment?   3) Is it possible to get a marriage visa/green card if we got married outside of the USA and **both** parties are not present in the USA at the time of the application and will this affect his ability to enter the country?    4) My partner also wants to know if it's possible for him to eventually get a dual citizenship between UK/USA?   We have several other options ranging from him getting a masters in the USA, getting a masters in Hong Kong where grants and scholarships are much easier to get (and he can live with me), or him working in the UK for a few years whilst we get our act together. We are just very confused as to how the whole process of immigration works and the requirements for it.   TLDR - Boy and girl want to move to America to live the American dream. Girl is American by birth but doesn't live there and boy is from UK. How this work?	Yes
She asked for all original copies so she could bring them to wherever and have them copied. She said I wouldn't have to sign anything and it would be fine, because they just need proof that the person coming here knows a citizen from America.  This seemed really sketchy to me, 1 because I haven't known them THAT long... and 2 - she asked not to tell my mom (who keeps all of those documents for me) and lie to her and say that it was for work purposes.  My question is - is this as sketchy as I think it is? My mom told me it was definitely not OK to give those documents over and not to 'vouch' for anyone coming especially someone I don't know.  What are your thoughts?	Yes
This person is someone I know and Im curious on what likely is going to happen to him if he is found guilty? Is he going to serve time then get deported or just get deported? I took a [screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/kIbvlc8.jpg) of what he is being charged with. Last I heard is that he posted bail but is being held by ICE. Thanks! 	Yes
Hello guys. Im a dual diploma student. I was a student in the US, was going to sell my car but i couldnt(couldnt find a customer who didnt look like a weirdo from craigslist), so i gave a friend power of attorney to gift/sell my car. I allowed him to gift it because there was a family friend to arrive that year so he could take it if he wanted it. I forgot to turn the license plates over before i returned to my country.  Turns out the guy i gave power of attorney got pulled over driving it(which i in no way allowed him to do) after the insurance expired. The police took the license plates and towed the car. He took it back after paying some fine.   I immediately made him sell the car for really cheap as i didnt want it giving me any more trouble than it already did.  Now the question. Im still not done with my university in NY. When i return to the US, is there any chance i might not be allowed into the country? :(	Yes
My wife and I are applying for sponsorship. I am a Canadian citizen and she is not but would like to come live in Canada with me when I move back.   I am 27 and she is 24. She is a CNA and nursing student while I am a tenure-track professor. The issue is, that when she was 19 she was charged with shoplifting a shirt from the mall. She went to court, was given a misdemeanor, and had to pay a fine. Can I still sponsor her given the situation?   She has not reoffended since and does not have any other charges on her record.	Yes
I have filled majority of the questions; however, I am stuck on a few and unsure how to answer them. I hope I may get some help on them please.   *Brief information: Never arrested, never committed any heinous crimes.   My current status is overstay. (with ESTA which is expired already. )  17. Have you EVER violated the terms or conditions of you nonimmigrant status? 18. Are you presently or have you EVER been in removal, exclusion, rescission, or deportation proceedings? 19. Have you EVER been issued a final order of exclusion, deportation, or removal? 20. Have you EVER had a prior final order of exclusion deportation, or removal reinstated? 21.  Have you EVER held lawful permanent resident status which was later rescinded?  46.e. Engage in any other unlawful activity?  (Does continuing overstaying consider a yes?)  Since April 1, 1997, have you been unlawfully present in the United States:  72.a. For more than 180 days but less than a year, and then departed the United States? 72.b. For one year or more and then departed the United States? (I am staying here more than a year but haven’t departed United States after overstaying.)  Since April 1, 1997, have you EVER reentered or attempted to reenter the United States without being inspected and admitted or paroled after: 73.a. .  Having been unlawfully present in the United States for more than one year in the aggregate? (Like I said, I was overstaying more than one year. But I haven’t departed the United States.)  I haven’t done any crimes, just overstayed. That’s it. Do I still need to say yes to those questions? And is there any other question that I need to say yes for overstaying?	Yes
"I'm on mobile at the moment so please excuse my formatting.   One of my uncle's ""friends"" is offering to pay him about 1,000 dollars to sponsor his new mail order bride from China. Obviously this is the biggest red flag you can imagine. However my uncle is really naive about this and is leaning towards accepting it because he needs the money. If the husband married the mail order bride shouldn't thag give her a green card? Why would they need a sponsor for it? I just want to get ahold of some information and facts about this issue to help me convince my uncle this is a very bad idea."	Yes
Hey everyone. My boyfriend is in the process of hopefully getting a job in the USA. We have been dating for around 4 years and always said we'd get married if we relocated so we can be together. I am worried about a couple of things that might cause problems  - I am diagnosed with Anxiety, this in itself isn't the problem. I have went through a few diagnoses' to get to this one though but it's settled on that. I am considered in remission but a couple years ago I got into a fight with a girl over something stupid. I punched her in the face but the police weren't contacted. I did, however, talk to my therapist about it and worked through it with them. If this is on my medical records could it cause problems? (Btw just a note that me and the girl resolved it and were both kind of douchebags)  - This is the one I'm really worried about. My mother is currently awaiting conviction on a charge of possession with intent to supply multiple substances and one charge of conspiracy to convey drugs into a prison. I did not know about this or profit from it. Will this cause problems? If so, how do I prove myself and what are my options?  Thank you guys in advance, worried sick here.	Yes
After three years my finance and I are finally able to afford and have a home together in Canada. (I'm American) We are getting married in November. We initially met with the lawyer at the end of June. The consultation seemed to go well but I have serious concerns about his retainer.   The email he sent me took a week. Is this typical? Within the email there are serious grammar and spelling issues and the retainer has my name spelt wrong. It's also 3500$ CAD not including he actual processing fees. This is only payable by cash or money order. Is this normal?  The reason why we wanted to get a lawyer is because I was denied entry to the border in 2015 for insufficient evidence to return to the states. I was going to stay for two months, didn't say my exact day of return, was in my car with my fiancé, and had my dog with me. I have been to Canada at least 4 times since then with no issues.  I also was previously married and sponsored someone to become and American permanent resident. They have been a permanent resident since 2015.  We divorced in 2015. The lawyer said this shouldn't be an issue at all. Is this true?   Thank you for the help. I live in Colorado if you need that info as well.	Yes
Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	Yes
"Looking for information and the best route of action to take for UK Immigration.  I've been here for almost 6 years as it is with a company sponsoring me on a Tier 2 (General) visa. I'm looking to segue into another company but I do not want the clock on my indefinite leave to remain to reset.  The questions I have are:  * Can I hold a position at a board or director level for another company while simultaneously being on my Tier 2 visa? I was under the impression that it was a strict ""no second job"" situation, or can they run in tandem?  * Is there a visa option that would let me segue onto being solely a board member of company 2, letting me leave my current company, without my Visa resetting or the need for me to leave the country to file paperwork?  Thanks in advance"	Yes
I was asked from my insurance to show proof of my citizenship so I sent in my I-94A. A couple days later they said they needed the hard copy. When I told them I didn't know what that was, they explained it was a form that I should have received the same time I got the I-94A. I'm just curious as to what it looks like or what information it has on it because I have a lot documents to go through and I'm not sure which one it could be. And if I don't have it, how would I go on my way to obtaining it?	Yes
Hi,      Here's a quick overview of my problem :      I'm French, my girlfriend is American, we've been together for 2 years (she came to France for a year, and i went 2 times to the US for 3 months).      We want to get married and live together in the US, but i currently don't have any visa except for the ESTA 3-months tourist visa.      I came to the US 2 weeks ago with the intent to stay for 3 months, get married, and figure something out to stay here legally.      I ran into some trouble at the border with the officer telling me that i can't apply for any visa after getting married, as this would be illegal.      Fair enough, i explained i just wanted to get married, go back to france after the 3 months and come back again right after to do the visa, at which point he got angry and told me i couldn't even get married on US soil (which is total bullshit based on my researches)      We're not really sure what to do at this point.   Apparently getting married and acquiring a visa are not seen as a good thing, so maybe i should find a way to get a visa without getting married, and get married afterwards ?      From what i saw there's only 2 visa i could apply for : K-1 and CR1.      For now my gf makes enough money to support both of us, but eventually i'd like to work as well.   No rush though, for now we simply want to be together, even if i can't work.      Here's my plan for now : Get married, go back to France once my current 3-months visa is expired, apply for a long term tourist visa, go back to the US whenever the tourist visa is approved, apply for a K-1 visa once i'm in the US.   I'm worried i might run into trouble because of the marriage.      What do you think ? Any better idea ?	Yes
I'm an international student at a Dutch university. In the academic year 2016-2017 I was unable to obtain 30ECs and hence my Residence permit will most likley be revoked. However if I transfer to a different university in the Netherlands to start a new course from Sept 2017 will I be able to stay in the Netherlands? I couldn't contact IND so I'm asking here. I hope someone here knows about this. And the MoMi states that you have to gain 30ECs ie half of the Total 1st year credit points at the University where you're enrolled to continue your studies and stay in the Netherlands.	Yes
"Hello Everyone, I'm writing because my fiance, who lives in the UK, was attempting to visit for a couple of weeks using the ESTA Visa Waiver program. She had the waiver approved but when she went through US Customs in Ireland, they questions what the purpose of her visit was and why she had 3 bags with her. She told them she was going on vacation to see friends and had 3 bags because there were gifts and she had clothes for several weddings she was invited to. They ended up interrogating her for several hours, took her phone and went through every text, email, and even her Facebook posts. They told her that she was not going to visit friends but rather going to visit her fiance. She told them that she was going to visit both and intended to come back in 3 weeks due to her having a job and had a return ticket. After hours of interrogation, the officer told her he didn't care about the luggage or the fiance part but was denying her entry because she lied to 3 officers about who she was going to see. They accused her of trying to use the Visa Waiver as a means to bypass the fiance or spousal visa and said she intended to stay in the US, which obviously wasn't true. He stamped her passport with an ""Application for Admission Withdrawn"" stamp and said if she wanted to enter the US, she has to apply for a fiance visa (which we intended on applying for in the near future anyways. This prevents her from being able to visit me in the US and our concern was how this would affect her chances of getting approved for the fiance visa when we apply for it. Does this negatively impact her chances? What are our best steps moving forward with getting her to the US and is there any way to remove the negative remarks associated with her traveling to the US? Any help would be appreciated!"	Yes
"I don't know if this is the best thread to post in but it's the closest thing I have because I don't have anywhere else to look.    Hypothetically, one my of friends is an international student from an Asian country living here as a student. He has no green card but he does have a working permit. He had previous situations with his host family that made him homeless for a while. He found a new family (I'm not sure if they're his legal guardians, but they are on his school papers and in order to continue school, they are required)    Now this is when the situation gets fucky because recently the new family has been arguing about him and essentially lost the ""trust"" in him and now is forcing him to pay back his ""debts"". Debts which include food, water, room, air, etc. All of this is done while his life savings is held under pressure. They apparently have proof that he was living under their roof for free. Along with this they are forcing him to find a job (basically means he is not allowed in the house) He is afraid that he is going to be deported if he tries anything legal and I can see why. He has had many close encounters with being deported back whether it was due to financial issues or family issues. I want to help him (tried talking to my manager about getting him a job) but I don't know how to legally help so I'm going to this subreddit for help. If possible, I would like to know if I could potentially become his host family so I would be on his school papers instead of the other people.    If this is the wrong request in the wrong subreddit, I apologize and ask that you refer me to a subreddit in which people will know I want to do. Many thanks in advance."	Yes
So I got my name changed, got certified papers from court, etc. I am also a foreign born U.S. citizen and I got my certificate last year, and I changed my name this year, therefore the Certificate of Citizenship is in my old name (note I did not update with the SSA  that I am a now citizen because i wanted to wait for name change). Now I'm planning on going to the Social Security Admin to notify them about my name change AND citizenship status. Would the SSA accept the Certif of Citizen as a doc even though it's in my old name? If I'm applying for a passport, would they accept  the current Certif of Citizen? Or is it NECESSARy that I apply for a replacement Certif that has my new name before I do any of this? Thanks	Yes
So i have a friend that has some VISA problems and was hoping someone on here could give us some advice.  She lives in MA and her VISA is up in a month. She's been looking for a new job for a while now and now it looks like the awkward timeline between not being able to transfer the visa in time before it expires.  Any thoughts?	Yes
I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?  I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.  I asked this earlier, but it got no response and was buried.

My sister has asked me to post about this.   • She is 8 month pregnant and is about to give birth in Thailand.  • As the title has already stated, she is Thai (Bangkok), her husband is Chinese. (Yunnan province, Kunming city)  • My sister and her husband have only sign their marriage certificate in China; they didn't sign one in Thailand.  • She has asked a Thai lawyer who is her friend about this. The lawyer has said that in China, the child can only get the Chinese passport if both of the parents are Chinese. Therefore my sister's son will automatically only be qualified for Thai nationality. The lawyer, however, does not specialize in this field of legal matters.  • On a Thai platform, another Thai woman said that she has asked the China Embassy in Thailand and they said that if the birth certificate states that the child is Thai, they can only provide China's visa with annual renewal terms. However if the birth certificate states that the baby is 'not of Thai nationality', then the embassy can provide the child with the Chinese passport so the family can bring the child back to China to continue with the proceedings. When the woman went to ask at the district office, they said that since the mother is Thai, they can only state in the birth certificate that the child is Thai and cannot state that the child is 'not of Thai nationality'.  • My sister's in-laws have told her to not get the birth certificate at all and get all the proceedings done in China so the child gets the Chinese nationality. They are trying to force/convince my sister to make her son's nationality Chinese. They are using money and legal reasons to convince her but my sister doubts their knowledges dealing with legal matters as their have previously lie and made up stories to convince my sister of various things.  Questions: 1. Will my sister's son only qualify for Thai nationality?  2. If my sister is to have more children, will the terms be different if she is to give birth in China instead of Thailand?  3. Can my nephew, who is Thai, inherit his inheritance from his father who is Chinese? (My sister is worried that they may use this as reasons to force her to give birth in China and force her son to get the Chinese nationality.)	Yes
I know an illegal immigrant who has been her for over 16 years. This person is one of the nicest people I know and I would really like to help them out. They care for a grandchild who is a legal citizen. They don't have custody but the father (legal) has abandoned the child and the mother (illegal) was deported years ago.   Can anyone offer advice on how this person can become a legal citizen of the US, or anything else that could help them?  Thank you!	Yes
"I hope this is the right sub.   When I went through immigration, they pulled up my ""rap sheet"", and even though I've never been convicted of a felony, they can see where I have been arrested for one. My actual record is clean (I have two marijuana related misdemeanors), but they said they need ""court papers stating that you have been cleared of all felonies"" that showed up on my report. I tried contacting my lawyer and he said he needs to charge me for ""post conviction representation"" for it to clear up, but I feel like that's just bullshit. Is there anything I can do without having to spend money? I didn't think it would be so hard to get into Canada. Will I have this problem traveling to other countries? Any advice is greatly appreciated."	Yes
"I'm not sure if I should list the country I'm in. I'm Canadian but live in Asia.   A couple of years ago an admin woman who handled work permit stuff for a company that employed me screwed me over and I ended up overstaying in the country by four months. My travel visa expired but my work permit was still valid which created a big gap between the two. It's a long story, but she was a shady douchebag and ended up holding my passport hostage and extorted the company to get it fixed. We couldn't call the police because if her connections ran higher than mine I could have been deported on the spot. In the time that she was doing all of this I networked my way up to the right people and took care of her (legally) once things blew over.   So at the time my options were ""find a way to fix it"" or get blacklisted from the country for five+ years. I ended up paying her off to ""fix it"" since it was my only realistic option, and I could deal with her after. What I didn't know was that the additional four month waiting period was so that immigration officials from this country could strategically sneak my passport into two other countries (Hong Kong and Macau) to get stamped (backdated) and returned, which would line the dates back up with my work permit. When it was returned to me I was told to say that I was in those countries on holiday to explain the gap.   At the time, while I was pissed off about the whole situation, I was just glad to get out of it. I haven't really thought about it since. I haven't been back to Canada or the US in 6-7 years, however a family member is getting married next year and I will have to go to that, and since I'll be on that side of the pond I'll probably have to go to the US later for work. I'm just worried that when I go through immigration I might get flagged since everything is digital now. On every trip I've made since this incident, I've had to use the finger print scanners at the airport and obviously with the stamps in question, I wasn't there, so no finger prints would show up.   So my question is, is it likely that this will be a problem going through immigration in Canada or the US? Do they track stamps and finger prints thoroughly? I considered applying for a new passport but my old one was stolen and this replacement one doesn't expire for another two years. I'm assuming I can't just stroll in and get another one?   I truly apologize if none of this makes sense. I live in an insane country. I will be speaking to a lawyer about this soon but figured it couldn't hurt to ask here in the meantime."	Yes
Hello,  I have lived in the US for the past 25 years and have been a green card holder for the past 5. I live and work as an engineer in Atlanta, GA. Been working past 6 years at the same company.  3 Years ago I was arrested for misdemeanor possession and I entered a pre-trial diversion program to have the charges dropped upon completion of my probation. I completed my probation without any issues.  I've heard some horror stories of Green Card holders being denied re-entry after traveling abroad with a criminal record. I'm planning on going to China in a month. Should I be worried? Should I consult with an immigration lawyer or is that unnecessary?  Appreciate any help.	Yes
Hello!   I'm a foreign student in the US; I'm on a student visa (F-1) going to art school. I know I can't work/get paid here legally, but can I make a film (me as writer/director) if I don't get paid at all? I will gather producers and crew, and they will get paid with money we raise to make the film, but I won't. Is that legal? I plan on sending the film to festivals in the US and abroad, if that makes a difference.   I went to film school here a couple of years ago and made some short films then, but I don't know if it's different now because my major (fine arts) is different...    Thank you!	Yes
I'm currently a us citizen under 21 living with my mom. My dad lives in Iran and wants to come visit me for a few months. I was wondering what options and visa would be appropriate for him to apply for. 	Yes
as I dont fully understand the legal speak of the executive order, does the order impact a person who comes from Iranian parents [and therefore is technically an Iranian national via father], but doesn't actually hold an Iranian passport himself, has never been to Iran and is a Canadian citizen?	Yes
Hey there. Little bit of background, I was born in the Philippines and moved to America when I was about four years old. (I'm 19 now and attending college.) I've never gone back, done all my schooling here, practically no connection to my home country aside from knowing bits and pieces of language and culture, got perfect English, stayed in good moral standing, etc., etc.  However, I keep running into trouble with documents and such because of my visa (A-2). This is because both of my parents work for the UN as staff. (Nothing major, just paperwork and such.) DMV visits are hell. I don't have a social security number. As far as I know, A-2 visa holders don't have a path to citizenship outside of marriage (and I don't want to commit fraud...) or sponsorship from an employer (which, I am told, is incredibly difficult--unless I also shoot for the UN). I know that the wait list for Filipinos to get their green cards/citizenship is miles and miles long.  If possible, I would prefer to avoid going back to the Philippines, since I'd basically be an alien and I dislike Duterte anyhow. I'd happily renounce that citizenship for one here, and I can't imagine how many kids like me feel the same.  So, does anyone have any advice for becoming a legal permanent resident or citizen of the United States?	Yes
Hello Everyone!  So my girlfriend is currently a DACA recipient from Honduras and has been here in the United States for 13 years. She always talks about wishing her and her family the ability to become legal residents but she says the only way she can is either for her to marry a citizen  (were not in a rush to get married) or to wait for her sister who was born here to turn 21.   Is there another way? She went through k-12 here in the US and is going to start college soon. And she works as well.  Thank You!	Yes
He was a student for 7 years at a university in TN, graduated in May, but then wanted to stay in the US. He had to file for OPT work or a work visa in that TIME to do so, but due to having an arrest on his record (that's now been expunged but took forever to pay off), the paperwork took too long to go through. His student visa is now expired by a day, and the immigration person at the university was on vacation this past week, and unfortunately, that was the last week that my boyfriend had any shot of getting the paperwork finalized. He had a meeting with this immigration person today, and he said there is nothing he could do, literally nothing.   He was told that he has to go back to his home country of Trinidad no matter what. To get a work visa, he'd have to go back home for at least six months to get that paperwork situated there.   Now, my boyfriend and I are looking at a green card marriage, but we have been together 2.5 years and have talked about being married anyway. It's not totally crazy as we do love each other. I have all of my documents, he has his (despite his license being expired). We're meeting with an immigration lawyer Friday.   What I'm most nervous about is that I've been a nanny being paid under the table since March 2016.  I don't know if trying a green card marriage will hurt me by the IRS because I haven't worked the last 1.5 years according to them. And living long distance for at least six months would be awful, but being arrested or audited would obviously be the worst fucking case of this whole thing.   TL:DR; Will trying for a green card marriage as a US citizen hurt the fact that I haven't been working legally (according to the IRS)?	Yes
I'm a Canadian citizen studying in the UK. I'd like to come back to Canada (and more specifically to Quebec -- I don't know if this makes a legal difference) in a few years (2-4) with my girlfriend, who is a British citizen. I'm under the impression that we could both benefit the legal advantages of being married (which I'd be happy to know more about; I'm thinking visa, scholarships, etc.), but we don't have the money or time to organise a wedding (my girlfriend's parents live in Australia).  Q: Can we get married now (in secret) and get married once more (not religiously) when we arrive in Canada?	Yes
Hi! First of all I’m sorry for using a throwaway but it’s quite personal.  I’m a dual UK and Polish citizen currently on a business trip in Panama, which I entered using a permanent residence visa that’s in my British passport.   Due to a family emergency I need to return to Poland immediately. I booked a flight for Thursday and it’s via Frankfurt. But, on this rushed trip to Panama, after which I was supposed to go back home in London I didn’t pack any of my Polish documentation. No passport, no national ID card. Just my British passport and an EU(?) drivers license.  Now the problem is Poland has a US type requirement where as I’m a citizen, I’m required to present a Polish document. Therefore in theory, my British passport is invalid.  What are my options here? There’s no Polish embassy in Panama. I could in theory fly to DC/Chicago and go to an embassy there but that would require me to spend a bunch of money and take a gamble on whether I’m eTSA authorised. I could go to Canada where I’m pre-authorised to enter but that’s further away and more money. And then I could make my case with the immigration officer upon arrival in Poland, but I’m very scared of that. I will pass through Panama and Frankfurt immigration with my British passport.  What should I do? Even through I’ve been dealing with this visa/passport issues a lot by obtaining residencies in multiple countries, I’m lost in this case. I will probably be entering Poland (if nothing gets delayed and we meet in Frankfurt) with my fiancé who is a Polish citizen and has a Polish passport but is in no way officially related to me, that is unless we fly to Vegas tonight and get married...  Any suggestions are appreciated. Thanks	Yes
"Hello,  My wife and I live in the states. She is not from here and is currently applying for a green card. Today, as described by my wife, a man in a green uniform came to my door while I was at work. My wife answered, and he asked about someone named ""Mr. Jefferson Jr."" To which my wife said he doesn't live here. Then he asked something along the lines of ""what's the last name of the man that does live here"" and she then told him my last name. I regret that she did that, but she was nervous and I understand. Then this man left. She said he looked like a police officer but in a green uniform with a hat that matched the uniform. I'm not familiar with what agency he may be from, but I've mentioned that my wife is applying for a green card because it may be relevant. She said he knocked somewhat hastily as if she thought he was a delivery man and was in a rush.   My thoughts? He could have been trying to verify this is where we live, and used the false idea that he was looking for a ""Mr. Jefferson Jr."" As an excuse to ask about our last name. Or it could be a coincidence, but I want to be sure. I haven't done anything of question to warrant any kind of legal action to my knowledge. Please help.   Thank you"	Yes

Hey guys, first time posting so here goes...  Backstory: My family has permanent residency status for the US from Canada, and everybody minus my dad have moved here and lived here for at least 2 years. My dad had to stay back because of delays in my brother's approval process, and after it was finally approved, he still resides in Canada due to our property not selling. He has visited the US frequently, but never stayed longer than a month.  The current situation: Dad's mother was in a coma, and her condition is deteriorating, so he intends to visit her overseas, then visit us before going back to Canada. Before leaving Canada, he was stopped by immigration and they interviewed him because he has never remained in the US since green card was approved 3+ years ago, apparently not following the rules. They said they were notating the account, and though they cannot take away the green card, they could send him to court to appeal. He took the flight, but they said he is taking a risk, and the US airport might withold the card or prevent him from flying. His cousin (immigration attorney) said he could fill out a travel request application, but it could take 6 weeks.  He's in the NY airport currently, and likely will continue to fly overseas to visit his mother, but that may jeopardize the permanent residency process my parents have spent so many years and money working on. Is this a possibility, and what can we do to minimize the risk?  Any thoughts?  tldr; dad is flying overseas and may not be granted re-entry, or have green card revoked due to non-residency since being approved. What scenarios may play out?	Yes
Hello there, Im Bruce  22 years old dual national like my sister, I hope to see her in a highschool back in the mainland US this semester/year.

If anyone knows of a highschool that'll accept a third year student with exellant grades let me know :P	Yes
Here's my situation regarding my marriage..  I am American-Vietnamese, born here in the United States in the state of Georgia. My husband was an international student I met when I was 17. We started a relationship in which lead to our marriage when I was 18. I had our son when I was 19. We went through paper work to change his status and attempt to get his green card through marriage. I am not familiar with what the correct terms of the whole process. During the process I was pregnant with our son, so the initial interview happened to confirm if our marriage was real or not. We definitely passed really easy because of our baby. Since then he got temporary USA resident and temporary work permit (I think that's what it is), and the application for his actual green card applied for. We got lots of confirmation letters that the application had been received. We lived our lives as we waited. During this wait time our relationship went downhill. It was a very unhealthy relationship in which I needed to escape in order to recover myself and to do everything I could to provide for my son. He was arrested when I was 21 for domestic violence. It was an accident on his part but I was scared so I called the police. He had to pay a fine, take family violence classes, and was on parole for a few months. That was the end of our relationship.. the last straw. I immediately moved to Florida with my son to get away and start my life over. I left with nothing but our clothes. I've since then built a life for my son and I here. I am about to turn 23, he is 29, and throughout these two years I have let his dad see him many times. I am grateful for their father-son bond and do not ask much from his father. His dad asked me to continue helping him getting his green card because he does not want to be sent back to Vietnam. Out of fear that he would be sent back and my son would not have his father here in the states or him not being able to help with child support, I agreed. I am in a very healthy relationship right now with a man who loves my son and I for about six months now.  Now that I live in another state and in a relationship, I'm worried. He called to tell me that he got a letter asking for an interview next month. It's been almost two years since I left and this is the first letter. He asked me to fly in for this interview. Let me also add his family here in the states are the ones handling all the paper work and they are the ones going back and forth with the lawyer.. I pretty much have been doing what I was told since this whole process begin and I have no knowledge of what goes on.  All I know is I have to attend this interview and I am nervous. He was arrested and I moved out of state and am in a new relationship. I honestly want out, but I do not know where to start. I no longer care about getting his green card and don't really want any ties to him anymore besides our son. I want to get a divorce and move on with my life. Should I go to this interview and tell them our relationship didn't work out? And I don't want to do this anymore? And is there any chances I can get in trouble?	Yes
Hi all,  My mother in law was just at the casino playing slots when she hit a $1,200 jackpot. When they came to pay her out the manager told her he would only give her $800 because she did not have a good social security number (she is undocumented)  they then told her that if she made a big fuss about it they would ban her from the casino. Can anything be done here?	Yes
Hey everyone,   Here's the situation. My mother is recently widowed and I'm unable to get her down into the bay area where I live (she lives 3 hours away from me) so that I can stay with her and look after her. My niece suggested that she could look after my mom but I need to get her over here into CA first. My niece is from the Philippines and I don't know where to start. I'm unsure what Visa she needs, what hoops I need to jump through/she needs to jump through, etc. Any advice or starting point would be greatly appreciated. Thanks everyone! :D	Yes
My friend moved to Canada to be with this girl, and has been married to her for 2 years and 2 months. Now, she's saying she wants a divorce. Starting next week, he's going to be visiting friends and family for 3 weeks. Is leaving on a trip a bad idea for him right now? If not, are there any precautions he should take before he leaves? And can she do anything to have him deported now that they've been married for over 2 years?  The only assets they have is their condo, which is paid off. It's their registered marital home and is in both their names.	Yes
Okay, so I was born a dual citizen of Taiwan and the US. I live in the US, but has come back to Taiwan for the summer.   On the morning of the flight, I realized my US passport has expired for many days, and the lady at the checkout counter told me to use my Taiwanese passport at customs. (Usually, I used US passport at US customs and the Taiwanese passport at Taiwanese customs) I've renewed my US passport in Taiwan, but the issue is that I don't know whether to use my US or Taiwanese passport when I return to the US.   If I use my American passport, would TSA question me for not having a record for leaving the US? On the other hand, if I use my Taiwanese passport and apply for a visa, would the process be complicated by the fact that I already hold an American passport?  Thanks.	Yes
Currently my father has a green card, but my mom is undocumented. I was wondering if my active duty military status could grant my mom some sort of residency or protection from deportation.	Yes
My wife and I are on what you might call an informal separation. She's been staying in another US city for about a month now. She's a 10-year green card holder and she recently mentioned that she might try to find a summer job while she's there.  My question is, could she potentially get in trouble with Immigration if she does this without having filed for a change of address? I'd imagine she'd need to give a potential employer an address and that she'd provide where she's currently staying. I'm concerned about the idea of USCIS seeing that one day and her being penalized in some form or another.  She hasn't indicated that she's going to stay there permanently, so she of course still has her official address the same as mine, which is what's on her driver's license, green card, etc.  Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!  *Also posted this to r/immigration before I realized it'd get more traction here, sorry*	Yes

Hi all,  This information is all from my mom's memory and she told me as many details as she could recollect.   My mom is currently 56 years old (California current residence). She came from Guatemala in 1989 with my dad and oldest brother. They were caught by immigration. After paying a $500 fine per person they were let go with court dates etc. My mom actually was pregnant with me at the time. I was born and a couple of months later she went back to Guatemala to see her family. My dad (now deceased) attended all court dates but she did not because she was not in the country.   When she returned around '92-'95 she applied for a work permit and was granted one that lasted from 8-10 years. Around the time the permit was up she received a letter that informed her that she needed to apply for residency. She went to see a lawyer and due to fear told him she was in the country when she was required to appear in court but was unsure of what to do so she did not attend. (In reality she was in Guatemala and that's why she wasn't present but she has been too afraid to admit this fearing the consequences.)   She applied for residency in the mid-2000s and went through the process almost getting to end until she was informed that due to the 1989 deportation order it would not be granted. She was too scared to do anything else and that's where the situation is now.  My mom has been in the country now since returning from Guatemala for 25 consecutive years. I am 27 and a citizen that lived abroad for about a year after she had me. Currently she is married to an immigrant from Mexico. She has three children born in the United States including me aged 27, 25, and 17. She is still scared every day of being deported and asked me to please seek out any resources/advice I can regarding her particular situation to try and find options for her to become a legal resident.  I appreciate anyone and everyone's advice. Thank you so much.	Yes
I have a opportunity to work outside of my country for two years. Anyways I would still apply each year for DV lottery while I'm outside of Croatia. And if I happen to be chosen for the further selection, do I have to be in my home country or can I do an interview anywhere in the world through USCIS and just go to the nearest US embassy?	Yes
I need some help with my abusive family and have no idea where to start on my massive list of questions, problems and concerns.  A little about me: I'm 16 and live on a small farm in Alaska, I immigrated to the US with my mother when I was 6 and have been here ever since.  My mother re-married someone in the US but my legal and biological father is in Europe. And my moms husband has not adopted me legally. I get verbally abused everyday and physically at least once a week. I have no real bruises I can show to prove of the physical abuse as it mostly consists  of pinning me to the floor and choking me while yelling at me about how worthless I am.  They are very far-right so any physiatrists or any mental health checkups are out of the question as last time I asked I was grounded for a week.  Here is my list of questions and concerns.  1. All I have is a green card and I'm not legally adopted by my father so I don't know if I will be deported back to Ukraine to my bio father who I haven't spoken to in 10 years if I run away.   2. I've heard of some law regarding living in the US and at a certain age being automatically legible for citizenship.   3. They force me to work at a small gift shop they run for no pay and without a work permit, which I know is illegal as they are not present with me at the shop and I work up to 60hrs a week.  4. I have a medium size dog who is the only reason I'm still alive as I got him during a very suicidal period in my life. If I loose him I will most likely fall right back into that pit. So I will need some suggestions about keeping him with me.  5. They homeschool me so I have very few friends and no access to a school counselor of any kind.   6. I have not penny to my name.   The only thing that's been holding me back from going to the police is my lack of knowledge about the US immigration system and my precious dog.   Please advise me as to what I should do to get out of this nightmare. Thanks :)	Yes
I am a legal permanent resident(via employment) and in April, it will be 5 years so I can apply for naturalization this month. I think Naturalization is a straight forward process that I can do myself without an attorney.   I got married last year and my spouse has overstayed her tourist visa by a number of years and is out of status. I know I can apply for her green card once I am naturalized. I want to know when I should start the process for her: 1. When I file my N-400 2. Or during the oath taking ceremony 3. Or after I get citizenship  Also, what should I put in as the status of my spouse while filling up N-400?   As mentioned earlier, I was thinking of filling up the N-400 myself and only use the services of an attorney while filing my spouse's paper. Does that sound good or is it safer to use an attorney for the naturalization process as well?  Thanks :)	Yes
"I do not understand the legal logic in the following immigration situation in which I currently find myself in.  US Citizen with wife who is not US citizen, albeit married legally in USA over 5 years ago. We have 2 US citizen children, of very young age, currently living with wife in the foreign country. After being legally married in US, I moved to wife's country for a few years.  Wife wants to immigrate to US, so does husband (me), for the betterment of the child's education and livelihood. Husband then comes to USA to establish residence and attains a good job to prove an ability to provide for wife (as per regulations in the affidavit of support) .   Immigration services estimates 12 months before issuing a visa, while a Fiance visa will take 6 months (i.e. I go to foreign country, take a ""spouse"" and bring her back). All communications to the USCIS yield little in terms of additional information on the case. Also no way to expedite the case unless she is from an extreme situation, which she is not.   Can someone, please, explain the logic in this situation, or even better, tell me how I can see my family again."	Yes
Im in a really bad situation right now, i was caught at my school with possession of marijuana, and the court date is coming up. My family is stressed and they think they are going to be deported because we arent citizens. They think they will be arrested when we arrive at the court, and this was my first offense (im 14) please help, do i just get probation and community service or are we getting kicked out of usa	Yes
Some clarification and backstory: I am asking on behalf of a family friend who isn't technologically-savvy enough to know about reddit. He has a daughter who will soon graduate from college in the US, who does not know that he was once deported - and he wants to keep it that way if possible. Also, first post here, not sure about the rules, the whole nine yards - will edit accordingly if I've broken any posting rules.  Story: My family friend (Bob) was an illegal immigrant for about a decade or so, until the mid-90s. He went there on a tourist visa and illegally extended his stay. In the mid-90s, Bob returned to his home country to settle some family affairs, and was detained when he attempted to return. From what I understand, he was flagged by the system upon arrival at customs, and it also didn't help that he had less than $100 on him (apparently, it seems that it signals an intent to stay illegally). Bob's visa was revoked and he was sent home on the next flight.  When his daughter was starting college, Bob tried to apply for a tourist visa to visit with her, and help her settle in. But the American embassy still had his records, and denied him his tourist visa.  Now, Bob is in the process of changing citizenships to another country on America's Visa Waiver Program (legally; his wife and daughter are from said country and he has been living and working in since being deported). If he successfully changes his citizenship, would it be possible for him to legally visit the US again? Or are there any other possible (non-illegal) workarounds to allow him to visit? He no longer has any intention of being an illegal immigrant.  Thanks in advance for any advice!	Yes
I've looked at multiple options online, but they can be a little confusing. First option was to just go for 6 months, and wait another 6 months to come back? I think that's what it said at least. Second was to get a work visa, the requirements seemed to be only for prestigious jobs though like doctors, lawyers, athletes, etc. The last option I saw was to enroll in college/university, but I can't really afford that much for American tuition. Please help me find another solution to stay with my boyfriend that doesn't involve these.  tl;dr I want to stay with my boyfriend permanently in America as a Canadian citizen and I'm not educated on Visas.	Yes
My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	Yes
I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?   I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.	Yes
Hi, I have a female coworker from Iran going back to visit her father who is very ill. I'm concerned that she won't be able to come back to the USA due to Trump's travel ban but I'm not for sure. I've tried talking to her about it, but she is too distressed with her father to care (Her words). She has a husband from Iran who is an american citizen who has asked me for help.	Yes
My sister is a Canadian citizen who married a US citizen over a year ago.  They had a child about 7 months ago, born in Canada.  She tried to cross the border yesterday with the aforementioned family and she was denied, because they believed her to be emigrating to the states, which in a way she was, but she wasn't aware of how strict the process to emigrate was.  Her husband has a job in the states and he had to go, but she had to stay here.  As far as I know, being denied from the border already puts her on a list which makes it harder to enter.  She's been living long-distance from her husband for a very long time already, she was very excited to finally have the family together and after returning early this morning she has been crying on and off all day, I haven't really seen her this torn before.  Is there anything she can do at this point?      Any and all information would be extremely helpful.  Thank you ahead of time.	Yes
So I submitted my K1 visa petition back near end of May.  It went to California which shows 3.5 month processing time (should get word in September).  The next steps are confusing.  Some say you fill out support information and gather civil documents and pay a fee for consulate interview and should be a fast process.  When I look at NVC website, they are saying copies of documents mentioned above go to NVC for processing before the consulate interview and can take up to 11 weeks to process now!  What is the correct process and is it really 11 weeks to process at NVC before an interview can be arranged (which takes 3 weeks to get that set up)?  If anyone can help me understand the process and timeline, I would appreciate it!	Yes
I’ve been doing some research and learned that felons ( and those convicted of lower level crimes ) have been turned away at the Canadian border.  I’d like to visit Canada ( Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, etc. ) but I’d like to figure out process of gaining entry first before wasting my time and being turned away at the border.  As far as my criminal history is concerned, 16 year’s ago I was charged and convicted of withholding information ie. not snitching.  This was a federal charge.  I haven’t had any issues with obtaining employment.  I was able to get into college and get my degree as well.    I’m not much for making excuses and letting life hold me back.  That being said, I do like to be proactive and be prepared and that’s why I’m posting about this on this sub.  So, what can I do to be have a chance at being allowed entry into Canada as a visitor/tourist/sightseer?  Will I need legal representation?	Yes
My husband had a DUI in Pennsylvania in 2009. He went through ARD to have it removed from his record. Will this impact his ability to enter Canada through Alaska for a fishing trip?  Thanks! 	Yes
My husband has these friends. The husband is an American citizen by birth and the wife was born in the Philippines. We have known them for a couple of years now.   They sent an affidavit home with my husband the other day wanting him to fill it out. He said no problem until he sat down and read it.  It's wanting info that he wouldn't know on his own about their marriage. We haven't seen wedding photos or a marriage certificate or anything like that.  If they spoon fed him the answers that would be perjury I would think. Right? Bug no no? They are trying to make him feel like crap for not wanting to lie on this form.	Yes
So I recently was kicked out of my house in Ontario, and housing here is expensive and there aren't too many Computer Science jobs, which is why I wanted to move to the US. I hold US citizenship and a US passport. In Ontario, we do not have an emancipation process so I'm not sure if I'd be able to sign legal contracts here or in the United States. I'm sure I'd be able to get a CS job but signing a contract is slightly confusing.  Thanks, Ashar	Yes

Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	Yes
"Now that we have just applied for my wife’s 10-year green card I suspect she may file for divorce. The ~3 marriage has struggled, due largely to factors stemming from unemployment (at times *both* of us have been unemployed). Finally and thankfully, we both have good jobs now, though they are in different states (I am in CA, where we married, she is in NY) so it’s now a long-distance marriage. I love her but I think she has checked out and I have to agree that with our new jobs if there were ever a time for a ""fresh start,"" now is it. If she files, I anticipate a ""peaceful"" separation. There's no rancor between us and not much to divide up--no kids, few assets, just a few thousand $ in the bank. If she took everything in the bank it would just be an inconvenience, really.    However, if there is one thing I have learned from this sub it’s that relying on the goodwill of an ex-spouse is asking for a disaster, and I wonder if I should be on-guard for something? For instance, could she somehow come after my future wages? Also, during one particularly difficult stretch, my parents gave us some financial support, can she go after them somehow? I think it impossible she would ever attempt such a thing even if she had recourse, but really sad things are reported on this sub every day.    One last thing: If I've accepted the inevitability of divorce, why don't I just file for it myself and get it over with? One is that I do hope this marriage might rebound and her family is emphatically behind me. Another is that I want to put all my energy into my new job and don’t anticipate acquiring much in savings or significant assets this year, I personally would prefer to defer the divorce until it has to happen.    Thanks and blessings.    TL/DR. I feel divorce is inevitable. Can I just wait for it to happen or is it urgent that I pre-emotively lawyer-up?"	Yes

I applied for change of status (I-539) in late Dec 2016 to F1 visa with the Vermont Service Center, so I can continue to reside in US to finish my studies, since one can no longer be a dependent after they turn 21 hence why my H4 visa expired the day before my birthday.   My initial start date for my F1 visa was Jan 9th (beginning of Spring Semester), which was then deferred to June 5th (beginning of the summer semester) since F1 wasn't approved by the time registration period had ended for the spring semester. And my start date was again deferred to Aug 21st (beginning of Fall semester) because F1 still hadn't been approved by the time registration ended for the summer semester. This deferral process is necessary to prevent the automatic cancellation of my change of status application.   USCIS processing times for change of status is currently at the least 6 months but can take up to 9 months. I continued to attend school and patiently waited for USCIS to process my case and get back to me. I had been checking my status and the processing times periodically and was hoping to get an approval by mid or late July. Instead, on June 8th, USCIS sent a Request for Evidence (RFE). The RFE was issued because there is more than 30 days gab between the end of my non-immigrant status (H4) that I am switching from and the start date of my F1 - which at this time was June 5th, but was then moved to Aug 21st. The request had referred to guidances April 6th and on May 10th ""reaffirming that nonimmigrants seeking to change their status to F1, M1, or J1 maintain their nonimmigrant status up to 30 days before their program start date by filing additional Form(s) I-539 to extend their nonimmigrant status while their change of status is pending."" We looked up these guidances and found them to be specific to B1/B2 visas, and even then, as someone that has aged out of H4, I cannot file additional forms to extend that nonimmigrant status.   We worked with an attorney to respond to the RFE (the response was due by July 10th). USCIS can take up to 60 days to respond to the RFE, so I can expect a response by Sept 10th - which unfortunately happens to be after the beginning for the Fall semester and if the response is a denial, then I have to leave the country right away leading to me having to abandon my studies and having to try to return back for Spring semester. The argument made in the RFE response is that (1) when I filed the I-539 in Dec with a stare date in Jan, I was more than 30 days away from the expiration of my nonimmigrant status; (2) The school had to defer my start date to the start date of the next semester in compliance with SEVP guidances; and (3) I aged out of my H4 status and thus cannot apply for an extension; thus USCIS should grant my change of status should be approved. I also have a chronic ear condition that I am under care for and had a surgery in May for, and will need another surgery soon for cochlear implants. I need to be under periodic long term car for my ear condition. In addition to supporting documents from school, etc. regarding the response we also sent in my medical records.  The secondary advice provided by my attorney is that if my change of status application is not approved or even before they have a chance to reject my application that I travel to my home country (India) and go for a visa interview there to get my F1 approved and return back to US.   The problem I have with this suggestion is that I believe that it's going to complicate the scenario. As mentioned previously, I moved to US in 2010 and have not been back to India since. I have very little ties in India. Even my Indian passport has my US address on it because I had to renew it here in US and we didn't have enough proof to retain our Indian address on there. I do not have a bank account in India, or I might have a minor account under my mom. I have family in India, but don't have any contact with them because of family drama/ problems. I do not have a driver's license or any other sort of identification. One of the major requirements when applying for a nonimmigrant visa is to show strong ties to your home country, which I severely lack. This is the main reason why I am terrified to go with this option of going to India to go for a visa interview for F1. There are other time constraints as well, like for instance, I need to return back to US by Aug 21st or else I might not be allowed back at the border. Just scheduling visa interviews takes time, and I not sure if I am going to be able to get a slot to get everything done and return by the 21st even if the strong ties to home country issues is to slide by.   I need advice on next steps. What are the other options I have? What else should I consider? If it comes down to that I have to go to India to get my F1 approved, how can I show strong ties given the situation?"	Yes
Location Vic/ Australia  I received a caution/ drug diversion for possession/ being under the influence of LSD along with a caution for possession of a air rifle last year (I'm young and stupid, that's a cop out but that's the truth).   I'm currently trying to apply for a working visa for Canada and for jobs. They ask about previous convictions and cautions including driving offences. I understand it's in my best interest to be truthful but I also know it could ruin my chances to mention these offences.   What I want to know is will they show up on a background check for my visa? I was told by police they wouldn't show up on police records checks for work as they are only cautions but I don't know if the visa application is more in depth.   Tl;dr received cautions in aus, will they show up on visa application for Canada?	Yes
Parents died, I assumed legal guardianship of my teenage brother over a year ago who starts high school this year. Husband and I are about to accept job offers for the Netherlands. Guardianship does not have specific restrictions on anything like this and I am talking with US lawyer this week as well but wanted to post here too.   But any lawyer from Europe or US know requirements for moving with a minor who has no living parents to a country in the EU?   Thanks!	Yes
A summary. A friend of mine in Dubai has been applying for his student visa to study in an Italian University for a year now.  The details here are hazy because I'm paraphrasing what my friend has told me.  Just recently (10 days ago), he was requested by the consulate to submit his bank statements, a photocopy of his flight ticket and his certificate of acceptance. When he did, someone working at the embassy told him the documents were false and to never apply for the visa again. In a threatening manner, I might add. They stamped the rejection on his visa.  I asked my friend, and he's certain every document is valid. I'm writing this here because he'd dumb af and doesn't want to seek help.   Isn't this illegal? I don't know much but I'm pretty sure falsely accusing someone is criminal.   What can one do about it?	Yes

Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	Yes
Posting for a friend since she doesn't fully understand Reddit. My friend is from Mississippi and struggling with depression and a recent suicide attempt. In an attempt to help herself and get better, she made an agreement (not in writing) with her mother and stepfather that they would look after her child, while she moved temporarily to Alabama to live with her father while she's working.  Recently she drove back to Mississippi to visit her child but her mother wouldn't allow her to see her child. An incident occurred where the police were called and she was told they couldn't keep her from the child, and if she needed them to they could go get her child for her. She elected not to do this because she felt it would traumatic to the child. She went back to Alabama without seeing her child.  Today, her mother emailed her father [this](http://imgur.com/a/qfvW8) and told him to print out page 6, have her sign it and get it notarized and then faxed back to her mother. My friend was not given the rest of the document until she pressed for it. Now her mother is telling her to sign and notarize the document and if she tries to take the child from them, she'll never see him again. She has text messages of this.  So what should my friend do? I told her to cease communication with her mother until she gets a lawyer and have all correspondence be between the lawyers. But she says she can't afford a lawyer and her mother knows that. Apparently her mother has hired one of the best in the state or something. I've linked her to lawhelp.com. She has not signed the affidavit, and refuses to. But she is scared that her mother and stepfather are trying to take her child away from her. What legal recourse does she have? Please feel free to ask questions and I'll try to respond in a timely manner to clarify anything.	No
I haven't posted on reddit before so forgive me if I am in the wrong sub or not adhering to protocol.  My young son and daughter are currently in Japan with their grandparents and myself and my wife are currently in the US. My wife has hinted before that she might take the kids to Japan and never come back, but so far hasn't acted on it. However, she made the threat again during an argument last night and has demonstrated behavior today that suggests she plans to go through with it since the children are already in Japan.  We have not filed for divorce or separation and she isn't currently scheduled to fly to Japan for another week, but it's possible she might be changing her flight now. My understanding is that I will have little to no recourse to get access to my children once she decides to follow through on her threats and I'm wondering what my options are to either prepare for the long legal battles ahead or to try and stop this from happening in the first place.  I have sought local legal counsel, but haven't heard back from them yet. She is not a reasonable individual at the moment, but I am hoping to appeal to her for a more rational solution than taking this kind of drastic action. That said however, how can I prepare for the worst case scenario? Thank you for your time.	No
I moved into an apartment in Kalamazoo Michigan last June, and this month my job wanted to transfer me to a different city, so I began the process of finding someone to sublease. My landlord made me aware that there had been a fire here and that's why the last tenant left. What they didn't tell me was that the fire marshall had told them that they could not legally rent this apartment because it's too close to the fence next door. There are two large fences, a chain-link and a wooden one running right along the side of the apartment. According to the mire marshall, that can't be that way if they're going to have someone living here.   Right after I renewed my lease back in March, the company that owned the building sold it to an individual, who I assume still has no idea that they/he have been renting this apartment illegally.  Now that I know this, I don't think I can go any further trying to sublease, but I'm moving at the end of the month and need to be done with this place by then.  What are my options for dealing with this?	No
Hi. I am from Northern New Jersey. I am in need of some advice and was wondering if the helpful people of this subreddit can provide some. Throwaway being used for anonymity. A couple of days ago, I received a check from the Federal Trade Commission because they settled with DeVry in a 100 million dollar settlement. After doing hours of research and spending hours on the phone with government student loan help lines I am lost. I want to know a few things. Does cashing this check stop me from filing a lawsuit against DeVry? Also, I still owe around $60,000 in Student Loans, with this settlement anyone with Private Student loans are being refunded but people like me who took out Federal Student Loans are left to seek out other means of refund. One suggestion from the FTC was filing for the  Department of Education's Borrower Defense to Repayment program. Should I do this before seeing an attorney? I am afraid that if Betsy DeVos gets her way she will get rid of this program before it can help me out. Any advice? Please and thank you.	No
This was first posted under r/relationship_advice but it was suggested that I might want to post it here too.  My mother been a total Bitch to both me and her husband for over a year. This has got me worried that my stepfather who is the nicest person I know might say enough and leave.   My mom has mental issues and she doesn't always take her medication and that can make her paranoid and really grumpy. She has been really bad this month and when I asked her if she was taking her medication she told me she doesn't need me to tell her when to take her medication.  She has been very hostile towards her husband ( at supper last night he asked her to pass the salt she threw the salt container at him. She said she was sorry later but worried he is going to say enough and I will be stuck with her being even worse because I he helps keep her acting out sometimes.  I don't know what I can do. My stepfather is the best thing ever to come my way. He helps me with so much and treats me like his real daughter. He loves me. He doesn't just say it ( he says it lots ) he also shows me by his actions like never lying to me helping me with school and when I have a problem I know I can tell him and he won't freak out on me. He has family time once a week most of the time my mom doesn't even participate.  My mom never tells me she loves me and most of the time I am sure she would be happier if I wasn't there. This is not new for me. I have been dealing with my mom's shitty parenting all my life but I don't want her to chase away the best thing in my life. I know she should be that and I want her to be but she doesn't care about me half as much as my stepfather. He has been my daddy for 4 years now and I don't want to loose him.  TL;DR My mom is not talking her medication and she is making both me and my stepfather unhappy . I am afraid my stepfather will leave me with her.	No
"I am located in New York.  Long story short, about 9 years ago I ended up damaging someone's property (twice!) as a result of two farming equipment accidents. As a result of it, I agreed to pay them $15K to settle their civil cases against me. We signed and notarized the repayment agreement, in which I was supposed to pay a certain amount per month.  A variety of family problems were present and I really didn't have the money, so the person specifically put into the contract that they could grant me reprieves from the agreed upon payment schedule if necessary, but that they had the right to rescind those reprieves at any time for any reason and have me continue upon the normal payment schedule. Basically, if I didn't have money to pay them in August, they could say don't worry about it pay me in September or something like that. After signing the agreement, I had a variety of unforeseen things happen to me, and the person told me don't worry about paying it back right now. I basically never brought it up to them again, moved and hadn't heard about it since. About two months ago, I received a certified letter in the mail from an attorney stating that ""any abeyance in payment is hereby revoked"" and that payment would be expected the following month at the law firm's address, as well as a copy of the signed contract. Having consulted online resources, I determined that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and that the contract was well over its effective time and ignored the letter. I just got a second letter from him stating that I was now in default of the agreement and they were prepared to ""file an action"" against me in county court and that according to the agreement and that I was responsible for attorney's fees, etc. unless I immediately corrected the default. I still have not responded. Am I right that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and thus their agreement is worthless?"	No
"I'll try to keep this short. My boyfriend has been pressing for an open relationship for months. I told him no. Finally, two days ago he said that we were now in an open relationship.   I told him it doesn't work like that and that both of us had to agree.   He said he owed our boss a favor, and I was going to help pay it off. My boss, last night, told me to stay late and told me my boyfriend said I was ""fair game"". I told him I didn't consent to have sex, which of course didn't stop him. He made me shower when we were done.  He sent me home with my boyfriend, and I have been there since ... I don't know what to call it - the rape?   I want to leave, or press charges but my boyfriend won't let me do either.   Can I even press charges with no physical evidence?  Do I need his permission to break up with him?   My parents gave me to him when I was 17, like to date... Kinda like an eventual marriage.  We are now 19 but not married. I don't know if this affects anything.   TL;dr: my boyfriend told my boss to rape me and won't let me break up with him. Please help.   Dallas, Texas"	No
"Before I start, this is not about me.  I know a certain someone, let's call this person T, who just got married.. Let's call the person T is marrying ""SO"". Maybe like 3 days ago. NOBODY approves or know about this marriage, besides a handful of people. I found out that the ""SO"" cheated on T. There are a lot of other signs that screams NO to this marriage.   I'm wondering what are the consequences of T getting a divorce. What can T do so that there are a minimal amount of consequences for T? What are some advice for this fool?"	No
I have no idea where to begin looking for a labor attorney in San Diego, CA.   Do I look online in Yelp? How do I go about finding one?  The situation involves a company, specifically her direct supervisor, acting very unprofessional towards my girlfriend. On top of that they penalized her for the government arranging to go to a mandatory meeting for her green card.   She wanted to go to HR but other supervisors have stated it will compromise her career and discouraged it. In that case I think it's necessary for her to see an attorney before she goes to HR, or sees what the labor attorney has to say having heard the full details.	No

"I listed an item for sale on the app LetGo for $300. I received a full price offer and provided my PO Box for payment. Since then I've had several red flags.   * The buyer asked for my phone number for the check, and since we've been communicating via text. The buyer has used two different phone numbers.  * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment.   * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.  * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.  * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.  * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.  Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.  Aside from not cashing the check what is my legal obligation at this point?  I've googled the credit union in GA and am considering calling them tomorrow to alert them.  In addition should I take the check to the police? Right now all i have is the check, the LetGo user information, and the two phone numbers the scammer used."	No
Just a bit of backstory,  About 7 months ago my friend who was living with me lost his job, I said I'd pay a months rent for him to give him time to find a new job and he would pay me back over the next few months or if he moved out he would pay me back when he started a new job. Unfortunately he didnt get a job and moved out and I paid his rent for that month. Now he's had a new job for 4 months now and has been avoiding me like the plague and coming up with excuses each month, Im certain he has no intentions of paying me back now, can I still take him to a small claims court even know there was no written agreement, it was just a spoken one. I have saved texts showing him saying he'll pay me back.   Yes I'm an idiot for lending him the money.	No
So my dad is on a ton of medication for his blood pressure that causes extreme frequent urination. Yesterday morning when he was headed home he got the urge to go RIGHT then. Anyone that has been on diuretics will understand. We are in Oklahoma by the way.  He pulled over in to an enclave (in a fairly rural part of town). As he was leaning against the hood urinating into the woods, someone drove by. They turned around as he was getting in the car screaming at him. (The guy had his wife and child in the car). My dad drove off because that is obviously a scary situation to be in.  Later we find out that the guy is blasting all over social media that my dad had his pants around his ankles and was masturbating in public. He didn't name him by name but we have an EXTREMELY recognizable car. Think only one of them in the state. He has since taken down the posts but claims to have made a police report and such.  My dad is an absolute wreck. He believes he has ruined our families reputation, is going to be hauled off to prison because its his word against theirs and they have three witnesses.   We have been in contact with lawyers and they just told him to lay low and not worry about it. They said worse case the cops might come by and talk to him. Urinating in public isn't a sex crime here in Oklahoma either.  Is there anything else I can do, what should we reasonably expect? What can I tell my dad to calm him down?	No
I am not from Virginia but I was pulled over while moving from Philadelphia to Atlanta. The officer said I was clocked at going 93 in a 70 zone so it was automatically a reckless driving charge and I had to appear in court. I didn't realize at the time but apparently Virginia is the worst place to get pulled over for speeding. This is my first offense, Ive never even gotten a ticket before. So my question is how do I prepare for this? Do I need to hire a lawyer? I do not have a lot of money but law offices have been sending me letters saying they could represent me. I looked online and apparently you can do jail time for this and I'm pretty young and don't want this to ruin my life. I tried to do some research but it seemed like a lot of lawyers trying to scare people into hiring them and it worked a little on me. Pretty much I have no idea what to do please help!	No
I'm in California.  My city has a law that old people are allowed to have pets regardless of what it says in their lease.

I'm renting 2 bedrooms in my house and the tenants would be sharing the kitchen and living areas.	No
Im kind of in a bind and really need help with my forms. I live in Massachusetts but im filing for divorce in Rhode Island. The residency requirements there are that one spouse must have lived in the state for a year prior to filing, which my spouse has. However, the first line of the Complaint asks me to verify that ive lived in the state for that period. Do i leave it blank?   Also, we don't have children so do i need to file the forms regarding children with N/A or not file them at all.   My last question pertains to the financial form. I filled it out to the best of my knowledge but there is a part on the top for total liabilities but seeing as i didn't list any Im not sure whether to write N/A or leave it blank.   Im sorry to put this on you guys but im filing Monday and haven't been able to afford a lawyer so doing it myself has been tough. Any help would be awesome and Id be soo grateful.	No
In October 2016 I was let go from my job. When leaving, I asked about my 26 hours of unused PTO. They referred me to the company's HR department. This is a large company that does business in many states. It is a mail order pharmacy. When I called, they said that in Kansas they don't pay unused PTO. But I don't think that's accurate. I don't think that's accurate because when my girlfriend owned a business that went out of business, a former employee of hers sued her for unused vacation time. I'm just confused with the law is and what I should do. Your help is greatly appreciated!	No
I leased an apartment in 2014.  The rental agreement expired at 12:00pm 6/30/2015.  The way I got to keep living there was by signing an addendum to the original lease.  I've done this a couple of times by now.    The latest addendum says that the resident agrees to extend lease to 7/31/2017. It also says this addendum shall be incorporated into the original lease and it changes the price of rent.  The landlord says I have until noon to vacate. If the expiration date has been extended to a new date and the time is not specified do I have until midnight?     I don't think it's going to be a problem, but I want to have the cushion time if that is legally what I've agreed to.  I'm not trying to cause any problems, these guys are great but they have tried to do things in the past specifically against the lease and they stopped when I told them what the lease said.  Am I interpreting this correctly?  Obviously I don't want to do the walk through at midnight, but they want to charge me a late fee if I hand the keys over at 3:30 instead noon (3:30 being the next meeting time they have available for the walk through).  No, the unit isn't covered by rent control.	No
"Thanks for checking out the post.  Here's the story: My landlord lives outside of the country and I am only allowed to pay via chase quickpay basically.   Apparently there was an issue this month and I might have accidentally set the payment to be sent on the first of August instead of July.  I don't get a receipt or anything saying that she's received the quickpay so nothing was out of the ordinary.    Last night on the 26th the landlords son wrote me saying that he doesn't see payment on the bank statement so I owe an additional $1200 in late fees ""per the lease.""  Now, they could be cool and say ""ya we all over looked it.  Lets work something out."" Instead of just waiting until an arbitrary day when they just notice they didn't receive a couple thousand dollars.    My question is what sort of notice should be given or can a landlord just wait the entire month before letting you know that you're late?  I feel like they can intentionally wait just to penalize a tenant more.  I'm considering not paying because I do not believe this is ""reasonable,"" but I could be wrong.  I do not have a history of paying late.  Its a nice neighborhood and we're good tenants its just that to wait until the total is $1200 over half the price of rent seems ridiculous.   What are my options?"	No
Practically speaking, are there advantages to being legally married at the time of your child's birth? I always heard that it was but I'm now struggling to find information on exactly why that is. I'm in MA.	No
About a year ago, our townhouse complex implemented this Poo Prints DNA testing for dog poop so that they could test poop found on the premises and fine the owners for it. As responsible dog owners, we happily agreed and took our dog to the front office so they could get a DNA swab from his mouth.  Fast forward to today and I've just received a notice that we are getting a $100 fine from a sample collected June 12th. I am beyond BAFFLED by this because we are so diligent about picking up after him, especially after the Poo Prints program started! We picked up his poop beforehand anyway, but you can bet that the idea of a fine has kept us on our toes.  I would have been the one walking him given the day/time the sample was collected, and they even state WHERE it was collected, and I do not know how in my right mind I would have left a big pile of poop right behind the clubhouse where management is?!?!? I don't remember the walk exactly because we walk him 3x a day (it's a lot of poop to pick up, but we do it because we should and because we also don't want a fine!) I just can't BELIEVE that I would have left his poop there. Unless it was soft poop that was difficult to clean up or diarrhea, I have no idea (and I can't remember if he was having digestive issues a month ago). He is a large dog- maybe it was soft poop that I didn't grab all the way?  In any case, it's incredibly frustrating because we do what we're supposed to and WE are being punished. I see piles of dog crap laying around quite often and am always surprised.  Is there anything we can do to fight/contest this? We have no other pet violations. I've done some brief poking around on the internet and it seems to me like fecal matter isn't great for DNA testing but I'm just really not sure what to do.	No
I've been brushing up on Fair Housing and I'm not sure about this distinction.  I know the [protected classes](https://laborcommission.utah.gov/divisions/AntidiscriminationAndLabor/x_what_is_housing_discrimination.html) in my state and locality.  Say I have an open house for a few hours and when I'm done I have X online applications.  Am I required to select the first applicant who meets my requirements (income + credit score) or can I select the applicant with the largest income / credit score?  My belief is that since size of income is not a protected class, I am allowed to select (discriminate) based on this information.	No
"I’m moving for a job. My future employer has given me a set amount for relocation reimbursement, but I need to submit receipts. Per my contract, I will have to do a partial payback to my current employer (didn’t stay the specified time). Ideally it would be nice to use some of the moving stipend to pay off my current employer.   Here are my questions:  1.	Can I set up an LLC moving company and hire my own company to move me? And then submit the invoice? I would rent a moving truck and then use family/friends help. 2.	What is the legality of this? If I can’t set it up under my name, can a family member set it up for me?  If it’s legal:  1.	How difficult would this be to do? Could I use Legalzoom or something similar to set up the LLC? Would there be any other costs? 2.	How hard would this make taxes? 3.	Is it worth it?  Thanks for your help. Throwaway account for obvious reasons."	No
So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	No

No
"Long story short but I video taped my wife and I having sex and sent it to her via Facebook messengers secret conversation. The video was 15 seconds long and she now claims that she was not a willing participant in the taping. Felony charges have been filled but I haven't actually been charged or arrested yet. I should know more in the next day or so. Needless to say I have an appointment with a divorce attorney first thing tomorrow morning. What are the chances that I will be charged and convicted of this and what does my sentence look like? I have no proof that she was a willing participant and there are plenty of texts saying ""I'm sorry. I thought you knew"" so it looks really bad on me.   I'm sure to be a nervous wreck over the next couple of days. "	No
"http://i.imgur.com/tfYD2ih.jpg  This is the notice. Like I said, I don't smoke so it doesn't affect me, but I am curious I guess and probably because when this management company took over, they had pushed what ""reasonable notice"" is when dealing with other things that require entering our apartments that are non emergency."

Okay I was driving on the far left lane left lane from a 3 lane street. I see a driver in my rear view and side mirrors driving like a f***ing maniac so I keep my eye on him. Once he is done swerving in and out of traffic he now has a complete clear road in the lane he is in (the middle lane). I see him accelerating SUPER fast as we are approaching a red light and immediately I know he is about to cause an accident: either he is going to rear end the truck in front of him or he is going to try to overtake my car and swoop in front of me but theres no way that he could make it. I couldn’t get out of the way because this all happened in a matter of seconds. So I’m still in the left lane and he car is slowly passing mine and I see his car coming closer to mine and literally he just switches lanes as if I wasn’t there and pushed my car into the curb then swerved back out to the right after impact (there was nowhere to go as he was literally squishing my car against the curb). Now here is my issue: this accident is clearly his fault but he is telling his insurance that I swung out from behind him and got over when he was starting to merge. My issue with his statement is that either way it goes (even though my story is what TRULY happened) both stories indicate that I was 100% in the left lane as he was merging. Wouldn’t he be at fault either way? His insurance is saying it’s a dispute of facts but its really just two different versions story which ultimately have the same point: Driver failed to yield when merging. Am I misunderstanding something. I honked at him for a few seconds which I guess he didn’t hear. I drive a BMW (small car) and this guy drives a Ford F-150 which huge tires. I am almost positive he didn’t even see me at all.   Please help. 	No
12/01/2017: Applied for LLC with name &lt;X&gt; with the Arizona Commerce Commision  12/27/2017: LLC was approved as &lt;X&gt;  01/08/2018: Signed first contract work as &lt;My Own Name&gt;  01/16/2018: Received letter that LLC was approved  When I signed the contract I was not aware the LLC was approvied. Did I at that time do business as a Sole Proprietorship or as the LLC even though I did not specify?  I talked to my City and they said I should only apply for a LLC with the city not for a Sole Proprietorship because of the contract.  I'm trying to figure out if I should have the contract corrected to include the LLC or if I can just let everything go as is. Am I going to run into any complications come tax time? Opinions?	No
Note: Actually, I rent by the week, so I'll only have to give 7 days notice according to FL law. Also fyi, it's a verbal agreement only.  Is it a problem I've already given him 3 days notice failure to pay?  He didn't cough up the money.  But I'm ok with just giving him a new 7 days notice to leave if that will make it tougher for him to challenge the eviction.  I really want him out, gone, out of my life forever.  I don't want to go to court, or if I do, then don't want to have to prove he owes me money, etc.    But one concern I have is suppose he attempts to sue me for something related to the tenancy.  If that happens, will I still be able to counter-sue for the unpaid rent?  Or will me going the 7 day termination-of-lease notice hurt me in that regard?	No
I have an LLC which has never made any money. I wanted to make video games, and did, but nothing sold. There's like $300 in the bank account for said LLC.  I'm going through a divorce, and we'll put in that I own everything about that company, but obviously it's at most going to be a sentence, the lawyer is not IP specialist, and I don't want to use lawyer time on this.  I'd like to continue making games, but I don't really need to use the same LLC,I could open a new one. (There's no name recognition, nothing really of value except it's already there.)  If I keep using this LLC would my ex have an easier time claiming that she part owns it in the event I actually ever make money on it in the future?  Basically should I close it and open a new LLC, or since there wasn't anything in there at the time of divorce it won't matter anyway?	No
"So where do I begin? My partner and I lived in an apartment(in St. Louis, Missouri) for 3 years and moved out the first of this month.  There are plenty of details that may or may not be relevant, but I decided to just include the history of our stay there, in case it could be of use.   Timeline of events:  July 2014 - Signed a lease with first property management company. Simple and straightforward, was done almost entirely online. He tells me to take some pictures of damage and email it to him if I want some repairs. I take *some* pictures, but not in detail. I ask about repairs, but only get little fixes here and there. They clearly were not that invested in the property, but I was okay with it because the rent was cheap.  Fall 2015 - Water main broke, landlord(owner) has to pay for everything. We were without water for a week, but compensated.  Summer 2016 - Property management company lets me know the house is up for sale. He said this doesn't have to change anything for me. He said we can sign a lease as usual, and that is what we did. Same lease as before, just different dates. Business as usual. Soon enough we get a letter from a different property management company (with their address, phone number, etc). I want to repeat that I did not sign a lease with them, it was the first company, but I assume they just took over the lease. I looked up the company's reviews online, and they have terrible ratings. Awful. From this moment on, I've only conversed with one person at the office about repairs, I've had no other contact with any of the people from the company besides a repairman. They did not see the apartment or speak with me.   Early 2017 - We ask for window sill repairs(they had been rotting out for some time). This is something that we bugged the other property management company about, but nothing happened. A repairman did come over, but they did a pretty crappy patch job... This is when we were thinking it might be a good idea to move this summer.   Summer 2017- In the middle of June, we find out we're approved to move into the apartment we've been looking at. I was concerned about the require notice to vacate before this, so I looked it up online and could only find a 30 day requirement for month-to-month rentals and leases without a fixed end date. Our lease has a fixed end date. Nowhere on our lease does it state that the property management company needs to be notified that we are moving out. It is around a week before our lease was up that we emailed the property management company about our intention to leave, and information about how to get a hold of us.  Yesterday - We get an email back from the company, they seem confused. They say ""do you mean you are leaving at the end of this month?"" We email back and explain ""no we left at the end of last month, that is when our lease was up."" In response, they said they needed a 30 day notice, that it is state law. Now, I had zero knowledge of this. Nothing in the lease. Nothing I could find online said this is true. We haven't responded.  I included lots of info about repairs, and their lack of understanding of the property, because I think these guys are indeed very sketchy, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they try to withhold our deposit or even try to charge us for damages that were already there. These folks make me nervous.   I know this was long, thanks in advance!"	No
"I deposited a paycheck last Tuesday (6/4) and ~$300 was deposited and the remainder was pending. The next day I went to buy gas and was denied, I checked my account and I was in the negative. My bank statement said the deposit was on hold and details would be mailed to me physically. I called my bank and they told me the other bank would not verify the transaction even after several attempts. Then after pushing them further they stated that they had confidential information about my employer's account and couldn't tell me anything, but that there was a very high chance that the deposit would be returned unpaid. I called my employer and they informed me that my bank has my funds and that I need to ""tell them to release the funds from the hold"". That sounds like it wont work and I am not sure who is telling the truth. I really need the money, I was not able to pay my bills on time this month and only have ~$200 in my account. Any help is greatly appreciated."	No
I am writing a memoir and doing my best to prevent any sort of defamation of character accusations before I send a chapter of my book to an online publisher. The people I am writing about include the two multimillionaire business owners (one had since passed away, one is the head of a largely recognizable brand) and a person in academia involved in highly unethical practices.   I have already read about the legal topic and done things like change names, stick to facts, not opinions, and stay in my own point of view, not jump to what another person felt or was thinking.  I have emails and articles to backup that what I am saying is true. However, for my own peace of mind, I would like a lawyer to read my chapter and suggest to me if any edits need to be made to further protect myself.   I do not have a lot of money, (less than $1000 in the bank). Is this something that I might be able to get a pro bono consultation for? Where would be the best place to look for a lawyer that would review my chapter? Does it make a difference if I look for someone who specializes in whistleblower law, literary/creative arts law, or first amendment law?  I am 60 minutes from Chicago, if it makes a difference. Thank you in advance for your help.	No
"My ex husband and I have 50/50 time sharing. In our divorce decree it states ""mother's address is to be used for school designation"". Due to my last move, she was to be zoned for one of the worst schools in the state. My ex husband was also zoned for a failing school. I talked to him in May about what we should do. I asked if his connection (a pb county sheriff) could get us a variance, he said no. I asked if she could attend his school (he's a teacher). He said it wasn't a good school. I attempted to sign up for school choice, but there were no good schools available. He resigned to send her to the bad school and basically let me know I was on my own in figuring anything further out. I wasn't okay with this and told him I was thinking about moving to a better school zone. I recently got a job offer 20 miles away making nearly twice what I was making before and four times what I made at the time of our divorce. That city is also where all the A-rated schools are (and where my daughter was born). After losing the offer on two homes to rent, I secured a home in the new area, zoned for one of the best schools in the state. In my decree it states I should notify him of the new address 30 days in advance, but that I don't need to do anything through the court if it's under 50 miles. Unfortunately, as much as I tried I was only just able to secure a place as of yesterday. I notified him immediately. My lease here ends in sept., with school starting next week. I actually paid extra to start the lease august 15th so she could start school, but I have my current place until September. Today he called me, saying I was in contempt of court for violating the decree because I made a major decision without him (what school she was attending). Since it says in my decree that my address is to be used for school designation, I thought if I moved it means it automatically is my school zone. I've offered to eat the cost of pre-care and even to pick her up on his mornings to take her to school in order to compromise and resolve this, so long as he picks her up after school, but he won't budge. I should mention that when we divorced he was living 30 miles from the marital home. He took her to a school 30 miles away without complaint. This school is much closer. He's only moved closer to me in the last two years. I want to know if he has legal standing and if I need a lawyer. Thanks in advance."	No
I help run the treasury of a small club in Michigan. Someone is sending fraudulent emails, claiming to be the club president, and using the presidents name and current vacation location. I've already talked to the president, and we need to get this taken care of. Who exactly do we call about this? Aside from ignoring it, what can we do? They appear to be using our clubs own email.	No
"Good afternoon! I desperately need some advice. I purchased my own home a few months ago and rented out a bedroom to a couple that seemed to have fallen on hard times and decided to help them out a bit.  They have always been late on payments, causing extra drama and then not paying me $100 in rent due to said ""drama"" that they caused.  Now they're saying they found weed in the bathroom and will not be paying rent for 30 days and that I can't evict them before that.   I don't even smoke weed, the picture they sent me was like a microscopic piece of weed and my agreement with them is on a week to week lease.  Can I not just end the lease starting today and they would only have one week to move out? Please advise and thank you in advance! This Is in Houston, TX if that helps."	No
"I am an Amazon Seller.  I sell various products, and I work hard to position them as high in the search results as possible.  I've been working on some products for months or years, and they slowly gain position in the search pages leading to more sales - but it takes time.  Lots of time.  Recently a competitor started selling a similar product.  (When I say ""similar"" I really mean ""exactly the same"", but with their label on it.  Which is fine, that happens all the time.)  The problem is that this seller generated dozens of completely fake five star reviews, getting his product in the top 10 search results within a week. That's right.  On exceptionally high-volume search results, he got to the top 10 in a week.   The reviews are obviously fake.  The people leaving the reviews have never reviewed any other product except for this guys.  They all left over-the-top, gushing reviews about how the freaking product ""changed their life.""  Each left pictures and videos.  Me and a friend traced back all of the accounts, and believe we mapped out a pretty decent network of sellers that work together creating fake accounts and leaving fake reviews.  The evidence is strong.  So we reported them to Amazon.  Two months ago.  Nothing has happened. Our sales have suffered.  This practice is in direct violation of Amazons terms, but they don't seem to have any interest in enforcing their own rules.  I've read that Amazon is going to bring a lawsuit against these types of buyers/sellers, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Is there any sort of legal action we legal sellers can take against the illegal sellers?  I believe that leaving fake reviews is in violation of some federal laws, is that correct?  Can we report them to a federal agency?  Can I have a lawyer write up some scary-sounding/threatening letter?  What are my options?  I am in the US.  Thanks you."	No
"Il  I was stupid and lucky. I parked somewhere with free parking for an event at a con. Only rule I could see was ""No overnight parking"". I get back to my car around 1am to someone calling  in my car to be towed. He said that once the mall closes you can't be parked there and it's a big fine. Luckily he let me go.   Now, this is just for curiosity sake, but he put a big sticker on my car window. On the driver's side back one. It isn't coming off easy, it's ripping like a sticker does and is leaving behind sticky shit. It's irritating. Is it legal for someone to vandalize my car like that?"	No
I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday.   So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably.   She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony.   Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers.   That sparked a heated argument.   Long story short;   *Sshe got in the car with her kids  * I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers   * She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety  * I stand in front of the car as I call the police  * She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way  * I jumped on the hood  * She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably   * She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me  * Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures    .................  This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed.   Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?  What charges can I have against her?  I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.	No
"After a traumatizing roommate experience, and a long search for affordable housing, I signed a lease of one year on a lockout type apartment underneath someone's vacation home. (I'm on the coast of North Carolina). They are a conservative, religious elderly couple who go to bed at 8 pm. I knew from the start we would have some personality clashes, and I only took the place because I was desperate and I was under the impression they would not be there full time.    They were hesitant to rent to me because I'm a bartender; I work long hours and come home late. Additionally, I am severely mentally ill and I have a cat, who is an emotional support animal which I have the necessary documents for, signed by my psychiatrist. I am well aware that private renters don't have to accommodate non-life saving assistance animals, and I signed the lease just so happy someone would rent to me. They added to the lease that they could kick me out at any time with 30 days notice if they decided my cat was ""a nuisance"". This, coupled with the fact that the man had the audacity to ask me WHY I have PTSD, were red flags, but for lack of other options, I signed anyway.   Well this past week, I've been dealing with the death of a friend and co-worker who was shot and killed last Saturday. Cleaning has been on the back burner, and I've had trouble keeping a clean living space my whole life anyway, as a result of my depression. I know it's not a good excuse but it is what it is. This is not to say I live in filth; my clothes are all over the floor and sometimes there's a few empty pizza boxes lying around, but the litter box is scooped twice a week and dumped/replaced every 2 weeks.   Well, literally as I'm walking up to my door coming home from the funeral, my landlord informs me that it's not working out, claiming that he can smell the litter box from upstairs. Funny, since I dumped and changed out the litter that morning. Furthermore, if it had been an issue, I would think most reasonable adults would want to have a conversation before evicting someone with very few options from their home. I asked if the deposit I paid upon moving in, equal to the amount of my rent, would cover the 30 days. He said no, reread the lease, it's a security deposit and not the last months rent. Well since he waited until the 27th of the month to inform me that I needed to move out, and I obviously can't afford to pay for another month if I have to find a new place, I have 3 days to get out. That's not really a problem, I can stay with my boyfriend and I don't want to live under these people anymore anyway. Additionally, I went back last night to retrieve my birth control pills I had forgotten there before I moved my things out today. When I first left the apartment I know for a FACT I locked the doorknob and not the deadbolt. When I returned to get the medication, the deadbolt was locked. Indicating that my landlord had been in without permission or notification and I have no way of knowing he didn't dig through my stuff. I'm very upset about this, and how poorly he has handled all of it. I understand completely that the whole house is his property, but how is it legal that he entered my apartment, which is still leased to me until the 31st, without at least notifying me?  Most of all, I'm concerned about getting my deposit back. In my lease, it is stated that the deposit is to be returned to me minus any costs for damages. The only damage to the entire place is one small lipstick stain on the bathroom wall, maybe half the size of a dime. I've removed my things, cleaned top to bottom, and everything looks as it did when I signed the lease. There is absolutely no way he should get to keep my entire $500 deposit over a tiny lipstick stain. If he tries to do this, is there anything I can do? They aren't customers at my restaurant, we have no mutual friends, and I have no personal ties to them whatsoever. I have no qualms about taking him to court if that's what it comes to. Even if I don't get the whole deposit back because of the stain. He has no reason not to give me at least part of it and I'm not sure what to do."	No
A neighbor hired a contractor to come in my land and remove ivy plants that had been growing up my trees for decades. I've spoken to four arborists, and all say they don't value trees or plants, and that I have to ask the insurance company for a valuation. For obvious reasons, I'd rather have my own number going into this.	No
I have an apartment in south west Wisconsin. I've lived here for 5 years and been a very responsible tenant. I have two other roommates.   So our faucet would leak when used, but it was a small drip and we didn't notice it for a long time. The result of the leak was mold in the cabinet space below. That section will need to be replaced. I reported the leak and concern for mold. They fixed the leak and sprayed the mold with an assurance that it was taken care of, but the cabinets have not been replaced.   I'm about to move out next month and I'm concerned that they have put off the replacement until after we move out and charged me for the damages and I don't have renters insurance.   Is there anything I can do to get some assurance that I won't be effected by these damages?	No
My mother is terminal and has drafted up a will leaving me all of her money and future money she hopes to receive from a malpractice lawsuit.  However she has a husband who has been a piece of shit in a lot of ways.  She cannot divorce him because she needs him as a caretaker for the rest of her time, but she doens't plan on leaving him any money.   However, I've been informed that he is by law entitled to a third of her estate regardless of what her will says. I looked it up and it seems to be the case.  Is this true or is it more complicated than that?	No
Earlier this week, I opened my front door to let my dog out into our fenced in yard, and the mailman was standing on the front porch with a package.  As you might expect, my dog (50 lb 10 year old mutt) was startled and started barking, and before I could react we were both pepper sprayed, the dog lunged, and the mailman fell down the front steps trying to run away.  The dog didn't bite him, but he did skin his knees and was limping when he left.  It was a substitute mailman, my normal mailman leaves packages outside the fence, but had apparently not bothered to tell the substitute that my yard has a dog.  My dog has never bitten anyone, so bite history isn't an issue.  How much risk am I at for being sued, and is there anything I can to do to prevent this from becoming a problem?	No
"I received a notice on my door yesterday, ostensibly from my landlord but with the logo of the new cable provider, stating that within a little more than a week, this new provider would become the ""exclusive provider"" for my complex and my old provider would be disconnected. I pay for cable (only internet) directly, the connection is in my name and not the landlord's. When I moved in a few months ago, the apartment already had the proper hookups for my current provider and I didn't need to have anybody come out for installation.  I've read plenty about the FCC's prohibition on exclusive contracts, but there seems to be an awful lot of loopholes. I called them and really didn't get much help. Regardless of the exclusivity question, is my landlord permitted to disconnect a cable connection that I pay for? If they do so, would I be able to ask my current provider to reconnect me, and forward any charges to the landlord? What I presume is the cable junction box is outside the building, so my current provider would not need to enter any part of the building to reach it."	No
Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	No

My dad is a business owner in DTLA. He was an incredibly hard-working immigrant who started out as a cab driver. He worked hard to build his business from nothing. For me, he truly embodies the American dream. However, his business is falling on hard times and he decided to downsize his store because he's been having trouble paying the expensive rent. Now, English obviously isn't his first language and he needs a lot of work. My dad usually keeps his business life separate and mostly unknown to me, but he came to me for help yesterday because he's struggling so much to pay not only his business rent but also his apartment rent. TL;DR Here is the dilemma: my dad paid a $20,000 deposit and now the landlord is refusing it to give it back but actually requesting $5000 more. I've attached all the ridiculous things he is charging. http://imgur.com/a/dvjBe The landlord is saying that my dad only gave them a three-day notice to quit, which is why he is charging the insane recommission fee. But it is completely false! They had a verbal agreement that my dad can move out, then asked to confirm via letter. So my dad sent the letter. The landlord told them they needed to move out by the 15th because new tenants were going to move in by the 17th. Also why the re-commission fee doesn't make any sense... The landlord never sent a confirmation letter back, but my dad moved out nonetheless because he said he didn't want to cause any more trouble with new tenants moving in and wanted his stuff out of there to keep his word. Now I understand it's difficult since we don't have a solid written confirmation from the landlord. But also, the landlord added all the fees such as sprinkler tests and toilet fee, which my dad all paid for out of pocket and has receipts for. He docked it from the rent since the landlord never paid them back. He also wrote on the deposit fee that he's fixed things like the AC, but he never ever has. How do we go about this? My dad's lawyer said he can try in the small claims court but he only has a 10% chance of winning. My dad only told me so I can write a letter BEGGING the landlord to understand that my dad is literally so broke right now and he's only conning a man who has fallen on hard times. I got so angry and heartbroken when my dad came to me for help. I'm only 19 and I know I was his last choice. Please reddit, advice would be much much appreciated!	No
This is Washington State, US.   I applied to work for a company called [Fun Flicks](http://funflicks.com/). It was a strange process to get this job. The interview was conducted outside and was really casual. It seemed too easy to get the job. It was an unusually small amount of time from application to being on board. Almost all of our communication has been via text, and I have not been shown the building they operate out of. I gave them my application with some sensitive information on it, that's all I am worried about. None of the information seemed out of the ordinary for a job application, but it is still concerning. They said I was 'on board' in May, and nothing happened after that besides some texting about the position. The last time we talked was a month ago. It all seems very odd. I can't even find one in Washington on Google maps. Either they are sort of unprofessional, or something sinister is afoot. What can I do to check the legitimacy of this company/job offer? Is there even a scam like this? Thanks	No
A roommate has moved into my property without a lease agreement signed(His BF signed the lease, but he has not).    Do I need to give a 3 day notice to vacate?  Can I just give him a notice of eviction?  How can I ban him from coming to the property if need be?	No
Hey everyone and thanks for any advice in advance. I have already contacted two lawyers that specialize in this kind of thing. I am waiting to hear back.   So last sunday my now ex went back to the hospital to be admitted for the 5th time because of her refusal to stay in treatment for her bi-polar and psychosis.(im using that as a catch all because eash time she goes in they call it something different. Schizophrenia, schizophreniform and a number of other things)   I am just tired of it. We have put alot of effort into this and she drops out of treatment every time. This is the first time she has gone twice in one year. Just last month was the other time.  I really don't want her having full physical custody of the children because i dont feel like she will stay in treatment again anyways. Besides some of the stuff ahe tells them when she is having an episode i dont think she has the means by herself.   I have supported her for years, someone always has. The support she wouldb get from me would no where near enough to raise two children in a decent setting.  The other complication is we are moving out this week and she wont be welcome. I wont be staying in this house anymore and neither will the children. I told her i would give her a key to getv her things but the electric and water will be off on the 26th. So there is no point in her staying here. The only place she could go is her dads and he has begged me not to pawn her off on him. .  As far as the boys go.. I offered to do an unnoficial agreement where they live with me and she can come get them whenever she wants. But i dont know how well that will work. Or if it is even legal.  With the info i provided do i have a chance? This is scary because i have heard so many stories of how men get screwed on this stuff.   Isv there anything i can do to prepare?	No
Location: Tippecanoe County, Indiana (West Lafayette, zip code 47906)  Hello fellow Redditers,  I am having an issue with a girl I subleased my apartment to. It is an unofficial sublease and management does not know about it. There is a clause in the lease stating unofficial subleases are not allowed.  Basically what is happening is my tenant is 2 weeks late on rent and is avoiding any questions about it. I paid rent to my landlord, but have not been reimbursed for it. She is also ignoring my calls and texts, or says she is at work and cannot take my calls. She also lacks the common courtesy to return my calls once she gets off work. I have no idea what to do in this situation.    Additionally, the lease ends on August 2nd 2017 and if she is not moved out and has the keys turned in to the management, there is a $250 a day holdover charge. What options do I have to fix this situation?   There are agreements that have been made over text that I have a record of. However, I need advice on how to handle this predicament currently, and possibly legally in the future.  Thank you for your advice!	No
So, my friend and I were driving pretty late last night. We had a long car ride, so he brought pot with him, and I shrugged it off. We hit a highway that had quite a few cars pulled over, so I was obeying all speed laws. Approaching a steady green light, I was riding my brakes a bit in the event it turned yellow before I got there (as to not get pulled over for running a red light). Turns out, one of my brake light was out. He had the grinder in my passenger side door pocket, which the officer then saw when I was giving my license and registration.   My car was then searched, and to my horror, I had my overnight bag tossed in my trunk which I meant to take out of my car before I left, but was in such a rush to leave and forgot to take it out. (I live walking distance from where I stayed the night before, I was being lazy and instead of walking three flights up to my apartment, I tossed it in my trunk to go walk and do other errands--- I never intended to drive). The cop read me my rights and asked me if that stuff was mine. I told him yes out of nervousness.   I'm 22 years old. About to graduate college (early for my program). I do community service regularly already. I'm planning on applying to graduate programs this fall for a PhD. I've had zero encounters with the law prior.   What do I do from here? The cops told me I could hire a lawyer or speak to the prosecutor myself on my first appearance. I was planning on applying for jobs as well this March, which I will all be background checked for. How is this going to affect background checks? Grad school applications? My life in general? How much are lawyer fees going to cost (on average) if I go that route? I have ~10 days until my first appearance.   Thanks in advance.	No
"Someone I know is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening. Most curious as to the answer to #3 as I could possibly urge her to do this."	No
My roommates and I leased a place for a year, we since moved out after making sure its clean except a broken window. We even moved out early so that the new tenants can move in ASAP. Its been over a month and we still haven't received our deposits back, we tried calling and emailing, we received an email about a month and a half ago saying that he'll send it mid june, its august now. That was the last we heard from him. We're still attempting to contact him, and no response yet. What should we do?   NOTE: landlord has a rep of not returning deposits and taking a LONG time to response for money related issues.	No
Location: Ohio  So I'm buying a mobile home off of my parents. The title is in my father's name. We(Wife and I) gave a check to my him in her name for the payoff and he paid it(with her check). He got the title yesterday and today my mother told me how much the conveyance fee was and I told her it was perectly good(it was like 40 bucks). They went to the auditors office today and my mother decided it would be a bright idea to have my dad sign it over as a gift to avoid the conveyance fee and a transfer fee. We just got to the title office and saw where they put that we paid 0, and there's warnings all over the title saying that lying is a felony.  So I got ahold of mother (even though it's all in my dad's name, he just listens to everything she says) and she basically just said just played it off like it's totally acceptable and people do it all the time. Obviously we are not going into the title office and partaking in a felony. So my question is, can I have this sorted out through the auditors office or is this a really bad situation? I fear my father will get introuble for this and the whole transaction is going to fall apart. Thank you for any advice.	No
So, my half sister (same mom) has been staying with her half-sister (same dad) since their dad passed 4 yrs ago. They told her today that the money she gets isn't here, and they've been spending it. She was ordered into their custody by the state, she's 16 now and wants to move out and figure out how she can take action against them to get her money (or at least some of it) back.	No
Looking for legal advice on the below situation. My neighbor had a tree (about 50 ft tall) in their property that was adjacent to my garden and separated by a fence. Today they hired a landscape who cut all the branches of the tree while i was at work. A large number of the branches fell into my garden, destroying a good part of my garden and leaving a large amount of debris in my garden.  What recourse do i have available?  Am i entitled to compensation? Who would be responsible for this, my neighbor or the landscaper?  Thanks.	No
I had a monthly parking service with Impark and I no longer needed to use their parking lot after April. I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.   I didn't deal with it right away because I had to go on vacation 1.5 months. Now that I'm back, I see that they have added on even more additional charges. On top of the $93.25, they also added on $50 (rejected payment charge) + $30 (late admin fee)+ $1.5 (tax) for the months of June and July. Now they say that I owe them $174.75 or my debt will be collected by a collection agency and will affect my credit.    I find it absurd that I have to pay $174.75 when I haven't parked in their parking lot since I cancelled at the end of April. Is there any way I can dispute this or will I have to pay them the money?	No
Hey guys, so, currently I am in MA as a j1 student. And upon my arrival my landlord took 500$ from me. Now, 250 were for rent, and the rest were a security deposit. Now, he didn't give me a contract, and he didn't give me a receipt. I payed that money in cash. That was 7th of June. Fast forward to today, and he hasn't come to ask for money once, until a couple of days ago, and he wants 1000$ in cash. Now my question is, since I have no lease, and the money he is charging me (12000$ for a single bedroom apartment/we are 4 people so 3000 each for the whole summer) is way too much. Not only that, I am here for about 4 months, and my rent is 3000 for the summer, but I know people who are here for 2 months, and they pay 3000 as well. My question is, what can he do if I don't pay my rent?	No
I'll try to keep this as short as possible... Divorce in 2012 - Ex Wife was awarded the home and signed a decree agreeing to refinance the home within 60 days and hold me harmless. She has never done this and is constantly late. She is up to 120 days past due now and I finally was able to contact her through a friend's cell phone and she says she's filing bankruptcy and to contact her attorney.  Is there anything I can do or should I just go ahead and file bankruptcy.	No
"I live in Los Angeles, California, the apartment I'm renting IS protected by the RSO.  One day I recieved a text via phone that for the most part read  ""gg no re""in short a 30 day notice to move out.  In order for it to be legal he HAS to have a just cause.  Which he claims after he texted me a 30 days notice.  He only gave me a reason after I essentially begged him to give me a reason.  The reason is allegedly uncleanliness. Some things have some form of merit to them, but most of them don't, anything that I could possibly have fixed I already have.  Furthermore I have pictures to help prove my case although its a difficult thing to argue I do have several arguements for why I am not unclean like he claims and that they are in fact far worse than I have ever been.  To my knowledge he has not said anything about court.  First he said he was going to call the police, then he said all of my stuff is going to be on the streets when I get back.  Putting my things out on the street without going to court is incredibly illegal.  Right now I suspect if thats the route he wants to take I have allready made plans to stay home so he can't do that, I'm not sure what hes going to attempt to do in this case with me here so I do have my concerns.  For example if he tries to bust down the door or attack me. Additionally they are several roomates, which could testify against me. one is his girlfriend, the other have been friends.  Largely any advice for the inevitable court case would be appreciated, if he ever figures out or decides that he actually wants to take me to court.  Or if he continues to decide to try and force me out through self help means."	No
Moved out of an apartment and was charged for things I didn't believe to be valid. Fast forward a few years, and I'm tired of dealing with the collections agency and want to just settle with a PTD but noticed they're charging interest. Wasn't in lease, and I tried searching through statute but couldn't find an answer. Is interest on debt owed provided for in Florida?	No
Last winter, my roommates and I were looking for an apartment, and came across a nice looking student housing complex. When we went to the office of the complex, we were told that we could not see the actual unit we would occupy yet because we had not yet been assigned one, and there were people living in all of them at the moment. A couple days ago, we finally were notified of our unit number (note that we move in Aug. 1st and today is July 28th). Anyways, I live two states over from my college, so I was not able to go see the apartment. My roommate, however, had the joy of seeing it today. The unit was on the out skirts of the complex, basically in the woods. Mt roommate noticed that the current tenants were home, and decided to knock on the door and ask to simply look around. Our town has a real sense of community, and everyone is super nice so this is not as odd as it sounds. The current tenant then proceeded to show my roommate the mold that was growing throughout the apartment, the roach and spider infestation, and the wet carpet from a leak coming from God knows where. The tenant also informed my roommate that there was a snake in the apartment one day... a fucking snake... and management did nothing about it. Their dryer was broken all semester, and once again, management and maintenance did nothing to fix it. I am wondering if there is any way for us to get out of this lease? Maybe because we were not able to see the property beforehand? I know basic contract law, which is why I am scared that we are royally fucked. Can we get out of it because of the unsafe living conditions?	No
I currently work at a small SaaS company in a client support type of role. I do general troubleshooting and account setups, nothing on the technical side of things nor do I take part in the sales process.   I've recently got an interview with another, much larger, company in the same exact field, in a different state, doing something pretty similar but not dealing with clients nearly as much.   Well, comes to find out that I have a non-compete that prevents me from working in the industry for TWO YEARS after quitting or being let go. The non-compete was signed when I first started at a super entry level call center position.   Is there any way around this? This is my field of expertise and it would be really hard to find another job that I'm as good at in this field. Am I screwed and stuck at my current company until the end of time?	No

So I was working part time at this Bikini place for like 3 years, in Feb of this year they said they laid everyone off because of lack of work. Literally no one came in anymore and they were turning the place into a warehouse office, some of the windows were already being replaced, and there was saws and stuff. So the last week of Feb my manager Shana called me saying EVERYONE is getting laid off except for the HR/ceo people on the 3rd floor. The retail store will be closed. So that very day I went into the work and asked them is this true, and they said they are closing the retail store and only the private owners will continue running it via online.     Flash forward to today, I see they made a post on Facebook saying 4th of July week sale, Come on in! The store was open.  Now is it only open for the 4th of july week?  Or did something shady happen in Feb? Because they typed a letter for me to give to unemployment saying the store was closed and everyone got layed off.	No
"I own a condo in Saskatchewan. Recently, I received a ""summer updates"" email from my condo property managers stating that pets are not allowed. This was the first time I had heard of this rule and there is no indication in any of the past 3 years of AGM minutes that a 'no pets rule' had been discussed or voted on by the condo owners to become a bylaw.   The condo I own is occupied by new tenants who have one cat (and now want a second). I have told them not to get a second cat until I figure this out.   I also want to get more information about this new no pets rule/ bylaw from the property managers but I am worried that if I start asking, they will then realize that my tenants have a cat and will take action to have it removed. I really like these tenants and want to keep them happy.   Any advice or thoughts on how to proceed?   Should i just ignore the rule but only let my tenants keep one cat? Should I contact my property managers and potentially point out that I have a cat in my unit while getting more info? Any other ideas?"	No
Hi,  My wife's employer pays for her health insurance. About a month ago, she had a routine doctors appointment. The doctor refused to see her since the insurance was terminated, unless she paid out of pocket. This also delayed her month prescription of medicine. Now she has a sudden sever pain in her neck, and she called her insurance to see what urgent care she should go to. They informed her that her policy was terminated again. This is very frustrating. Is this a legal or employment board issue? Someone told her to just go to the urgent care and send the bill to her boss. I think that is a bad idea.   Her employer has never announced to the overall company that there has been nonpayment of the insurance premiums. For all we know, they have failed to make payments on time other months as well. My big concern is what if she was in a serious accident or had a sudden illness. We could be liable for all the charges and he full bill if that were to happen.   Any advice?	No
"Hi, I'm posting this on behalf of my 85-year old non-English speaking grandma.   My grandma owns a house in Los Angeles County, CA that she rents out for some extra income. She doesn't speak English, and listed the property in a Chinese newspaper. She also wrote a big For Rent sign in Chinese with her phone number (I don't really know how to read/write Chinese, but she says the sign said ""for rent"") and put it outside the house.  Someone showed up to the house, arranged a meeting with my grandma and me (I translated for her) and basically this guy threatening to sue for discrimination because the ""For Rent"" sign isn't in English. He did mention something about an out-of-court settlement though, before he left in a huff.  Does this guy have a case, or is he just trying to make a quick buck? And do we have anything to be worried about?  Thanks so much in advance!!"	No
I'm trying to put out a piece of hardware that would be used by laboratories, so I guess it falls under the umbrella of lab equipment. Obviously, I would like to comply with all regulations, but was wondering what relevant organizations/documents I should take a look at. I was thinking along the lines of FDA/FCC maybe? Any help would be appreciated!	No
Given the recent tweets by the president that say that transgender people can no longer serve in the military, what is going to happen to those of us who are openly trans?  My background is that I have a medically approved transition plan from the military, and my ID card and all my legal documents reflect my new gender. Will I be kicked out? Will I be subject to UCMJ charges or court martial? Since my transition (minus surgery which I choose to skip) is basically complete can I stay in as my new gender? If I do get separated, can I re-enlist in the future if the next president changes the policy? Can I de-transition to stay in?  Should I start talking to JAG now, or get a civilian lawyer?	No
So this is somewhat long, please bear with me:   It is my first time renting and after 18 months (last 6 in a month-to-month) I got a 90-day end of tenancy notice saying that the house is for sale.   Now, I was not sure what I was doing and this followed:   1) Unaware of the 30-day notice to vacate I had to sent I immediately started looking for new apartments and was accepted on a new one today (07/11) with move-in date on August 1st.   2) and I called the property management to notify I had found a new place and that I would be able to move on August 1st. The agent said it was OK through over the phone.   After reading about it better I found I had to send a 30-day notice, which was not compatible with move out date of 08/01.   3) I give the agent a call and tell him I have to send a 30-day notice but in order for it to be valid for 08/01 my date would have to be 07/01. He says it's OK and even tell me that simply stating via email that I was able to move 08/01 was enough. I disagree and say I'll send you a 30-day noticed like that anyway.   4) I send him a 30-day today notice to the same email he was talking to me, backdated 07/01 and ask for him to acknowledge it and confirm that he was in agreement with my moving date. He does neither of that and ignores the e-mail.   In other e-mails he is always really vague and avoid direct answers to my August 1st move-out date. He refuses to specify a prorated rent in the case I move in that date.   Now to the problem:   That 30-day notice says I recognize that failure to vacate on the date set forth may cause owner/agent to suffer actual damages.  Question:   1) Does he have to acknowledge the 30-day notice on his e-mail and answer my question in order for the notice to be valid?   2) What happens if I do it the usual way and send first class mail with another one dated 07/12 with a later move out date? Will he be able to say I already had sent one and did not vacate, therefore causing damages?   3) What is the best way to fix this mess, invalidate the unanswered, previous 30-day notice and have a valid move out date so that I don't end up paying an extra rent?   Let me know if some part of it is too convoluted so I can explain it better.  Thanks all!	No
I just got a call today from my storage unit stating I have used their on site dumpster when I shouldnt have. I threw away some empty packing boxes. They told me the dumpster is not for customers. I apologized and said it wont happen again and that I was unaware I was not allowed to use the dumpster on the property where I rent a unit.  Then they told me that there is a $200 penalty for using it. I said I dont remember that listed in the lease contract I signed that I wouldnt use their dumpster or any mention of a fee/penalty for doing so.  I checked the contract and there is no mention of use of the dumpster or a fee for using it.  They called again in the afternoon which I let go to voice mail. They said they have me on their surveillance cameras using the dumpster and to call back.  Do they have grounds to charge me for use of the on property dumpster where I rent a unit?	No
