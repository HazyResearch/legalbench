Does the post discuss visas, asylum, green cards, citizenship, migrant work and benefits, and other issues faced by people who are not full citizens in the US?

Post: I know an illegal immigrant who has been her for over 16 years. This person is one of the nicest people I know and I would really like to help them out. They care for a grandchild who is a legal citizen. They don't have custody but the father (legal) has abandoned the child and the mother (illegal) was deported years ago.   Can anyone offer advice on how this person can become a legal citizen of the US, or anything else that could help them?  Thank you!

Post: I hope this is the right sub.   When I went through immigration, they pulled up my "rap sheet", and even though I've never been convicted of a felony, they can see where I have been arrested for one. My actual record is clean (I have two marijuana related misdemeanors), but they said they need "court papers stating that you have been cleared of all felonies" that showed up on my report. I tried contacting my lawyer and he said he needs to charge me for "post conviction representation" for it to clear up, but I feel like that's just bullshit. Is there anything I can do without having to spend money? I didn't think it would be so hard to get into Canada. Will I have this problem traveling to other countries? Any advice is greatly appreciated.

Post: Hello,  I have lived in the US for the past 25 years and have been a green card holder for the past 5. I live and work as an engineer in Atlanta, GA. Been working past 6 years at the same company.  3 Years ago I was arrested for misdemeanor possession and I entered a pre-trial diversion program to have the charges dropped upon completion of my probation. I completed my probation without any issues.  I've heard some horror stories of Green Card holders being denied re-entry after traveling abroad with a criminal record. I'm planning on going to China in a month. Should I be worried? Should I consult with an immigration lawyer or is that unnecessary?  Appreciate any help.

Post: My primary residence is in Texas just off campus in a house I am subletting for the summer. It's in a house shared by a dozen students; natural it's a rowdy neighborhood. The plan is (was?) to sign onto the lease when school begins again. Unfortunately due to a family emergency I had to rush home.  After I left someone listed all of the unoccupied rooms on Airbnb.com for some extra cash. An Airbnb guest hosted a party. Two teens got into a drunken fight and accidentally knocked a third person through the deck railing causing them to fall and be sent to the hospital.  I don't have renter's insurance because I thought it only covers my stuff.

Post: My rap sheet consists of 1 DUI, which most companies I want to work at don't consider to be a disqualification. I got a job offer at my dream company and now I have to wait on the background check. I've seen a report from a background check company before and it has all "gory details" of the court case, including aggravating factors that were ultimately ignored. Can a background check company use all that info against me or can they only report on the fact that I have a *Gross Misdemeanor - Driving Under the Influence, 1st Offense*.

Post: I'm mobile so I apologize in advance. So, after this post, things got worse.  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6fui41/tx_contractor_not_completing_work/  The contractor and crew stopped showing up completely, after a torn down deck and dock. $12,000 was paid in total. The 'contractor' kept leading my FIL on basically, saying he had an investor who was going to loan the money to him so my FIL could be paid back $9,000 plus lumber. Well, that didn't happen. He called FIL yesterday, said he sold off all his assets (truck, cell phone, handguns) and was filing bankruptcy, so FIL would get nothing if he tried to sue him. Obviously, get a lawyer, right? My FIL feels like it'll just be more expensive to get a lawyer since there's a good chance he'll never see his money again.
