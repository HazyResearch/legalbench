Post: Should I be getting my parents to proactively contact the health insurance company to see how to pay or is there some out of this world reason that they don't have to pay anymore? They had cancelled the insurance through calling the Obamacare phone number stating that they didn't realize their insurance had autorenewed and got mail a month later with the results. The result was that we would have to pay anyway but the health insurance was cancelled. We haven't received mail from them anymore, not even a bill. Should I wait until a bill comes in through the mail or should we be proactively calling the obamacare hotline or the health insurance company to get further details?

Post: My roommate and I were feeling unwell in our basement apartment for a long time. We discovered a drier was exhausting directly into our unit. We asked the landlord to fix it, but he did, and ever since then it has gotten way worse. There's a chemical smell in the air and staying in the apt more than ~15 mins causes extreme fatigue, loss of focus, sinuses closing up, and chest tightness (Whatever it is isn't triggering the CO2 or natural gas alarm)    Landlord agreed to terminate our lease and let us keep our stuff in there unpaid for the first few weeks but now he wants us to set a move out date and pack up. But I feel really bad when I stay in here. The last time I went in to get my stuff I fell asleep suddenly and woke up 2 hours later with a nosebleed and difficulty breathing.    Landlord refuses to hire an indoor air quality inspector and says he plans on sealing off the whole basement and no longer renting it. I called the housing inspector but he said he only inspects whole houses, not just the basement... so I would need to go through my landlord... what do I do?

Post: Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if any more information is needed.  Thanks in advance!

Post: I enjoy going for walks most mornings, and I often read while I do so. I recently found a pleasant neighborhood to wander but it appears to be an HOA (*shudders*). Can they ban me for wandering around there all the time? I've seen some gated off communities that claim "PRIVATE PROPERTY" but this one has no such signs. So far people have been friendly but I fear they might get annoyed after a while of seeing me stalking around with my books.

Post: I am looking to leave (flee, rather) my current employer and one of the opportunities I am presented is the same position with a competitor that is opening a new location.  Back in 2011, contingency of continued employment was a non-compete agreement of 1 year and I am uncertain of the scope of the 'area of coverage'.  This is specialty retail, so I'm not sure what could be considered 'protected information or practices' I could be taking with me. But clientele of this specialty visit most locations and I cannot imagine this not somehow getting back to my current boss if I were to leave and go to this competitor.  I doubt any action would be taken, but I do have a higher-than-most profile in this industry.  Kicker is, I am leaving because of a hostile work environment stemming from and sourced by the top of the food chain.  Berating, misplaced aggression, verbal abuse, swearing, I have documentation of instances that I could probably file a case and win with, but I'm not looking to sink a small business, just to keep myself from garnering a worsening mental state.  TLDR: If I am attacked over a non-compete, is a retort/defense of a hostile working environment forcing me to leave an acceptable legal defense?

Post: I'm going through a divorce right now and I was hoping to get some guidance here. Im currently stationed in Virginia but was married in Alabama and thats where my soon to be ex-wife is currently living with our 2 children. So we have a mutual agreement contract which states she'll be taking all payments of the second vehicle and Ill be giving her a certain amount of money for child support until our children have reached the age of 18. The contract is signed by both of us and is notarized as well.  So on the beginning of this month when the contract was supposed to take place she told that she didnt want to buy the car from me because she doesn't want it.  So now Im stuck paying for another car I cant afford and was wondering if itll be worth getting an attorny to help with that along with the divorce paperwork. Like what would happen if I got an attorney to press that case for me? What would be the negative consequence of her breaching a contract? Or would I be out of more money than before because I now have to take that route. I was also hoping someone could tell me how long we have to be separated in Alabamas laws in order to file for divorce. Ive googled and I cant find anything on an amount of time we need to be separated. I know Virginias laws and they're easy to find but thats not the case for Alabama since we were married there.   Im planning on getting an attorney but I want to have as much knowledge as possible before I do. If you have any questions please ask. I'm activr military and Ive already spoken with legal quite a few times but it always comes down to then telling me to find an attorney in Alabama without any real guidance.   Thanks in advance!
