"Hi Reddit Lawyers. I need some advice on my case. Backstory:  April 2016- I injured my hamate bone, fracturing the hook. I did not know this until May, when pain persisted and I went to an Ortho. I had X-rays and an MRI to confirm the fracture. My ortho elected to wait for the bone to heal. Fast forward to July. Still have pain, went back to the same ortho but with a hand specialist. He also had me wait and did not perform an excision. By August, the pain was still there and I would not heal. After X-rays and a CT, we decided to excise the hamate hook. (I was told I could immediately get back to sports and life as soon as the incision healed, but that story kept changing as I followed up the procedure and had pain. Being told I could participate quickly is something for another time).  After waiting a few months with no activity, my wrist was feeling ""better."" I was not having the same pain. On July 3rd, the same pain came back. After X-rays, MRI, and CT, it was shown that my hamate hook was still there. Only half was removed. The same fracture site existed with only the tip missing in the images. I went to a new ortho and recently had the rest removed.   The standard of care for this injury is to excise the hook immediately based on my research. Non union rates of the fracture are as high as 90%. My new ortho also said that they do not even talk about letting it heal, that went out of date 20 years ago. The go to is excision. This is also coupled with the fact that the surgeon stated he removed the entire hook in the op report. He ""completely"" removed it and said he examined the fracture site- something not possible because the original fracture was still there. Apparently, all he did was cut the tip of the bone off. This, obviously, caused me to have a follow up procedure to fix that issue.  So I had to wait in pain and not continue my life, which was wrong to begin with, and my surgery was incorrectly performed. I spoke with a lawyer and was basically told my case isn't big enough for his firm. I plan on getting a second opinion. I would like to know what you guys think. If I can't find representation, should I send a letter to the original ortho? I would include what happened, what had to be done, the images from the CTs clearly showing the hook still there. Maybe compensation? What should I do? Thanks in advance!"	Yes
I think it seems obvious in hindsight these meds where a problem but when your unwell and in a psychiatic settig you tend to take meds like it or not and i didnt associate the increased meds and pain fully until lately. It wasnt until i read about Akathisia that i noticed this is what i had been suffering. I just want to sue because this has bankrupt me and ruined my life and could have been avoided if a docter had just noticed these very negative side effects and stopped the meds.	Yes
I live in Washington. I have bipolar disorder and I had a severe manic episode that started around the 20th of June. On June 28th, I bought a 2013 Subaru WRX STI. I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k.    Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership.   I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price). They took the other route and had their lawyer send an email basically just saying there's no 3 day grace period or anything like that in Washington.   I know I'm definitely knee-deep in shit for this, but does anyone have any suggestions? I'm debating just leaving it there and taking the credit hit from a default. I make pretty good money for my age but I don't want to be stuck with those ridiculous payments. Even just seeing the car gives me anxiety and reminds me of all the bad decisions I made during that manic episode.	Yes
Hello all, I went to the ER yesterday at 1am for severe stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea and vomiting. I was given a slew of IV’s that were supposed to ease some of the pain and nausea. I can’t quite remember the nausea medicine but I was given ranitidine for stomach pain. Within the first few minutes I finally felt better and was able to finally sit up without feeling like me stomach was gonna burst.  Fast forward maybe an hour and the stomach pain returns, It starts to creep until It is a full blown torrent of pain. I begged for some more medicine and after another ranitidine bag I felt a bit better.   They took blood samples and found that I had a lipase of around 140, this led them to believe it was my pancreas and they gave me a CT dye mix to cat scan my organs. After the cat scan which showed a severely inflamed pancreas, I started itching, BAD. I have had hives before so I told the nurse hives were starting to form and she said, simply “No those bumps are from you scratching.” 10 minutes later and I’m covered head to toe in large, red itchy blotches. It takes them maybe an hours and a half to file some paperwork before they finally give me something to rid of the hives that had me ripping at the bed sheets in pain.  Once my hives cleared, I was given even more drugs, though my abdomen still hurt very bad. I passed out from all the drugs and pain and fell asleep. I was admitted into the hospital overnight and woke up 10am today. Cue, me waking up and vomiting blood-filled green vomit into multiple emesis bags. I begged the nurse and the doctor both for more nausea and pain meds though all I was given was some more ranitidine which at this point does nothing for me.  Now I’m sitting here with the worst pain of my life and the doctors saying I have to deal with it. They recommended I had a endoscopic tube inserted to my stomach to search for ulcers. The only problem is, I’m 17 and this hospital refuses to touch minors with that and I have to instead wait until Monday. (In two days) and see my family physician and get a recommendation before I can go to a different hospital and receive treatment. I asked if I was going to be getting any medicine to last me until then but I was denied everything and I know the pain is gonna return again. I’m just dreading when they take this IV out of me and discharge me. I can’t stand the pain, it hurts too bad. All I want are some pain meds. I guess I’m just gonna have to deal with it though.   A little side note I would like to add is they took a toxicology test on me and found THC then they tried to say that it was the THC causing my intense pain and inflammation. FML.  TL;DR: I had severe pain and sulfur burps, went to the hospital. They said I had a swollen pancreas then poisoned me (unintentionally) and covered my body with hives before taking an hour and a half to fix it. Currently about to discharge me after not fixing any of my abdominal issues or even giving me some pain meds to make the situation easier.	Yes
"My sister is a resident of California, she recently was prescribed some Vicodin after oral surgery on July 6th, 2017.   In pain still; the doctor during a follow up wrote out another prescription today on the 11th for the same medication except now Target/CVS are refusing to fill the prescription because there is a *new law* that ""covers this medication every 8 days only"".   I'm curious; wouldn't the doctor who wrote out the prescription be aware of this or is this not even a true law?   Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"	Yes
" A couple days ago, my mother went to the doc for a bump in her eye that seemed to be infected. The eye doctor examined it and said everything would be fine if she just rinsed it with warm water for two weeks. However, my mom didn't like this advice as she has been misdiagnosed before (years ago). Upon getting another eye doctor's opinion the next day, her fear was confirmed- the bump on her eye was infected and she needed surgery within 72 hours.  My question is: what can be done from a legal standpoint? I am sure that a complaint to the hospital will just be a slap in the wrist for the first eye doctor and I would hate for the same thing to happen to another person. I believe it to be utter unprofessionalism to say ""wash with warm water and rinse,"" and so I've came here to ask for advice.  Is this medical negligence, malpractice?"	Yes
My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	Yes
"I'm a US citizen who lives as an expat in the Czech Republic and have a huge medical bill in Colorado that I cannot afford to pay, and now debt collectors keep sending my brother notices (I have my US mail sent to him).  Some background: I was visiting family after spending a year in Vietnam and got very sick two days before flying to Europe. I thought it might be a parasite (I previously had one in Vietnam) and was informed by a nurse hotline that only an ER can check for parasites on this short of notice.   So I went to the ER and they gave me an IV drip, did blood work and stool sample, and gave me some meds. They would not give me any sort of figure for how much all of this would cost, not even ballpark. They just said ""it varies"". They were pushing to do a stomach ultrasound and I refused because it sounded expensive. They were very unsympathetic to the fact that I had no US health insurance and that I'd be paying out of pocket.  Now I have a bill for over $5000 that I can't pay. I don't even have any assets worth that much money.  I don't live in the US anymore, although I visit about every two years. What's my best option here? What sort of legal action are they able to take? Do debt collectors do payment plans? Are they able to go after my brother?"	Yes
