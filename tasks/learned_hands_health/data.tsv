Hello all, I went to the ER yesterday at 1am for severe stomach pain, bloating, diarrhea and vomiting. I was given a slew of IV’s that were supposed to ease some of the pain and nausea. I can’t quite remember the nausea medicine but I was given ranitidine for stomach pain. Within the first few minutes I finally felt better and was able to finally sit up without feeling like me stomach was gonna burst.  Fast forward maybe an hour and the stomach pain returns, It starts to creep until It is a full blown torrent of pain. I begged for some more medicine and after another ranitidine bag I felt a bit better.   They took blood samples and found that I had a lipase of around 140, this led them to believe it was my pancreas and they gave me a CT dye mix to cat scan my organs. After the cat scan which showed a severely inflamed pancreas, I started itching, BAD. I have had hives before so I told the nurse hives were starting to form and she said, simply “No those bumps are from you scratching.” 10 minutes later and I’m covered head to toe in large, red itchy blotches. It takes them maybe an hours and a half to file some paperwork before they finally give me something to rid of the hives that had me ripping at the bed sheets in pain.  Once my hives cleared, I was given even more drugs, though my abdomen still hurt very bad. I passed out from all the drugs and pain and fell asleep. I was admitted into the hospital overnight and woke up 10am today. Cue, me waking up and vomiting blood-filled green vomit into multiple emesis bags. I begged the nurse and the doctor both for more nausea and pain meds though all I was given was some more ranitidine which at this point does nothing for me.  Now I’m sitting here with the worst pain of my life and the doctors saying I have to deal with it. They recommended I had a endoscopic tube inserted to my stomach to search for ulcers. The only problem is, I’m 17 and this hospital refuses to touch minors with that and I have to instead wait until Monday. (In two days) and see my family physician and get a recommendation before I can go to a different hospital and receive treatment. I asked if I was going to be getting any medicine to last me until then but I was denied everything and I know the pain is gonna return again. I’m just dreading when they take this IV out of me and discharge me. I can’t stand the pain, it hurts too bad. All I want are some pain meds. I guess I’m just gonna have to deal with it though.   A little side note I would like to add is they took a toxicology test on me and found THC then they tried to say that it was the THC causing my intense pain and inflammation. FML.  TL;DR: I had severe pain and sulfur burps, went to the hospital. They said I had a swollen pancreas then poisoned me (unintentionally) and covered my body with hives before taking an hour and a half to fix it. Currently about to discharge me after not fixing any of my abdominal issues or even giving me some pain meds to make the situation easier.	Yes
This is gonna be a long one, feel free to skip to the TL;DR.  I don't know where to turn with this, so I'm trying here. I'm a woman in my thirties living in Norway with mental health problems. I've been trying to seek help for the past six months with several rejections and I wonder if anyone can tell me if there is something I can do to get help here.  In November 2013 I tried to commit suicide. For 1.5 years after that I received one-on-one therapy sessions where I was diagnosed with Avoidant Personality Disorder. The therapy was concluded in July 2015 because the therapist felt we had gotten as far as we were going to get in my current situation. I was put into group therapy in late October the same year and while I tried my best for 6 weeks I ultimately failed at completing the 'course'.   Since then I was in a work placement program for approximately 1 year. I started struggling with attendance after about 6 months and after several bouts of depression and suicidal tendencies I was committed to a clinic in January 2017 and concluded from the work placement.  I was in the clinic for a total of 10 days. The first therapist I spoke to at the hospital I was at first talked about thinking I would benefit from trauma therapy. It was also mentioned that I could get assistance at home to help me keep things neat and tidy as I find myself unable to keep on top of housework myself. Once I was transferred to a clinic all that was talked about was me returning to work placement. I was concluded there once I was released from the clinic, so that never happened. The psychiatrist at the clinic referred me to an in-house program where you're in the clinic for 6 weeks receiving cognitive treatment, going home in the weekends.  I never received any follow-up calls or check ups from the clinic after being discharged. I was rejected from the in-house treatment because they felt I needed more individual therapy and further progress.  Since I was discharged, my GP/doctor has been helping me send referrals to various psychiatric institutions. I was rejected from the district psychiatric clinic (DPS) in both Indre Østfold and Akershus based on something my former therapist wrote in my file: that I would likely not benefit from further treatment.   Two private psychiatrists have also been attempted but have received either rejection or no response.   Two years have passed since I was in active treatment and my psyche is in a much worse state than it was after 1.5 years of steady treatment. I've gone through painful things and continue to go through painful mental things that I need help to handle. I am desperate for a therapist to talk to, to help set my head straight. At this stage I'm in such a deep depression that I barely can get out of bed. Nothing is enjoyable. I go through the day only so that I can sleep again. Sleep is the only peace I know.   Now, my question is whether there is anything I can do to make that statement either stricken from my record or asked to be disregarded? This one thing seems to keep me from getting the help I seriously need and I'm just really terrified of my future if this continues. Is there ANYTHING I can do to get help based on only my current situation? Is it legally sound to reject my referrals based on a two year old assessment?    TL;DR: I struggle with mental health issues including depression and recurring suicidal thoughts. A former shrink has written in my records that she doesn't think I will benefit from more treatment and now I'm being rejected for treatment everywhere I turn. What can I do?	Yes
I had a very, very bad experience with a dental  surgery the other day. Woke up during surgery, surgeon held me down and finished procedure with me wide awake, no pain meds, and left the room. No other interaction with him afterward. Is this information I'm allowed to share in an online review of the dental practice?	Yes
I live in Washington. I have bipolar disorder and I had a severe manic episode that started around the 20th of June. On June 28th, I bought a 2013 Subaru WRX STI. I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k.    Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership.   I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price). They took the other route and had their lawyer send an email basically just saying there's no 3 day grace period or anything like that in Washington.   I know I'm definitely knee-deep in shit for this, but does anyone have any suggestions? I'm debating just leaving it there and taking the credit hit from a default. I make pretty good money for my age but I don't want to be stuck with those ridiculous payments. Even just seeing the car gives me anxiety and reminds me of all the bad decisions I made during that manic episode.	Yes
Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.  When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay.   My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!	Yes
" A couple days ago, my mother went to the doc for a bump in her eye that seemed to be infected. The eye doctor examined it and said everything would be fine if she just rinsed it with warm water for two weeks. However, my mom didn't like this advice as she has been misdiagnosed before (years ago). Upon getting another eye doctor's opinion the next day, her fear was confirmed- the bump on her eye was infected and she needed surgery within 72 hours.  My question is: what can be done from a legal standpoint? I am sure that a complaint to the hospital will just be a slap in the wrist for the first eye doctor and I would hate for the same thing to happen to another person. I believe it to be utter unprofessionalism to say ""wash with warm water and rinse,"" and so I've came here to ask for advice.  Is this medical negligence, malpractice?"	Yes
I am from Canada so I am not terribly familiar with this situation under state laws. My friend has a sister who has been in the ICU for a couple weeks now and requires heart surgery. Without the surgery she will die, and even with it, it is highly likely she will die. They are a very poor family and already struggle to make ends meet. If the sister dies, are the parents responsible for outstanding debt?   I thought a hospital bill can only be charged to the patient, an insurance company or if someone had signed something. Just looking for some advice on how this sort of stuff works and where to go from here.	Yes
My girlfriend with a mental condition (schizophrenia) has a friend who constantly makes her feel bad until she sends a sexually explicit image to her. If she doesn't respond to him (he lives in New York) then he berates her and curses at her.    This past day there were over 45 missed calls from him while we were spending time together. I didn't know she was doing this until she told me he was yelling again because she hadn't answered today, and I finally snapped and called him out on it. He eluded to having the images which led to my learning she had been doing this, and then spoke of how he got annoyed and mad at how she didn't send these images so he got mad. Today was the first day I learned of this. Once she learned I knew about what she did for him she cut herself so deeply she was in the ER and the other guy was unapologetic at his actions. I'm not sure if this has any legal grounds. Would it be helpful to call the police and report this? We are both 20 so are rather inexperienced. Apologies if this is written badly. I'm a mess.	Yes
"The long version:  I work with developmentally disabled men. My employer is a private not for profit agency that cares for nearly 1000 disabled people. I don't want to drop the name .On an outing one of my clients tripped and fell down 2 stairs, landing flat on his belly and face. He was awake, he sat up on his own and was responsive. I called my supervisor for guidance and she told me to take him to the hospital if he would go himself or call an ambulance. He wouldn't move and doesn't communicate very well verbally so I called the ambulance. The ambulance arrived and took him to the hospital.  This is where it gets messed up.  I follow the ambulance and try to get to my client but the er wouldn't let me see him for 15 mins. Finally they let me see him and they have him in a gown and lying in bed. They ask me what happened and I tell them what I saw. They order a ct scan.  While we are waiting for the results I comment that he is acting weird. He usually can walk but he won't. So the nurse said that the doctor won't let him leave if he can't walk. Scan results come back, he broke a bone in his face but he can go home. No checking if he can walk or other exams. Just a head and neck ct. And bam, suddenly he is discharged.  My coworker and I load him up and take him home. He still won't walk and is still acting weird, but they said he had a concussion and would be dazed. So later that night my boss comes and does an exam and it is obvious he has an injured leg, so they take him back in the ambulance. They wouldn't let my boss be in the room with him just like they did with me. An x-ray is ordered. Broken femur.  He has surgery and 2 days later my boss notices his shoulder is swollen and bruised. It took more than a day to convince the hospital to just x-ray his damned arm. X-ray is ordered, but the next shift nurse tries to cancel it citing the ct scan, ""They should have picked up anything on the ct scan..."" My boss was pissed. Turns our, he has broken humerus.  So the higher level people in my company want to have a formal meeting with the hospital because this is just ridiculous. So the hospital is now trying to pin the whole thing on me. I gave them bad info, and that I said it was ok to discharge. That kind of stuff is way above my pay grade and I am not the guardian. My boss said it is bullshit, but she isn't sure if I'm in any legal jeopardy.  So with that, do I need to lawyer up so I don't get sued without representation? Ask any questions, and sorry if it reads like a grade school story. I am super stressed and feel so bad for my guy. The hospital failed him and I feel like I failed him too.  Edit: Somehow I managed to delete the original post, sorry."	Yes
My roommate and I were feeling unwell in our basement apartment for a long time. We discovered a drier was exhausting directly into our unit. We asked the landlord to fix it, but he did, and ever since then it has gotten way worse. There's a chemical smell in the air and staying in the apt more than ~15 mins causes extreme fatigue, loss of focus, sinuses closing up, and chest tightness (Whatever it is isn't triggering the CO2 or natural gas alarm)    Landlord agreed to terminate our lease and let us keep our stuff in there unpaid for the first few weeks but now he wants us to set a move out date and pack up. But I feel really bad when I stay in here. The last time I went in to get my stuff I fell asleep suddenly and woke up 2 hours later with a nosebleed and difficulty breathing.    Landlord refuses to hire an indoor air quality inspector and says he plans on sealing off the whole basement and no longer renting it. I called the housing inspector but he said he only inspects whole houses, not just the basement... so I would need to go through my landlord... what do I do?	Yes
I was at a friend's party when the deck collapsed and I along with 2 others had to be taken to the hospital. My injuries are a severe scalp laceration on my forehead and up through my hair line. Another girl broke her back.   The house was a rental and from what I know they had the deck looked at/repaired twice. What is my best course of action?	Yes
Whenever I go to my orthodontist, they have a bunch of dentistry chairs in the back so each patient is getting treated side by side with no privacy. In this same room, there's a big television in the middle with patient's names, reason for visit, treatment for the visit, who they're seeing, appointment time, et cetera. This seems to me like a very clear violation of the law. Am I correct in thinking this?	Yes
I am currently battling with my insurance company about my claims. This is not for an car accident claims. Just strictly medical treatment and I am in the State of Washington.   I started receiving medical treatment back in April 2016. and inquired about starting my claims in September 2016. I made all the inquiries through emails and never actually submitted my claims. They told told me is that, in order for them to reimburse me, I have to make the payment out of pocket. I did not have the money to pay for the expenses at the time so delayed my claims. They NEVER told me that I have to submit my claims within 180 days of my services.  I finally was able to make payments on the medical services in July 2017. Subsequently, I my claims and the Company deny reimbursement for treatment received from April 2016 through December 2016 since it was outside of the 180 days window.   I was doing some research and it mentioned something about Washington State is a notice prejudice state but I am not sure if it has been extended to health insurance claims.   Am I out of luck? Is there anything that can help me?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
I was walking at work when my right knee sprained I didn't fall or hit anything. I was told that they couldn't cover it because I was just walking but, the reason it sprained was  from a prior injury that I sustained from work before. The place they sent me to Concentra urgent care facility that handled and cared for my injury told me that I was fine and released me from care. Not too long ago after they let me go I reinjured the same right knee just walking at work. Now am I suppose to act like Concentra wasn't wrong for letting me go the first time? I'm sure they are not perfect so now the people handling my insurance are telling me that Concentra can never be wrong and that it's just a coincidence that the same right knee sprained just walking ? Can I sue ?	Yes
"My 92 year old grandmother is currently decaying away in her home losing her mind. She has been injured various times but plays it off with insane excuses. She is clearly not mentally fit to be all on her own.  Currently she is in the ""care"" of my aunt, in which her daughter forced her so that she controls all my grandmother's finances. Right now the aunt does nothing at all, and worsens my grandmother's physical state.  In general the aunt is a big obstacle.  What can I do to help this situation? Ideally I'd want my grandmother to move in with me so I can actually take care of her but im unsure if my aunt would let that happen. It's come to the point where the aunt drains her pension each month not even leaving her enough for groceries.  Legally what are my options, alternatively i'd want her in an old folks home."	Yes
My father married a gold-digger because he didn't want to die alone, now he has dementia and my step-mother dropped him off at a nursing home saying that she was going shopping and would be back. Of course, she didn't return. My father has told me that there was nothing more for him to live for up where they were staying, but if he was to live with me instead of this evil woman; I know that his quality of life would improve. Is there anything I can do to rescue him from the care of this lady? She has power of attorney and I don't have the resources to take her to court.	Yes
She is on dialysis (no kidney function) and had surgery to remove mass from colon three weeks ago. She was put in a nursing home for about two weeks but after being diagnosed with malnourishment and in such severe pain she was put back in hospital due to an abscess which they drained. She  started having seizures every 20-30 min and has not had any nutrition in 4 days. She is begging for food but from my understanding, they won't even tube feed her until they find what is causing seizures. She is completely bedridden due to being malnourished  but of sound mind. My father just got a call from the doctor asking for her living will. I am worried they will stop all medical help if he gives it to them.  What can we do?	Yes
"I'm 50 years old.  After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.  Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.  My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.  Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.  I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.  Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.  Thanks very much for any advice you can give."	Yes
I don't think she has a case but now that's she's of more sound mind she's annoyed she was fired because of a hospital visit related to her PTSD.  Basically she was a contract employee for a company when she had an issue that ended up with her in the hospital.  They held her for 4 days but couldn't find a bed for her in a ward better suited for her so eventually released her to my care.  (Ultimately a mistake because she ended up in the hospital again for worse symptoms for a whole two weeks but I digress).    I never contacted her work during those 4 days, I honestly didn't even think of it, I was spending those 4 days sitting in a chair in her hospital room. Upon her release I do contact them and let them know what happened, she still wasn't really in the shape to talk to them but since her job was basically ticket assigning and chat moderation she agreed to go back to work right away since it was simple and done from home at that time anyway. They ask for a picture of her release paper work showing the days spent in the hospital and leave it at that.  I let her know she said she'd handle it, sent them a picture and that was the end of it for a few hours.  A few hours later they contact us saying she sent a picture of the wrong thing, I look and curse myself for not double checking her because in her addled state she did send the wrong thing.  She sent the picture of the paperwork that basically just said they set her up with an appointment with her normal doctor to follow up about the issues with her PTSD and the hospital stay.  I grab her normal paperwork and see that since she transferred hospitals at some point they only had the 2 days at the second hospital listed not the first two.  So we head out to the original hospital and get the paperwork showing all the days she spent.  I'm sitting at the gas station outside our house when we get a call from the contracting company and are told that they have ended her contract and she doesn't have a job anymore.  They do kind of have a history of this.  Two or three months prior to this another coworker of hers who was actually employee there for over 4 years had their contract ended the day after it was revealed she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  I don't think she has much of a case because I don't think contract employees have much at all in the way of rights.  Also they didn't actually know she had PTSD the only thing that told them was the paperwork she accidentally sent them, she never told them herself at any point.  Either way I said I would ask.	Yes
After a routine cleaning with a dentist they informed me that I need five fillings in my mouth. I come in a week or so later and get the fillings done.  PRIOR to the fillings I felt absolutely no discomfort or pain in my mouth. AFTER the fillings my mouth is in constant extreme pain and several Advils a day barely mitigate the pain.  I believe this dentist did something to mess up my mouth and I was wondering if there is anything I can do in the form of legal action against her. This is the state of Illinois.	Yes
My daughter was refered by her dentist to another dentist to see if a very small cavity needed to be filled and to consult about possibly getting veneers. She is 17. She went back and was gone for 2 hours. The receptionist blew off my requests for information about what was going on multiple times. When they brought her out she looked like hell. They had done an unauthorized root canal on her. I am pissed off. My daughter now has a giant silver molar that was put into place without asking. What do i do here?	Yes
So, my wife (no marriage cert, but we lived &amp; function as man &amp; wife) has left, not really communicating at all.  While I adore her, and want things to work out, if she needs to leave to be happy, I can deal with that.  However, she has major medical issues (using the max FSA contribution in ~8 months each year), but if we are split, I can save ~150 a PAYCHECK by dropping her and changing to a high deduct plan, with HSA.  She has no job at current, and ~4 yrs ago when she took med leave from her last job, she didn't do the required appt's &amp;/or paperwork to continue to get paid from them. She also refused to apply for unemployment, or disability in all that time.  We also have a 5 yr old daughter, but I'm not concerned about custody today, although that will be it's own issues.  Open enrollment is typically in Oct. so I have time. But I want to be prepared.  So much more, I'm sure, but ask ?'s and I'll answer.	Yes
So two years ago my fiance was attending a university in New Hampshire and she received health insurance through the university. After a year she took a leave of absence and moved to California for a job. She received health insurance through her job in California. The university did not cancel her insurance in New Hampshire, so she submitted a form to the insurance company in December 2016 to waive the insurance in New Hampshire and the waiver was refused. She repeatedly reached out to the insurance for several months to sort out why they would not cancel her insurance and she's now finding out (through the university, which has done nothing to alleviate the problem) that there were claims submitted in January, February, and March of 2017. Being in California she couldn't have used the New Hampshire insurance since it was only accepted at the university's medical network. She has proof that she was clocked in at work in California for the times associated with the claims.   The university states that all students (even those on a leave of absence must have health insurance that meets their requirements). Her leave of absence ended a month ago.   I've already read through the [FTC's medical identity theft](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0171-medical-identity-theft) page and plan to follow the instructions there. Is there anything else that we can do to solve this? What would be the best way to get the insurance cancelled?	Yes
We are located in Alberta, Canada.   Over the course of the past year, my mother has suffered a debilitating illness that has kept her from working.  There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc).   My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.    We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we don’t know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage.   Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.	Yes
I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back. Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this. After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time. By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything. I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts. Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?	Yes
Problem 1:  My cousin has cancer. It was at one point treatable, but because of her mental health issues she was not able follow the plan established by her doctors. She is now terminally ill. Last week (Wednesday, the 44th day of her stay), we were notified by the hospital  that they planned to discharge her the next day. We were generally not happy with the treatment she received there (they would forget to feed her and administer her medication), but the nursing home she came from was worse, and we had yet to find better alternatives.  The next afternoon (Thursday) they returned her to the nursing home after saying she had consented to leave. She has  schizophrenia,  has not consistently received her medication, and is unable to make these kinds of decisions. I, her power of attorney,  did not discuss her discharge with anyone at the hospital (I was unable to return their call in time), and did not consent to her return to this nursing home. After speaking with my cousin about the incident later, she denies saying she was prepared to leave. Friday, around noon, less than 24 hours after she returned to the nursing home, she was readmitted to a different hospital for breathing problems. She was diagnosed with Pneumonia, and doctors noted spots on her lungs.   We are appalled by the way they have treated her, but aren’t sure who to contact, or what we can do about it. Should we contact the medical board? Do we need a lawyer? What kind of lawyer do we need?  Problem 2:  My cousin has siblings who so far, have not participated in her care, but seem very interested in her assets, and the possibility of acquiring them after her death (she has no children, a nice home, and over $150,000 cash). Though we haven’t mentioned it to her, she has said she suspects they are “only coming around now because they’ve figured out how much money i’ve got”.  One sibling is particularly intent on using her in any way possible. After meeting with her doctor to discuss her prognosis, his first thought was to search her house for life insurance policies. He has asked my husband and I to purchase bonds with her money, and a number of other “small” horrible things.   This weekend we found out that he broke into her house and changed  her locks. We do not know when it happened, or if he took anything, but my cousin says she did not want him in her house, and did not ask him to change her locks. He says he did so because he needed to find her insurance policy. He doesn’t want to be responsible for her funeral expenses after she passes, and didn’t trust me (the power of attorney) or her other sister to go to her home. He claims to be trying to do what’s best for her.   He has also been very adamant that she not return to her house (we’ve considered placing her there with an in-home nurse for her final days). We now believe it is because when he was there he stole something.   I am not sure how to protect her property from him while she is still alive, and I am wondering if I should call the police, and seek a  restraining order.  Thanks for any advice you can provide.	Yes
My sister is pregnant and she wants to get an abortion. In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.  So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.  Ideally they wouldn't ever know about it but let's assume they figure it out somehow, can I (or her) be in any legal trouble here?	Yes
Briefly...  I make a HIPAA Violation report about my employer.  When you do this, there is a box that you can check that says that you do not want your information revealed to the company you are reporting.  Today I get a call from my employer... basically saying... about that HIPAA report you made about us...  Awkward.  I contact HHS.gov.  They confirmed that they erroneously revealed my information to my employer.  I do understand that my employer cannot legally retaliate against me.  (At least not overtly.  But who knows what my performance reviews are going to look like over the years).  I also understand that at least as of right now... I have no damages.  So I suspect that I answered my own question...  Except that it seems like a pretty big deal that the agency that you are reporting privacy violations to are violating your privacy.  Do you think this is something I should consider pursuing?  Or do I need to just sit back and wait for enumerable damages?	Yes
She talked me into staying with her because she said I had commitment issues.  She made herself my personal caretaker isolating me away from professionals, church, friends and family.  I trusted her more than myself because of dogmatic Mormon views of Husband and Wife and benevolence of mental health professionals.  She talked cryptically about gas lighting, life insurance and suicide protection but ducted out at the idea that she pay it incase I am instituted and can't.   She lastly brought up a polyamorous marriage. I said she was cheating when she left for weekends without contact. She gave me 30 days to get out of her parents house (she was already pushing her parents into nursing homes for).	Yes
Asking if I have any legal leverage being you know a minor. It's a bit of a complicated situation I don't want to go too too deep in to it but long story short I think the meds are unnecessary and potentially harmful.	Yes
 I am not from America so I apologize for my bad English. I used google translator  The other day I was in the pharmacy picking up my painkillers, and in the box says how many to take, but I took the biggest route and now I'm out of pills and I can not get high, and I feel very sick. Is there any way I can sue the pharmacy? Also, my province is Michoacán	Yes
My spouse is currently in the psych ward on voluntary status. A nurse who is caring for them has repetatedly verbally abused them. We made a report to an outside party who has informed the director of nursing at the hospital.   The nursing director informed the nurse who was the abuser of the report and who made it. Is that legal? We are afraid of retaliation by the nurse  as they were not sent home or repremanded in any way.  Is that legal? I thought reports were to remain anonymous.	Yes
Went to a court hearing, where it was vital that the doctor send the medical records to prove my case, but the clinic sends a blank disc to the court.  I was give the blank disc from the court that day.  I was told in court that because the disc was blank with no records on it that I was going to lose my case in court that day. I was to recover no reward for my case.  So the doctor or the clinic messed me out of thousands.  No justice for me at that time.  Well I haven't given up hope that I will fix this.	Yes
"Hi all,  I'll try to keep this simple. My health plan(New York Medicaid) covers 20 visits of Physical therapy a year. I might or might not have gone over 20 visits when I started going to my current Physical Therapy Office. I went to PT for 3 visits and got billed $50 for each of the visits. Now in this point of my life, $150 is a boatload of money and can't afford to pay it off. Apparently my plan can't help me out as I went over the 20 plan limit and the PT office didn't confirm whether I was at my limit or not as well.  So I'm basically stuck with this bill and it will possibly be sent to collections. Now I have a ""plan"" perhaps on getting this resolved which may be a bit un-kosher. You see this same office billed my insurance company (NY Medicaid), for an EMG of the Neck and Lower Back and they were paid $3.5k for each part.  However when I asked the office for the report they tell me they only did and have a report for the EMG of the Neck not the lower back even though they billed my insurance for it and got paid $3.5k.  So I want to try to ask them to waive my physical therapy balance of $150, so that I look the other way and don't report them for billing fraud to my medicaid health plan. I'm not sure this will work but I am all out of options, and would like any and all advice."	Yes
I have been to a mental hospital voluntarily a few times when I was younger. I want to buy a gun for hunting but was not sure if Im alllowed to. I Dont have a mental illness. I was also one time held in a hospital until I saw a psychiatrist whuch was a couple hours, then I was released after being evaluated. Do I still have my gun rights?	Yes
I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my leg in 2013. Medi clinic Doctor didn't prescribe blood thinners or send me for an ultrasound to confirm it or even suggest a follow up afterwards. Ended up almost dieing in the hospital with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs so bad I passed out from lack of oxygen and my stressed out heart couldn't pump enough blood. After my diagnosis (two xrays and CT scan later) I was on clot busters so strong I had to stay in ICU for 24 hours in case my brain started bleeding out. During my stay, the info pamphlet they gave me pretty much stated flat out that PE is caused by deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) in the legs.  Currently on blood thinners right now for the next 6 months and am otherwise healthy. I think the Dr that diagnosed me completely dropped the ball with not prescribing treatment or requesting an ultrasound to gain even basic knowledge about what was going on and to that effect it's probable the clot remained for years and moved to my lungs (been having breathing issues for the last couple of years)...  Thoughts?  I'm not about frivolous lawsuits, but this sounds like negligence at the very least.	Yes
"Last year, I went in to a California urgent care center because I ended up having strep throat. I gave them my Aetna PPO insurance, paid the $75 copay, and then went on my merry way to the pharmacy. This was about a year ago.  I did a credit report check recently, and to my surprise a $200 bill had been placed into collections over 6 months ago, with the urgent care center listed as the original account holder. So I call this urgent care, which is located in a small shopping mall and is not attached to a hospital or any other medical offices. The receptionist pulls up my account and tells me that she sees that I paid the copay, but that they have nothing to do with further billing, as they send all their claims to a contracted medical billing office for insurance collection, which is apparently the standard in the industry. She kindly gives me their medical billing company's phone number, apologizes, and says she has ""not heard positive things"" about them. Great.  So I call the medical billing office explaining that their buddy, the urgent care center, sent me to them with my qualms about this phantom $200 medical bill. She looked me up by my name and birthday, and said that yes, they did send that amount to Stanislaus Credit Control Agency after four unsuccessful attempts to contact me. Interestingly enough, the main offices for both Stanislaus and this medical billing company are both located in Modesto, CA. Anyway, the lady says this is a result of me not reaching my insurance deductible, and that this $200 was the amount my insurance, Aetna, would not cover for the urgent care visit. I thought that sounded legitimate so I eased my tone and said thanks for clearing that up.  However, I now believe she was giving me a pre-scripted run-around. I call Aetna to ask what my deductible would be for an urgent care visit. **Aetna says there is no deductible for urgent care visits, only a copay.** I ask them to look up the claim for this urgent care visit, as the urgent care center has my Aetna insurance policy on file. **Aetna has no record of any claim for any urgent care center on my behalf.**   My Aetna customer service guy says hold on, he will personally call this medical billing office. I stay on the line listening to the provided elevator music, and he comes back reporting that the person who is in control of my account is apparently not in the office today, a Monday afternoon at 2pm. I ask my Aetna customer service guy if he thinks that sounds shady. He agrees, and says he personally will try again tomorrow and get back to me. I google the urgent care center on Google, and there are already four negative reviews mentioning surprise letters from collections agencies.  Are any/all of these companies in cahoots with each other to make money from collections, instead of correctly filing a claim with Aetna? I am still waiting to hear back, as this Nancy Drew stuff all went down today. Thanks in advance for any theories."	Yes
I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.  First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying. I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.  I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.  As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.  Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.  **TL;DR, sick, boss doesn't believe me, what do?**	Yes
"I am sorry in advance if this is long  3.5 years ago I had some issues where I woke up and wasn't able to move my joints, this was accompanied by large lumps on my legs. I was 24 years old (Female). I was referred to a dermatologist as they thought I had Erythema nodosum. Over a month or so I was doing tons of blood work and seeing this dermatologist anywhere from 1-3 times a week. I was constantly being told it was something else and being put on new medication. During this month I was also referred to a rheumatologist. Rheumatology and dermatology had a big meeting (?) where there were roughly 50 specialists of different levels in a room (I dont know what its called) to discuss my case because it was extremely rare. I was diagnosed with something called ""polyarteritis nodosa"" which is a rare form of vasculitis. My dermatologist called me with great news that they finally new what it was and then prescribed me.. prednisone (a oral steroid). I was given it for 6 weeks. Over this 6 weeks I started experiencing dehydration, frequent urination, some weightloss, extreme fatigue. I made appointments and saw him on numerous occasions because I felt that this should not be happening and something felt very wrong. He assured me it was just side effects and would send me on my way. At the end of the 6 weeks he essentially told me I was good to go and that I shouldn't have any more flare ups. Roughly a week later I started seeing lumps on my legs again and quickly made an appointment. Without questions, blood work, anything, he prescribed me another 6 weeks of prednisone. He told me he absolutely did not want to see me for 6 weeks and to not come back in. I started taking it and within a day or two all the side effects came back.. and they only got worse. I started losing lumps of hair, losing drastic weight and started blacking out. I would leave class ( I was a student at the time) and then wake up on a couch in the hall 4 hours later. I had lost roughly 35 lbs which was essentially all muscle. I am overweight and always have been.. my legs were the size that someones upper arm should be. I started barely being able to walk because my body wanted to collapse. After 3 weeks I made an appointment. The first thing the doctor said to me was ""I said I didn't want to see you for 6 weeks"".  I started crying and told him something was very wrong. Then he said ""I think you have type 2 diabetes because you are so overweight"".  This came from a doctor that ran 15+ blood tests on me months prior. He sent me for blood work that day and I got a call from the emergency room.  My sugar levels were at 29 mmol/L (540mg/dl). I was kept in the hospital that night and had an IV of fluids going through me. The nurse I had was talking to me and was very confused as to why the doctor put me on prednisone. She went and spent some time reviewing my file. She came back and told me that before the steroids my blood sugar levels were completely normal. She told me that in that meeting with all the doctors.. every single doctor recommended he NOT put me on prednisone because of the risk of type 2 diabetes (Due to the fact that im over weight). I am in the process of retrieving all my files from the hospital. I recently moved out of Ontario to Alberta. My diabetes are pretty controlled but this is still something that will effect me for my entire life. I know it has been 3.5 years but at the time I had no energy to think of anything to do with legal, I was also a student. Now that I am in my career and still need to see numerous doctors on a regular basis I am starting to realize how much what he did has effected my life and will continue to do so. I pay for medications that I should have never needed if it wasn't for him. Although being overweight I am and extremely active, healthy person. I always have been. I played soccer for 18 years, basketball for 5. I was a bike messenger riding 60-70km daily before moving to alberta.. this should have never happened. I need to know if it is worth it to go and talk to a lawyer.   Tl;DR  - a doctor gave me a medication against the advice of roughly 50 other doctors that resulted in me developing type 2 diabetes despite me showing all signs of type 2 and him ignoring. Do I go to a lawyer?"	Yes
"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	Yes
Today I found out Cigna denied part of my FMLA paperwork for a small error on the form that my doctor made.   The doctor failed to include two days I have missed from work in his date range for my intermittent leave for Migraine.   When I spoke with Cigna about this they stated that I can get a second chance, but only because I live in Washington State. Washington State has its own FMLA law. If I lived in a state without secondary protection, Cigna states that they would not reconsider if my doctor corrects the form.   Cigna never called me to inform me of the error on the form, and just denied my claim.   When I brought this up, they told me that they aren’t allowed to call. They also said that the law as written allows them to deny a claim and not reconsider it.   When I asked them where in the law it says they can do this, they mentioned that sections 825.306 and 825.307 of the 1993 FMLA pertain. She stated that it reads that the employer cannot call the doctor to question items on the form.   This section was obviously intended to protect the employee from the employer unscrupulously contacting doctors trying to prevent the leave from being approved under the law, Cigna is trying to make it about them.   I want to get this information out there. People living in states without secondary approval could lose their jobs because of stuff like this. People in desperate situations and in poor health could lose their jobs and their ability to pay for their insurance and their ability to receive care because of this policy by Cigna.   Upon research I read something about a 7 day cure period, and I think my situation applies.   What can I do? I feel like this company is taking advantage of people and it makes me sick.	Yes
"I live in Washington state.  In June 2015, we were on vacation in Montana and my daughter had an accident that required a trip to the emergency room (she grabbed a hot hair straightener with both hands, fully recovered with no additional treatment necessary).  We gave the hospital our insurance information, were discharged and didn't hear from them again.  In April 2017, we got an EOB in the mail from the insurance company saying that our responsibility is the full amount because the hospital didn't bill within our plan's ""timely filing limit"".  A few months later, in June 2017, we got the bill for the full amount from the hospital.  I'm not sure what our next action should be, my thought is that we write a letter to the hospital informing them that we will not be responsible for paying the full bill as it was their neglecting to bill the insurance that caused the problem.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
"Hey guys,  So just to start off this story is very long and I can post more details if needed but basically what happened was this...  I visited a dentist for a general cleaning and during the exam they stated that I needed to remove one of my fillings and replace it with a porcelain filling. They were very persistent and proceeded to tell me that I needed to get this done. I agreed eventually. The filling took over three visits (one month) for them to ""get it right"". During one of my visits they dropped the filling on the floor and I, the patient, found it. All of the visits were the worst pain I've ever felt in my life as if they did not numb me right and the staff seemed very unprofessional.   After the visits were over, the tooth is still in a lot of pain and I have been in pain for over two months. I contacted them and they told me the doctor that worked on my tooth does not even work there anymore. All of these events obviously made me decide that I will be seeking help from a different office and I requested them to give me a refund of the money I had spent on those visits. They are being extremely difficult to work with and I'm concerned I will not get my money back. My question on the matter is do I take them to court if they refuse to refund me?  Any advice would be greatly appreciated and again I can give more details as requested. There were a lot of events that took place that were completely unprofessional and I've never experienced this kind of thing from a dentist.   Thank you so much!"	Yes
Husband had been ill for a few weeks and went to see Dr. Did chest X-ray and confirmed pneumonia-prescribed one week round of antibiotics. Husband went back in 2 weeks later for follow up, not any better. Dr did not repeat X-ray, blood work was abnormal so he was sent for ultrasounds of thyroid and kidneys. Doc never followed up on anything - actually he has never called ever. Husband called and made another appt - still feeling ill and coughing up horrible stuff and wanted to go over ultrasound and repeat blood work results. Came into office coughing up foul smelling phlegm. Repeated chest X-ray and was sent to hospital. Received antibiotics in hospital and was told he would have surgery. Was in hospital for 36 hours-no surgery. Dr came in and husband confronted him about his care and how he felt that he had been ignored. Dr admitted husband was patient profiled as a drug user by appearance. (Husband had lost 15 lbs before he saw dr and told him of weight loss, then lost an additional 10 before last appt. He had also lost a tooth in his 20s due to trauma.) Husband was transferred to another hospital on request. Underwent 4 hour surgery for empyema and then sent to icu. We are still in the hospital.  This all happened in Texas.	Yes
My friend who suffers from chronic insomnia just turned 18, and with the passing of the new medical marijuana law, he thought he'd give it a try. The only problem is his love for shooting firearms. His doctor informed him that he would be barred from ever owning or shooting one if he received his medical card. He is OK with not being able to use firearms during the duration of the time he uses the M.M., but he is worried that he would never be able to own/shoot one again legally. What is the current law on this and are there any ways to get around it if his doctor is correct? Thanks so much in advance.	Yes
I am having a hell of a time trying to find out if this is legal or not.   Does anyone know if a doctors lawyer/legal advisor is allowed to be present in the exam room with the patient, while the doctor and patient discuss the patients medical information/diagnosis, without the patient being aware of or introduced to the lawyer? In California.  In what situation would a doctor do this?   To me it screams guilt/liability but this isn't exactly something that happens frequently so I am unsure. Especially when the patient is unaware of any serious medical issue that the doctor might be liable for.	Yes
The police emergency detained me because they believed I was suicidal. I was in my car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazards on as I was crying and couldn't drive with blurred vision. They took it upon themselves to assume I was suicidal even though I made no indication of it, have no history of mental illness or even a police record.  I was forced into the back of a police cruiser, taken to the ER against my will, and they tried to charge me $2400. I negotiated it down to ~$650 and left. The doctor cleared me after talking to me for 5 minutes because he knew I should not have been detained for anything. I did not even have to see a psychiatrist as the police earlier said.  I'm not sure if there is anything I can do, but I was hoping to find some advice.     TLDR: Police detained me wrongfully, forced me to go to ER, and I am stuck with the bill now.	Yes
My Grandmother is 66 years old and started cataracts surgery June 1st.  They do one eye, wait 2 weeks, than do the other eye.  With this surgery you also get to choose the type of lens you want, and what distance you'd like to see best - near, intermediate, or far. You can choose other options as well, including having a different power in each eye. But she chose to see better near for both eyes.   Both surgeries themselves went fine, no problems. The problem is that now she has one eye that sees up close and one eye that sees far.   We had many follow-ups with the eye doctor - not the surgeon - Who was surprised on the last visit the difference he saw between the eyes and said he was seeing something not the norm but he wanted to wait a few more weeks to make a definitive conclusion as this surgery can take a period of adjustment.   The problem persists, is pronounced, and we believe is past the time adjustment period and seems to have settled. We have the final follow-up appointment next week but we wanted to know beforehand that if the eye exam follow up does conclude that further correction is needed if we need to pay more for that, if we have legal recourse, and/or what we should make sure to do/get/ask.	Yes
"(I understand this is a very complicated subject and it would be impossible to give me any straight answers here.  I'm mostly just looking for insight.  I'm going through a very scary/stressful period and I don't know whether a consultation would even be worth the energy at this point.  Any input at all is appreciated.)  Male  30 years old  So in 2015 I was diagnosed with a severe migraine variant that involves daily episodes of head pain and neurological deficit.  No fun.  This involved a great deal of emergent investigation and consultation with several specialists.  The problem isn't life threatening but it does carry some risk-factors and it's recommended that I keep a close eye on it.  Fast forward a couple years and I move to a new town.  Migraines aren't doing so hot so I set up a new patient appointment with my current provider (a Physician's Assistant).  I bring in detailed documentation of my case and we discuss my problem at length.  I watch her (presumably) enter all of this information into her computer.  At the time she seemed pretty on top of things, referred me to a new neurologist, got some bloodwork set up.  I felt like I was in good hands.  Fast forward to the present day and things are not going very well.  I am having severe issues with my neck and the neurological component of my migraines has become frighteningly pronounced.  My neurologist is booked for the month so last week I report to her office to discuss what's happening.  We decide to order a set of MRIs.  A number of things about the visit strike me as very odd/unprofessional/concerning:  - ""Wait what neurological symptoms?""  She forgot about them.  This was essentially the entire focus of my first visit.  I had given her a printed out description of exactly how my migraine auras present and we had discussed at length how important it is to monitor these because they can mimic some very dangerous things.  She kept this printout.  I checked my records after the visit and it seems none of those things had ever been recorded.  - She insisted the weakness/numbness on the right side of my body was due to a pinched nerve in my neck.  This is despite three different neurologists previously diagnosing these symptoms as brain-related, either migrainous or epileptic in nature.  I explained this to her, which she completely disregarded when placing the MRI order explained below.  - She forgot I have blood pressure issues.  - She prescribed me a muscle relaxer which the pharmacist later told me interacts with one of my other medications.  - She said she wanted a good look at the soft tissues in my neck, but ordered a spinal MRI.  I thought this sounded wrong so I checked with the imaging center when scheduling my appointment.  Wrong indeed.  I had to call her and have the order revised.  - Upon arrival at the imaging center, a confused looking receptionist told me my provider had called at the last minute and changed the order again.  I was never contacted about this.  - When ordering an MRI, the doctor/PA notes the patient's current problem so the radiologist knows what to look for.  For my Brain MRI, the order reads ""Migraine without Aura"".  I've been diagnosed with Migraine *with* Aura for 2 years.  This was established at my first appointment.  It's rather important, because frequent migraine auras can actually leave behind lesions detectable on MRIs.  No mention of the extremely complicated, localized neurological deficits I have such a detailed history of.  - Likewise, my Neck MRI order fails to mention the severe pain I've been having in the front left side of my neck, which was presumably the entire reason we were getting it done.  Instead it only mentions the numbness/weakness in my arm which (again) already has an established brain origin.  I got the MRI on Tuesday.  The imaging center said it would take up to 48 hours for the scans to be read, and then my doctor would call me to let me know what's next.  Friday rolls around and I still haven't heard anything, so I drive over to the imaging center and pick up the reports myself.  They tell me the reports were finished on *Wednesday morning* and I must have missed the call from my doctor.  I triple checked.  I'm signed up to receive multiple forms of contact.  No emails or portal messages or anything.  There are even some abnormalities noted on the report, which I thought typically meant the patient was contacted as soon as the information had become available.  Funny thing about the MRI report, it came back noting I had ""right sided neck pain"".  My pain is on the left.  I don't know who's fault that is.  It's like they're throwing darts at a board.  So now I have these reports that I have to second-guess because my provider gave the radiologist shoddy/incomplete information about my case.  I'm taking drugs that interact with each other because it's the only solution I've been offered.  The diagnosis I spent over $10,000 resolving in 2015 is now being changed by someone who isn't even technically a doctor.  I know I haven't been physically injured by anyone, but does any of this sound like malpractice?  I don't even like the idea of suing anyone, but this illness has caused me a great deal of disability and I am now looking at a situation where I may have wasted almost two thousand dollars on scans that need to be re-done because somebody else didn't do their job.  Sorry for the length of this post I'm just very wound up about the whole thing and have no idea how much of this I should consider acceptable or how I should proceed with handling it.  Thanks in advance."	Yes
"I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.    My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?  What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?"	Yes
"My sister is a resident of California, she recently was prescribed some Vicodin after oral surgery on July 6th, 2017.   In pain still; the doctor during a follow up wrote out another prescription today on the 11th for the same medication except now Target/CVS are refusing to fill the prescription because there is a *new law* that ""covers this medication every 8 days only"".   I'm curious; wouldn't the doctor who wrote out the prescription be aware of this or is this not even a true law?   Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"	Yes
What can I do? I've never been in a situation  like this before.	Yes
Hello,  As the title says, I am on my ex (husband's) insurance plan as a dependent. I am not able to get onto a different health insurance plan without cancelling this one. They say that only the primary account holder can have me removed from the plan, but my ex and I are not on speaking terms. Is this legal? Do I really have no say in this? I live in Canada, btw.  Thanks in advance...	Yes
"Hi everyone.  My father passed away about 5 months ago after suffering a heart attack during surgery to remove colon cancer.  There are a few odd things that happened, however. I've been trying to ignore them, but they've really been bothering me lately.  1) We had all spoken to my father (who was brain dead at the time) and a few of us were in and out of the room. I stayed in the room the whole time, as I didn't want him to be alone. A few of my family members had come back into the room, and as I was sitting there holding his hand, they pulled the plug. It surprised me, as there was no explicit ""Are you ready to pull the plug?"" They just pulled it, and all of a sudden it got quiet. At the time, I figured maybe it just wasn't like the movies and that's how they did it. But now, I'm second-guessing myself.  2) Apparently, I'm the only one in my family who understood that, when we were finally getting to see him after he had stabilized a bit, we were going to say goodbye. The rest of my family understood that we were just going in to tell him to fight through and that we were here for him. So while the plug pulling surprised me, it REALLY surprised them.   3) This could totally be an ICU nurse trying to make my mom feel  better, but the ICU nurse said that while my mom was telling him to fight, he raised his arms and pretended to box. I highly doubt that if he was brain dead, he would've been able to do that.   My dad had leukemia for 10 years and cost his insurance a lot of damn money over the years. I hate to suggest that they were eager to get rid of him, but... I can't help but think that.  Is any of this normal? Is there something odd to this whole scenario?  Thanks so much, and sorry if I rambled or if this is the wrong sub."	Yes
Mom in Ohio is a permanent resident of a nursing home but underwent surgery in a hospital and upon her return to the nursing home requires physical therapy to recover. Medicaid has covered her permanent residency but then Medicare Part A steps in to cover the skilled nursing physical therapy she is receiving post-op.  The question about simultaneous status has arisen because we took her to an appointment outside of the facility (unrelated to the surgery) and we were informed that her status as a permanent resident vs skilled nursing patient matters for billing purposes. They explained if she is covered under Medicaid then they would bill them, however if she is currently covered by Medicare then the nursing home should be billed directly or her personally if the nursing home doesn’t deem the appointment vital.  So can you be considered both a permanent resident and a skilled nursing patient by a nursing home? Meaning the nursing home is concurrently receiving payment from Medicare and Medicaid (the per diem and the patient liability amount).  This is my first post! I am sorry if it is not worded well, I have very limited knowledge of Medicaid/Medicare/Nursing Homes and am learning as I go. Also, I am cross-posting in hopes of getting it in the right place!	Yes
I am a young expat having a US insurance in a country where insurance is mandatory for every resident.  My insurance declined my doctor's request for a treatment for a recently diagnosed life-long debilitating disease.  It simply said that based on the medical evidence provided, the insurance was refusing. No explanation was given.  Basically, my question, what happens from then on?	Yes
She has a pacemaker, and is a 3 time cancer survivor in her mid 20s. She has been in and out of the hospital every month for the past few years. First it was heart issues, and another was breathing problems. She got many heart surgeries, including heart valve and stents. She has had heart attacks too. She barely has any muscle on the back of her neck, so its hard on her to look up while at work.  I almost lost my mom many times. I'm 20, she is 52. All of these problems are from the radiation she endured in her twenties. Recently, she was hospitalized for over a month because she couldn't breath. She had fluid drained out of her lungs, which was a major surgery. She made it through it, and now has to use an oxygen machine at home and oxygen tanks every where she goes.   We struggle financially, and as a college student that works almost 40 hours a week, half of my paycheck goes to bills. She has applied for disability twice, and has been denied twice. I'm in shock, especially because of everything she has been through. And now that she relys on oxygen tanks, it makes me feel horrible she has to still work because she got denied. We did get a lawyer, but it could take up to 2 years now.   Is there any way to fast track this process? Or any place we can appeal this? There is absolutely no reason she should have been denied. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm a Florida resident if that helps.  Edit: we were also denied food stamps, even though we can barely afford food and barely get by with bills. She has lost too much weight since she has been on the oxygen machine.	Yes
"TL;DR: The place I work is gross, and the manager does nothing to prevent it. What do I do?  I work at a local pizza restaurant, and the manager is just awful. I could go on about it, but here's the main concern: I'm pretty sure I got a fungal infection from working with dishes. The area rarely gets cleaned properly (I'm one of the maybe 2 people that uses cleaning products thoroughly), and the proper sanitary supplies are not readily available. Not even gloves. I've been cut working a handful of times, and not even washing/sanitizing has prevented the infection. People clean the dishes they need and sometimes more before the regular dish shift (6 pm to close), and the only sanitary option in the area is hand sanitizer. I'm not sure how effective this is honestly, but I personally spray my hands off, dry them with a paper towel, apply a generous amount of hand sanitizer and rub it in, then wipe off the excess before handling clean dishes. Other people typically use the sprayer and handle dishes doing little more than using paper towels after, and then proceed to wash their hands and continue food prep. This is alarming, because I can only imagine how much bacteria and fungus have spread throughout the restaurant due to the manager's utter disregard for any proper procedures. I will either be going to the clinic today or tomorrow for a check-up for the infection, but I'm wondering who I should contact to fix this. It's gotten to the point that I almost want a doctor's note to limit me from any food or dish contact and stick to driving, but that wouldn't be fair to others. They're unaware of the issue due to inexperience or ignorance. I've had issues with fungus from unsanitary working conditions in a ""high class"" popular Italian chain restaurant before. Any information is greatly appreciated, if you need any other info, let me know."	Yes
[PA] I don't want to give too much away. But doctors messed up and tried to cover their tracks. I need a lawyer but not sure who to go to. Any help is much appreciated. Thanks. 	Yes
I lived in and worked as an RA in a very old building when I was at university. There's one very uneven staircase and one day I fell from the top of it, hit my head, and fell down the rest of the staircase. I had all of the normal concussions symptoms and was diagnosed with one.   I haven't really been the same since then. I've always had bad headaches on a daily basis but I starts sleeping poorly and had more really bad headaches after this. About a year after this happened I basically had a migraine for three months, had to stop school, and developed an eye droop.   No one could figure out what was the matter, I had scans, blood work, etc. They still couldn't figure it out so said it was likely complications from severe headaches for too long. I was put on pills and Botox injections.   A few months after that I began having neurological problems, confusion, memory problems, my handwriting got really small, and I had to stop university for the second time. Once again nothing could be figured out. I had more MRIs and even a spinal tap and nothing was found. Thy said it may have partially been a complication from one of the headache drugs.   I live in pain everyday. I take pills at breakfast, supper and night, I'm just now attempting to finish the degree o should have over a year ago. My life has changed completely. Even though I'm in Canada the medication still costs a lot. I don't get to be young anymore.  A disability lawyer said I might have a case and I'm not sure if it's something I should pursue.	Yes
"My mother was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer's disease at 59, and is now 66.  For the last 3 years she has stayed in an independent living retirement community that didn't necessarily get involved in her day to day life, but generally would let my sisters and I know if she started progressing more quickly, missed meals, etc.  Cut to a few weeks ago, facility contacted my family saying she has started doing some things (nothing violent, just a lot of getting lost, wandering) that will require us to move her and that we should start ""actively looking"" for a new facility, but said there was no large rush and they took our payment for the entirety of this month.  I'll note here that moving any senior into a retirement home with more care requires them take a physical within 30 days of moving and they must have all medical records.  These take a bit of time to get in order.  In short, we felt they were giving us that time.  This morning, my sister receives a call saying that my mother has slapped someone at the facility and they are kicking her out effective immediately.  They told her that because we've already paid through July there is no need to hurry her things out, just her.  I'm out of town for work and the more information I get from my sisters the more pissed I get a this place.  Am I just way out of line with what I think is right vs. what the law is or is there a firm legal footing to protect my mother, sisters and family from one day notice termination and what I see as essentially rent theft?"	Yes
"I am a 27 year old and have been on the ""Healthy Michigan Plan"" through Michigan medicaid due to being a graduate student with no income.  Back in February I received a one-time inheritance payment of $26,000 which would bump me over the limit for 133% of the federal poverty level which is the designated level for benefits eligibility.  My negligence to report the ""income"" change within 10 days indicates that I may be responsible for overpayments by medicaid.  I had been confused about whether the inheritance counted as income and would be treated as such by medicaid.  I did some research and am unsure as to whether the income reporting is annually or monthly.  Since that one time payment, my income has returned to zero. What are my options at this point?  I have used medical services since that time using my medicaid insurance. Will reporting the income now start a shit storm that will require legal counsel?"	Yes
My mother had a heart attack in March and she's been in two different hospitals since then. The first hospital released her to the second with an idea that when she recovers there, she'll go to another rehab facility. She has not recovered and the issues are still going on. (For context, she was told she should have triple bypass surgery which I agreed to.).   I'm not sure what to do legally or personally at all. We have a house and I own a condo. Another hospital that wants to take her for rehab wants her on Medicaid, but she can't get on it because she has assets that go beyond the requirement. I also don't have access to all the financials in any case because I can't get my mother in her current condition, to sign a power of attorney.   Again, I'm not sure what to do.	Yes
Hi Reddit,  A friend of mine when to an urgent care clinic today after having an asthma attack. After they gave him some medicine, followed by blood work, they determined his blood potassium level was dangerously low, called an ambulance for him, and sent him to the hospital.  After some time there, the hospital found nothing wrong with him. His potassium was low because the medicine he was given temporarily absorbed some of the potassium, making the levels appear low when they really weren’t. And now he’s stuck with a hospital and ambulance bill for emergency treatment he didn’t need. (He works in foodservice and doesn’t have a lot of money. Idk if he has insurance.)  Could he successfully sue the urgent care clinic for negligence to pay for the hospital visit?	Yes
"I'm considering suing my doctor for medical malpractice. This doctor works out of  ""Clinic Name LLC.""  What do I need to know in regards to the LLC at the end of the clinic name? Does this mean I cannot sue him for malpractice or is he protected from lawsuits because he works at this clinic?"	Yes
I'm trying to get on disability (height is 4'10 with a few mental disorders that have been left untreated, and 27 years old). The only diagnosis that I have are over 10 years old. It feels like I've developed another disorder as I feel like I can't go outdoors and have trouble completing my job because of this. I know that you have to have documentation of your disorders to get on disability but without insurance, I can't readily get up-to-date diagnoses. What is it that you guys recommend?	Yes
While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell.   I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home.   My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with. While I was at the ER, I told them it was a work related incident and to contact my employer. I received a bill for a little over $500 and promptly handed it to my general manager. I have now received another for a lowered amount, $267. When I received the bill for $267, I sent it to my employer with a note asking what we needed to do to take care of this and haven't heard anything.   I no longer work there because I accepted a position for an internship in another city. What legal obligation do I have to pay the remainder? I don't want it to go to collections, but I don't feel responsible for paying it, either. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have gone to the ER at all. What is the best course of action?  TD;LR: got Tilex in eyes at work, boss sent me to ER, stuck with bill.	Yes
"I live in Texas and I am renting an apartment. I noticed mold on the edges of the vent right around the time where I developed a weird cough. I also allergies, thought they were seasonal but it could be that it was the mold. Anyway around a month ago I told the apartment people that I saw the mold on the edge of the vent. They sent a guy to clean it but he said it was just condensation and that it wasn't harmful. He changed the filter and left. I then decided the clean the ""condensation"" and took out the vent where the ac air comes out from, and saw it was incredibly moldy. The vent was covered in mold, the wall had mold and inside the vent area there was more mold. It was disgusting. I also noticed mold on the vents to my living room and restroom. Since they ignored the mold the first time is there anything I can do? How do I approach the apartment staff? And do I have to continue to live here with this mold problem? I don't think it is healthy to stay in this apartment."	Yes
"Throwaway because reasons but I love this sub and read it daily (probably more than I should) and have learned so much. Hope you guys can help with this.  (Also 1st post disclaimer so if it's formatted wrong, I'm sorry.)  I recently started working at a tiny pharmacy in a tiny town in WA. It is not a ""regular"" (Walgreens type) pharmacy. They make personalized medications and also do not bill any insurance at all. I have worked in many other pharmacies/medical places and all of them have treated anything with any patient info as protected and put it in a separate garbage to be shredded. This place does not. We throw everything, no matter what's on it, in 1 garbage that gets taken out to an easily accessible to anyone dumpster. I'm talking about full prescription labels with name, address, phone, dr, drug, directions, etc. They also write the last 4 of the credit card and CVV on the same paper so that also goes in the garbage. As well as any notes like a temp different address or ""card declined"" or spouse's name.   I am INCREDIBLY uncomfortable with this. If I was a patient and found out my pharmacy was doing this, I would literally never fill there again and tell everyone I knew what they were doing. I think it's a huge breech of trust. I asked my boss why they do that and she said because they don't bill any insurance, HIPAA doesn't apply to them so they can disposed of it however they want. I'm sure she knows the rules but there has to be something that says it's not ok but I'm not familiar enough with personal information disposal regulations.   LEGAL QUESTION- Is there anything I can show her to say ""no, you can't do that""? I like my job but I'm so uncomfortable with this and actually might quit for this reason. You can't tell a patient ""trust us, we'll take care of you....but don't look while we give access to your medical info to any bum who wants to dig through the garbage.""  Tl:dr pharmacy doesn't bill insurance and throws away PHI because ""HIPAA doesn't apply"". Is there anything I can show my boss to say ""stop being dumb?""  Thanks in advance for any insight!"	Yes
My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	Yes
"**Backstory** My wife and I went to visit a friend in Roatan, Honduras in April.  I had to be taken to the emergency room for food poisoning.  While I was getting my stomach pumped, my wife was dealing with the paperwork.  They initially told her it would be $250.  After they saw that we had insurance it got bumped to a $500 ""deposit"",  and as we were ready to head out it turned into an $800 ""deposit"". At that point we were starting to get angry and told them to just charge us whatever the costs were.  We weren't just going to leave them money without seeing an invoice of the charges.  They refused to provide one.     The dude had copies on his desk of my Driver's License and Insurance card.  So I grabbed them while he went and talked to his ""manager"".  When he came back we told him that we didn't want to use insurance and just charge us whatever the costs were.  My wife, being the great fighter that she is, got the ""deposit"" down to $500, cuz they kept on saying that they didn't know how much.  So we paid the ""deposit"" and I left them a copy of my driver's license and my email address.    I don't want to scam these people, they might have saved my life, but I just wanted them to charge me for the services rendered.  **Now** Yesterday, almost 90 days out, I receive an email with the invoice of $5,000.  We spoke to our friend in Honduras and he says these charges are outrageous.  The invoice came from an American company.    My question for a lawyer would be, is there a ""statute of limitations"" on this sort of thing?  Is there anything they can do to me legally?  All they have is my driver's license with an out of date address.    Thanks in advance."	Yes
Hey everyone. I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'm not sure how to proceed. My mother is seriously mentally ill and has been refusing treatment for as long as I can remember. I beg her to get help because at this point she's extremely paranoid, terrified of touching things (germ situation), repeats herself 100x times, and has pulled out all her hair, and sadly, there's even more :( I've tried pretty much everything, but she's ALWAYS been this way. It even had a huge effect on my upbringing and due to that I have CPTSD. She once tried to burn me alive as an infant, and would regularly slam my head into concrete and the tub for things as simple as knocking over my juicebox. I'm afraid that at the rate she's going, she's just going to crash and burn... hard. I have a 16 year old sister too, and I fear that if my mom really gets out of hand, we'll be evicted. She honestly screams 24/7 so I'm not even sure how we haven't gotten kicked out. Due to my cptsd and a slew of other conditions, I'm disabled and can only work a job from home, but that's not enough for me to move my sister and myself out... I was wondering if there was any way the section 8 could be transferred to me or my sister, as my mother isn't stable or responsible enough for this kind of thing and always submits their paperwork MONTHS late. It's like she's trying to go out of her way to get us kicked out. Anyway, I'd like to keep my little sister safe, more importantly. Is there any way we could protect ourselves and our housing as my mother continues to self destruct ??  Thank you, and sorry for the essay... It's just been a LOT :/	Yes
Last year i went into the hospital and was misdiagnosed with the stomach flu, i went home and a week later ended up taking myself back to the emergency room after my appendix ruptured. I ended up needing emergency surgery after the drains didn't work and spent three weeks as an inpatient. I had to drop out of school for the semester and am still having problems. is this worth a law suit? or even a consultation?	Yes
"(suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.  At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.  I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was ""I'll talk to you when I get back"" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule.   Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there.   This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting.   But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying ""I'm too sick to work"" contradicts ""The way you run this place is inhospitable for me"".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there.   What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?"	Yes
"I had 3 teeth extracted yesterday by a local oral surgeon, and after I got home and the numbness began to wear off, I realized that one of the 3 was not one I had asked them to pull. I had a referral list with x rays from my dentist that reccomended 5 for extraction, but included a note that said ""per patient which ones"". I had opted to only do 3 for now since they were patially broken and painful, was going to ask my dentist about options to save the other 2 since they hadn't been painful. Before they started I was showing the assistant which ones I wanted done, and I opened my mouth and pointed to each one. I explained also that I had no clue which teeth the numbers on the list corresponded to, and my dentist had told me to just show them which ones that they would know the numbers. I thought she seemed to understand which ones I meant, but later I realized they pulled the one in front of one I had asked them to pull. It was on the list, but as I said, I wanted to try to save it. I called the office up, but they were already closed and the best I could do was leave a message with the answering service explaining what happened. What are my options for dealing with this? ""I'm sorry"" clearly won't bring my tooth back, and I'm less interested in money than I am in being able to eat as normally as possible again."	Yes
My girlfriends son is almost 2 years old. A few weeks ago he hurt his leg, and she took him the very next day to an urgent care facility. They did X-rays and stated a sprain. A week later he was still showing pain and swelling so she took him to another imaging facility who also stated sprain after additional X-ray. Today she is at Vanderbuilt with him and the doctora there are saying a fracture.  Is there any action that can be taken against the first two facilities?	Yes
My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes
"Good Morning,  I'm writing this as a request to find out what I should do with regards to patient abuse. The patient in question is my father, and below I've copied the draft that my mother, a RN nurse of 20+ years, wrote.  Essentially my father's back was messing up and we had to go to the ER at the VA due to urinary incontinence and met Dr. A.  Dr. A was condescending, told them they should not be there because the ER is for people with real problems, (cancer, amputations, etc), and asked if my father had any bowel problems. Dr.A was told no, and then insisted on doing 2 anal exams. He never washed his hands, did not physically help my father orient himself, barked orders at him while my father was struggling to move, and threatened to send him home because sphincter tone was normal.   My mother questioned Dr.A about the urinary incontinence because our primary care physician told us to come in specifically when that occurs. Dr.A ordered a bladder scan, saw the urinary incontinence times 2, then transferred us to the Harborview ER (Seattle).   Below is the draft letter that my mother wrote to file a complaint, and i was hoping I could get some feedback/help with ensuring that it is received with the amount of urgency that it deserves.  Looking for criticisims/edits/review, as well as legal advice for proceeding forward.   We are located in Seattle, Wa.   ***Draft Letter***  	July 12’ 2017 Attn:  Medical Center Director 	I am sending this complaint in regards to an ER visit for my husband, Patient, on June 18’ 2017.  	My husband was being treated at the American Lake VA since late May’ 2017 for a back injury.  He’d been to PT with a referral in for Neurology and Sports Medicine d/t quickly progressive symptoms.   During the course of 1 week he went from walking independently to being given a cane and then a rolling walker by PT.  We were instructed at the last MD appointment to go to ER if any difficulty with urination occurred or if pain became intolerable.   	On Sunday, June 18’2017, we ended up in the Seattle VA ER d/t 2 episodes of incontinence/retention over the past 3 days and intolerable pain.  I arrived with my husband assisting him to ambulate with the rolling walker d/t him being barely able to stand.   	Dr. A was our ER doctor.  His attitude from the moment he stepped into our room was condescending and dismissive.  He showed nothing but disregard for my husband’s condition stating that people usually come into the ER for real problems such as Cancer or Amputations.  My husband had severe progressive numbness, tingling and pain down his right leg, all of which occurred over the course of 1 week.  He asked my husband if he had any bowel incontinence and was told no.  He then decided to perform a sphincter exam x2 with obvious force with both penetrating entries and no handwashing at any time.  Afterwards he did not wipe the gel off either time but left him there on his side struggling to move in severe pain.   Of note, this is for a man who can’t lie straight d/t back pain and can barely move without assistance.  This was all after bowel incontinence had already been denied.  Dr. A was ready to send my husband home until I questioned him about the episodes of urinary incontinence.  He then decided a bladder US would be in order, which should have been done as opposed to a rectal exam for the initial complaint.    After the US showed urinary retention after multiple attempts he transferred us to the Harborview ER.  On the transfer form he noted my husband to be ambulatory as if he was independent, no note of 1 person assist or ambulatory aide needed.    The end result being my husband was admitted and MRI showed a moderate L5-S1 disc herniation with nerve impingement.  He’s since had a microdiscectomy performed and is now healing.   	I understand many people have back pain, but for Dr. A to be so dismissive of a person is poor practice and abuse of his own perceived power.  He is a bully to the point he is on the line of patient abuse.    I don’t believe this man is fit to work with patients, especially a vulnerable population such as veterans.  My biggest concern are for the patients in the VA system who have no one to speak for them.  Most veterans are not knowledgeable of how patients should be treated.  The treatment and testing from Dr. A for my husband was wrong and abusive.    									Sincerely,  									Patient Wife"	Yes
"Sorry this is going to be a long post. I'm not sure if this is actionable at all but I thought I'd post here and see what people think. I'm a 30 year old male that lives in British Columbia, Canada.  I have been very sick for the past seven years and have officially been diagnosed with an insulinoma. It is a rare pancreatic tumor on the pancreas. This is my story.  In 2010 I started becoming quite ill and went to my family doctor multiple times for a year.  He misdiagnosed me with celiac disease and then after that was ruled out by a specialist, my GP gave up on me.  I decided to take matters into my own hands and in less than an hour of researching online I discovered that I most likely was having multiple hypoglycemic attacks a day.  I went back to him and got several requisitions for blood work checking my glucose levels, and sure enough I was right.  My blood sugars were ranging from 2.7-4.1 mmol/L after meals and throughout the day, which is dangerously low. The most common form of hypoglycemia is reactive hypoglycemia.  The treatment for this is eating healthy and exercising, which I was already doing.  At the time I was a personal trainer studying kinesiology and extremely fit with about 8% body fat.  Because of this my GP ruled out reactive hypoglycemia and his diagnosis was insulinoma, an insulin secreting tumor on my pancreas which made perfect sense to me.  I was then referred to an endocrinologist for further help.  The endo did standard tests to check my liver and kidney function and to make sure I didn't have cancer, and then diagnosed me with reactive hypoglycemia without doing a single blood glucose test.  I had gone to a dietitian at my local hospital who said my diet was perfect.  I even wrote out my diet for the endo but all he said was to eat better. He said there was no way it could be insulinoma but never really gave a reason why. I then took his advice and ate even healthier by almost eliminating all carbs from my diet except for some veggies, and I got immensely worse and my blood glucose was even lower than before.    I tried to go back to the endo but he refused to see me.  I then went to endo #2 for a second opinion.  Endo #2 saw me for 5 minutes and said it was reactive hypoglycemia, but on the off chance it was an insulinoma he told me to do a 12 hour fasting blood glucose test. The test turned out negative. He told me this would rule out insulinoma, but now that i know more about the condition a 12 hour fast has never been given to diagnose insulinoma. Even when it was first discovered in the early 1900's.  There was always a 48hr supervised fast test in a hospital with strict protocols, which turned into a 72hr fast test, and today basically any blood tests with blood glucose under 3.0 and high insulin, c-peptide or pro insulin is enough to diagnose insulinoma.   Shortly after that I tried every healthy diet i could find, and the only thing I found was that the healthier i ate the worse i got. So I preformed an experiment where I only ate junk food.  The diet was less than 30g of protein a day and over 600 grams of fast acting carbs like pizza, mcdonalds, apple pie, soft drinks, candy, pasta and garlic bread.  For the first time in almost 3 years my blood glucose was normal and i felt relief of all my symptoms for two weeks.  However this was not a reasonable diet, I gained over 10 lbs in a short amount of time and still become hypoglycemic when i exercised.  I demanded endo #1 see me again with this new information and he agreed.  I saw him and told him the healthier i ate the worse i got, but the worse i ate the better my blood sugars were, which is consistent with insulinoma.  He admitted that it made absolutely no sense.  I asked him what do we do now, and he said ""i don't know"".  I asked if he could refer me to someone who could help and he said, no. If i wanted another referral for another opinion i would have to go to my GP and ask him.   Upset and confused by this endo, I returned to my GP and asked for another referral to someone new.  He did so, but endo #3 refused to see me saying that he agreed with endo #1 and there was nothing out of the ordinary about my case. I then luckily got referred to a wonderful internist who saw me right away and told me there was no way this is reactive hypoglycemia. He forced endo #3 to see me.  I then saw endo #3 and he explained to me what reactive hypoglycemia was and how i have it.  He said it couldn't be insulinoma because when my blood sugars were 2.7, my insulin levels weren't high enough.  He was wrong on multiple accounts here.  My insulin level was in fact high enough, and even if it weren't he should have tested my c-peptide during a hypoglycemic event to rule out insulinoma.  C-peptide actually gives a more accurate indicator of how much insulin is being released in the body and is crucial in diagnosing insulinomas. So i asked to go to the diabetes clinic to see if they can help me with my diet, since he was so sure it was reactive hypoglycemia.  I went to the clinic and they immediately said this is not reactive hypoglycemia.  They sent a letter to endo #3 telling him that he has to help me figure out what's going on.  So i go back to my internist who spoke with endo #3 and apparently he reluctantly said there may be something else going on here.  So then I was referred to endo #4 in a different city.  Endo #4 saw me and immediately said that there is no way this is reactive hypoglycemia.  She suspected and confirmed insulinoma after having me induce a hypoglycemic attack and having glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels taken. I saw her in 2015, and the test only took one day.   She then sent me to endo #5 in my own city to do the appropriate image testing to locate the tumor.  Endo #5 decided to do a 72hr fast to confirm that i in fact have insulinoma.  I spoke to endo #4 who said this was unnecessary, but if she wanted to have it done then i had to do it. It took 8 months for her to do the test and get the results and she sent me a letter saying i passed the test and nothing was wrong with me.  So either i'm the first person in recorded history with an insulinoma to pass this test, or she did it incorrectly.     So i go back to endo #4 and she tells me, if she doesn't think i have an insulinoma then she thinks im drugging myself.  She told me that's the only way I could be lowering my blood glucose so low.  So I induced a hypo with high insulin and high c-peptide with a negative drug screen.  After that endo #4 and endo #3 agreed i had an insulinoma.  The interesting thing is that for this test, my insulin was actually lower than the test endo #3 used as evidence to say my insulin wasn't high enough.  This makes no sense to me how he says this confirms insulinoma when previously he said that my insulin levels weren't high enough.   So then after all that I have been undergoing imaging studies and other fun tests for the past several months and they have 100% found the tumor in the tail of my pancreas.  I'm currently waiting for a surgery date to have it removed.    I feel very outraged and angry that it has taken 7 years to figure this out, when my GP and I have told them this is what it was 6 years ago.  Over the past 7 years i've barely been able to work.  I had to quit school and stopped being a personal trainer.  In fact when I saw my internist 2 years ago, he told me my blood sugar levels were way too low to function as a normal human being let alone work, and put me on disability for the past 2 years while we figured this out.  I also ended up having blood sugar readings of less than 2.2 mmol/L, which is considered life threatening.  I don't know if this is worth pursuing legally but I've got time to kill until my surgery so i might as well look into it, thanks!"	Yes
My girlfriend and I went to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico this past week. Went great, until I ate something bad and came down with severe fever, chills, pain, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Worst infection of my life. I ended up needing medical transport and was hospitalized for 3 days, where they pushed all sorts of drugs and antibiotics. Ultrasound revealed my colon was super inflamed, and I had a condition called gastroenteritis. The hospital stay cost $16,000.  We contacted the resort, asking for a refund. We know for a fact it was something that I ate from there that made me sick, since we didn't leave the resort at any time. If they refuse, do we have legal grounds to sue?	Yes
I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.	Yes
I'm not entirely sure if this is a fixable problem, but any advice would be much appreciated!  I had a baby three weeks ago, and we found out that there is something in our apartment that makes it hard for him to breathe. We tried everything: cleaning, laundry, air purifiers, humidifiers, etc. think it's smoke from another apartment, but don't know how to prove it. My husband and I have been staying with the baby at my parents' house for a few days, and he hasn't had any trouble breathing. We took him back to the apartment for a few hours last night, and he started to have trouble breathing again. Whatever is bothering him, it was on all of the clothes we brought back with us until we washed them.   Would it be possible to break our lease without penalty, if we can't live there? We need to find somewhere else to live, but that's not an option if we're stuck paying for this apartment. Our lease isn't up until December, and I can't seem to find anything definitive about options for breaking it. It looks like the management needs to make a good effort to lease out the apartment, if we say we don't want to stay, but I don't know how that will work out.  Thank you so much for your help and advice!	Yes
I'm considering suing a surgeon who is a part of a clinic with LLC at the end of the clinic's name.   What do I need to know about suing a surgeon a part of an LLC company?	Yes
I really need help, please. I don't have insurance and I visited a new doctor May 17 because I have hypothyroidism and needed a new prescription. Upon meeting the doctor (mom as my witness) I explained to him I had surgery years ago and I need a new prescription to balance out my thyroid hormone. I told him I was diagnosed in February. I explained how I had a thyroidectomy and I would need medicine the rest of my life. I also said I just need the proper blood work to determine what MG of Levothyroxine I should take, and a prescription to make it happen. I even wrote all of this on my new patient sheet. I take what I thought was the proper blood test and now I must wait. A few days pass and I get a call from a nurse or receptionist saying my blood work came back normal.. I tell her there is no way seeing that I only had one month of Levothyroxine treatment and before that my levels were dangerously low. She insists I'm fine so I hang up very confused. I call my last doctors office and they also say that is impossible and they must have tested wrong. I call the new doctors office and they tell me I was administered a General blood test. I get a little upset because I specifically told the doctor what I needed and he didn't listen. It cost me about $115 out of my own pockets, no insurance. The nurse goes on to say the thyroid blood test is about $200. I demand the $115 I paid get credited to that, the accountants response is that they already paid the outsourced lab and cannot get the money back. I say it isn't my problem they did that because I told the doctor what I needed and what disease I have and he chose to ignore me. The accountant goes on to say that the doctor doesn't have to listen to me. I wanted to speak to my doctor but the three receptionists and accountant were all I got. I reported this to the Texas Medical Board and they said the doctor referred me to an endocrinologist which is completely false and dishonest. I never spoke to him after the initial appointment, and the nurses or receptionists were insisting I was fine.   Please somebody help me. I don't know what to do at this point. I am untreated and I feel extremely weary, I have no energy because I was left undiagnosed and untreated. I can't help but think of the other people this doctor left untreated, without their knowledge. He must be stopped.	Yes
Hello I am an Expat living in Germany and am legally unable to work due to illness. My doctor here is willing to certify the disability and work with a doctor in the US to help me with getting the TPD Discharge of my student loans. But I don't know any US doctors and I haven't the slightest clue who I can ask. Does anyone have any recommendations for doctors who would be willing to help me? This doctor would have to be willing to communicate to my GP long distance. He or she does not need to be practicing at the moment, just needs to be licensed to practice in the US. Would appreciate any advice on this. Thx.	Yes
So my dad went to the hospital for heart issues this week and while he's home and fine now there was several mixups that could have gone very badly first of all his meds were mixed up with his father's same name junior and senior secondly they had my dad down that he had a stint put in but again that happened to his father like 8 years ago and finally the biggest issue they put a portable heart monitor on his chest they wrote down the number for the monitor wrong and gave the right number to another patient so they were monitoring this other patient as if it were him needless to say if anything had gone wrong it probably would have been really bad so what we're wanting to know is does he have grounds for a lawsuit since nothing happened and B if he approaches the hospital administrators what percentage should he ask off of the bill 	Yes
Good evening, and thank you in advance for any advice. -------- TLDR: My wife had a C-Section and the internal sutures ruptured 8 days after discharge. She had no risk factors, and it apparently prompted the hospital to change their policy or procedures with sutures. Lingering physical and emotional issues remain to this day. --------  In April of 2016, my wife gave birth to our second child at an unscheduled but non-emergency c-section at a major hospital in Iowa. Luckily, both my wife and child made it through the Cesarian section just fine and we were discharged from the hospital 2 days later.  8 days after being discharged, my wife was getting ready for a Dr. Appointment for our child and coughed a few times. She felt a sharp pain in her abdomen, and within a few minutes notices a small trickle of blood coming from the Cesarian Section scar. It was very little blood, and we didn't think much of it until we mentioned it to our son's pediatrician. She recommended we get an appointment to the hospital to be safe, and we did so for later that morning. We discovered that the internal sutures for my wife had rupture, and that she had experienced a Fascial Dehiscence. They rushed her into surgery and several hours later she come out the other side alive, but with a serious road to recovery. All told, it took approximately 2 months to fully heal with regular wound packing and a wound vac.  At the time, her OB (who did not perform the C-section due to it being unscheduled) but who performed the corrective surgery mentioned that this was an extremely uncommon experience, especially considering my wife had none of the risk factors. She indicated that the hospital had switched the type of sutures used in the recent past and that they were convening a board of doctors to discuss my wife's case and changes that needed to be made at the hospital to prevent it happening again. Now, a year later, we are finally starting to realize the seriousness of what actally happened. My wife is still now dealing with some lingering physical effects (significant scar tissue causing her lower stomach to bulger) and she has had significant anxiety going back to doctors or being in a hospital.  We never really considered a lawsuit against the hospital until a family friend who is a doctor mentioned it recently. I'm curious if any of the folks here are familiar with medical malpractice and if this is somethng that would be worth pursuing or discussing with an attorney in Iowa. We have since relocated to a new state, and I don't want to spend the mental effort and spike my wife's anxiety again unless it is worth it.	Yes
Hi all,   I turned 26 this year and got booted from my family's health insurance plan, was making almost no money as a contractor, so I went on Pennsylvania's public health benefits. Two months ago, I got a job offer and I needed to both start right away and move to where the job was, and in the personal tornado of making that happen, I just remembered that I never cancelled my public benefits.   The moment I took the job, I left the income bracket in which I'd been eligible to receive benefits. My health insurance with this new job didn't kick in until one month into it, so I've technically only had 'double health insurance' for one month. The only costs that my benefits have been covering in this overlap period are the monthly rental payments on a medical device I need - it's a cost that I could hypothetically reimburse the state for out of pocket.   What kind of trouble am I in? Obviously, I'd like to take action first thing Monday morning when their phone lines open up and report my mistake, but am I looking at any potential legal issues here?	Yes
As stated I'm having to go in tomorrow at 5 am for an emergency procedure. I had today off, and just left the doctors where I found out. I haven't told my job yet. I'm a front office manager at a hotel.   Normally I wouldn't be too worried, but I'm concerned due to the fact we've just gotten a new general manager, who for lack of better words is a complete idiot. He can't do ANYTHING by himself. He's only been at our property for less than a week. No one on the property really knows how to do what I do on a daily basis. This is what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned since I will be out for a minimum of two weeks- they will replace me. Especially seeing as this is going to make everyone's lives really difficult.  How should I handle this situation with my employer and do I have any rights? All our handbook states is if you require more than three days off you need a doctors note.	Yes
So about 4 days ago my first born was well, born. He was born at home with no health issues although mama had to go to the hospital for a hematoma that was ironed out in no time. After we got home we both had been up at this point for about 40+ hours and were exhausted. He had passed his 24 hour visit with no issues and we were just about ready for bed when my SO asked if his hands were blue. I had told her they looked red if maybe a teensy bit blue and we decided to go to the ER for our new parental Paranoia, after telling them this they brought him to the NICU and said they needed blood, some pee and a 48 hour watch. Obviously we didn't want to but we waited the 48 and as we were relaxing my SO was holding the baby in the chair and he had been angled funny and lost his breath from his head being against the his chest. The doctor knew this but it was shift change so she communicated it to our new doctor, he says 5 more days are necessary even though my baby has been told he's healthy, a good eater, and clean of any infections. Do we really have to wait the 5 days or can we do an alternative and leave. I know AMA isn't allowed but is there any other way?	Yes
Hello - over the last few years, I noticed my skin had been getting progressive worse like I'm really allergic to something.  I've documented the deterioration of my skin the whole time at my doctor's behest.  Over the last two years, I've worked with my doctors to try everything possible - from steroids to light therapy to daily injections.  Nothing worked.  My doctor began to wonder if it was an environmental issue and encouraged me to stay away from my old, musty office for two weeks and see what happens - lo and behold, my skin turned almost back to normal for the first time in years.    I came back to my boss and talked to her about options for me to continue working - I offered telecommuting, working in another office across the street and coming in for meetings, etc.  She refused to work with me on anything.  I'm now taking medical leave.  What options do I have?	Yes
Are there any laws in California about how close you can smoke to doors and windows of residences?    I live in an apartment complex with a lot of cigarette smokers.  I am highly allergic to cigarette smoke (been to the ER, multiple doctors, prescribed inhalers, EPI-pens, etc.)  The number of smokers has gotten much worse in the last few years, and it is negatively impacting my health to a serious degree.  I had to move out of a previous residence for the same problem.    The apartment complex has a small open grassy space with a barbeque where most people smoke.   [&lt;Sexy MS Paint Diagram!&gt;](http://i.imgur.com/5uOE8AX.jpg) It is within a few feet of windows and doors.  People also smoke inside the laundry room and inside the enclosed garage.  At any given time of the day or night there are around 2-4 people smoking.  I really don't want to be one of those people who complain about this sort of thing, but there are lots of children in the complex who shouldn't be inhaling this too.	Yes
I (25F) will be giving birth to a baby boy who is the offspring of my fiancé (31M) in September. Because we are not legally married yet, I have a few questions/concerns over medical legalities.   Basically, I need to know the steps to take in case of something going wrong during birth. I'm assuming, as the father of my child, he would take over the decision making process for the baby if something were to happen to me. Would he have the same medical power of attorney over me if I were to have to be put in a coma or on a life support machine? Or would MPOA go automatically to my parents? I guess my questions are  -Do I need to file some sort of paperwork in case of an emergency with my life?   -Do I need to have a will or some type of notarized paperwork giving him MPOA over our son?   -Should I just inform my parents of my wishes in case of an emergency?   -Am I overthinking ALL of this?   Any and all advice will be considered. Thank you in advance!	Yes
"I have a 4 year old son. My name is not on his birth certificate and paternity has not been established. This is an agreement between his mother and I, I have no custodial rights and they live several hours away. This, to her, prevents me from ""trying anything"" and also prevents me from being responsible for any child support.  I pay half of his health insurance premium through Florida Kid Care to help out.   This coming enrollment period I will be adding my 8 year old son to my insurance, the difference between Emp+Child and a family plan is minimal.   My question is, can I add my 4 year old son which I, on paper, have no rights or custodial duties for to my health insurance while keeping our arrangement?"	Yes
My kids (9 and 8) are doing a dermatology study on a cream of some sort. When the dr approached us we were told they would each receive $650 for about 16 weeks of study, using meds and getting blood drawn. We discussed this with them and they wanted to do it. Upon signing the paperwork we noticed that it said the payment would be $500 for each. My wife talked to the Drs tech about it and she was assured that the payment was $650 and that it would be changed. Fast forward until now and we are being told it is actually only $500 and that we signed for that amount. Drs office isn't willing to do anything about it. Do I have any legal action I can take or are my kids just screwed for trusting them the staff in the beginning?	Yes
 Location: Los Angela's California  I was at a bar last week with some friends and some time during the night I was at the bar getting a drink and when I turned around an extremely drunk man smashed his glass into mine while he wildly gestured about something.   At first I was in shock since he basically smashed a glass in my face but when I looked down my entire right hand was a bloody mess. I shouted and one of the bartenders saw this and called the ambulance. I  was furious with the guy who gave me a fuck of comment before the manager on staff sat me down and helped me until the ambulance got there.   I'm at the hospital and during the exam it was discovered that 3 of the tendons in my hand had been cut and I need surgery to repair them.   The broken career part of the story is that I'm an graphic designer who relies on the use of my hands to do my job. And now that my hand is still recovering I can't work or do anything and I'm concerned about what to do. I don't know who I should call, if there's some way of getting my expanses covered, what I'll do if I can't use my hand well enough in the future and I can't work as a graphic artist anymore.   I'm surviving off the money I have saved and will be okay for about a month and I have medical insurance so that's all taken care of. But I just need advice of if I can get some sort of money to help pay for my expenses and what my options are.   I don't really have the money to pay for a lawyer since al of my savings are paying for everything and I don't have a salaried job since I'm freelance at the moment.   I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes as I'm writing this with my left hand on mobile and I'm kind of dog scared shitless about what to do.	Yes
I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	Yes
Hi,  My wife's employer pays for her health insurance. About a month ago, she had a routine doctors appointment. The doctor refused to see her since the insurance was terminated, unless she paid out of pocket. This also delayed her month prescription of medicine. Now she has a sudden sever pain in her neck, and she called her insurance to see what urgent care she should go to. They informed her that her policy was terminated again. This is very frustrating. Is this a legal or employment board issue? Someone told her to just go to the urgent care and send the bill to her boss. I think that is a bad idea.   Her employer has never announced to the overall company that there has been nonpayment of the insurance premiums. For all we know, they have failed to make payments on time other months as well. My big concern is what if she was in a serious accident or had a sudden illness. We could be liable for all the charges and he full bill if that were to happen.   Any advice?	Yes
Should I be getting my parents to proactively contact the health insurance company to see how to pay or is there some out of this world reason that they don't have to pay anymore? They had cancelled the insurance through calling the Obamacare phone number stating that they didn't realize their insurance had autorenewed and got mail a month later with the results. The result was that we would have to pay anyway but the health insurance was cancelled. We haven't received mail from them anymore, not even a bill. Should I wait until a bill comes in through the mail or should we be proactively calling the obamacare hotline or the health insurance company to get further details?	Yes
"I'm a US citizen who lives as an expat in the Czech Republic and have a huge medical bill in Colorado that I cannot afford to pay, and now debt collectors keep sending my brother notices (I have my US mail sent to him).  Some background: I was visiting family after spending a year in Vietnam and got very sick two days before flying to Europe. I thought it might be a parasite (I previously had one in Vietnam) and was informed by a nurse hotline that only an ER can check for parasites on this short of notice.   So I went to the ER and they gave me an IV drip, did blood work and stool sample, and gave me some meds. They would not give me any sort of figure for how much all of this would cost, not even ballpark. They just said ""it varies"". They were pushing to do a stomach ultrasound and I refused because it sounded expensive. They were very unsympathetic to the fact that I had no US health insurance and that I'd be paying out of pocket.  Now I have a bill for over $5000 that I can't pay. I don't even have any assets worth that much money.  I don't live in the US anymore, although I visit about every two years. What's my best option here? What sort of legal action are they able to take? Do debt collectors do payment plans? Are they able to go after my brother?"	Yes
I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical. When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas. A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call  b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her.  Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request. I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper). *Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty.  *She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.” *Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them. *I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored. *I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.) *I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy. *My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic. *My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call. When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy. Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.	Yes
Hello r/legaladvice and the Reddit community as  whole. First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.  Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al’s devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.   Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?   What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?   Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?   Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.   If there's any questions I can ask or information you guys need please let me know and I'll ask Al. This is so early on he's still dealing with the emotional blow. Btw I did ask permission to ask for help on his behalf so long as it was anonymously.	Yes
"Hi Reddit Lawyers. I need some advice on my case. Backstory:  April 2016- I injured my hamate bone, fracturing the hook. I did not know this until May, when pain persisted and I went to an Ortho. I had X-rays and an MRI to confirm the fracture. My ortho elected to wait for the bone to heal. Fast forward to July. Still have pain, went back to the same ortho but with a hand specialist. He also had me wait and did not perform an excision. By August, the pain was still there and I would not heal. After X-rays and a CT, we decided to excise the hamate hook. (I was told I could immediately get back to sports and life as soon as the incision healed, but that story kept changing as I followed up the procedure and had pain. Being told I could participate quickly is something for another time).  After waiting a few months with no activity, my wrist was feeling ""better."" I was not having the same pain. On July 3rd, the same pain came back. After X-rays, MRI, and CT, it was shown that my hamate hook was still there. Only half was removed. The same fracture site existed with only the tip missing in the images. I went to a new ortho and recently had the rest removed.   The standard of care for this injury is to excise the hook immediately based on my research. Non union rates of the fracture are as high as 90%. My new ortho also said that they do not even talk about letting it heal, that went out of date 20 years ago. The go to is excision. This is also coupled with the fact that the surgeon stated he removed the entire hook in the op report. He ""completely"" removed it and said he examined the fracture site- something not possible because the original fracture was still there. Apparently, all he did was cut the tip of the bone off. This, obviously, caused me to have a follow up procedure to fix that issue.  So I had to wait in pain and not continue my life, which was wrong to begin with, and my surgery was incorrectly performed. I spoke with a lawyer and was basically told my case isn't big enough for his firm. I plan on getting a second opinion. I would like to know what you guys think. If I can't find representation, should I send a letter to the original ortho? I would include what happened, what had to be done, the images from the CTs clearly showing the hook still there. Maybe compensation? What should I do? Thanks in advance!"	Yes
"Hey guys, I'm kind of freaking out cause it looks like my eyes will never get to be 20/20 and I'm out $4000+ due to my current situation..  This kind of a long drawn out process, so I’ll just put everything in bullet form in chronological order:  •	December 2016: LASIK (using Contura laser) performed by doctor A. Result is ok, no longer have to use glasses, but not even close to 20/20.  •	March 2017: Go in for a check up and doctor A suggests an “enhancement” surgery  •	March 2017: Enhancement performed  •	June 2017: Go in for another check up, vision still not improving, doctor A suggests another enhancement.  •	June 2017: Wary of third surgery in the span of 7 months, I ask doctor A for medical records so I can get a second opinion.  •	June 2017: Get a second opinion for doctor B. He says my cornea has now become too thin for any more surgeries. He says that doctor A over corrected my astigmatism during my first surgery, then tried to correct the over-correction during my enhancements, which did not work.   •	June 2017: Share with doctor A what doctor B told me and recorded the conversation with his consent. Doctor A said that doctor B doesn’t know how to read the provided medical records because doctor A is using the “Contura” laser which doctor B is not familiar or had training with. **With ultimate confidence, he went on to say that with one more enhancement, my eyes will be 20/20 and will not require any more enhancements for the rest of my life.**  •	July 2017: Get a different second opinion from doctor C. The doctor echoes the opinion of doctor B and further went on to say that my cornea could be unstable at this very moment due to the two procedures. She said that due to my cornea thinness, there cannot be any more work done on my eyes now and for the rest of my life. Off the record, she went on to say that doctor A has a reputation in the community to perform reckless procedures and that the claims that he's making about how other doctors can't read his ""Contura"" laser is all ""bullshit"" because she has part of the Contura training as well.  At this point, I have lost all trust in doctor A and don’t think I’m going to not share any more information that I’ve gathered. I am definitely considering moving forward with legal action. Do I have a case? What do you guys suggest I do? Do you guys have any recommendations for a lawyer that can handle this kind of case in San Diego?  Thank you!"	Yes
We live in a more remote region of Canada that has a full sized hospital. Our family doctor routinely cancels appointments on us and wait times to see them are upwards of 6-8 weeks. My wife was victim of a massive infection after the birth of our child that was apparently very easily treated had she been seen 3 months after the birth as intended. Her doctor cancelled and rescheduled every 3 months for a full year, causing the infection to grow to the point where she was bleeding for a month straight.  Our doctors have cancelled and rescheduled almost every single appointment we've made for the last 2 years often resulting in wait times of 2-18 months to be seen for potentially time sensitive issues.  I was told to wait 2 months to see my family doctor for surgery follow up while I was actively bleeding from my jewels. Do we have any kind of legal recourse here? We're tired of getting constantly dicked around by the terrible healthcare services here.  Do we have any recourse? Is there anything we can do short of contacting elected representatives who are actively slashing healthcare budgets in our province and likely not to care about this anyways?	Yes
"My Uncle was recently admitted to the Hospital in Houston and it took the Hospital 3 days to contact us, his family, because he was dropped off by a woman claiming to be his spouse who did not show back up until today wanting to pull the plug. We believe she is an illegel immigrant who has another valid marriage in Mexico, sorry for the lack of details I'm trying this as fast as i can because of the situation at the Hospital at the moment, he is located in Houston Texas and my aunt just made it to the hospital. We don't know who this woman who is apparently his spouse is, but we suspect it's some prostitute who was trying to become a citizen. What rights do we have as his family, can we stop her decision? Will she inherit everything he owns as he has no children?  What can we do as his family, nobody wants to unplug him except for his ""spouse"" who NOBODY know who she is."	Yes
I'm trying to get some advice for my roommates sister, and I only have the basic run down. Her sisters son died from Bacterial Meningitis, and was sick for about 2 weeks before it happened. They were controlling it with Motrin, but his fever got worse and they took him into the ER after a couple days of him not improving. He had a 103 fever upon arrival, and they just told him to keep giving him Motrin and released him. They never ran any further tests finding out that he had that, and the next day he continued to just not really wake up, and continued to look in bad shape. They took him into another hospital the next morning after being released from the ER, and they wound up admitting him and had to put him on life support that same night. 24 hours later, they pronounced him brain dead.   I just don't see any way the ER should NOT have admitted him, and possibly been able to save his life. Would they potentially be on the hook for this?	Yes
Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	Yes
"Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.   As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her.   I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked.   When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me.   Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes.   and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record.   There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.  Thank you. TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it."	Yes
Hello,  I was terminated from my job on April 24th this year.  I knew my health insurance was good through June 1st in which case I used it.  Since then, I thought my family was uninsured while I wait for benefits from my new job but I've received an updated insurance card from a new insurance company (Aetna switched to United Health Care) and my wife called them and they did, in fact, say that all of my benefits are active.  I have also never received any termination paperwork or COBRA information in the mail to this day.  My question is can I still use these benefits even though I think the company has no idea that they are paying for them?  (They are an extremely unorganized company with nobody looking over financial matters, so I think I may be slipping through the cracks.)	Yes
Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
Hey, this may be a dumb question and if I'm putting it in the wrong place please let me know.  I went to a new doctor who started me on a prescription for a new medicine to counter some side effects of another medicine I take. The new stuff actually started to help, a lot. For the first time in a long time it didn't feel like my stomach was trying to eat itself constantly. However, they put a typo on the prescription--they prescribed 15 pills at one dosage, and 15 pills at a second, but the second half had the typo and the pharmacy couldn't fill it. No big deal, they have 15 days to correct it, right? Totally wrong. The pharmacy called them 2-3 times in the first week, and faxed the request over as many times. I spent all of the next week calling, leaving voicemails, and never hearing back. Finally Thursday, the pharmacist got a verbal confirmation it was being sent over that day. I called Thursday and got the same confirmation. Nothing. Then Friday morning I called and told them that it needed to be in ASAP so I could pick up that afternoon, because I only had one pill left. They assured me it would be sent to the pharmacy within the hour.  Pharmacy again got nothing. I tried repeatedly to get through to them again and when I finally got someone on the phone, was told that it was still waiting for the doctor to sign off on it (the girl from the morning had told me she'd messaged the doctor but either she didn't do that, or the doc just didn't bother) and she'd gone home for the day. It's a controlled substance psych med, so the pharmacist wasn't able to even give the one pill to bridge the gap, even though they had the original prescription with that stupid typo.  So today has been an absolutely awful day of being sick, having stomach pains way worse than they were before I started this miracle medicine, and just generally wanting to curl up and cry.   I'm already looking for another doctor, and gave them honest reviews on Yelp and Google, but honestly with their other low reviews (I didn't even check first, was referred by a friend who didn't have as bad a time) I don't think they care to make improvements. Is there something that can be done to fine them, or somehow bring to their attention how badly they communicate? At this point I just don't want them to screw anyone else over like they did me.   Thanks everyone, and have a great night.  TL;DR doctor jerked me and pharmacy around for 2 weeks and messed up on a prescription for a psych med, caused massive frustration and a day and a half of feeling awful. Can anything be done to make sure they don't keep doing this to patients?	Yes
Hey everyone~ using a throwaway account for this. Please let me know if this is the right place to post or if there's a similar post I may reference.   So I became disabled recently (off the clock) and found out I'll need surgery which would leave me immobile for the next 2-3 months, and won't return to an active lifestyle for another 8 months. Because my job is high physical activity I am in the process of claiming disability and my employer has been extremely helpful. Since I also live in a walk-up in an urban area I can't access my apartment safely without supervision so I decided to stay with my mom in a different state until I can have the surgery.   The problem is I didn't have insurance at the time of the disability so I've been having to pay out of pocket for MRI/X ray and Doctors visits to make sure I would really need surgery, out of the state I live in. My insurance kicks in next month so I'll have to wait until then to get the surgery, unless I want to pay over 10k out of pocket. I can't yet make an appointment for the surgery because I'm not insured yet, even though I will be at the time of the appointment. I get it, it's a legal issue. There are a lot of 'should haves' in this scenario and I am to blame for why this is spiraling. I'm gaining back control of the situation but it's going to be a longer process now. However, this is not where my issue is.  I went to urgent care and paid out of pocket so I could get referred for an MRI and specialist. Okay. Did that. When I saw the specialist I asked specifically if I would be able to work and how long would it be. He said absolutely not and that it would take up to 8 months to recover, post-op, back to my high activity level. My employer then suggested I file for disability. When I spoke to the office again they said they wouldn't fill out my claim because I'm not getting the surgery with them and that it could be a legal issue, however when I pressed them on why they didn't really give me a lot of information. When I spoke with my employer's insurance company they said they just needed the word on whether I could work or not, and that the surgery dates could be figured out later.   Then, I tried going to the urgent care to see if that first Doctor could fill out my disability form (since he was the one who referred me and scheduled the MRI etc). His receptionist said that it would take up to 2-3 visits, possibly more to get the claim filled out ($150 per visit!). It's literally one sheet of paper asking if I can work. That's it. The MRI is proof enough I can't and I have my medical forms from the hospital. When I asked why she wouldn't give me an explanation, all she said was it would take time to fill out the paperwork (but doesn't know exactly how much time) and that we could see a specialist if I needed it that badly. I am at a loss. I'm in the process of finding my own specialist and surgeon in my state and that's become a wholly different issue otherwise I could've had that provider help (and will if none of this gets figured out but time is a factor with paperwork) ...  Can the hospital refuse to sign the disability papers because I'm not having the surgery with them even though they told me I will absolutely need surgery and won't be able to work?  Can the urgent care doctor ask for an unknown amount of medical visits just to fill out one piece of paper? I feel like I'm being price gouged.  I know this is my fault, yes I should've had insurance and yes I should've seen a doctor in my state immediately to start the process of finding a specialist. I really did not think my injury was  going to need surgery at the time and thought I could just heal my way out of it. I'm learning a hard lesson this month and paying out of pocket for it. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you	Yes
Hi all,  so rewind to about a year ago when I began taking some medicine to remove a foot fungus in the. During one of my last treatment visits in January 2017, I saw a different podiatrist for the first time due to my other podiatrist being out of the office. This new podiatrist may have had an issue with my appearance or something because he did not really address me at all and seemed annoyed by my presence. He did not talk much even though I had asked him a lot of questions about my progress. He takes a quick look at my nails and then proceeded to cut my nails very low, despite my painful cries, without warning me or asking me to do so in the first place. After which he writes me a script for some bogus prescription that didn't help and left without saying anything. Fast forward to May 2017, and I start to develop very uncomfortable pain in one of the toes trimmed down low. Apparently, the low cutting of the toenail resulted in an ingrown toe nail in eventually both toes. A preventative measure to this is to soak your foot in salt water to help the nail grow, but my previous podiatrist did not mention anything about that.   The ingrown toenail proceeded to get infected, and resulted in the last couple of months of alot of pain, discomfort, expenses on medical supplies, and many trips to the doctor. I really find this podiatrist culpable of all of these issues, especially since the other podiatrist I saw before him did not think it was necessary to cut the nail so low, and has been coaching me through the entire process.  Can I sue that podiatrist I saw in Jan for cutting my nail too low and not giving me any advice after to prevent ingrown toenails?  Are their lawyers out there willing to see this case considering there won't be a lot of money involved?   Thanks for any legal advice you can provide!	Yes
I've been seeing several doctors lately and for privacy reasons, I'd rather my employer didn't know about every time I see a doctor.  Can my employer see the times or dates i saw a doctor? What information would they have access to regarding my health or doctor's visits?    Is the simple fact that I visited a doctor considered private under HIPPA? Thanks!	Yes
Not sure if this is the right thread, off sick due to a very personal issue because of stress (no I'm not bluffing it's real), I originally wanted to go back to work however my GP advised me not to. Now I am undertaking therapy and don't think I am ready for work but knowing the nature of my company they will do everything to get me back. What rights do I have? Can a OH Nurse overturn the sick note?	Yes
Hello everyone I'm in a bit of a bind. I called a doctor's office to set up an appointment in January. I made an appointment and they told me I needed a referral. I told them to cancel the appointment and call me when they received the referral. This was all in the same phone conversation.  Here it is 6 months later and after sending two referrals, they never called. I received this bill last week for $50 for a no show appointment. I cancelled that appointment and even if it was still an active appointment there was no reminder call/text/email which I opted for.  So, I call the office and get an answering service. She directs my call to the office manager who does not answer. Her answering machine clearly stated that of the call was for a no show bill to submit in writing. So these people send out these bills so often that she needed to put that on her message. I left her a message stating who I was, why I was calling, and asked for the address to send this letter to. No call back. I've called several more times and still nothing.  I've really had it with this office. I looked at their review on Google and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue. They have horrible reviews and some very similar to my experience.  So, what is your advice?   Thank you so much!	Yes
Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if any more information is needed.  Thanks in advance!	Yes
TL;DR- Got lost in the health insurance system due to a glitch; now have a wisdom tooth tearing up my mouth and want to know if it's okay to get medical help despite being in an appeal process   So! Back in December of 2016, I applied for health insurance via NY State of Health and uploaded my tax returns as proof of income (I'm freelance). I was then told I hadn't given enough information of proof of income despite uploading my tax return, so called the phone line to ask what more I needed to do. They told me tax documents were enough, it was a glitch in their system, and they would contact me when it was all settled. In February I hadn't heard from them yet, so called again to check in---was told once again that it was a glitch and they would contact me shortly.  Fast forward to now--I still hadn't heard from them, but apparently have a wisdom tooth that decided to show up in my mouth last week and wreck havoc (constant pain, hard to eat, hurts to swallow, all that fun stuff). I called the office again to check in, was told it was a massive error on their part and they got me set up to pick a plan (which I did), except it doesn't start until August--I cannot make it much longer like this, one week has already been hell. I then requested to file for backdating due to an urgent medical need, which was denied (not sure why entirely, more than willing to call and ask for specifics if that's helpful).   I can expand on all of this further if the wall of text hasn't already been a turn off, but the basic questions I have are:  -now that I'm filing an appeal, is it okay to still get my tooth removed or does that hurt my standing in the appeal process?  -if I win this appeal will I be reimbursed for whatever costs my dental would've covered (if it's kosher to remove the tooth)?  -is it terribly stupid to not have someone to represent me for this telephone hearing?  Thank you for any/all help and hope everyone is having a wonderful Sunday!	Yes
I think it seems obvious in hindsight these meds where a problem but when your unwell and in a psychiatic settig you tend to take meds like it or not and i didnt associate the increased meds and pain fully until lately. It wasnt until i read about Akathisia that i noticed this is what i had been suffering. I just want to sue because this has bankrupt me and ruined my life and could have been avoided if a docter had just noticed these very negative side effects and stopped the meds.	Yes
"Location: Colorado  I'm in my mid-20s. My mom was recently served with a ""Petition for Dissolution of Marriage"" document by my stepdad. I went over to talk to her about it, and she started handing me things to bring back to my place. These include legal documents for the ownership of several valuable horses that she owns ($20k+) as well as two guns that she uses for horse-mounted shooting (if it matters, they're crippled guns only capable of shooting blanks).  I have a suspicion that this was the wrong decision, but I just took the items from her and put them in my car because she was crying and I just didn't know what to do in the moment. She also tried to get me to take my half sister's passport (she's a minor), but I refused to take that.  What sort of legal risk am I at for being in possession of these items? I believe the Dissolution of Marriage document states that she's not allowed to hide assets."	No
We are divorced, obviously. I have primary custody and he has visitation that includes two full weeks in the summer (one in June, one in July. We live close to one another so I often help out sometimes during his time when work emergencies or what have you pop up. My schedule is way more 9 to 5 than his and we both care deeply about our child so it works out the best.   My family owns a winery so I have some amazing local wines around the house.   My ex is vehemently against drinking on principle.   I don't drink around our child at all but I do drink when he isn't there. Not all the time but often, either socially or alone.   This past week was his week. Because of this, I was trying to fit in some training at work to keep my professional license. It was pretty intensive and boring and by the time I got him on Thursday, I was exhausted. I had a glass of wine and then checked in with my ex to see how our child was doing. I try to check in at least once daily by text. Sometimes, since we live so close, our child wants to come home for the night or come home early from his week so I always like to check.   I didn't get a response back so I had another glass and ended up falling asleep on the couch. I am not a particularly heavy sleeper but I hadn't gotten a lot of sleep the night before and I had just had two glasses of wine so I slept heavy.   I awoke the next morning to find a ton of texts and missed calls from my ex-husband saying our child wanted to come home. They had apparently stopped by and knocked on the door for a good 20 minutes and I hadn't answered.   I feel bad that I missed the texts and calls. I feel bad for not being available. I even feel bad that it could have been a legitimate emergency.   But it wasn't.   I called him the moment I woke up. He didn't answer so I drove over there to see if I could help with the issue and apologize for not being available.   My ex-husband was very upset and understandably our child was sad that he couldn't come home.   I did get my ex-husband a copy of my house key to help prevent that sort of thing going forward but it doesn't seem to be enough.   He threatened to call CPS because I am the primary parent and was not available. He said I admitted to having a bit too much to drink (I said I had two glasses of wine not too much).   Apparently my son wanted to come and had been upset and cried a bunch while they were waiting outside.   I just now got a missed call (I was in a meeting) from someone who wants to talk about a complaint that was filed with their office regarding my child.   Do I need to call them back? Will they just call back? What do I need to say?   I am completely lost here and could use some help.   I do have bottles of wine in the house. They are in a child lock cabinet and he can't work a cork screw but they are still there so I can't deny that I drink.   Right now, our child is in the workplace sponsored daycare at my work downstairs and I am worried they will just show up and take him.	No
"So I currently live with two other people, one of them, ""Abby"", is pregnant and recently revealed to my other roommate, ""Brianna"", and I that she has decided to stay living there and doesn't want to move out. Obviously Brianna and I do not want to live with a screaming, crying newborn so we decided to get our own two bedroom.  We were able to find something very quickly and want to move asap since Abby is due early September and we are worried about it coming sooner. We are on a month to month lease and both gave our 30 day notice. Ideally we would have liked to move out mid August and get half the last months rent back but landlord said no so we decided to just eat it.  Yesterday the landlord (who is also a lawyer) emailed us the following: ""Please be advised that you both have given your notice but this does not remove you from your obligation to pay rent should the monthly amount not be paid.  You will remain jointly and severally liable for any rent owed until a new lease is signed.""  So he's saying that if Abby doesn't find someone to move in by September first we still owe the rent??? How is that legal? Abby should be the one that has to pay our rent since she couldn't find anyone to move in, right? Please someone help me make sense of this...  We are in Massachusetts btw if that changes anything"	No
My grandfather has dementia and my mom and him set up my mom to be his financial and medical POA. Located in Illinois.  It's been 4 years and my mom has slacked completely. She hasn't done his taxes, some bills have gone unpaid, and last but not least his debit card bounced because she didn't transfer money to it (really confused him and was a bad day).  I'm not sure my mom wants to give up this title but it's at a really bad point. It won't be an easy conversation but something needs to be done.  What are my best / worst case scenarios?  Thanks.	No
"So yesterday my girlfriend called me all excited because she bought a new car from a used car salesman. She told me the contract and it is absolutely horrible. She's a young girl (21) and went in and told a salesman it was her first time buying a used car and he pulled the whole ""oh it's easy I'll walk you through it"" and took advantage of her.   Her contract is absolutely awful. They have her paying about $17.5k for a car worth maybe 7k. She has a 65 month contract with 9% APR. I told her that she got screwed over and to use californias 48hr used car cooldown period to void every contract she sign. Well she just sent me a picture of her signature on a contract opting out of purchasing a cancellation for her contract. She's got amazing credit score as well if  that helps anything.   Is there anything we can do to get her out of this contract and prevent her from buying this POs car for almost 3x it's worth?"	No
"Hey folks.  My family just moved into a new apartment and today it will be exactly a week.  Before move in we noticed the light in the fan wasn't working in two different rooms but the lady showing us the place told us not to worry they would be fixed before move in.  Move in comes along and they're still not fixed but we figure it's not a big deal we don't need them and they'll be by to fix them at some point.  Then we go to do laundry and discover the brand new dryer in the apartment isn't working so I take a peek behind it.  It probably is new because they never bothered to hook it up to anything hence why it's not working.  We called and informed the leasing agent immediately of these problems then handed in the move in paperwork that you fill out any damages/problems at move in and included both issues.  We have called every day since then and every day we've been assured that maintenance is coming that day to fix these problems, and every day they have not.  Now we honestly don't want to rock the boat here because it's hard to find an affordable apartment complex here that you aren't likely to get shot by.  But I was wondering if it's reasonable to ask for prorated rent based on the value of a working washer/dryer.  I was digging through our lease and found this about repairs, *""We'll act with customary diligence to make repairs and reconnections. Rent will not abate in whole or in part.""*  Now obviously this states that they won't prorate rent at all, but I figured it can't hurt to ask if there's a legal definition or whatever for customary diligence and if over a week without the working appliance would be considered breaching customary diligence.  At the end of that day we're not going to fight this if it's not a black and white yeah you can ask for that and see what they say kind of thing.  As like I said, we don't want to rock the boat."	No
My girlfriend, and I are thinking of moving in with my parents in Colorado to focus primarily on school. Right now we're working full time while going to school full time in Nebraska, and it's way to much work... however we're running into big problems regarding in-state tuition in Colorado.   To my understanding I would qualify for in-state tuition because my parents both live there, and have for multiple years. However she has no relatives up there at all. We thought maybe she'd be able to gain residency there, but it seems like Colorado is very difficult. From my understanding she wouldn't be able to gain residency or in-state tuition till she is 22 years old, or considered emancipated. This is because in Colorado you're considered a minor until 21 years old, and your residency is based off where your parents are located. We've both been completely independent for 2 years, living together for 1 year.   Sorry for the poor format I'm at work, and trying to be fast. I'm basically wondering 1. How can my girlfriend get in-state tuition without having to become emancipated 2. What does becoming emancipated include? would there be reasons not too? 3. Is there anyway around these strict in-state tuition rules that are legal? Thanks everybody in advance.	No

I'm a flight student that was referred to an airplane owner to purchase a 10-hour block of flight time.  I was sent an invoice from the owner's LLC.  I wrote a check made out in his name and sent it to him.  In a short amount of time a few life things happened and I decided to stop flying.  I let him know that I was no longer going to use the flight time and requested a refund.  No contract was signed, and no policies were announced at the time of sale.  He is saying he will not give me a refund.  Can he keep the money forever whether I use the flight time or not?  I realize I did send the money and enter what I assume is a sort of contract by the fact that I sent a check in response to an invoice.  I'm curious if I can sue for my money back or if I'm just hosed.  I'm in Virginia.  Thanks a lot for any advice.	No

"I currently attend a University in Oklahoma and I have been living in the same rent house since last June--a little over a year now. My ""landlord"" owns a popular local bar near campus and is known to be very wealthy and very friendly. A couple of my friends worked for my landlord a while back and had to go pick up a couple items from one of this guy's ""storage houses."" They asked him (my current landlord) if they could move into the house and live there, to which he obliged on the condition that they signed a lease and did not mess with his stuff he was storing in the garage. Fast forward a few months and he had only asked for rent payment for the first few months and never did for the rest of their lease.   The June after their lease ended (and they moved out) my new roommates and I tried to contact him to set up a meeting time to sign a lease, however, he bailed last second and told us he would call us when we was ready, but that we could go ahead and move in. We waited all summer and he never called us about a lease so we've been living here for over a year now. He never asks for rent and we just pay the bills. We know that he knows we live here because he still sends us letters reminding us to keep the thermostat up over winter break and the lawn service still comes every other week. Moreover, he never brings up the house or our living situation when we go to his bar.   I guess what I'm asking is, what exactly are my rights? I've hypothesized that he's using this house either as some sort of tax write-off so he doesn't really care or that we just scored the deal of a lifetime. I figured I'd ask because with the Fall semester coming up, I'm extremely stressed that he'll come kicking down the door out of nowhere and I'll be having to move out in the middle of the semester."

I am 6 months pregnant. I applied for WIC to help with basics such as milk and eggs, since I consume a lot of those and we are currently functioning on one income (my husband's). We were married last October and although I plan to take his last name, we have not gotten around to doing that yet. All of my identification still says my original name.  The first time I went in, the woman who registered me with WIC assumed that my name was changed, even though all of my identification had my original name. When the vouchers printed wrong, we immediately told them and then they reprinted with my correct name.  When I went back for my follow up appointment today, it happened again. I called and somehow they said they have no record of my actual name. So they could not have corrected the error in their computer system, just reprinted the vouchers.   When my husband looked more closely, he noticed that the middle initial is also wrong. Looking up people in our area, we found that the name they have given me is an actual other person here.   We don't understand how this happened; I provided original social security card, photo state ID, birth certificate, and a host of other documents with my correct name, SSN, and birthdate on it. But it appears they have filed me as a completely different identity and have been dispensing my vouchers as such this whole time.   The situation is even stranger because they told me they are connected with Medicaid. But my medicaid card has the correct name and birth date on it.   I am wary of this situation because I have a separate legal issue (fraud case relating to a small business I formerly ran) currently going on that my lawyer is working on getting dropped. It is unconnected to WIC, but I really do not need anything that was not my doing looking fraud-y right now.   So I asked WIC on the phone if I could come in tomorrow to have it fixed and they said yes. But 1) I have no idea of how to make sure they actually fix it this time and don't just reprint it while keeping me linked to another person, and 2) I asked if I could get anything in writing documenting the error for my personal records and they seemed hesitant, said they'd have to ask a supervisor. I do not care whatsoever about trying to get anyone fired, I just need something that clearly indicates this was not my doing. I don't know what is and is not legal regarding government institutions such as medicaid and wic, but it doesn't seem right if any blame for this falls on me because I cannot obtain from them any proof that I gave them 100% original, correct information from the start.   I would prefer to just not have WIC at this point, but we do need it until I can go back to work.   In case I need it, how can I - 1) obtain some kind of proof that this was not my error, and 2) Ensure that they have my correct identity on file?	No
"So I'm not sure what to do as I have never experienced something like this before.  I waited for the walk sign to turn on and went when it said to.  This girl was taking a left turn and ran right into me.  She stopped and asked if I was okay which I replied, ""I think so."" Because I was in shock, I probably didn't do everything right.  She gave me her business card and left.  A couple of witnesses called 911 and stayed with me.  The cop said she did everything right and that it was an accident, although she was at fault.  She said the sun was in her eyes.  My question is, do I have any grounds to get compensation for the anxiety this accident has caused me?  I already have bad anxiety issues and this has exacerbated it.  Also, I had to spend 6 hours in the ER, I am assuming her car insurance is going to foot the bill?  Any suggestions for next steps are greatly appreciated."	No
So we are both early middle age, and overall I see this as great news since I can afford it, and probably wont have kids another way.  She has a lot of family help available and both of us have family roots keeping us in the area.  We want to coparent.  Mostly, my question is: am I foregoing any rights by not  lawyering up at the moment?  So far, it has been amicable and I would like to keep it that way.  What should I consider in terms of legal options?	No
Our landlord lives in another state and will be in town this weekend.  He wants to see that the mower does not work, our bathroom sink is actually leaking, and hopefully to fix them.  However, he wants to come while we're at work.  Is this legal?  He has already tried to change the due date for rent from what his lease specifies; he does not seem to know landlord laws very well . Thank you!	No
Within the past month (sometime between July 7th and now), the cost of housing in my dorm listed on the ASU website was increased by $69 a semester. The amount listed, before and after the change, was explicitly listed as the cost for the 2017-2018 school year. This change in price was well after a late cancellation fee of $500 was in effect (the fee slowly ramped up, reaching the full $500 on June 20th).  At the end of the previous school year, to sign up for housing, we had to agree to [this](https://housing.asu.edu/sites/default/files/2017-2018_license_agreement_-_ftf-ret-upp.pdf) housing agreement. Part of this agreement does say  &gt; The Arizona Board of Regents, ASU, and/or designated facility management companies reserve the right to change room rates and other charges and fees if circumstances require adjustments.  Is it legal for ASU to change the amount they charge for housing after a cancellation fee is in effect?	No

My friend is going through a contentious divorce right now. She has asked me to give a deposition and possibly testify for her. I really want to, but have an underlying concern holding me back.   They both have a history if drug use, and I have smoked pot with both of them in the past. The things she wants me to testify about have nothing to do with drugs, so I guess my question rests with the likelihood that I would be questioned about my own drug use and what the consequences would be. Is it possible that testifying to that could mess up job, adoption, or similar prospects for myself down the line? Also, my friend seems to think I might get drug tested for agreeing to be a witness. Is that right? I really just want a clear understanding of what I'm getting into if I agree to do this.    Do they drug test witnesses in situations like this?	No
I'm a 17 year old, extremely smart (not bragging) O-levels student studying in Pakistan and currently in Bahrain for summer holidays.   At the age of 11, my parents took me out of school and put me into a Quran teaching institute for 5 years, during that time I got extremely depressed with having the same routine 7am to 12pm and 3pm to 7pm everyday for 5 years.   Every year I tried to convince my parents to let me go back to school but they never agreed and just beat me, until the 5th year when they realised I wasn't interested in finishing the Quran and it was getting too late.  After that I spent the next 3 months finishing the 5 years worth of syllabus of 5 subjects so that I could get into school. After 3 months I moved to Pakistan to live with my brother (who turned out to be a sadistic asshole)and left my family behind in Bahrain.   My brother wanted me to get into the 8th grade of the Pakistani education system but since I was 3 years behind my former classmates, I went behind his back and barely got myself into the first year of O-levels.  At the end of the first year, I topped all of my subjects getting all A's and A+'s except I math and ended the school year with certificates in Business, Economics, Accounting and English for the best student of each subject over the year. I did all of that in my first year of school after since the 5th grade.  After that I was still behind my former classmates who were in the 12th grade and I asked my brother to let me skip one year of school and get myself into the 3rd year of O-levels straight after finishing the 1st, my brother didn't allow me and gave me no reason as to why he didn't and said I should take my time, so once again I went behind his back and got myself into the 3rd year of O-levels all by myself. I had to finish the whole 2nd year syllabus in 2 month and, after I was done with 2 subjects out of 5, my brother caught wind of my plans to skip a grade and took away my laptop, phone and everything else knowing I needed the internet to study as I had no teachers.  so now I'm stuck. I opened up to my mother about how my brother treats me and how he's an asshole, and she replied by beating me and telling me how I disrespected my brother. Now my only option is to go with whatever my brother has planned for me which is gonna ruin my future. I know I have great potential. The students who got the same grades as me in 12th grade as I did in 10th are getting into top universities like Stanford, Harvard and Pennsylvania on full scholarships and stipends. It's been my dream to move to the US to study an to pitch an amazing app idea I have that has impressed many of people but my parents would never allow me to move there because of religious reasons and other reasons.   Other than my education, I had breathing problems for 10 years from the time I was 7 to the time I was 17 and my parents never took me to a hospital,this year, I convinced one of my brothers to take me to a hospital where I was diagnosed with either Bronchitis or asthma (full diagnosis would be done if I visited a specialist which I probably never will).  I just want to know my options, what can I do to leave my abusive and careless family behind and move to another country? If I have the option of getting into some education programs abroad I would have no trouble getting into them because I have exceptional grades in all my subjects. I have a lot of potential but I'll never be able to achieve it if I stay with my family.	No
Basically, my sister has a dangerous lifestyle. She into doing crazy mountain climbing challenges. She has two sons, and the children's father have died doing the exact same thing. Losing her is a reality that I worry about. I also worry about my nephews who I can't abandon if something happens to my sister.  Can I take a life insurance policy with myself as the beneficiary in case she died, so that I have the means to take care of her children? I'm assuming the premiums will be high due to her lifestyle but it's a small price to at least not having to worry about the financial aspects of her getting herself killed and leaving her children with nothing.  We live in Montana.	No
When looking for car insurance recently I decided to see if using slightly different descriptions of my profession impacted the quotes the companies gave me online. It did, but I noticed that after getting a few quotes my quotes increased, even when the information I provided remained constant. This lead me to suspect that the companies I was recieving quotes from are using information from the cookies on my browser to increase their quotes for insurance... Is this even legal? I am in the EU if that helps...	No

I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?  I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.  I asked this earlier, but it got no response and was buried.

She came home from Banff Pregnant, Had a Daughter named “M”  Soon after Fell in love with a man we will call “Bob” whom took to M as his own. Moved them both into his home. He had a problem drinking and about a year in got in an accident causing bodily harm. He had also impregnated my sister with “L” They tried to avoid jail by going into detox voluntarily but come the court date 6 months later, Bob got 6 months in jail. My Family was at their home keeping it up while he was away. No Help for his side of the family. Both sides of the family supported him with zero ridicule. He has been sober for 6 years and my sister was his rock.  L was born, my parents again were there to help, no sign of Bob's family. Two years ago they had twin boys. This is where I believe postpartum depression poked its ugly head. M is 8, L is 5. Again not to repeat myself but my family is now there everyday helping, while Bob’s family doing as little as possible.  This is where the story gets dark. My Sister tried to killer herself with pills. She’s taken to the hospital,they run tests ect. Immediately admitted to the Mental Wing. Now the Children's Aid Society is involved.  I’m not living in the same province, I fly home to visit her in the hospital where she will reside for 2 weeks. If you’ve ever been in a Mental Wing one thing stood out she did not belong here. While she was in hospital Bob family all of the sudden had to help with the kids. She was no tint here for a week and Bob’s Aunt had papers for my sister to sign basically giving up custody of her children, thank goodness my parents were there to read the documents first. And they were not signed. Next the Van Bob’s mom Co-signed for needs some repairs that are to be covered by insurance but tell my sister that the only way to get it fixed is to sign over the van to Bobs mom. (Bob can not drive until 2020). This is obviously wrong she ended up just signing a different piece of paper from the insurance company saying they can pay for repairs. Keep in mind this was while she was in the hospital.  My sister finally gets out of the hospital, can not live at home because of the Children Aid Society rules she must have an additional adult present for visiting her children. These restrictions are to be lifted soon and she can move back home with her children, she is currently living with my parents.  But wait there's more since she has been living away from the children, Bobs family has had to step up and help alot more than ever. Is going to get a whole lot more bizarre so here goes. Bobs mom has taken the keys to the van and will not give them back forcing my parents to take two vehicles to pick up the kids because Bob will not let them in the house. They have packed up all my sisters things and put them on the porch one night, i advised them they can not move out of the marital home and to leave the boxes there. They have recently changed the locks to the Marital home leaving my sister without a key. Bob has also asked for a separation. All of this sounds bizarre but it's real, Bob’s family has completely turned against my sister when she needs the help and support the most.It all feels like set up now. They are dictating when she can see her kids &amp; implementing their own rules that accommodate themselves and no one else.  Financially they are not in a good place, They do get the tax benefit from having kids which pays for the van &amp; the rest she sends to Bob to pay for the marital home.  My questions are, can she move back home when the Children's Aid Society has removed their restrictions? What happens if she does not? Is this entrapment?  Can they legally do any of this? What’s the fastest way to get legal aid? We don’t know what her rites are  I'm not a real good story teller, please take it easy.	No
I'm not actually involved in this, but people from my university are posting online asking questions and for advice.   A new apartment complex has been under construction and was offering tours in the spring. They leased out rooms telling people they would be ready to move in by September 2nd. A friend of mine actually toured the place and asked what would happen if the building wasn't completed yet and was simply told that it would be and was brushed off.   Tenants received an email today stating they won't be ready by the move in date and have two options: they can either delay their lease to December 29 and receive $1500, or cancel their lease outright. Either way the tenants need to suddenly find new housing fast.   This is in Minneapolis, MN, and I was just wondering what the policy on something like this might be. Can the owners really lease out rooms that aren't built yet and fail to provide by the move in date?	No
Hi, thanks for taking the time to open this up.  We're looking to rent in London and had an offer accepted for a house, the agent then asked us to transfer the holding deposit via email. We transferred £700 now the agent says the landlord is considering other offers. Do we have any legal recourse? Are holding deposits binding for both parties?  Thanks again.	No
I can understand if someone quit and you need to cover a shift, or it got busy before you where about to leave, but;  The store I work for closes at 10:00 PM everyday besides Sunday, of which we close at 8:00 PM. The company has distribution centers which ship products to their stores - Which is fine.  What's not fine is that they frequently schedule these shipments to arrive at 7:30 PM or even 8:00 PM - When we close.  Typically, I'm pretty laid back and wouldn't care, but these shipments take *at minimum* one hour to just unload, not put the items where they need to be.  I'm just thinking that there has to be some kind of rule that prevents this. They should either rethink their logistics or schedule for tomorrow.  **Tl;dr**: I, and everyone else, am being kept working well passed store closing ours by same companies (seemingly deliberate) shipment scheduling.  Is there anything I can do about this?  Location: Iowa, USA.	No
"My Fiancee and I were on driving back home from Montreal to NJ yesterday morning, July 30. Literally around 10 miles after crossing the border from Canada back into the US, I got pulled over for speeding, 80 mph in a 65 mph highway (I-87). My question is if it's worth it fight the ticket, whether driving back for the court date or hiring an attorney. A few bullets below:  * Last speeding ticket in NY was like August 17, 2014. * Had a speeding ticket in CT in Feb 2015, but it was reduced to a ""traffic violation"" * I live right by NYC, so it would be a 5 hour drive to the local courthouse. * Worried about the fine/points since it would technically be within 3 years of my last conviction. * As stated, it was 80 in a 65. * I was driving with a couple of cars near me on a Sunny, clear morning. * I was driving in the left lane and slowed down once I saw the officer.  So what do you guys think, would it be worth it to fight it, or just pay it and plead guilty?"	No
I'm trying to enroll my child in kindergarten. I attended pre-reg in April and provided my lease and copy of utilities. All utilities are in my name. On lease my name is listed under occupants, but my step mother is the primary lease holder. (She signed for me 2 years ago when I first got back to the US because of the employment gap.)    Received letter stating that I am required to appear with the primary lease holder in person on a specific date/hours next week for her to sign an affidavit saying I live there. Apparently this is a new county wide requirement put in place specifically to [irrelevant opinion.] She cannot be here for it. She can't leave work and she lives out of state. They said she can't have it signed and notarized not in person. (She has never lived in the apartment and signed online. Basically my guarantor or whatever.)  I called the school board and they said a wordier version of too bad and that she has to come. Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated. I'm assuming I have to miss work and show up alone, but do I have any leg to stand on to get her enrolled?  Don't they have to enroll even homeless kids?	No
"Hi everyone. My 3 roommates and I sublet 2 rooms in an NYC apartment. Our ""landlord""/roommate agreed to renew our lease until the end of the year. We do not have this documented, only in a Facebook message. Our current lease ends on August 20th. On Monday, while he is in Russia, he sent us a Facebook message basically saying he may not renew his lease at this apartment and we may all have to move out by the end of the month. He did not give a reason other than that he is involved in court case currently and depending on how that goes he will either move or stay. We then came to find out he was or is being sued by the official landlord of the apartment. We aren't sure, though, if that is the case he is currently involved in. Our rent was due yesterday and we did not pay it. We didn't pay it because we need money to put towards our new apartment and he has a significant security deposit from the three of us. Also, he revealed he put our security deposit directly into his PERSONAL bank account, not into a separate one, which is what the law calls for I believe. He is now insisting we pay our rent saying he can't take it from the security deposit. We are not sure what to do about this situation or what our options are. He is still in Russia and should return by the 10th to appear in court. Thanks for any advice you can offer."	No
"Hello everyone,   I'm primary custodian and both the Dad and I have joint legal custody. Dad has married so our child, ""Sarah"", has a StepMom. Sarah is 11 years old and is at Dad's house about 3 days a week.   Here are some examples of what Sarah is fed at her Dad's house:  -A single hot dog for dinner  -A single small turkey sandwich for lunch (no mayo)  -One piece of pizza for dinner  -A granola bar for breakfast   She also has told me stories of being yelled at by StepMom for sneaking a piece of cake at birthday parties.   It's important to note that Dad/StepMom are weight obsessed. StepMom is very underweight and Dad makes multiple comments about how thin women, a la Audrey Hepburn, look best. They think Sarah is too big because she has a small stomach. Sarah is not overweight (per Doctor) and the stomach is something normal that happens before puberty for many girls.   When I try to speak with Dad/StepMom they claim they offer Sarah side dishes but she won't eat them. Sarah, while admittedly a picky eater, says this isn't true.   Sarah has developed a very skewed vision of herself. Keeps telling me she's fat and now works at losing weight (she's lost 4 lbs). I'm EXTREMELY concerned about her mental health. However I'm not sure if this qualifies as neglect because they are feeding her, just not much. Thanks for any and all advice."	No
Got caught with a drink at a bar and i'm underage (18) the cop took me outside, wrote up a citation and left a number for me to call for a diversion program before she sent me on my way. I was also given a court date. If that number can't help me and I go to court, what punishment should i expect? Do i need a lawyer? I violated section 4301-69(e). Feel free to ask questions if i left anything out. A friend bought the drink and I had no fake on me	No
"My brother is a horrible sociopath and drug abuser. My mother has been one of those mothers who has been blinded by motherly love in the past, and has enabled him for the past twenty years. But now it has reached a point where she fears for her life. So last year she took out a restraining order against him.  However, whenever the police take him away... they seem to release my brother from custody after a few days. I don't actually know the law, but I'm told that my brother is classified as mentally-ill by the state, and according to the law, they cannot hold mentally-ill in jail. So over the past several years one of three things, happen... they release him to a homeless shelter, or the county hospital, and one time even a church. And from there he is released, and able to come back to my mother's house where he starts the abuse, and the cycles starts all over again.   In the past, she would even bring my brother home herself because, even after physical violence, she would say ""he is still my son and I love him"". But because the type of drugs he abused got harder and harder, and the physical, mental, and financial abuse got worse and worse, she finally was able to get a restraining order against him.  However, my brother has found another loophole to this restraining order law: Police can only remove people violating a restraining order if they are outside the house. What he does is hop the backyard gate and sneak into the house. According to my mother, the police have told her that they can no longer remove my brother if he is already inside the house.  My brother currently has a case against him for violent abuse against my mom, but the next court date is in late September, but I fear she won't last long in her current state.  My questions:  1) Am I misinformed in that mentally-ill persons cannot be kept incarcerated in California? If that is indeed in the case, what options do we have to forcible keep my brother away from my mom at least until the court hearing date?  2) Can the police really do nothing if my brother is already inside the house on the restraining order?  3) Can a restraining order be made null and void if my brother argues that my mother voluntarily took him back?"	No
Long story short, I met a woman on reddit from India, we have been talking for months, and well obviously hit it off. We decided it may be best for her to come to the US so we can get married, and so she can get treatment for a particularly rare mental illness. As I understand it the best way to do this is on a K-1 visa. Now here is my question. How do I go about proving that we actually have a relationship? We have been communicating on Skype for a few months, but I would really not want to print out those transcripts because it talks a lot about the mental illness, as well as other personal things. I am going into my senior year of college, and can't really afford a lawyer, although should be able to pick up a job in a years time. This is also hopefully, when this plan would come into place. Still would prefer to not hire a lawyer because of the expense however. Should I make a new Skype, and only talk to her there about things we wouldn't mind being printed out, and used as evidence of a relationship? Can customs ask to see her phone, and look through everything? I know I am supposed to meet her in person once for the K-1, and when I do I will make sure to take plenty of pictures. Anything else I can start doing now, before next year?	No
Hi everyone,   Me and other tenants digitally signed a lease at the owner's insistence while we were out of state.  He never provided a copy of it with his signature. We need a copy as we are currently seeking a lawyer to help us with understanding if he is in breach of contract regarding something else, but we need the fully executable lease for the lawyer's help.   Questions: Is the landlord required to provide tenants with a copy of the lease with landlord's signature?  If the landlord is refusing to provide, what options do we as tenants have?Would a lawyer actually help us to receive a copy?  Thanks. Have learned a lot from all the mistakes we made during this current lease term.	No
"Per our lease, rent is due on the first and late after the fifth. We pay rent with SSDI on the third of each month, without exception. We've never paid late. On the second of each month, everyone gets a ""Notice to Quit"" on their door, not just us. Landlord says it's normal business procedure and refuses to stop, but I've rented for decades and have never encountered this before. It's insulting and intimidating, and it feels like harassment. Is it legal?"	No
Landlady lives above me. Her apartment flooded due to her toilet overflowing which spilled into my unit while I wasn't home. ~$500 in damage to my personal property. I have renter's insurance, but the deductible for personal property damage is $500 and I'm moving out in around two months already. Am I just out $500? What do I do?	No
"Okay I'm gonna tell you all the details. I am 18 and I was charged with domestic violence and assault. Domestic violence is false because the lady who I have an assault charge on thought for whatever reason that I was choking my girlfriend out, which never happened. My girlfriend and me were arguing and she threw my stuff out the window, so we continued to fuss and I kind of had my hands flailing in the air and I was faced towards my girlfriend in the car, opposite of the windshield. I told her there was a lady coming and I didn't want her to hear us arguing but she didn't care. So the lady ended up running to the car and she yelled get off of my girlfriend. I told her this isn't her business and my girlfriend told her I'm not doing anything to her. The lady then pepper sprayed me and it got all in my eyes and hair and neck.   Me and my girlfriend were both in the car coughing and choking on the lingering spray, so we had to exit the vehicle. I'm panicking because I can't see anything at all so I hurry to grab my stuff and get it back in the  car, then I walked towards the lady (she's in front of our car)  to get around to get in the vehicle and she tried to get her pepper spray again so I covered my face and I tried to grab it from her but, I'm still barely able to see and my face is burning and numb at the same time, and she accidently fell since I got too close to her. I got in the vehicle and my girlfriend noticed someone recording and I got out the car and I ran over to him and slipped, got back up and ran and asked why he was recording. He said because he can and I called him a racist because of the smirk he had on his face looking at me. I didn't do anything wrong to my girlfriend or that lady, yet I have these charges, and my girlfriend has already talked to the state prosecutor, but initially she told them I grabbed her wrists(and that's already considered domestic violence) when police first talked to her, but that's not how it went, we were just arguing like any normal couple, and now she doesn't say that but it's already in the police report so how can we go about her saying that to that we were just getting loud?    I'm about to go to my third court date because they keep stalling,  adding more evidence for themselves and now they're trying to get me for bail violation because I called my girlfriend in jail. She's literally the only person I talk to and the only number I knew by heart. I had to talk to her to get a hold of my dad and that's the only reason I ever got bonded out. They only have two recorded 14 minute conversations and my lawyer said I said something about not caring about staying away from her or some bs like that, and he told me that the way the judge and prosecutor thinks, they just look at the police report and go ""oh this guy choked his girlfriend and hit an old lady yep he's a bad person"" but little do they know I have never even been in trouble before and I am not a violent person whatsoever, me and my girlfriend are happily in love and have been for over 4 years, I'd never lay a hand on her, and I have so much respect for anybody, even people that are mean, because I'm too nice of a person.   Now they're going to have a jury selection and I have to talk about my bail violation in a few days. What can I do to make them not put me in jail for that?"	No
Okay, so I was born a dual citizen of Taiwan and the US. I live in the US, but has come back to Taiwan for the summer.   On the morning of the flight, I realized my US passport has expired for many days, and the lady at the checkout counter told me to use my Taiwanese passport at customs. (Usually, I used US passport at US customs and the Taiwanese passport at Taiwanese customs) I've renewed my US passport in Taiwan, but the issue is that I don't know whether to use my US or Taiwanese passport when I return to the US.   If I use my American passport, would TSA question me for not having a record for leaving the US? On the other hand, if I use my Taiwanese passport and apply for a visa, would the process be complicated by the fact that I already hold an American passport?  Thanks.	No
Something new and different for me. A couple of weeks ago I get a call from a lawyer whose name I don't recognize.  Apparently I don't remembering him.  About ten years ago my parents sold their house. At the time both were ill and in a nursing home so having power of attorney I signed everything at the sale.   The call was asking that I sign a deed because not all the property was properly signed over in the sale in 2008. He says he represented my family in the sale. After giving it some thought I vaguely remember my parents lawyer not wanting to handle the sale and recommending someone else. So this guy is probably legit.  He asked that I call the lawyer for the current owner (that bought the housed in 08). Same lawyer then as now.  So I did.    Talking to lawyer number two, who I also don't remember, she tells me that lawyer number one reopened probate, without ever notifying me. While I have a feeling that's probably just fine it kinda rubs me the wrong way. So number two asks of I can drive to her office and sign the papers. No, it's out of my way and it's her problem not mine. I tell her where I work (three different locations in a 10 mile radius) and tell her to call me when she's going to be in the area and I'll try and to meet up. She suggests someplace else.  I again tell her where I am during work hours and suggest she call me.   Week goes by I don't get a call.   Now lawyer number one is back in the picture. He left a message saying he just needs one minute of my time. He's stopped by my house unannounced twice missing me both times.  Maybe it's just me but that kinda bothers me. Leave me alone on my time. I've got some health issues and on tough days/weeks I'm completely exhausted at the end of the work day and just want to be alone and rest.   It's my nature to want to be a nice and helpful guy. But I'm also uncomfortable being asked to sign legal documents without completely understanding any possible implications. A lot of the time I feel like I'm physically and financially just barely keeping my head above water. I just can't handle any additional complications in my life. Do I just sign or do I ask them to please leave me alone and to fix their own mistakes?   Thanks for any insight or suggestions.	No
I gave my friend money to lend and believed her story. Today, I thought I was dropping her off to see her mother, but I drove her to pick up heroin from her drug dealer. I had no idea this was happening, and I'm scared and worried for the child. The grandparents are likely to get CPS and the police involved.   I just would like to know what to expect from my end; will I be called in to give information or have to testify in court, if it happens? What is the process involving opiate addiction and pregnancy? Will I get in trouble?  Thanks.	No
So I have two separate issues, both of which would require removal and re-pouring of my 3-car driveway. I'm wondering if I should be looking for a lawyer to represent, or if I will have to pursue through small claims court. Unfortunately, if I bring it to small claims as a single case, it would exceed our $5k maximum award.  &amp;nbsp;  FIrst: My rain gutter drains onto the middle of my driveway (between 2 garage doors). This winter it was a constant sheet of ice. I had two neighbors slip and fall on it. Similar houses in our neighborhood have the rain gutter going directly to a french drain and draining underneath the concrete instead of running across the top. I was told by the person who did my walk-through that the foreman probably screwed up and forgot to have the rain gutters done before the driveway got poured. Of course that wasn't put in writing during our warranty walk-through. I spoke to my insurance agent and they tell me that since I know about the issue, it's my responsibility to be sure that drainage isn't making my driveway icy - I'm not sure if this means that if there's a lawsuit because of it, that they'd refuse to cover it?  &amp;nbsp;  Second: The top of my driveway has spalled and chipped off very badly. I recorded a video this spring where I was able to chip off large pieces of the surface with just my fingernail. The concrete damage is significantly worse where the ice was covering the driveway. I think my driveway was also poured in the winter, and may have frozen before it cured.   &amp;nbsp;  So if I want to sue for replacement of my driveway and correction of rainwater drainage, what's my best route? I'm worried I won't be able to find a lawyer who'd take on such a small case. I'm guessing the cost of repairs would be about $15k - $20k maximum. If I can't find someone to take the case, could I split it into two separate small claims cases and pursue it on my own? Other options? Thanks - I know concrete is a tough issue, even my builder says they don't warranty it... even though they're constantly tearing it up and replacing it all over my neighborhood on houses they've recently closed on.	No
A friends grandmother has split her will among her four children. However, her daughter (my friends mother) died before she did. By this point the grandmother was senile and could no longer change her will so she died with her will unchanged. My friend would like to know whether she inherits the money willed to her mother or the remaining three children split the money between them.   Thank you for your help	No
This morning, I found a notice that eviction had been filed on my door. I immediately went to my apartment office with the letter and showed her my bank statement where the rent was paid. She immediately determined that this was in error, contacted the law firm that files evictions for them and will have them dismiss the case. I am relatively comfortable that this will be done. She seemed panicked that it happened.   My questions is, should I be looking for something other than a dismissal? At this point I feel like having an eviction filed then dismissed could be an issue for future background checks. Also, I would assume it appears as if I failed to pay rent, then paid it as a result of the eviction.  Am I being too passive by allowing them to dismiss it? Should I be looking for a different resolution?	No
"I am on a lease with my adult daughter. She has also had her own lease for a year since she turned 21. I am listed as head of household. Due to circumstances I am ""transferring"" my lease to a one bedroom because I can no longer live with her. The management office has assured me that I am allowed to do this whether she agrees or not bec I am head of household. If she doesn't move out at the end of the month, management said they come and change the locks so she is forced to leave. My question(s) are 1) can they legally do that or do they have to go through an eviction process? 2) If they do have to go through eviction is that in any way tied to me? I have a new lease and have been assured that the old lease will no longer exist after the 31st. PLEASE help...I need to make sure that if she has to be formally evicted that it will be on her record only?? Thank you"	No
Are there any rules that the tenant board has in place for buildings being responsible for bikes stolen from their bike storage rooms? If more info is required, I'm from Waterloo, Ontario, Canada.	No
Im Located in Florida, USA. Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old.   My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.   I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.    My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.   This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.   I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!     tl/dr: ex wife keeps winning custody battle even though she knowingly is filling false accusations	No
I currently live in NYC and started renting my apartment in October of 2016. The building that I live in was previously an old boarding house that had rooms and shared bathrooms on each floor. When the building was renovated, the rooms were made into studio apartments. All of the apartments have a living space, small kitchenette area and bathroom fully contained except for mine. Apparently due to some type of structural issue they were unable to tear down a portion of the wall to join my apartment and the bathroom, so the landlord rents it as is with a detached private bathroom and the lease specifically designates it as private. The setup is definitely unconventional, but it is NYC and was surprisingly affordable so I took it. The bathroom door is right next to my apartment door so all I really have to do is briefly step out into the hall. The bathroom is always locked and before a few days ago, I was the only one with a key.   There are four other apartments on my floor, with two on each side of the building. Over the weekend, the opposite side of the building began having plumbing issues. My side of the building was unaffected. The landlord is apparently having a difficult time with repairs and the bathrooms are unusable. On Saturday evening I came home to find that the landlord had given the other two tenants keys to my bathroom without even telling me!!! I called him immediately and he made some excuse about it only being temporary, but it’s now Wednesday and nothing has been rectified. I’ve called him daily since then and he has since stopped returning my calls. I don’t know my neighbors very well and one of them along with her boyfriend has seriously questionable hygiene.  There are already cleanliness issues and I don’t feel like I should have to deal with that. I’ve also gone to use the restroom to find it occupied a few times. I absolutely don’t want to share my bathroom. I would have never signed a lease that didn’t offer me a private bathroom. The bathroom also has a small closet that I was using for storage so I also had personal belongings in there other than your typical bathroom needs. I don’t know what to do. I guess I have lots of questions.  What rights do I have in this situation? Is what the landlord did illegal? Can I break my lease if the bathroom isn’t designated private again soon? Does the landlord owe me some type of compensation for this? Can I tell the other tenants that I don’t want them in the bathroom so maybe they’ll start complaining to the landlord to get the repairs done faster?  TL:DR  I rent a studio apartment in NYC with a detached private bathroom. One side of the building is having plumbing issues so the landlord gave the other tenants keys to my bathroom without asking or notifying me. I absolutely do not want to share my bathroom. What rights do I have in this situation?	No
I'm in Missouri. My boss claims that because of IRS requirements I cannot be paid drive time to our second office. Unless I clock in at our main office and ride in the company car with others. Is this company policy? Or is this actually an IRS requirement. 	No
"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	No

So I am in need of an Occupational Drivers License because my license got suspended until March 2018. So I'm torn between getting a lawyer and paying around $300 so they can get that for me or just going through the process myself! I've been looking up different lawyers and they all basically state it's fast and simple with them and that if i were to go about it on my own, it would cost more. Is that true? Any advice would help. Thank you!  P.S I am in San Antonio, Texas. I don't have any outstanding tickets, warrants or surcharges on my driving record and I have already gotten a notarized SR-22 applied to my current vehicle.	No
Title is pretty self-explanatory, I got into an accident, my rear bumper got ripped off 2 weeks ago and I just got a ticket in the mail for careless driving. The cop did NOT see the accident and the entire encounter was overall friendly. Now I know I can just talk to the prosecutor before court and have it knocked down to unsafe driving but that's a $400 fine that I'd rather not pay if I didn't have to. Since the cop didn't see the accident and the other driver isn't gona show up to court to testify against me if that were the case, so what are my options? Any advice would be greatly appreciated	No
I live in NYS.  My car was stolen while I was at work an involved in an accident before I could report it stolen. The their hit another car and fled on foot.   My question is, am I liable even though I wasn't driving? The insurance company is telling me that I'd have to prove that I didn't give my keys to someone. It's a keyless ignition car, so there was no physical evidence of theft when we recovered it (there wouldn't be, they essentially hacked a computer).  But this doesn't sound right to me, if I'm the defendant in a civil suit, can't I use he negative defense of superseding cause, since I wasn't driving the car? How can you prove a negative? (That I didn't give my keys to someone)  Thanks for taking the time to read and respond!	No
"My sister M is currently 13. Earlier this year, she started self harming and one of her friends reported it to the school. M talked to a school counselor and confessed that she had been molested as a child by one of my cousins. The counselor then shared this information with my family (and the police I assume? Aren't school counselors mandated reporters?). None of us had even suspected a thing and it was horrible for pretty much everyone in my immediate family (no one outside my parents and siblings knew or even suspected). Now here's the part where I want legal advice:  My sister M was 7 when my 16 year old cousin molested her on 3 different occasions. She is now 13, like I said. Even if M does decide she wants to press charges (and I don't think she is currently in a place to feel comfortable doing so), is there like any chance in hell that something will come of it? The cousin who molested her was a minor at the time, no one witnessed it, and while I and my family of course believe M, it happened 6 years ago so I'm afraid there's not any ""proof."" Note: this cousin joined the military out of high school and we have not seen him in years. Does being in the military affect this at all, if charges were to be brought against him? I'm mostly terrified that he will be able to hurt (or has already hurt) other children and, of course, I also want him to rot in hell/jail for what he did to my sister. Pressing charges is ultimately going to be M's decision (with support from her therapist and all of us), but what are the odds that it's even worth our time (ie, will actually go somewhere legally) and her possibly having to see him again in court to press charges?"	No
So I got a DUI in Louisiana. They issued me a temp license. I have not had my first court date, so I'm not actually convicted (I'm assuming). I have since moved to Arkansas. Can I get a driver's license here before my court date?	No
Hello, curious about IP in the US and have a few questions. Whenever you visit a convention (Comiccon etc) there are always a ton of artists selling fan-art.   What's the legality behind that? Is it just a matter of companies not going after small time artists and hoping they don't notice you? Is there a difference between selling a drawing of a companies character in their original costume vs designing a costume with that character in it? Does it matter?  What about accepting commissions to draw a companies IP?  With those out of the way - I plan on selling original artwork of my own design at conventions starting next year. What can I do to protect myself? How would you go about income tax (Specifically MO/KS tax laws regarding artwork sold)or licensing original content? If someone stole artwork from me what would be my best course of action?  Thanks for your help!	No
Six years ago my (now ex) boyfriend and his friend raped me. He had been pouring a flask in my drink all night and when I passed out in his bed he and his friend brought in another girl and tried to get with both of us. She got freaked out and called a taxi and left. My ex and his friend cornered me and his friend had his way with me while my boyfriend held me down.   My ex stormed out the room and called me a whore.   Fast forward to last night, I get a call from his latest girlfriend and after hours on the phone talking about the abuse we both endured with him we found out that he and his friend raped her too in the same fashion.  This guy has a history of sexually abusing women and abusing animals (put a cat in a microwave, gave a small dog a seizure from kicking her across the room, abusing this girls dog to the point where she had to give him up so he'd be safe). He is truly the scum of the earth and there is no end to the carnage he causes anyone in his life, mental and physical abuse.  I may have what constitutes as a confession from him about the sexual assault and his latest gf went to a doctor right after so that may be proof.   Now that I have this girl's experience, I know that it'll happen again and I am wondering if we have a case? There are at least 4 other women I could contact that would potentially testify against him.  Thank you for any advice.	No
I'm 20 and am expecting to go to trial. I had to get a police report in before I could have my car get towed after my collision in which I took a breathilizer and managed 2 points below a dwi (0.06). I have to show up in court in a month.  So now I'm wondering what first steps I should take before the court case's consequences such as getting my license suspended, getting a restricted license etc.	No
At the time (April 2017), while my aunt was under a temporary conservatorship of person and of estate, she hired an attorney (at the request of her alleged financial abusers) to draft and execute a last will and testament. She also had them draft a pour-over will and substantiated judgment, but these weren't executed. This is amounting to $34,000 in legal fees.  The attorney had my aunt undergo a psychology assessment, hired by the attorney. However, she underwent many other assessments before and afterwards, all of which concluded that she is unable to handle her affairs, as she isn't in the proper state of mind after suffering a debilitating stroke in 2015 and multiple smaller strokes and seizures afterwards.

Backstory: I'm transferring from my local community college to go to Cal in the Bay Area. Housing was ridiculously hard to find, so I'm living in a small house split into two apartment units with people I've never met. There is 4 rooms being rented out in the unit I'll be living in, and I was the 2nd person to sign a lease for one of the rooms. All 4 rooms were leased out as single rooms to 4 different people. Turns out there is no wall separating two of the rooms. They emailed me saying I can either rent out a room in the other unit that is more expensive because of it being secluded (which I can't afford), or share the room until a wall is built (they still need to get permits from the city) in a couple months. They claimed that the other 2 people that signed up for singles have already moved in. I emailed them back saying I was not pleased about it, but I'll share the room until they get a wall up. This all occurred about a week and a half ago.  Fast forward to yesterday and one of the roommates that supposedly already moved into his single emailed me asking if I could set up the internet because he will not be moving in until the 11th. I signed up for a room, and also will be moving in before him (on the 2nd). Another email came in and made it seem like the other guy with a single room also hasn't moved in.  So my question is, what would happen if I move in and take one of the empty single rooms? The lease I signed states that I'll be getting a single room to myself and the other room is even 50 sq feet smaller than the one I'd be getting after the wall is built. The rent is only a $50/month difference, but I'd be willing to bite the bullet on that if I had to just to guarantee that I'll have privacy. I don't get why the landlord (which is a corporation) is singling me out for sharing a room in the first place since I was the 2nd person to sign up for a room and will be moving in and paying rent for a longer period than the other roommates.  Could they do anything about me taking the other room since they are already breaching the contract we signed by not actually having a room for just me to rent?	No
I'm 16, 17 in October. I want to leave my house as soon as possible possible after school starts in August. I will have my driver's license and possibly a vehicle then.

She's got BPD and bipolar with mental trauma from being molested as a toddler by her parents, and she's recently been put on new meds which caused all sorts of psychosis and delusions until they kicked in.  Three years ago, her 8 year old nephew was staying the night with her and bugging the he'll out of her. She put half a MG of klonopin in his drink so he would go to sleep. Her new meds are making her feel guilty for all her past wrongs, but she told her therapist about this and was told it has to be reported to the hotline on Monday.   We're in Arkansas, what can we expect? She's on disability and her mental health can't handle jail. I'm freaking out, she's calm.   During a bout of mania she told her sister, the boy's mother, a few weeks ago when she went to the hospital to try to be checked into behavioural health while her meds were asjusting. The mother didn't press charges, and those doctors didn't report it. What is going to happen? It's not like there's proof, and maybe the statute is up?	No
"throwaway account. Apologies for the length.  **tldr:** I am being forced to work again with an HR person who, in the past, refused to do his job and put my physical safety at risk. How do I protect myself this time with documentation in case I need to go to a lawyer? Are there other resources for disabled people?   I work for the Federal government, and my agency is headquartered in Washington, DC.  According to the agency's internal website, we have a Disability Office whose role is to help disabled employees determine reasonable work accommodations with their managers.    **PAST EXPERIENCE:** A few years ago, I was injured and needed ""reasonable work accommodations"" to enter and leave my office building, because it was not wheelchair accessible.  Of the Disability Office, Mr.X, wrote me *in writing* that the office's role was *not* to assist disabled employees and Managers, but to file paperwork for OPM.  My manager and I stopped working with this office and tried to figure this out on our own.  At the time, I was in too much physical pain and not in Washington, DC, so I wasn't able to figure out how to escalate this.   **PRESENT EXPERIENCE:** Fast forward to the present, I have another medical issue requiring ""reasonable work accommodations.""  Against my desire, I was forwarded to the same Disability Office. And then was told I was assigned to work again with Mr. X.  I emailed his Manager and requested a transfer, sharing his prior communication. The Manager disregarded my request, stating the office now cares about customer service, and Mr X is timely with his reports.  Subsequently, Mr. X emailed me, claiming to be ""delighted"" to meet and work with me, and asked me to fill out more forms.    I am distraught that I will again waste precious time and resources to work with Mr. X when I need to focus on my health. But this time, I'm now back in Washington, DC, and would like to be prepared to bring this to a lawyer, if needed.     How shall I best document my interaction with Mr. X, especially if this needs to be taken to a lawyer?  In my reply back, should I acknowledge the past communication? I don't want to lie, and claim I look forward to working with him, because then they could claim that I was satisfied with his prior help.... does this make sense?  Also, are there other groups that help disabled people receive ADA services? Lastly, do you think I have any recourse for the Disability Office's and Mr. X's past refusal of service?"	No
Massachusetts renter here.   I recently had to vacate long time apartment due to sale of the home. Had lived in apartment for 8 years, and was in a month to month agreement with landlord. Received 30 notice to vacate on July 6th, found new apartment and moved out on July 28th.  Prior to moving landlord made some comments about his eagerness to retain my security deposit, which came out of left field, as I've been a model tenant for the entirety of my time renting (rent paid in full/on time every WEEK for 8 years)   When I left the apartment I left 5 larger pieces of furniture (bed/frame , bureau, hutch, love seat, and computer desk) that I had no room and/or use for in my new apartment.   Landlord had previously reached out to me and told me he would be away from August 5th (date I needed to be out of apartment) until some time this week.   He called me yesterday to confirm that I was out of the apartment, I told him I was/had been since the 28th, and also explained about the larger pieces of furniture, and suggested that he used the security deposit to pay someone to remove them.   He had since called me multiple times (I have not answered) and left 2 aggressive messages, threatening to file eviction proceedings if I do not remove my property.   I am not living in the home from which he is threatening to evict, I have up to date rent receipt  for the past 8 years showing I do not owe him $$, and I believe I am well within my rights to leave the property and abandon my deposit. I have spent well over $3000 on moving expenses over the past month, and frankly cannot afford to spend several hundred dollars to dispose of my old property, especially without knowing whether I will recoup my security deposit or not.   Am I within my rights, or could I possibly lose an eviction case, despite not living in the property?	No
I live in Cook County Illinois in an owner occupied building, 3 bedroom unit, outside of Chicago. The landlord is a rather unpleasant person who has been dishonest from the start.  I've been here for approximately 7 years and recently discovered that the common area hallway light is running on my meter. I also suspect that there is a storage area that is also connected to my meter, but have no way of confirming this on my own. The lease doesn't say anything about my having to pay for common area power.  I am due for a new lease in a couple of weeks and my fiance is moving in with me. My landlord is not pleased with this and is requesting that he fill out an application, provide credit history, etc, as well as increase our rent.  I am worried that my fiance won't get approved due to his terrible credit history. In the meantime I have this electricity problem with which I am very upset. My electric bills are always very high and I never understood why. My electric was even turned off on two occasions due to my inability to pay. Had I not been paying for someone else's power, I wouldn't have been living in the dark those two times. It was rather stressful.  My goal is to have my fiance move in and establish residency here, then take up the electricity issue.  How would I go about this?  I believe that this landlord knows about the electric being wired to my place as he's been the owner for over 20 years. That light is a newer addition as the cord is ran on the outside of the wall and routed to my place through a drilled hole.  Other issues:  -When I came to sign lease I asked who lived in the building, landlord said 'older couple', but failed to say that it was him and his wife. I found out after moving in.  -Mice are entering my apartment, but landlord is disregarding my friendly complaints. Gave me two mouse traps and called it a day. Mice are still here and he knows.  -Lease says no pets, no visiting pets, did not make an exception when I got a doctor's recommendation for an emotional support animal or when I needed to dogsit my brothers pup while he was hospitalized, but recently saw that landlord has cats himself in this building.  -Took almost a year to replace broken fridge.   Please advise. I wouldn't mind getting my money back. At least for the electricity bill and for having to clean mouse shit from my counter tops on a daily basis.	No
"Hindsight is 20/20. I realize now my mistakes: Holding rental property with out deposit or signed lease or any money what so ever.  The wife of the couple 23f and 23 m military put me on the spot several times.    Things I've tried to graciously provide but is turning and in fact turned into a nitpicking negotiating, bulldozing nightmare.  ""Reduce the pet fee since one pet is emotional therapy but will not prove it""  ""Let us paint (before even seeing the house it's recently been professionally painted for 2k)""  ""Let us meet you in the middle of the night, give us directions for an hour, invite all our friends and bang on the door,oh we forgot the money, we didn't bring the signed lease, we couldn't find a printer, we don't want to sign the lease until we pay and didn't want to pay until we found out your a real person not a craigslist killer""  Everything screams (I'm an idiot me the op and they are entitled)  They've been in the house since 1am Saturday, can't get them to answer to meet up for the lease and payment, they promised they would but like everything else they just end up doing what they want.  When I called this evening they finally answered and instead of giving me a time to meet they say ""we don't wanna pay the full month and want you to take off money from the deposit we have a list of discrepancies, and instead of 865 we want to pay 500""  I explained I already did the walk through with them every appliance is new, we did not provide a washer and had warned them that, now that is a bargaining chip for them.  I saw the writing on the wall and said  ""You've not paid any money you've not signed a lease and you've not stopped making demands-it's clear I'm not going to make you happy this isn't working""  He says ""I need a week"" but also cusses me out and threatens me that they haven't signed anything so he doesn't have to do ""jack S----""  I say ""please no hard feelings but this will never work you've not jumped through any of the hoops that tenants are supposed to and I've had to do every single thing what your asking me to do now is too much special treatment""  The house could pass a military inspection it was spotless ontop and behind appliances professionally cleaned.   They are not in the same reality... I know really shouldn't have let them move their stuff in but they were ""please don't make us get a storage unit tonight just for one night"" and he is a marine who just got back the beginning of the month, I didn't know things would get so out of hand but they kept pushing.  I ended the conversation by saying I might be able to give you 48 hour but I need you guys out because I really did hold the house for you and this has gotten out of hand, your not wanting to pay and your taking advantage of me (my stupidity in reality).  What do I do? I need to know my rights, I am getting a property manager but I would like to get them out since they have no intention of really paying and keep stalling.  I have his commands number but I do not know legally if they are squatters or what I have done. We only want them gone with out retaliating in the form of damage."	No
So I bought a condo, Massachusetts, back in 2012 (worst decision I’ve made to date).  Only 2 units were built, one building townhouse style.  The second unit sold shortly after.  The developer still has not built anymore units (leaving it about 95% unfinished) and gets in trouble with the city every time he tries (ignoring wetland issues and cease and desist orders).  He periodically lists the development for sale but no one has bought it.  I, with the other unit owner, take care of plowing and general maintenance.  The developer no longer collects dues from us and just leaves us be.  I haven’t heard from him in about a year now.  Not sure what lead me to check out title of the property but it looks like a mess. There are all these quitclaim deeds to Nevada corporations this guy has set up, sometimes for $1 and sometimes for more.  Back and forth and now a deed clarification of some other corporation saying that they have the valid title.  This new corporation, while previously created by our developer, doesn’t look like it is owned by him anymore.  From what I can tell, the property has been passed around for shares in these corporations.  I spent half a day in google digging up all sorts of stuff I didn’t want to know and didn't really understand.  So not even sure if our developer is even our developer anymore.  What kind of mess is this and how do I protect myself?  I eventually want to be able to sell, but my gut says that won’t be possible.  And I feel bad about unloading this on to some other clueless buyer.  Besides not being able to sell, is there any other way this could come bite me?  Can he, the developer, even pass around the land like this?  Could my mortgage be called due?  Doesn’t he, the developer, need to let the unit owners know about these things?  I’m so in the dark.   I feel like I need a lawyer to look at all the facts and look out for my best interests … but it’s such a muck I don’t even know what kind of lawyer to look for or what needs protecting.	No

"I'm ready to divorce my wife of almost three years. We got married in October of 2014 because she needed to go back to her country for family issues and couldn't leave due to being undocumented. I absolutely loved her at the time but we really married for the wrong reasons. I'm so unhappy and ready to get my life back.   Anyway here's the stuff I'm worried about:  - We own a home together, but I'm the only one on the mortgage; if she tries to take the house is it true I'm also entitled to have her take responsibility for my debt? Would a judge really grant her hundreds of thousands of dollars and leave me to pay for it for the next 30 years without a home?  - I have a small retirement fund that started after we were married, is she entitled to any of it? It's barely $5000.   - She hasn't been working for the last year and a half but is perfectly able to find work. She worked while I was finishing my degree so I agreed she should take some time off when I found work in my field (we agreed to ""a few months""). She is not educated beyond high school.   - She is not a citizen, but qualifies for citizenship under our marriage early next year. Does this affect anything?  - I'd much prefer arbitration over a legal battle, what is a good way to get this?  - I have massive student debt, is it true I am entitled to have her take part of that debt? I would only use this as a bargaining tool if things got bad.   - I make just under six figures a year; do I have to worry about alimony if our marriage was so short?  Appreciate any advice!"	No
I work for a large, national corporation.   Our local labor union which represents more than 400 local employees has tentatively agreed to a contract this week. They have set a date to vote on the contract, which is this weekend (under 7 days notice).  The union is refusing to let any of the union members read the contract prior to the days of the vote.   I am looking for a legal basis to force them to give us the contract or to extend/block the vote.	No
"Thanks in advance for any help.   My lease ended on May 25th and my landlord has yet to contact us about our security deposit. I'm listed as the agent on the lease and emailed her the day we moved out with my mailing address and a reminder that I was the tenant that would be receiving the deposit.  I read the Maryland statute that says the following ""If the landlord, without a reasonable basis, fails to return any part of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the termination of the tenancy, the tenant has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney’s fees.""  Today is the 45th day and I still have not heard from my landlord. How exactly should I proceed? The security deposit was a little under $10,000 and suing her for $30,000 seems somewhat unreasonable but is that what we're entitled to under the statute? At what point should I contact an attorney? Should I reach out to her directly again?"	No
Hi /r/legaladvice Partner and I are looking at settling for a brand new place tomorrow. Unfortunately it is not ready to live in with a number of issues that still require a clean up. The vendors (also the builders) have stated they will fix it up when they return from their holiday on the 22/7. I have this in writing via email. Would it still be advisable to withhold an amount of settlement? Is there any legal obligation for them to make sure everything is fixed up? My solicitor had informed me that if I trust the vendor I can let it be sorted out. I was also informed that I may request for them to pay the necessary costs for me to fix up the property, if this has not been completed within the defect rectification period.	No
"Hello /r/legaladvice,  In Georgia, USA. This is might be long, so I sincerely apologize in advance. My former landlord has not returned our security deposit after nearly three months now. Since my roommate and I moved out in the beginning of May, he has essentially ghosted us, seemingly deliberately not responding to our texts and emails, and dodging our phone calls. He told my roommate back in early June that he sent the check to my forwarding address. There was no evidence of this check. After waiting a full month (and then some because it was almost July) to pass, I finally sent him a formal demand letter by certified mail. He responded two weeks later with only a vague text message, saying he got a return check from me. There was no mention of the letter I sent him, but he said he had deductibles after his contractor took a look and he will be sending the list and remaining balance soon. I responded promptly, thanking and asking him to send it as soon as possible. Then we heard nothing from him again.   Ten days ago, I sent him *another* demand letter. He has finally *sort of* communicated to us two days ago, claiming via text message a list of numerous damages to his property. It was a lot of ambiguous stuff like, ""The fridge was messed up."" We have no idea what that entails. Still have not provided any monetary figures and when/if he was returning our deposit. We sent him an email back right away asking for clarification and again for him to return our deposit and he has gone completely silent again.   My question is: Can he even claim he is withholding money for damages after the 30 days allowed by Georgia law? Or does his limited communication still count as him expressing that he was going to withhold the deposit. Have we ruin hurt our own case by trying to communicate with him and work things out?   Some other things: *1. We have rented the place for two years—initially 1-year, then renewed for another year. Thinking now, this was a mistake because there were so many things wrong with the house and, of course, this whole situation now. But it was a good location and the rent was cheap. We thought we had spent so much time, effort, and money making the place livable, and were used to it.  *2. We gave him notice when we moved and we did not owe rent. We kept the place clean and well-maintained. He tried to convince us in April that our lease ended days earlier than it did and when we pointed what was clearly written on our lease, he told us it did not matter and it was common knowledge to everyone that the last day of the previous month was always the last day or a new month's rent had to be paid. And then he tried to say the lease date was a mistake he made that he never changed because he thought we would understand. And when we pushed back, he stopped responding and acted like it never happened the next time he talked to us. We have the impression that he is partially being vindictive now because he could not squeeze more money out of us. *3. Pretty much everything on the list of damages he finally sent basically fell into one of two categories: Either A) already existed when we moved in because it was a very old house or B) were things we had told him about but he did not want to repair or repaired poorly (ie. cheap materials or only replacing one small part when really the whole thing needed to be straight up replaced). He was even in denial about a gas leak and did not fix the broken front door for over a week. We took photographs of the condition of the house when we moved in and also took a video of us going through all the rooms of the house when we moved out. We also have text message correspondence with him where we told him about various house problems and asked him to come take a look at them (although there was a lot of verbal in-person assurances he made that we did not get down in writing, some of those things he listed a damages after he said they were fine).  *4. And this may or may not be a separate issue, but I do not know if there is any that can legally done about it now... We were responsible for the utilities for the property according to the lease, but what he failed to clarify until after we had already moved in was that he had converted the small 1(?)-car garage into a separate unit (that honestly did not seem up to code) and was renting it out. There was no mention of this unit in the lease. It had no access to the heating/cooling controls and there was not a separate meter for utilities. They were constantly knocking on our door to turn up or turn down the heat/air-conditioning depending on the season because they only had a vent coming from the main house. And we were stuck with the bill when the other tenants ran up the water or electric bill.   I an sorry if my post is a mess and if I said a lot of necessary things. There is honestly just so much, and I have no idea where to begin. I have also contacted my university's student legal services with my inquiry, but everything is a slow process in the summer semester, and I will be graduating shortly, so might not be eligible for legal advice there much longer. Thank you for reading."	No
Hello r/legaladvice. I received a traffic ticket last Friday but the courthouse still hasn't received it. They can't give me a definite price until they receive it. Don't I get in trouble if I don't pay it before my court date?	No
"I own a condo in Saskatchewan. Recently, I received a ""summer updates"" email from my condo property managers stating that pets are not allowed. This was the first time I had heard of this rule and there is no indication in any of the past 3 years of AGM minutes that a 'no pets rule' had been discussed or voted on by the condo owners to become a bylaw.   The condo I own is occupied by new tenants who have one cat (and now want a second). I have told them not to get a second cat until I figure this out.   I also want to get more information about this new no pets rule/ bylaw from the property managers but I am worried that if I start asking, they will then realize that my tenants have a cat and will take action to have it removed. I really like these tenants and want to keep them happy.   Any advice or thoughts on how to proceed?   Should i just ignore the rule but only let my tenants keep one cat? Should I contact my property managers and potentially point out that I have a cat in my unit while getting more info? Any other ideas?"	No
"A few days ago, we noticed that there was water seeping from the floorboards at the front door. We thought it was a burst pipe or something, so we called the landlord. Long story short, the damages are our fault. Water was leaking from our air conditioner in one room, and leaking into the other. Since the damages are directly located at the front door, and no damages seem apparent in the other room, it seemed fine at the time.  However, the landlord wants us to pay for reflooring the whole house. For the record, the front door shares flooring with the living room, kitchen, and hallway (as in, it's all connected). He wants us also to pay for reflooring all the rooms as well, including the ones not affected by the damages. He also insists on picking which service he wants used, and that we can't just replace the section with the damages, because ""we'll never find floorboards that look like that."" I'm not quite sure I buy that; it seems like fairly generic laminate hardwood flooring.   The landlord has been frustrating and condescending as hell, so my SO is content to just find a new place to live and let his landlord keep the security deposit. However, that just feels like a really bad idea to me, which is why I'm looking for outside advice.  My questions are this: 1) Does the Landlord have a right to charge us to refloor the whole house despite the location of the damages? 2) If my SO chooses to leave and let the Landlord keep the security deposit, is there any chance the landlord will come after him seeking more money for damages? 3) My SO claims that he may not've even turned in the rental contract to the landlord. Will that affect things?"	No
Like the title states a friend and I have come up with a fun little idea and we want to build it and try market it. It would be named after a video-game character.  Any advice on whether or not this would be legal? Or any good resources on where to see if the name is still trademarked?  Thank you in advance!	No

"I had a 1 year lease in south Florida with a notoriously horrible rental company called Invitation Homes.  I had to extend my lease for 2 weeks (because of my job).  Anyways, I just got my ""security"" deposit back and they took out $645.60 for ""damages,"" the bulk of which ($522.70) was for painting all the interior walls/trims/closets and to ""sand the imperfections"".  This is complete and utter BS and I even took a video as I was walking out of my apartment documenting everything.  I just wrote them an e-mail for clarification but I wanted to know what my legal options were.  Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.  And just for some backstory, I have lived in 3 places prior to here over the last 8 years (grad school, work, etc...) and I have never had any of my security deposit kept before.  Ever.  So this is really frustrating.  Thanks in advance."	No
About July 10th a branch from a tree on the property broke and hit my truck causing scratches and denting. We asked the landlord to pay for it and didn't like how my husband talked to him and said he was going to evict us. My husband has mental health issues and became suicidal and called 911 due to these thoughts. He was evaluated at an urgent psychiatric center and released the same day. We got the eviction notice yesterday and it states that my husband was walking around the park with a rifle threatening and intimidating people, including a minor child. This is simply untrue as my husband did not even have possession of his guns on the date they say this happened. I talked with the property owner and he said if we leave before the court date he will prorate our rent for the month and even return our security deposit as long as everything is in good condition. Do we get out before court or fight the eviction?	No
I know that it is illegal to brandish or present a firearm with the intent to intimidate people in all states. I was wondering if this law extends to all weapons or just firearms.	No
I recently was signed power of attorney to sell a house that my grandmother left to her remaining children in her will. The arrangement was for the house to be sold immediately and the money divided between the three remaining sisters. After what has been almost a year, my aunt who was left with power of attorney has done nothing to settle the issue by carrying out my grandmothers will. After pleading with my aunt she agreed to sign over power of attorney so i can sell the house. Of the three remaining children who are entitled to a piece of what the house sells for one does not want the house to be sold. This being the case she has gone to the property broken the locks on the house and her daughter moved in to claim the house for her own. A week before power of attorney was signed over to me i went to the house with a officer and requested that she leave. The officers told me there was nothing that i could do unless i had power over the decisions to be made in selling the house. I was told to leave and escorted off premises. Now that i have power of attorney and spoken to a lawyer. I have been told that i would need to give two weeks notice of eviction and bring along the proper paper work. I have the deed, will, and Power of attorney over all decisions made from this point forward. I dont know what my next steps should be? I Live in San Antonio Texas and am 21 years old and not well versed on these issues. My main concern is that they destroy the house in the time they have to evict. The main reasoned iam worried about it is because they are known to pour quick cement down the drains and ruin the utilities before they move out. I need to write a eviction notice but dont know were to start. If anyone could give me some advice i would greatly appreciate it.	No
We have battled the poor drainage on the road above our home since we purchased in 2012.  The hill we live on is steep, but the road is sloped too flat, so instead of diverting water to the ditch (above the road), it is diverted towards our house (below the road).  During a larger than average rain event while we were away from the house all the water from above our house (large area with many homes) was basically diverted to my driveway rather than the ditches and culverts system that is in place.  A torrent of water ripped my very manicured gravel driveway to shreds with gully's almost a foot deep.  Rock from my driveway was transported up about 100 feet from the driveway on our yard below.  We gave the borough the chance to offer to fix our driveway and they didn't make an offer.  I think it may be time to get a lawyer.  What kind of lawyer do I need, will they require upfront payment, how do I pick a good lawyer?  They have previous plans to re-surface the road this year and we want an engineer to certify their plan will solve our drainage issues permanently, and to reimburse us for costs related to fixing our driveway (I estimate somewhere in the $4000-8000 range + legal costs).	No
Long story short.. divorced 2 yrs. minor child lives with me alone. No contact from ex in over 2 yrs. he has recently started emailing me asking for pictures of child. My Atty advised I should send. He has increased requests to every month and now every week for the past three. Each email he is trying to get me to converse with him, &amp; makes references to our past relationship. I only respond with pictures, no conversation. I had pfa against him which expired and was not able to be renewed because he moved out of state. My question is what is reasonable for asking for pictures? I mean come on, appearance isn't going to change month to month and I feel that he is just using as an excuse to try and get me to talk to him. I feel like it's just more emotional abuse and harassment.	No
Does anyone have a good recommendation for a lawyer that represents tenants or a plan of action to take?  I have lived in a brand new apartment since December 2016, and have had several problems with my apartment. I have been extremely patient over the last 7 months, trying to work things out with the property management. I have spoken to the property manager, district manager, and the vice president. The most pressing issue is that during the summer spring, there have 3 storms that have come through, that have resulted in an inordinate amount of water coming into my bedroom through the window. Each time it has gotten my bed, floors, and walls wet and each occurrence have contacted the necessary people to report the problem with videos and pictures. They said they fixed it after the first one, however I believe they mistakenly worked on the wrong apartment. In addition they entered my apartment without giving notice to me. I believe it is now time to pursue different avenues to get my expected resolution. I can find plenty of lawyers that represent properties, but am having a hard time finding a lawyer to represent me. Need recommendations or advice. Thanks in advance!	No
"Note: Posted in r/relationships and r/askto first, someone suggested you'd be a better resource.   Hey Reddit,  I live in a condo in a town about 45 min north of Toronto, Canada. My neighbors (we share one of those metal walls on our balcony, so sound basically is like it's right beside each other) they were blasting music from about 3pm to 11:07pm on Sunday night, specifically to affect us. I found out from their drunk rants back and forth that they are upset that I sometimes play metal music after work (I've never got a complaint from them before). I'll play music sometimes off my cell phone or off my TV, but they had a very loud sound system blasting oldies rock (van halen, AC/DC, etc) all day, while making jokes like ""hey Rocco think we should play some screamo music instead?"" He'd say ""nah I hate that shit, this is real music"". It's a man and woman, probably at least late 50s, my wife and I are mid 20's. (and Disturbed/System of a Down/ Otep is the music I think they're complaining about, certainly not screamo!)   Eventually we complained to security twice, they only answered the door to security for the first complaint, which I made on my way out of the building for a rec league sport I play downtown. My wife ended up feeling unsafe as she heard them after the complaint ""they don't know who they just fucked with, they'll regret this"", ""I'll fuck them up every chance I get"", ""we'll complain to security about every little thing they do now"", etc - those were all told to the security guard and added to their file (whatever that entails).   While I was out my wife went down to complain the second time, the male neighbor walked out of the parking garage, visibly intoxicated, was most likely driving just before that. He saw my wife making the complaint, both her and the security guard noticed that he almost fell over he was so drunk. I probably would have called the cops right then if I had seen that but neither of them did, pretty sure it's too late now.   According to my wife they then made more veiled threats to us talking with each other, my wife got scared and called me and I left my game early to come home. Neighbors continued drinking and playing music until 11:07pm, their son came out at around 10:30 and told them they should be careful because 11pm (official noise complaint time) was coming up, they just laughed at him (I'm guessing he's around 15ish, and I hear him smoking bongs on the balcony pretty often). He came out at another point and asked if they had any batteries and they just laughed at him and said ""what do you think we are, the dollar store?"" - obviously they're not the best parents and really drunk.   I took recordings with my phone of the loud music and backed them all up on iCloud. Even in the bathroom on the opposite side of the unit (950 sq ft), with my cellphone music at full blast and the fan on I could hear deep bass. Security entered our unit both times (at my wife's request) and noted the loud volume we could hear inside.  These neighbors are in at least their late 50s, maybe older. They don't seem to work at all, sound like they're straight out of Sunnyvale trailer park and best friends with Jim Lahey, they really just drink and smoke cigarettes all day. They and I smoke cigarettes so we're outside often at the same times (I've never talked to them before, I don't even know what they look like, but wife does). They rent, we own. Security guard told my wife that they and their landlord will be sent a complaint letter.   I'm worried that they'll cause more problems in the future, especially if I have music on that they can hear, it's the summer and I like to have the windows open and some music on for like half an hour when I get home from work most days, but I don't even own a stereo that could play music at even half the volume they had theirs on at today. I'll likely stop that or at least cut this back now.   Any suggestions? I'll call the cops if I need to (if this persists) but I really don't want to cause even more issues, these people sound like really vengeful children. I found the website for Toronto bylaw and it says noises at anytime, not just after 11pm that effect ""quiet enjoyment of a home"" can be grounds for a cop call, but  a) we're in a nearby town and I'm not sure if the bylaw is the same (couldn't find that online) and  b) we like to make noise too, we have the occasional party or times with loud music (but not as loud) - difference is if we get a complaint we've turned it down and apologized, not turn it up and make threats and loudly complain all day (only got one noise complaint in this building from a different neighbor and did exactly that, but have got some at past residences and did the same)  Any ideas Reddit?   Tl;dr - condo neighbors (who share balcony with metal wall between) wanted to get back at me for listening to normal-Volume music by blasting really loud oldies rock from 3pm to just after 11pm while drinking, we could overhear them making non-specific threats against us, wife got really scared. One of them likely drove really drunk during the day, but no proof of that."	No
Throw away account used as precautionary measure.  **Short version**  Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.  **Long version**  My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have.   Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.  When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.  There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.  The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.  The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.  This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.  I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.  Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.  Any thoughts are appreciated.	No
"Hello R/Legaladvice. Me and my husband rented a house for three years (April 2014-June 2017). Before we moved in i asked the landlord if we could paint the walls. He stated it was allowed. After 3 years of renting, we bought a house and i texted the landlord on 6/25/17 to see if we needed to paint them to a more neutral color before we moved out on 6/30. The landlord replied ""no, as long as there is no holes or damage"". the landlord texted me today 7/11/17 stating that we need to repaint the walls. Can he legally change his mind on wanting us to paint the walls after our lease has ended? Can he keep our security deposit if we refuse to paint the walls 2 weeks after we moved out and turned the keys in?   Thank you in advance."	No
My father needs to file some court papers about a domestic violence incident.  English isn't his first language, so he has asked me to help him fill out the form.  Do I need to know any particular legal terms, or is the form pretty self-explanatory?	No
Hi. A year ago I moved into my first apartment. I took pictures of the apartment before I moved in. I noticed that the apartment did not have a microwave (but the other units did) and I mentioned it to the landlord. She told me that I would have to bring my own. I brought my own. Now that I moved out, I get an e-mail asking where the microwave is. I told her what she said to me a year ago and that I purchased my own. She is still saying I took it. Is there anything that I can do? Also, I took pictures the first day of move in.	No
So my ex wife and I were married in England and moved to Canada. We separated and a year or so later, she moved back to the U.K. with our two sons. She then legally divorced me from the UK and three years later sought to obtain a divorce agreement here in Canada. The resulting Court Order addressed support payments for our children (whilst they are children of the marriage). Since then our eldest son has started University in England, age 20, away from his home, on a three year Bachelors program. I was not consulted on this and simply expected to pay 75% of the fees (approx $15,000 a year) as well as 75% of residence costs (he now rents a home with other student, and I am expected to pay 75% of this. My ex wife also wants me to still pay her support payments in line with guideline table amounts, so that she could contribute her 25% in compliance with the court order that we currently have.  I didn't believe that this was correct, and am about to sit in a DRO meeting in an attempt to mediate a solution to facilitate a revised Order, failing which we will unfortunately end up in a full court hearing. (The DRO meeting will take place in Canada, with my ex wife dialing in).  I find it hard to comprehend how decisions can be made, without conferring with me but I'm expected to pay, pay and pay.  My son is working part time (his schooling takes about 12 hours a week) and he does not currently contribute to his tuition fees or his housing.  Me ex wife lives with her partner (in U.K.), she has recently had a third child with him, works for his businesses and is claiming that she earns very little. She does not pay for the home she currently lives in, so the argument for support to maintain a home for our son, should he choose to come visit in the holidays is, in my opinion, moot.  To add insult to injury, she has destroyed my relationship with my sons by using lies and destructive 'propaganda'. I used to see my sons often and text daily, and now they refuse to speak with me.  I have never shied away from my financial responsibilities to my children and never would,  but at 44 years of age, I need to be able to properly plan for my future, provide for my new family, and repair my relationship with my sons.  I am seeking any advice on the pertinent issues related to paying for education for an adult child, who lives abroad, we were divorced abroad and the rules for support are ordered here in Canada (in the U.K., support stops at 18, no matter the schooling being undertaken). Also in respect of her working for her partner and not showing true earnings, in order to reinforce her argument that I pay a larger portion of the education costs. Final note, I believe she has not paid her 25% of the first years tuition, and simply had my son take a student loan to top up the 75% that I have paid.  Sorry this is convoluted, I'm typing on my phone. Any further factual information required to provide advice, please let me know. I love my kids dearly and the ongoing dispute and the resulting damage it has had on my relationship is incredibly hurtful and is affecting my current relationship due to the stresses involved. Any advice is truly appreciated.  Thank you!	No
TL;DR: my father is mentally ill, his wife tried to kill him and has beaten him up in front of his doctors. Can I sue her?  I posted some time ago an AmA regarding my father's abusive relationship.  The situation has been getting steadily worse and worse until he has (finally) been hospitalized in the psychiatry department to treat his sever anxiety. Over the past month he has been staying in a psychiatry facility to continue with his therapy.  Last friday, his wife was there. His wife is extremely abusive and violent. She has already beat him up in the past, and has always been psychologically abusive. On friday she became furious over a discussion they had with the doctors. She took my father out of the facility for the afternoon (a temporary leave with the doctors' approval), and once they were out of the facility she tried to steer the car off the road. The car was damaged but luckily nothing happened to him. Once they were back in the parking lot, she started screaming and beating him.  He is mentally ill and completely unable to break out of the abuse. He will not press charges nor try to avoid her (in fact, he hoped he would be discharged soon to go back home with her).  What can I do? Can I sue her for attempted murder over the car incident? The doctors are on our side, and just yesterday the MRI results came in indicating that his brain is starting to get compromised because of the illness: can I get the court to declare him unable?  Thanks.	No
I live in San Francisco, a city notorious for overreaching tenant rights. Both me and the tenant have signed and agreed to a Stipulation of Judgment whereby I will pay her $20,000 in set payments in exchange she has to leave by 8/1/17. The time is now fast approaching, and I'm thinking she isn't going to leave. She is having difficulty finding a place and frankly, many landlords will likely not accept her. Do I have anything to worry about? Will I be able to evict her should she not leave by the agreed upon date? The signed document states she waives her rights to trial TIA	No
"Okay, so, basically my kids dad had me served with a civil summons yesterday petitioning for joint custody with him being the primary. For some backstory, we were together for 8 years, have two daughters, 5 and 7, and have been separated for four years. Never married. No prior legal agreement in place. Since we separated I have always been the primary parent. He never had them more than a couple days a week, has never paid child support, never there when I needed him, everything has always fallen on me. We have been having issues for quite awhile now. He has always been very unreliable. Doesn't pick them up when he says he will, doesn't answer calls or texts, never says when he'll drop them off, will be set off by the most random things and threaten to keep them and not give them back. From July to October of last year all of this kept escalating. My oldest picked up lice from school and gave it to me and her sister and he berated me for being ""filthy,"" refused to give my kids back but eventually relented and gave them to my mom after insisting they had lice again after I had already treated them. They didn't. He was erratic with the days he wanted to keep them, was late getting our oldest to school and couldn't pick her up so I had to drop what I was doing to rush to get her. Eventually I stopped asking him to help me out and my mom and I worked out a more reliable  schedule because I just couldn't depend on him or trust him to help me and be a partner. This was fine for about a month until he started demanding I change my schedule so he could see them. He wouldn't work with me and I got scared so I cut off contact while I saved money for a lawyer.  We have been back in contact for about a month now. He showed up at my moms house, said he was going to call cps on me, the cops, that I am unstable, etc. I talked to him and he told me all he wanted was visitation. I sent him a very long text outlining my issues and concerns but telling him I was more than willing to work with him and go to a mediator but I wasn't comfortable with him taking them until there was something in place. He never responded and instead had me served with this summons. I'm calling lawyers as soon as possible to formulate a response to the summons since I only have 20 days but I guess what I am asking is what are the chances I would lose primary? I have had some missteps in my past which play into why I did not seek out a legal agreement sooner, I was a stripper which I thought would hurt me and I did mess with substances. (Nothing major like heroin or anything and I was never addicted or did anything around the girls). Now though I am steadily employed since November and have moved up quickly at my job. I have been clean from any and all drugs for almost a year. I don't smoke and I rarely drink. I have a reliable paycheck and benefits. The girls go to school in my district, I have a stable home, I've had the same boyfriend for four years and we don't even live together, I provide everything for them emotionally and financially. He has never provided support or had them more than a couple days a week in all the time we have been separated.  I believe he's trying to file this way to get out of child support and to hurt me. He is a very manipulative, vindictive person and I know he doesn't like me standing up to him so he is going to do everything he can to drag me down. I'm afraid me cutting off contact will play against me. In his summons it sounds like he is going to go after my environment and emotional stability. What do I need to do to prove what he is asking is not in the girls best interests? What are the chances he will get what he is asking? Is there anything that will hurt me going forward and that I need to do to prepare? I am fine with working with him on the joint custody part but I absolutely do not want to lose primary. I'm scared and need some reassurance. Thank you guys."	No
"I have called the city and no one seems to know which is appalling. One building is a 35 unit building and our ""sister"" building is on Broadway and has is a 60 unit building. We share a boiler and in the rear there are other pipes connecting the two buildings that somehow look pretty dangerous. Thank you."	No
This is a very very long story over the course of 5 years, but to begin with I'll just start with the most basic info to see if I have any chance of recourse. I live in a approximately 40 unit apartment building in Southern California.   Live in manager #1 was fired for sexually harassing tenants including my fiance Live in building manager #2 was fired refused to leave the building, defaced the building and his apartment and generally terrorized everyone living here.  Live in building managers (a couple) #3 were fired almost immediately, refused to leave, had to be evicted, severed all the internet cables, vandalized washing machines, vandalized their apartment and stole.  Since managers #3 left there haven't been any changes made. The locks weren't changed, the security cameras don't actually work, and zero effort was made to protect tenants from the extremely hostile managers #3.  I awoke this morning to someone trying to come through my window using a ladder managers #3 left in the alley. I am extremely distraught and don't feel remotely safe in my own apartment. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's the basics.   The big kicker is that it's a rent controlled apartment and the landlord would be more than happy for anyone in the building to leave since rents have gone up substantially in the area. Especially those of us who have been here a while.	No
I am currently residing in Florida  In April, I made the personal decision to leave my apartment due to personal conflicts with my roommate. We are both on the lease and I asked to either have my name removed from the lease, or to terminate all together. She refused to comply with either of those options out of spite. There is no contractual agreement between me and my roommate stating that we would pay our share of the rent, only a contract with the landlord(the lease). I have been paying the second half of the rent out of fear of what may happen if I choose to stop. From what I understand reading Florida law and finding bits and pieces, the landlord would undergo this process to collect rent: Once the rent is X amount of days late, the landlord will file a 3-Day eviction notice. The tenants will have 3 days to either pay the late rent, vacate the apartment, or fight the eviction in court. Now with that being said, having the eviction to my renter's history IS NOT A BOTHERSOME to me. I also understand the landlord may sue for missing rent. Being evicted and having to pay overdue rent for the month sounds like a better deal to me than continuing to pay rent for an apartment I'm not living in until December. My main concern is the retaliation of my roommate, and fact checking the eviction process. Is there anything legally she may pursue in a small claims court against me directly beings that there is no contractual agreement directly between the two of us, stating we would split the rent? Is there any actions that the landlord may take that is much more serve than eviction/suing for missing rent? Does my roommate have a case to fight the eviction in court?	No
I stupidly signed a lease with my brother in law and his girl friend. It is a year lease and it isn't up until February. Since moving in it has come to my attention that he is a on alcoholic with a drug problem, as well. He drinks and leaves beer bottles everywhere, has friends over until all hours of the night (if they don't end up on my couch).  Uses drugs including cocaine in the house. He is verbally abusive. They have two dogs that have fought so much that they've had to go to the emergency get three times (twice in the past two weeks alone). I have two young kids (4 and 1) and I can't continue to keep them in these conditions. Help please.	No
"Friendly old-guy neighbor learned I was planning on moving, and approached me offering to sell my home for 3% of the sale price. He wants me to put a ""for sale by owner"" sign in front of the property with **his** phone number on it, and says he knows cash buyers eager to move into the neighborhood. He says he has provided this service for other sellers in my neighborhood, though he is not licensed to practice real estate.  On the one hand, this seems super-shady and makes me more than a little uneasy. On the other, I'd be happy to quickly find a qualified buyer, and wouldn't mind paying my neighbor to bring me someone from his social network.  What kind of headaches am I setting myself up for here? What kind of headaches might he be setting himself up for?"	No
I fall 2016, my cousin lost custody of her children due to drug and abuse charges. My parents chose to foster them, and they lived with us for 4 months. However, we had to let them go back into the system, as they were in danger from their mother. DSS wouldn't supervise visits, she would show up announced, high or drunk, stole from us, among many other things. We made the hard choice to let them go into the foster system to try and protect them from their mother. Out of spite, their mother refused to allow visitation or any contact between us and the children. However, since then, the mother has lost any and all parental rights. I want to know if there's any way I, as a family member and former caregiver, could gain rights for visitation. I want to maintain a relationship with them, so that hopefully, once I have the means, I could adopt them and get them out of the system. I have no contact with their mother or their biological grandparents. TL;DR- I want legal visitation with my cousins who I fostered, as their mother has lost all rights.  Would this be possible? What channels would I need to go through to receive legal visitation? Thank you!	No
"My mom in the process of buying me a house (her offer has already been accepted) and I might be able to start working on it as early as next week.  There are at least 2 homeless people who are using the attic above the garage for shelter. I've never seen them but I have spoken very briefly with one of them.  I really don't feel comfortable with them continuing to use the house once it is mine. What are the proper steps I should take to let them know they need to leave?  My mom is worried once we tell them they will ""tear up the place"" but I think that's unlikely and even if it were to happen, I'm not sure there is anything we could do to stop it.  Does anyone have any experience with a similar situation? Also, if any homeless or formerly homeless people happen to see this post, I'd love to hear your perspective and advice."	No
I needed some minor body work and paint done on my jeep. Took it a shop that is part of a large national chain and paid $700 down payment.  Since then there's been one issue after another and it's 2 weeks past when it was supposed to be done. After they stopped answering their phones I drove down and they went bankrupt with the jeep still inside, disassembled, and sanded.  I've called their corporate office who told me they will see about releasing the jeep to me so I can take it somewhere else.  Since the jeep isn't legal to drive as it is, I'll will probably have to pay for towing, putting it back together, ect.   What steps should i be taking now? Is there something I can do to get the 700 back if they refuse to refund It? I understand they already did some work, but towing the jeep in pieces 2 weeks later wasn't what I had in mind when I payed. What about compensation for a rental car? I'm in the middle of moving and I will have to rent a vehicle now.  TLDR dropped jeep off at shop and paid 700 down. Shop went under with the jeep disassembled and locked inside. What should I do?	No
"My girlfriend and I just received a voicemail from our apartment complex saying that we had to take down our [CA Pride Flag](https://smile.amazon.com/California-Pride-Flag-Rainbow-Banner/dp/B002OSQEUG/ref=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_g2609328962?_encoding=UTF8&amp;%2AVersion%2A=1&amp;%2Aentries%2A=0&amp;ie=UTF8) because it's not on a flag pole (we saw a neighbor hang their USMC flag against their porch wall vertically, so we did the same with our flag.) and that it needs to be ""displaying colors properly.""  Our lease says nothing specific about flags, but it does say, about patios and balconies, ""any item not specifically mentioned here must be approved in advance by the community manager. Any item that has not been approved in advanced will be required to be removed immediately."" We didn't get permission, we assumed because we saw the other flags we could do the same. We can fly it on a pole, but we're worried about ""displaying proper colors."" What rights do we have to fly this version of the California flag?"	No
The title pretty much sums up my situation. Around two years ago I was notified that I had failed a urinalysis for d-amphetamine (adderall) and that, after 10 years of service, I was going to be processed for an administrative discharge, essentially firing me from my job without judicial proceedings and removing all benefits that I had earned.  I was obviously in shock and, after speaking to my wife, hired a private attorney in addition to my military appointed JAG lawyer. He had an interesting proposal. He intended to have my urine specimen sent to a lab on the east coast for DNA testing. The results came back a few weeks later and the lab had successfully obtained a DNA profile which did not match mine. I was elated, and thought everything was in the past.   My command pulled all proceedings and told my attorney they were going to commence an internal investigation as to what may have happened. They fired the Marine in charge of the urinalysis collecting program.   About one year after all of this I received a call to report to my Battalion Sergeant Major. I had no idea why, and when I got to his office quickly found out that they were proceeding with the discharge anyway. They wouldn't tell me why. And now here I am, jobless and with a wife and 12 month old son, with no insurance or solid source of income.   My question is this: Obviously, I still have all documentation showing the DNA results. Is there any recourse I could take? Would it be advisable to go to the media? Should I contact congressman? I am at a loss here. I apologized for the rambling and very much appreciate anyone that had some solid advice.	No
"Hey legal advice, should be a quick questions.   I rent a house with 4 of my friends. The kitchen sink has been mostly plugged since we moved in. I asked he landlord to deal with it within the first 2 weeks that we moved in. He sent somebody but they didn't really unplug the sink, just made it barely usable. We have dealt with this as is for a couple months now. When it gets really bad occasionally somebody will use a plunger to unclog the sink and allow it to drain. We are not putting food down the drain - we use the food catch and empty it often. When I got home after being away this past weekend I noticed the sink had detached from the bottom of the sink, leaving an inch or two gal between the countertop and the sink basin. I informed the landlord and he is blaming us because we used a plunger on the sink a few times. The repair bill came out to $280 ($220 labour, $60 materials). While the landlords contractor was repairing the sink i spoke with him for 10-15 minutes about the job. He told me that the sink failed because it wasn't installed properly and had essentially been held in place by nothing but silicone sealant acting as a glue to the underside of the countertop.   When I asked the landlord (who is very set on us including this $280 with our next rent payment) he is adamant that improper installation was not the cause as it was ""professionally installed 10 years ago by Home Depot"", his words.   How, if possible, can I get out of some or all of this ridiculous charge?"	No
Hello, I was wondering if someone on here could help point me in the right direction.    Back in March 2017 my 18 year old daughter contacted me and asked me to come pick her up and asked if she could live with us.  She had been out on her own since Jan 2016 when her and her mom got into a fight and her mom kicked her out.    I jumped on a plane immediately and flew to NC to pick her up.  After getting her settled in and enrolled and transfered in to the local High School I decided to contact the OAG to file a change of status and termination of CS.   The OAG mailed me the required forms and gave me instructions on how to prove her residency. Which I sumbitted per their request.    Now child support was due to terminate in June 2017 so there was merely 3 months of payments left from a 17 year history of the order. I did not want my ex to have anything she did not deserve especially once I learned my daughter had essentially been homeless since Jan 2016.   The AOG placed the moneys on hold while they verified the change.  Months went by.  Finally received a status update from the AOG on June 20th 2017.  However it was not was I was hoping for.  They informed me that with out the other parents signature stating she is giving me credit for those three months the AOG states they can not return the money to me.    The OAG claims it is their policy but refused to give me documentation stating the legal procedure claiming it is not public record.    It has been one month since they mailed my ex wife the documentation and she never responded.  I called the AOG and asked them what the next step was and they told me they do not have an answer for me.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor who ended up just contacting someone else who is going to send another letter to my ex wife inwhich will go straight to the trash.    So my question is what policy is the OAG following that stipulates they must have a response from the other party to determine status change?  They claimed it is not public record when I asked about such policy.  Also if I were to file a suit in court on what grounds would I file since the court order has already expired since my daughter is 18 and has now graduated?    A lawyer would cost too much in comparison to what the AOG is holding.   Any advice would be appreciative.	No
Hi There,   I'm a recent graduate looking to rent a room in London. I found somewhere I like and have paid the admin fee to take the room off the market and will be signing the contract on Friday (28/07/2017). However, the landlord is asking to see copies of my last 3 bank statements (amongst many other things!). I feel a little uneasy about this, is this usual? do I have the right to say no? I feel like this information is a little private. I will also be sending him previous landlords reference/character reference/employment contract already. Any advice would be appreciated	No
Hello Reddit,  I am a 21 year old male with no prior criminal record living in New York. I was recently charged with petit larceny for stealing a pair of sunglasses from a store I worked at. I returned the glasses the next day without ever being asked to because I didn't feel right taking them. Later that day I was pulled aside by Loss Prevention and told they have everything on camera. They brought me down to a detainment cell where I waited for the police and was given a field arrest for petit larceny. I am very nervous and afraid for myself because I wasn't raised to do things like this. I hope I didn't mess my future up.  My questions are these:  1) Will this stay on my record?  2) If so, how can I get it taken off 3) What implications does this hold for my future? 4) As a college student I don't have very much money, is a court appointed lawyer good enough to handle this? 5) What course of action should I take when handling this situation?	No
I've been carrying this on my shoulders since Nov. 2015. The therapists know the entire situation, in depth, and even though I feel iffy about what to do, they still encourage me. It is not such a black and white/cookie cutter situation, it's also very twisted, and gross, and sick... So I'll spare you the details and make this brief.   I don't have money to hire a lawyer, but my current therapist told me to at least seek a free consultation with one. How do I do this? If the crime happened in another county, what do I need to do. What will happen if/when I finally press charges? What should I expect? I need to know so much, but I don't know what all to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	No
"Hi guys, I had a few questions regarding property ownership rights and financial rights in California.  My wife and I are going through a divorce, we have a a house together and joint credit card, checking and savings.  In short what are my my rights to the money in the checking and savings.  Also, what should I do with the property, what does it mean for her to ""buy me out"" regarding the property?    If you're curious about the situation, please see my previous posts.  In a gist we have a house which she says I don't contribute enough, even though she knew before hand that I would be on deployment and have my own living expenses."	No
"Last week, my landlord had sent me a ""viewing schedule"" with a list of days / times the place could be shown (it's not guaranteed there will be showings at those time slots, so he may or may not enter at those times). They aren't exact dates either; the schedule is Sat, Monday, Wednesday @ 10, 1, 4, or 7 each week until the place is rented.  Is this sufficient notice for him to enter my place? He sent me the schedule last week. I was under the impression he would still need to give 24hr notice before actually entering, or is the viewing schedule he sent enough notice?"	No

Some context.  My father and mother split apart five years ago.  I occasionally keep in touch with my father.    My father got arrested last weekend for domestic abuse.  Now I don't know the whole situation but I don't condone domestic violence.  My father spent the weekend in jail, and bailed himself out.  In the meantime his girlfriend took a restraining order out on him so he cannot return to the house to get his belongings.  He has personal artifacts (items he had long before he met this other woman), some jewelry (again he had long before he met this other woman), and his passport.    I want to know what my father can do to retrieve his rightful items.    P.S. My father and the girlfriend just bought the house he has been exiled from.  I would also like to know if this could be taken away from him or what his rights are.	No
Hi all. I work part time at a shitty job that I really don't enjoy. I keep track of my hours and I have gotten paid for all of them except for two.  I worked for four days on the week of June 26th and last Friday on July 7th.  I'm supposed to get paid weekly. So let's say I work the week of June 26th; I get paid for that week the that Friday, June 30th.  So I go in June 30th for my pay for the week of June 26th, and my boss says he is busy and because I did not call to let him know I would be picking up my paycheck, he will pay me next time I come in. Okay, fair.  I come in July 2nd and my boss tells me he may as well consolidate the check for the week of July 26th and my pay for whatever other days I work on the week of July 3rd.  So I come in Friday the 7th of July to work, and while I am working my boss tells me checks didn't come in this week, they should be in by Wednesday, July 12th.  Isn't this in violation of the FLSA? He hasn't paid me for the close of a pay period (Week of June 26th and the Friday of June 7th, which he told me he would consolidate).  What should I do? Can/should I take legal action before tomorrow? If tomorrow rolls around and he doesn't pay me, what do I do?  I do not know any personal information about my boss. No contact info, anything. I know his first and last name. The only way to reach him is at my place of work, if he's there, and if he feels like coming to the phone because 50% of the time he's busy. I also overheard him talking to a coworker where the coworker told him he recalled once when he hadn't paid him for months- because my boss needed his social security. Is what my boss is doing illegal? He's not paying us adequately, and he is hiring people without their social security. He also handles tons of raw food without gloves and forces us to do the same. Asking to use gloves while handling results in a simple answer from him: a firm 'no'. Can someone help? I feel like this place is very shady.	No
The situation is my sister was enrolled in a dual enrollment high school program at a local university where she went and lived on campus to take classes. My parents were not involved in any of the application or enrollment process and neither saw nor signed any paperwork. For context, She is not on good terms with my parents and has a long history of behavioral issues. They weren't really told anything about this program.  My sister told my parents when asked about how she would pay that she had money saved from working at Starbucks and had taken a student loan.  My parents later found out that there was in fact no loan or money and that the huge tuition bill was due. My sister is 17 (18 in two months) and is still technically a minor.  The university is making lots of threats to my parents if they don't pay. However, they never knew about any of this or signed any paperwork to make them liable for a $10,000+ bill.   Legally, can the school come after my parents for this?	No

"In Arizona if it matters.  My wife was offered a nice job that ran a credit check, they found an eviction judgement from five years ago we thought we had paid off. There is apparently still 600 left on it. This in itself isn't a big deal as they said that satisfying the public record would allow her to move forward in the employment process.  I've spent all day trying to track down WHO to pay as before we paid the apartment complex directly ( we have proof ). They referred me the court with the docket, fair enough. They in turn referred me to the law firm that handled the case, ok sure. Gave them a call, they in turn referred me back to the complex. Dead end. The complex then referred me to their collection agency who has no record of the collection. I've officially hit a dead end. Where do I go from here? I want to pay this and have it ""satisfied"" we my wife can get this job but everyone is referring me to someone else in an endless cycle. My first step tomorrow is to go to the court and lay out what happened today, but I'm wondering if anyone had additional insight."	No
Hello Everybody - First and foremost, I sincerely appreciate any and all assistance you can offer.  &amp;nbsp;  TLDR= Wisconsin - Never married, Child is 14, have 50/50 custody/placement, there has been no order for support since 2007 when we amended the custody order for 50/50.  Is my Ex entitled/able to acquire to any of my payout?  &amp;nbsp;   Full Story = Recently discovered I will be getting some money, not Millions but still a life altering amount for my situation(lowish six figures).  My primary question/concern is how best to proceed to ensure that my ex is prevented/limited in her ability to stake any form of claim in the payout I will get.  My goal is to maximize the positive impact this payout can have on my life and my son's life only.  &amp;nbsp;  Basics of it are as outlined in the TLDR, we have had 50/50 custody/placement since I got out of the Military in 2007, she 100% agreed to sharing everything, we developed the current agreement together, without lawyers and both submitted it, judge signed off on it.  We were never married, when the support order was active during my service (03-07) I never missed a single child support payment, voluntarily updated child support every time I received a raise.  We split every cost for him 50/50(I write checks and have paper record of everything), we share all major decisions, we agree/share the same approach when it comes to teaching/disciplining our Son, IE when he's grounded there I ground him here and vice versa, we support each other in that fashion.  Overall I would say my Ex and I have a pretty good co-parenting relationship, I really couldn't ask for more as far as all of that goes.    &amp;nbsp;  My Son has indicated a desire to live with me several times, he has also stated this desire to his Mother.  I would love for him to live with me, that said, I recognize the reason he wants to live with me is because he and I share a lot of the same interests and overall have a ton of fun.  This is largely due to the fact that he is my only child, so he gets 100% of my attention/recreational spending, at his Mother's he is the oldest of 3 children, so gets far less attention and a lot more misc chores due to the larger household.   &amp;nbsp;  I typed all of that out to attempt to help inform your responses, not trying to kill you with a wall of letters.  Regarding finances, she is married, they have probably double the household income that I have, we don't really share our finances but we did include in our court order, neither of us have asked the other about anything for years.  We alternate yearly on claiming my son as a dependent on taxes.  My basic concern is that once she learns about my anticipated payout she will file for child support.  I have performed some basic research, in WI it looks like they utilize a formula for 50/50 situations similar to ours where they analyze the difference between the two parents income.  How does that all relate to taxable lump sum payouts?  I know I probably need to hire an Attorney, there is also the possibility that I will get the payout and she would never even know unless I deviated from my current lifestyle to drastically.  &amp;nbsp;  Thank you again for any and all assistance	No
