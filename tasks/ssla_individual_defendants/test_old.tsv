2  On December 20, 2011, Cobalt also announced that Sonangol and Cobalt signed a Production Sharing 
Contract for Block 20 offshore Angol a (where Cobalt’s Lontra well is  located) pursuant to which Cobalt 
was named the operator of Block 20 with a 40% working in terest in the Block.  Other partners in Block 20

3 The FCPA also requires companies whose securities are listed in the United States to meet its accounting 
provisions.  The accounting provisions of the FCPA require  corporations to:  (i.) make and keep books and 
records that accurately and fairly re flect the transactions of the corporation; and (ii.) devise and maintain 
an adequate system of internal accounting controls.   Case 4:14-cv-03428   Document 1   Filed in TXSD on 11/30/14   Page 4 of 724 6. On February 21, 2012, Cobalt disclosed th at the SEC was investigating the

SEC that day, the Company assured investors that the SEC investigation was baseless, stating that 
Cobalt “believe[s] that [its] activ ities in Angola have complied with  all laws, including the FCPA.”  
To support Cobalt’s claims that its operations in  Angola were free of corruption, Cobalt claimed 
that Nazaki was a legitimate partner in the Comp any’s exploration Blocks 9 and 21 and a “full 
paying member of the contractor group.”  The Company made similar cl aims throughout the Class

8. Warren is an energy company that develops and produces onshore crude oil and
natural gas reserves. Prior to 2014, Warren primarily operated an oil recovery property in the
Wilmington field in south Los Angeles, and natural gas properties located in Wyoming. On July
7, 2014 Warren announced that it had agreed to buy a position in the hydraulic fracturing
Marcellus Shale gas region in northeastern Pennsylvania from Citrus for $352.5 million,
consisting of $312.5 million in cash and $40 million in Warren common stock, with a valuation
of $6 per share. Peterson, a co-founder of Citrus and its President and CEO, also joined
Warren’ s board of directors. The deal was effective, for economic purposes, as of July 1, 2014.
9. The Citrus acquisition was a transformative deal for Warren, as it doubled the
Company’ s reserves and tripled production. However, the acquisition would also greatly
increase the Company’ s sensitivity to market fluctuations for natural gas, and Warren’ s debt
would dramatically increase, as the Company funded the cash portion of the Citrus purchase byCase 1:16-cv-02037-CBS   Document 1   Filed 08/11/16   "

About Dakota Plains  
23. In 2008, Gilbertson and Reger founded Dakota Plains. To avoid

signatures were stamped or forged. Gilbertson and Reger later replaced their fathers 
with other handpicked officers. The roles of Gilbertson and Reger were never 
disclosed to the public.

¶ 4). 
In the course of its investigation, the SEC staff determined that Dakota Plains 
became a publicly traded company as a result of a reverse merger on March 22, 2012.  
Prior to that reverse merger, Dakota Plains is sued promissory notes to several individuals 
and entities who loaned the company a total of $9 million.  These promissory notes 
provided that the noteholders would receiv e bonus payments based on the average price 
of the company's stock in its first 20 days of public trading.  (McShane Decl., ¶ 5). 
Upon being publicly listed, the stock pri ce of Dakota Plains almost immediately 
rose to $12 per share on very light volume and stayed at or near $12 per share for almost 
exactly 20 days.  The price then declined gra dually until September 24, 2012.  Since 
September 24, 2012, Dakota Plains has neve r traded above $4.24, and it is currently 
trading under $1.  As a result of the stock price during the initial 20-day period, Dakota 
Plains disclosed that the noteholders were en titled to receive payments of approximately 
$32.9 million.  (McShane Decl., ¶ 6).

 B. Jessica Gilbertson’s Relevance to the Investigation  
Based upon the SEC’s investigation to date, it appears that Jessica Gilbertson was 
involved in a number of transact ions in Dakota Plains stock or promissory notes that may 
have been made by or at the direction of her former husband , Ryan Gilbertson.  Although 
Ryan Gilbertson had no publicly disclosed ro le with Dakota Plains, he had substantial 
involvement with the company.  Among othe r things, Ryan Gilbertson, a foundation 
controlled by him, and Ryan and Jessica’s mi nor child collectively held approximately 
$3.5 million of the promissory  notes containing the additi onal payment provisions.

and shareholder communications, and a review  of other publicly available information concerning 
Psychemedics , the other Defendants, and related non- parties. Plaintiff believes that substantial 
additional evidentiary support will exist for the allegations set forth herein after a reasonable opportuni ty for discovery. 
NATURE OF THE ACTION 
1. This is a securities class action on behalf of all purchasers of the common stock of 
Psychemedics between July 26, 2016 and January 31, 2017, inclusive (the “Class Period”), seeking remedies pursuant to §§10(b) and 20(a) of the federal securities laws.   
2. Psychemedics provides testing services for the detection of abused substances 
through the analysis of hair samples.  The Company  represents in its public filings that 
Psychemedics testing methods utilize a patented tec hnology that digests the hair and releases drugs 
trapped in the hair without destroying the drugs.  
3. Throughout the Class Period, Defendants falsely represented that the Company’s 
revenues were drastically increasing driven “by  our international business, specifically an Case 1:17-cv-10186   Document 1   Filed 02/02/17   Page 2 of 21opportunity in Brazil ” and  that the Brazilian operations had a “ very positive impact ” on “ revenue 
and earnings .”  
4. On January 31, 2017, a press  release was published reporting that a Brazilian court 
had found Psychemedics Brasil, a long -time business partner of the Company, in violation of 
Brazilian anti- competition laws and, as a result, it owes a competitor millions for losses caused by 
the ant icompetitive practices.  
5. Upon the news, on January 31, 2017, the Company’s stock price dropped from 
$25.62 per share on January 30, 2017 to close at $18.87 per share on January 31, 2017, or 26% 
with a more than 5,000% increase in trading volume as compared to the previous day.

Jeffrey R Spain"	" In conjunction with the 
strategic review of the Wawa facility, Rentech is also exploring strategic 
alternatives for the Company as a whole. In addition to the
se announcements, 
Rentech is providing updates on its other operating businesses.
 
 
Wawa Facility
 
 
As noted in prior communications, the Wawa facility experienced equipment and 
operating challenges subsequent to the replacement of problematic conveyors last
 
fall. These issues have persisted.
 
 
On February 16, 2017, our board made the decision to suspend operations at the 
facility. This decision is based in part on our review of the work by a third
-
party 
engineering firm to identify necessary capital improveme
nts. While we believe that 
the issues we have been experiencing at the facility can be resolved with additional 
capital investments, we have concluded that it is not economical to pursue those 
investments or to continue to operate the facility at this time
. Rentech’s other 
businesses, including its Atikokan facility, continue to operate without interruption.
 
 
As a result of this decision, the Wawa operations team will immediately begin a 
safe and orderly idling of the facility, which the Company expects to 
complete in Case 2:17-cv-00997   Document 1   Filed 02/22/17   Page 8 of 17 PageID #: 89
 
approximately two weeks. When the facility is successfully idled, a small 
workforce will remain in place to maintain the plant so that it can resume operations 
with minimal cost and time if there is interest from a third party to invest in or 
p
urchase the facility. The remainder of the workforce will be placed on a temporary 
layoff while options for the facility are explored.
 
 
Rentech expects to incur a significant asset impairment charge relating to the Wawa 
and Atikokan facilities in its fourt
h quarter 2016 results.

was willing to p ay more to acquire the Company so that it could lock up the deal with Carlyle and 
GTCR.  
4. Having agreed to sell the Company, the Individual Defendants then had to convince 
stockholders to vote to approve it.  That task was not necessarily going to be easy, g iven that 
another party had offered to buy the Company for $22.50 per share, that AMRI shares had 
previously traded as high as $23.95 per share, and that the Company was on course for significant 
growth and profits.  Thus, in order to make the Merger price  appear attractive to AMRI’s outside 
stockholders, the defendants issued a proxy statement recommending approval of the Merger (the 
“Proxy Statement”) that contained materially false and misleading information and omitted other 
material information that wa s necessary to make the information that was disclosed not misleading.  
5. Most notably, the financial projections contained in the Proxy Statement, and relied 
upon by the Board’s financial advisor in opining that the Merger price was fair to stockholders, 
are inconsistent with the Company’s true plans for growth, as shown by defendants’ own prior 
statements.  While the Company had told investors it would reach $1 billion in revenue within the 
next few years, the projections used to justify the Merger forecast that the Company’s revenue 
would not have reached $1 billion even by the post -2021 “terminal year.”  These downwardly 
manipulated financial projections were central to the Proxy Statement and to the Individual 
Defendants’ advocacy of the Merger.  Projectio ns that were honest ( i.e. , showed higher growth) 
would have made clear to stockholders that they would have been better off rejecting the Merger 
Agreement and either continuing to own AMRI as an independent public company or holding out 
for a better offer.  Case 1:17-cv-01179-GLS-DJS   Document 1   Filed 10/23/17   Page"

Defendant ADT is an electronic security system company incorporated under the laws of Delaware.  ADT’s history traces back to the American District Telegraph Company, formed in 1874 as a consortium of 57 telegraph operators.  After over a century in business and a series of acquisitions and mergers, ADT became a public company in September 2012.  Throughout its prior tenure as a public company, ADT characterized its business as a recurring revenue business, where approximately 90% of its revenue is generated from its multi-year customer contracts, and emphasized five key value drivers for its subscription-based business model: customer additions, costs to add a new customer (known as subscriber acquisition costs or “SAC”), average revenue per customer, costs incurred to provide service to customers, and customer tenure.  In May 2016, Defendant Apollo Global, a private equity firm, acquired ADT in a leveraged buyout, after which ADT became a privately owned company and thus ceased trading publicly.  Through the IPO, ADT was spun off by Apollo Global and again became a public corporation, trading publicly on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker “ADT.”   21. Defendant Apollo Global is the private equity firm that took ADT private in a leveraged buyout in May 2016 and then quickly took ADT public again via the January 2018 IPO.  Apollo Global exercises control over ADT, its officers, and its board of directors.  Apollo Global appointed a majority of ADT’s board of directors and, through affiliated funds, continues to own a majority of the voting power of ADT’s outstanding common stock. As a result, ADT is a “controlled company” – i.e., controlled by Apollo Global - under the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies and for purposes of the federal securities laws.

CBL denies all allegations of wrongdoing and asserts th at its actions have at all 
times been lawful and proper. However, given the class certification, the 
accelerated trial schedule, the inherent risk of any trial, and the potential cost of an 
adverse resolution of the litigation, the Company believes that me diation was the 
prudent path. Furthermore, it maintains that the proposed settlement is in CBL’s 
best interest and in the best interests of its shareholders.  
 
Proposed Settlement Structure  
 
Details of the proposed settlement structure and anticipated accounting impact are 
available on CBL’s Form 8 - K filed with the SEC today.  
 
As part of the proposed settlement, CBL will suspend payment of its common 
dividend for two quarters: the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (payable in third quarter 
2019), and the quarter ended September 30, 2019 (payable in fourth quarter 2019). 
The suspension of the dividend for two quarters will preserve approximately $26.0 
million in cash at the current quarterly dividend rate. Based on the current 
projection of taxable income for 2019, which includes the impact of the settlement, 
CBL believes it will satisfy all required REIT distributions for the 2019 taxable 
year. The proposed settlement does not restrict CBL’s payment of common 
dividends thereafter. CBL anticipates re suming a quarterly distribution with its 
Case 1:19-cv-00149   Document 1   Filed 05/17/19   Page 6 of 23   PageID #: 67  
 dividend payable in January 2020 (subject to Board approval) in an amount to be 
determined at that time based on updated taxable income projections for 2020. 
CBL’s common dividend previously declared on February 25,  2019, and payable 
on April 16, 2019, will be paid as declared.  
 
19.  To learn of the shocking size of the settlement, investors had to seek out SEC 
Form 8 - K filed that same day which revealed  in pertinent part :

proceed in this way, the companies involved, and their directors, becom e virtual guarantors of 
the accuracy and completeness of the Proxy Statement.   The standard for liability under section 
14(a)  and Rule 14a -9 is simple negligence.   
10. The Joint Proxy  contained the Merger Agreement, which included a 
representation that M &T was not in violation of “any applicable law,”  including the Bank 
Secrecy Act.  Merger Agreement, § 4.9 (“ M&T and each of its Subsidiaries have complied in all 
material respects with, and are not in default or violation in any material respect of, (i) any 
applicable law, including all laws related …the USA PATRIOT Act, the Bank Secrecy Act… 
and any other law relating to… money launder ing prevention….”).  
11. The Joint Proxy was dated February 2 2, 2013, and mailed to shareholders on or 
about February 27, 2013.  By April 12, 2013, many shareholders would have already cast their 
ballots, and only four business days remained until the formal meeting in April 18, 2013.  On 
that date, however, Hudson C ity and M &T jointly announced that regulators had expressed 
“concerns”  with M &T’s procedures, systems and processes related to BSA/AML.  This was 
followed by a Proxy Supplement which was completely vague regarding these matters, omitted 
all particulars, and in any event provided proxy voters with insufficient time to evaluat e the 
situation.  
12. The materially incomplete and inadequate Proxy Supplement was followed by a 
publi c conference call convened by M &T on Monday, April 15, 2013 which was designed to 
ensur e concerned shareholders that M &T had violated no laws (a n assertion th at has turned out 
to be incorrect) and that the matter  was not a very serious one.  M &T CFO Jones stated on that 
call that the regulatory issues would delay the close of the Merger in the “near term”, and that the Case 1:15-cv-00897-UNA   Document 1   Filed 10/07/15   Page 4 of 40 PageID #: 44

6.  Plaintiff , as set forth in the accompanying cert ification incorporated by refere nce 
herein,  purchased Ruhnn  ADSs  pursuant and/or traceable to the IPO and was damaged thereby . 
7. Defendant Ruhnn describes itself as an e -commerce retailer and so -called “key  
opinion leader” facilitator based in H angzhou, China. Ruhnn conducted the IPO in New York 
and the ADSs sold in the IPO trade in New York  on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol 
“RUHN.” The  Company maintains a dual voting class structure designed to concentrate control 
of the Company in  the ha nds of Company insiders out of proportion to their economic stake in 
Ruhnn. Class B shares,  which wer e exclusively held by Company insiders, each have ten votes 
per share, as compared to  Class A shares, which entitle their holders to only one vote per shar e. 
Each Ruhnn ADS sold in the  IPO represents five Class A ordinary shares of the Company. After 
the IPO, Class B shareholders  were estimated to control 88.2% of the Company’s voting control, 
and thus to dominate Ruhnn’s  activities and affairs.  
8. Defendant Min Feng (“Feng”) was the Chairman of the Board of Directors of 
Ruhnn  (the “Board”) at the time of the IPO. He is also a founder of the Company. Prior to the 
IPO, defendant Feng owned over 29% of the voting power of the Company. Through his 
owner ship of  Class A and Class B shares, defendant Feng maintained 50.1% voting control of 
the Company  following the I PO. His ownership of Class B shares provided defendant Feng with 
disproportionate  voting control over Ruhnn as compared to his economic stake i n the Company .

CASE NO. ______________ , PAGE 5 Chief Science Officer, and inventor of Co- Diagnostics’ technology, Brent Satterfield, Ph. D., was 
absent from the call and did not address the allegations after boasting to the market about Co-
Diagnostics’ Covid- 19 testing accuracy in press releases in the weeks leading to the company’s 
earnings announcement.   
14. That evening, in response to other drug companies’ widely- reported test accuracy 
struggles, financial news services began reporting that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
announced publicly that no Covid- 19 test is 100% accurate . Of course, this announcement by the 
FDA undermined Co- Diagnostics’ claims about its tests’ perfect accuracy.  
15. When  markets opened on May 15, 2020, the stock slid to $15.80 per share.  The 
stock never rebounded, and today trades at severely reduced volume for between $15 and $16 per share, with expectations that the stock will trend lower due to the company’s product not being what it promised, public skepticism, and the realization by investors that Co- Diagnostics was a 
flash -in-the-pan company that achieved astronomical gains by deceiving the public while it was 
wrestling with an unprecedented global pandemic.   
16. Durin g this time, and with a cloud of doubt hanging over the company’s claims of 
accuracy, Co -Diagnostics’ directors and officers have been rapidly exercising stock options for 
pennies per share and immediately selling their shares into the market reaping millions of dollars from the fraud -inflated price of the stock. The Officers and Directors, knowing the truth of the 
company’s products and its future prospects, are taking their profits at cost to the public markets before the company inevitably becomes a penny stock once more.  The investing public at large does not have the luxury of purchasing its shares at penni"

6. Such a sales process, or lack thereof, clearly indicates that the only end -goal 
acceptable to the Defendants was an acquisition of China XD  by Faith Dawn  and Han.  
7. In approving the Proposed Transaction,  the Individual Defendants have breached 
their fiduciary duties of loyalty, good faith, due care and disclosure by, inter alia , (i) agreeing to 
sell China XD  without first taking steps to ensure that Plaintiff and Class members (defined below) 
would obtain adequate, fair and maximum consideration under the circumstances; and (ii) 
engineering the Proposed Transaction  to benefit themselves and/or Faith Dawn  without regard for 
China XD ’s public stockholders .  Accordingly, this action seeks to enjoin the Proposed 
Transaction  and compel the Individual Defendants to properly exercise their fiduciary duties to 
China XD  stock holders . 
8. Next, it is clear that the  Proposed Transaction was engineered by Han to gain 
complete control over the Company by any means necessary, a goal which, as the Preliminary 
Proxy reveals, he has had since at least 2017 .   
9. In violation of Federal Securities laws and in  further violation  of their fiduciary 
duties , Defendants caused to be filed the materially deficient Preliminary P roxy on June 22 , 2020  
with the SEC in an effort to solicit stockholders to vote their China XD  shares in favor of the Case 1:20-cv-05156-AT   Document 6   Filed 07/07/20   Page 3 of 30 4 Proposed Transaction .  The  Preliminary  Proxy  is materially deficient, deprives China XD ’s 
stockholders  of the information they need to make an intelligent, informed and rational decision 
of whether to vote their shares in favor of the Proposed Transaction, and is thus in breach of the 
Defendant s fiduciary duties .  As detailed below, the Preliminary Proxy  omits and/or misrepresents

Michigan.  As indicated on the certifications submitted herewith, Plaintiffs purchased Bayer ADRs

18. Defendant Bayer is a multinational pharmaceutical and life science company.  
Incorporated under the laws of Germany, the Company maintains its corporate headquarters in 
Leverkusen, Germany.  As explained on Bayer’s website, ADRs “are a U.S. dollar-denominated 
form of equity ownership in a non-U.S. company” and “are an instrument used widely by non-
U.S. companies to offer and trade their shares conveniently and efficiently in the U.S. equity 
markets.”  Bayer ADRs represent Bayer ordinary shares and as of September 20, 2017, when Bayer 
performed an ADR ratio change, four Bayer ADRs correspond to one Bayer ordinary share.  Bayer 
ADRs are registered by Bayer with the SEC on Form F-6 and are issued by a U.S. bank, The Bank 
of New York Mellon, acting as depositary.  Since September 27, 2007, Bayer ADRs have traded 
in the U.S. over-the-counter market under ticker symbol “BAYRY.” Case 3:20-cv-04737   Document 1   Filed 07/15/20   Page 6 of 27CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS

because IIPR’s stock price is contingent on the financial health of its 
tenant po rtfolio and the ability of its cannabis  companies to continue to 
pay high lease rates over the next 15 –20 years.

properties in IIPR’s portfolio by square footage.

Plummeting stock prices are particularly problematic for cannabis 
companies for whom traditional debt financing is  either inaccessible 
or prohibitively expensive. Rather, cannabis companies must typica lly 
issue equity. When their  share prices decline, they are forced to issue 
equity at lower prices, further depressing their share price and further  
increasing their cost of capital. It creates a vicious cycle.
