"A friend of mine ""borrowed"" my car without my permission, meaning he stole my keys and took my car to run an errand, but later returned both.  Is there legal action that could be taken?  The state this occurred in is Georgia."	Yes
"Hi guys, sorry if this takes a while to read. I thank you for your patience.  To make a long story short: two months ago, someone messaged me asking for help with an investment fund. He said that he had spend 13 years working on an software trading program that accurately predicts the foreign exchange market. I realized that he was woefully unprepared to run or manage a fund and consulted him on how to set up a fund. He likely was not going to pay me but that's fine, I wanted him to succeed as accomplish his goals. I later realized that it was very unlikely he had programmed an worthwhile arbitrage code, as he claimed to have, because he showed a lack of understanding for basic macroeconomic concepts. Furthermore, his trading policies involve SEC violations and using boiler room tactics for obtaining funding. Additionally, he nonchalantly expressed that he could choose however much to give back to investors, whenever--indicating a ponzi scheme like distribution. When I expressed my disagreements, he commanded me to get back in line and told me to get him ""operating capital"" for his fund. He had also mentioned knowing cartel members (with implied threat), and saying that he wanted to work with them, thus signaling a money laundering scheme. I requested that he stop what he was doing and told him that I will not be providing him with operating capital. He then told me that he had recorded all of our conversations and will release all my information public (where I work, live, etc.). He will then call my workplace and pretend to be a client being harass by me, as well as actively seek out my clients and harass them. The gist of his intent is that it'd be easier for me to bribe him to stop, then to file all the legal proceedings to sue him. Furthermore, he is seeking out attorneys to assist him in harassing me as well as file a lawsuit for having called what he was doing a ponzi scheme.  --- My question is this: Assuming that he finds a corrupt attorney willing to assist him, do I have the grounds to sue this attorney for morality clause violations?"	Yes
"I was rear-ended. As a result I several herniated and bulging disc. The only treatment I got from the ortho was prescriptions (anti-inflammatory) stuff. I refused the spine injections (freaks me out. I rather deal with the pain). I wanted to wrap this up last time I saw him (month 3). He says ""you should keep coming settlement will be larger if you come more"". The visits are literally 5 minutes. Is this true or is the guy trying to milk me for bills? Also in Florida.  "	Yes
"As the title states my neighbor built a full-size Olympic regulation skeet range in his backyard. Overall I feel like there is a lot going on here but I'll try to keep it relatively succinct while giving context on everything.  I live in rural Shawnee County, KS. I bought my home in 2014 to get away from the city and have some peace, quiet, and space, and maybe have a few farm-style critters. Our home is on 3 acres. It was a delightfully quiet first winter in the new house.   Late winter of 2015 a neighboring house and 15 acres went up for sale and quickly sold. The new neighbor is a kind man with a family. He stated that he planned to use his land for dirt bike trails and putting in a shotgun range for his son (who is, admittedly, quite a talented shooter). My dreams of a quiet rural home felt shattered.   Within a few months he was running skid steers to flatten the plot, had dump truck loads of gravel brought out, built a high and low house for the target throwers, and put in concrete pads for the shooting stations. This is a full-on, permanent, Olympic regulation installation. In no time at all his son was out there shooting hundreds of shots a day practicing. Evenings on our back patio or deck were filled with the sound of shotgun practice. I did not want to be ""that neighbor"" so we just tolerated it, knowing the son would be moving to college within a couple years and the shooting would decrease.  Note that I also own and use firearms so I don't have anything inherently against their use. It's the fact that this is a permanently installed shooting range that I feel is detrimental to property values and disruptive to the ability of my family and all of our neighbors to enjoy our property. It has come to the point that I want it to go away. If we were to try to sell our house, I'm certain we'd have to disclose the neighbor's range. Can you imagine how limited our potential market would be? Who would want to buy a house next to that?  I looked into the zoning of our area (Rural Agricultural) and it lists ""Gun target and practice shooting ranges"" under ""Uses permitted by Conditional Use Permit."" However, his property is subdivided as single family residential. The publication which specifies a process for conditional use permits is [here](https://www.snco.us/planning/document/zoning_regulation_20131205_art_25.pdf) and references a procedure found [here](http://www.snco.us/planning/document/ZoningRegulationSec33.pdf). I don't know how that all works if the property is already set up as single family residential. I do know that I was never informed of any hearings or opportunities to provide my opinion on its use. He just did it.  The kicker here is he just listed his home for sale yesterday. I fear that there may be some sort of law that if properties neighboring his don't file a complaint or speak up about disruptive use within a certain period, or if a sale goes through, that we will have in effect agreed to its use and waive any right to complain. I also fear that the buyer may use it even more than the current owner did.   I am about to head over to the county planning department to file a formal complaint about it and see if there is anything they can do.   Does the Legal Advice community have any other suggestions? I just want to make sure that when the neighbor is gone, so is the shooting range."	Yes
I had a very, very bad experience with a dental  surgery the other day. Woke up during surgery, surgeon held me down and finished procedure with me wide awake, no pain meds, and left the room. No other interaction with him afterward. Is this information I'm allowed to share in an online review of the dental practice?	Yes
"Sorry if my post is a little messy, this just happened yesterday and I've been a complete wreck.  A little backstory: my cat was about 13 or 15 years old (I can't recall what age I adopted him, I think I was 7 or 8), and I'd had him since he was about three weeks old, and we grew up together. I have severe anxiety due to mental illness, childhood abuse, and the death of my father, and he was classified as a therapy animal by my therapist who'd I'd been seeing for four years at that point. He was my best and only friend and I'm just beside myself.  On Sunday I let my cat outside (he had arthritis and liked to lie out in the sun for a couple of hours before coming inside, I guess it helped because he started walking better once it got sunny) and went about my day. Later as I was outside, I saw a huge Boxer dog carrying something in his mouth; once I realized it was my cat, I streaked across the lawns to the neighbor's house where I basically had to fight the dog off my cat so I could hold him as he died in my arms. I was inconsolable and traumatized. The owner wasn't present, but her mother was and assured me that she was sorry and informed me that the young child in the house had incorrectly tethered the Boxer dog to its chain, causing it to break out of its yard and run into mine, where it found my cat.  After wrapping my cat up and talking to the owner when she got home, she apologized and offered to pay for any bills, which I accepted. I called a vet, got an estimate for cremation, and everything at that point seemed as settled as it could be.  I walked to her house this morning as I was headed over to the vet appointment to ask her for the finances she offered, and she refused, saying she didn't have the money and that she has leukemia and simply doesn't make enough to cover the bills. I told her I was sorry that she was ill but she is responsible for my cat's death and she needed to take responsibility, and she told me to contact her attorney. My mom offered to pay for my cat's cremation, but now I don't have money for an urn to put the ashes in (the vet doesn't offer free urns so it would come in a sealed bag).  **Since she told me to take her to court, I'm here asking for advice. Here's a TL;DR bulletpoint with information**  **My therapy cat was killed by an unleashed Boxer dog and the owner refuses to take financial responsibility.**  * The leash law in West Virginia states:   &gt; §19-20-13. Dog running at large; liability of owner.  &gt; Any owner or keeper of any dog who permits such dog to run at large shall be liable for any damages inflicted upon the person or property of another by such dog while so running at* large.  * My city within West Virginia's leash law states:  &gt;  The City Code of Ordinances Chapter 4 states that ""no person shall allow any dog owned by him or in his custody to run at large within the city. The term ""running at large"" means allowing a dog to leave the property limits of property owned, leased or occupied by its owner without restraint. The term ""restraint"" means being secured by a leash or lead, or being under the control of a responsible person and obedient to that person's command.""  * The owner admitted fault and offered to pay for damages * The owner then refused to pay for damages she previously offered * The owner requested that I take her to court * The owner verbally attacked me when I went to her house on Monday (I don't know if this is relevant but I'm including it) * The owner admitted negligence in allowing her young child to handle a Boxer dog three times her size (again I don't know if this is relevant but she admitted to being negligent in this respect) * The owner keeps three dogs in a 3x4 kennel in the backyard, which is way too small for the size of her dogs * The owner admitted that her Boxer dog was actually looking for a different cat that has been wandering around her yard lately, so she admitted to knowledge that her dog had vicious intent but did nothing to prevent it  I can't think of anything else. I don't want pain and suffering money, I don't want to hurt her, I just want her to pay for the price of my cat's urn. I want to put this behind me so I can grieve my best friend. I haven't had a day of restful sleep or without crying and and wailing into a pillow for two days. I'm really hoping you guys have any advice, and I thank you in advance."	Yes
I live in Vancouver, BC. I think I know the person who may be ordering pizza online for me from abroad. I fired him and he was quite upset. He moved to another country a few months later. That's my evidence against him. I heard from another person that he plans to move back to Vancouver, BC next year. Once he comes back, can I have the police arrest him for harassment?	Yes
Hi all,  I recently received a notice from an insurance company stating that I caused body damage to my neighbor's vehicle with fireworks.  His wife claims to have seen me lighting them too closely to her vehicle.  Though I was lighting fireworks, I was not the only person lighting them in the area.  The fireworks I had lit were small fountain style fireworks, barely capable of exceeding 10' in height.  I have a photo of myself standing between the fireworks and the neighbors vehicle, seemingly at a safe distance.  Should I dispute this? What type of proof will they need to deem me responsible?	Yes
"So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit. So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help.."	Yes
Several years ago I received a REALLY racist email from a business in Louisiana that was intended for somebody else. It was sent from a work address, so I forwarded it to the sender's management. Management sent a very weak apology, and that was the end of it.  A few days ago, I was telling somebody about it, and found out while Googling that the person who sent the message is still employed there, and has apparently been promoted.  I'd like to go on a few review sites like Yelp and and tell this story, so that potential customers will know what sort of business/people they are dealing with. I have two concerns:  - Will the fact that this is all veritably true going to keep me out of legal trouble?  - Is the confidentiality threat at the bottom of their emails as hollow as I think it is?  Also, if it matters, the business is in Louisiana but I am in Massachusetts.	Yes
2-3 weeks ago my neighbor's dog started coming on to my property. We live in the city and the dog used to have an electric fence, but it seems that is no longer the case. The dog is on the larger side (40-50 pounds) and very aggressive. Several times my mother has had to run for the front door while out gardening because the dog will run towards her and begin growling and trying to bite. Tonight the dog attempted to bite her and she kicked it several times until it ran away. We have told our neighbors on three separate occasions about the issue and they keep saying they'll handle it but never do. We have also called our local police department whenever we see the dog on our yard, but because it is not an emergency, it usually takes 10-20 minutes for them to arrive, by which time the dog is back in it's yard/house. The police knock on the neighbor's door, but they never answer. The officers we spoke to last said they could do nothing until there was evidence the dog hurt someone or was dangerous. My mother is beginning to fear working in our yard because of this animal. I love animals, but this dog is becoming a threat to my mother's safety, so I was wondering if it was legal to shoot it the next time it tries to hurt someone in my yard. Between the police and lack of problem solving by my neighbors, I feel like I am running out of options and it is only a matter of time before someone gets hurt by the animal. However, if shooting is illegal, what other steps can I legally take to resolve this situation?	Yes
Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.  When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay.   My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!	Yes
So I posted on Craigslist looking for women or couples who will let me jerk off in their panties/thongs (yes, I'm weird).  A guy emailed me about it, but when I asked if he would ask for or if he had his girl's permission this is what he said:  She wouldn't be into it. But she won't find out either. I've cum in her panties many times and put them back in her drawer. She's never known.  I've even used her when she's passed out drunk and cum on her face. She never knew.   Is there a way to report this? If so, how do I do it and is there a way to do it anonymously?  Will I have to talk to the police myself, or can I just submit the emails?  I'm kind of freaked out right now, and would like to avoid doing this publicly because I'm kind of embarrassed about my craigslist post/fetish...  All I have is his email address and the messages.  I have not yet responded to that last email	Yes
N.CA   So I was involved in a collision like two weeks ago and my dumbass admitted fault because it was my first accident.  Talked to my adjuster (I have full coverage) and I told her how it happened and she told me that it was not completely my fault. My insurance already gave me a check for the damage of my car &amp; everything. Yesterday the other driver called me twice but I didn't answer because I was working, and today his insurance called wanting to talk about it and I told them they can talk to my adjuster if they have any questions. I'm freaking of maybe being sued, like the other guy was an Uber so he can claim lost wages, and everything I google leads me to law websites so I'm stressing.	Yes
My girlfriend with a mental condition (schizophrenia) has a friend who constantly makes her feel bad until she sends a sexually explicit image to her. If she doesn't respond to him (he lives in New York) then he berates her and curses at her.    This past day there were over 45 missed calls from him while we were spending time together. I didn't know she was doing this until she told me he was yelling again because she hadn't answered today, and I finally snapped and called him out on it. He eluded to having the images which led to my learning she had been doing this, and then spoke of how he got annoyed and mad at how she didn't send these images so he got mad. Today was the first day I learned of this. Once she learned I knew about what she did for him she cut herself so deeply she was in the ER and the other guy was unapologetic at his actions. I'm not sure if this has any legal grounds. Would it be helpful to call the police and report this? We are both 20 so are rather inexperienced. Apologies if this is written badly. I'm a mess.	Yes
My roommate and I were feeling unwell in our basement apartment for a long time. We discovered a drier was exhausting directly into our unit. We asked the landlord to fix it, but he did, and ever since then it has gotten way worse. There's a chemical smell in the air and staying in the apt more than ~15 mins causes extreme fatigue, loss of focus, sinuses closing up, and chest tightness (Whatever it is isn't triggering the CO2 or natural gas alarm)    Landlord agreed to terminate our lease and let us keep our stuff in there unpaid for the first few weeks but now he wants us to set a move out date and pack up. But I feel really bad when I stay in here. The last time I went in to get my stuff I fell asleep suddenly and woke up 2 hours later with a nosebleed and difficulty breathing.    Landlord refuses to hire an indoor air quality inspector and says he plans on sealing off the whole basement and no longer renting it. I called the housing inspector but he said he only inspects whole houses, not just the basement... so I would need to go through my landlord... what do I do?	Yes
While delivering at work in my personal car.  I was involved in an accident that was not my fault.  I had the right of way and the other driver was cited at the scene.  Law enforcement came and I went to the hospital for minor  injuries I sustained in the accident.    If the other driver is completely at fault will my ability to accept pay out be at risk since I was delivering in my personal vehicle?	Yes
This is in Brooklyn, NY. Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage.   Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,  The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.  When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.  The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife.   The body damage is just cosmetic so it wouldn't be thousands (I don't think) to fix, but it would be at least a few hundred, maybe more. I'm also really anxious about what was done in my car without me knowing and how often this might have happened. I am due to move out of state this Thursday, 7/13, so I'll be severing my relationship with the garage anyway, but I'd appreciate any advice on how best to proceed. Thanks!	Yes
"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
I was at a friend's party when the deck collapsed and I along with 2 others had to be taken to the hospital. My injuries are a severe scalp laceration on my forehead and up through my hair line. Another girl broke her back.   The house was a rental and from what I know they had the deck looked at/repaired twice. What is my best course of action?	Yes
"Okay so we were at a bar down the shore in Jersey, just us two. We have been friends for about 3-4 years now and we met through my cousin who went to high school with him. We have been going out together a lot lately on the weekends and everything seemed cool until a couple weeks ago when he called me out in our group chat about me never being the one to drive when we go out. I took it as a joke in the group chat but soon after I invited him to come out on said night with me to the shore and that I'd drive us down there.  So he agreed and when the day came he left his car at my house and we went in mine. Everything was going well the whole ride there and during the time we were at the bar. We started drinking at around 4pm and we had agreed that I would stop at 9 in case I would have to drive back (we had planned to stay at one of my friend's house nearby). Later on in the night at around 8:30pm, while I was at my peak of intoxication, I closed my eyes for a split second and rested my head back against a column that was behind me and in that moment a bouncer approached me and said ""alright, you're done."" and directed me towards the exit. So my friend followed, leaving behind the group of girls we met there.   It was honestly the most bs way I've ever heard of anyone get kicked out of a bar, if anything I would've given myself a warning. But anyway, at this point I was pretty drunk so i can only remember certain instances until later on at night. So as we were on the street, he texted our group chat (which he tells everything on) saying ""(me) got us kicked out of the bar for being too drunk. If he says anything stupid imma knock him out."" I didn't like that whatsoever so as soon as I read that I snapped on him, basically telling him that he wont do shit and to stop running his mouth. In that moment I realized that this kid had a lot of bad energy held in towards me because he started to verbally go off on me as well saying disgraceful things and standing his ground as well. Not much time had passed until two police officers appeared from the shadows and began talking to us. I don't remember how the discussion with the officers went because I didn't know I had gotten cited a noise complaint ticket until the next morning. But anyway, that's what came out of that interaction with the officers.   After the police left, we walked separate paths but both ended up at my car. When I saw him there I told him to fuck off and find another ride home, which was how angry i was towards him because we live almost an hour from the shore. So I stayed in my car until I got an answer from my other friend who has the house down the shore which wasn't until after midnight.   As I was in the car, my friend who had freaked out on me continued his hateful rant towards me in the group chat, basically trying his hardest to make me sound like a loser. So what do I do? I gave him a bunch of sarcastic responses until he was infuriated enough to write: ""I will beat you to death. I will beat your dad and your siblings and your mom and your dog to death. I have lived through things you can't imagine."" Word for word, I have the screenshot.   This one pushed it overboard for me. I called him and when he answered I was screaming and cursing him out and telling him to ""come do it then."" But nothing else significant happened that night.   After i got home the next day, he texts me ""are your parents home?"" I said ""Why?"" he said ""I have to talk to them."" I said ""No you don't, you need to get your car and immediately get off my property."" to which he replied, ""I'm not paying this ticket, either you or your parents are paying for it because it was your fault.""  I read this and out of the intention of avoiding any physical altercations on my property I said ""Give me the fucking ticket. You're not going anywhere near my family.""  He came, game me the ticket and I ripped it up after he left my property. Now I just paid mine ($290) and his court date is tomorrow if he doesn't pay it off which he can't do now because he needs to mail in a check with the ticket itself. Noise complaint tickets can't be paid online in this municipal bureau which I just found out today, if I knew before i wouldn't have torn it up. I sent him a picture of the summons #, court ID, etc. a couple of days ago thinking he'd be able to pay it off online after he sucks up his pride.   He claimed he would sue me because I ""agreed to pay his ticket"" and he screenshot my ""give me the fucking ticket"" text. can he effectively use that against me? I said that to get him off my case with the intention of giving him all the ticket info through text afterwards. When he told me he'd sue me I said i would bring up his death threats towards me and my family.   So if he doesn't show up to his court date tomorrow to plead not-guilty and actually does go through with his claim to sue me, would his case be valid enough for the judge to rule me as responsible for his ticket payment? If so, how would I go about a counter-sue in the unrelated matter of him threatening to kill my family?  Thanks in advance."	Yes
I've run into a bit of an issue with my dishwasher and I would be interested in getting your opinions on how to resolve it.  The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.  After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.  After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options:  -Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher  -40% off a new Bosch replacement.  I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?  The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.  What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this?   A 40% discount would have seemed to be a fair, good faith resolution if it wasn't for the inflated pricing and all of the associated inconveniences.	Yes
Say, if I'm to screenshot someone's tinder (online dating) profile and put it on a site where it's ranked and commented on	Yes
I'll keep it short.  Had skype sex with boyfriend of 4 years while he was overseas. He took explicit screenshots of the skype sex without my permission and I found them hidden on his computer. Was he legally allowed to take the nude photos or is it only illegal if he starts sharing them?   Worked the situation out with the BF, deleted the pictures, and reestablished my boundaries, but I just want to know what my legal rights are in case I run into this situation again.	Yes
Hi I live in GA and recently bought a car from a private seller. He hid the fact that the engine was bad by bumping up the RPMs. Is there anything i can do to get my money back or have him pay for the car? 	Yes
I've never had this sort of thing happen before and I'm not sure if I can even pursue anything. But I thought I'd put it out there. My girlfriends brother in law had to help dislodge it from my windpipe.	Yes
Hello, On July 7th I had my grandson over for a week. My property had a large population of feral cats who were extremely aggressive. I killed or trapped at least 5, and the rest eventually stopped coming around my area. I still received visits from the neighbors cat who lived several acres away) who wears a green collar. As well as an occasional feral cat.   On July 7th I was watching a western movie when my wife yelled at me to come help her through the screen door. I rushed on to my deck to see what was going on. My wife was bleeding from the hand, and the neighbors cat was hissing at her. The hairs on the its back were standing up, and it looked pissed. The cat stood blocking me and my wife from my grandson The cat swiped in our direction then slowly walked in the direction that my grandson was in as he cried. I drew my .45 (note I had it in a concealed holster, which I have a license for) and fired 3 shots into the cat, who died.   I then obviously called my wife and ambulance. She had to get several stitches, it was a whole mess. The police filed a report notified the neighbor, and now the neighbor is threatening to sue me. Claiming that her cat was docile and was not violent.   What are my options? Am I at fault here?	Yes
So I was waiting at a stoplight today and got low-speed rear-ended. It wasn't bad, but did give me a fright. My car was still perfectly drivable, even with the dings and scratches. I took pictures of my car, her car, her insurance and license plate and submitted a claim online. I didn't call the police on her because I am certain it wasn't bad enough to cause injury, and accidents are accidents, but she started being a little cagey after all of this and kept repeating that she thought some of the damage was there before, which it wasn't. I don't expect any issues and I'm not trying to get some payout, but was there anything else I could do besides calling the police to prevent me from being screwed over?	Yes
My seventeen year old daughter made some poor decisions and ended up passed out in the back of a taxi last night with some friends who were apparently trying to get her back to one of their homes. At one point, it seems she need to vomit and the driver stopped the car. Somehow, the car door was opened and my daughter, who remembers nothing, ended up hitting her head on the ground and suffered a major concussion. At that point, instead of seeking medical attention, the driver simply put her back in the car and finished the route. We only found out about this later the next day.   Is there a cause of action here? If I find out the driver was responsible for opening the car door and causing my daughter's injury could she/he be found liable?	Yes
So basically my ex-girlfriend borrowed my cat on Thursday under the pretense of needing to spend time with her for emotional support.  Then this morning (Sunday) she started sending me text messages saying that she is keeping the cat and that she will not return her at all.    What can I do here?  I've already called the police but they said I'd have to hire a private attorney and take her to court.  I have mountains of evidence and witnesses that the cat is mine and not hers, the cat is chipped to me and I have vets bills etc with my name on it.  I also have the texts where my ex says in clear terms that she knows the cat isn't hers but is keeping it anyway.    What can I do here?  I know this is a silly question but I really love the cat and want to get her back, thanks for your help.	Yes
"I'm 50 years old.  After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.  Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.  My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.  Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.  I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.  Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.  Thanks very much for any advice you can give."	Yes
I think some lawyer would benefited just to follow me around. Seriously. I have a series of bad luck despite of trying to be very positive. Just this week alone: 1. The president of a dumpster company trespasses my property. I complained to his worker previously but have no intention to pursue it. He took pictures and denied that his worker broke the driveway. He's going to call another expert into my property even after I said he's trespassing. I have the before and after drivrway pictures btw. His company worth 1 million and the damage only worth a few hundreds bucks. Lol.. 2. My multi-billion dollars employer refused to honor my promotion. Reason? Change of manager and I took FMLA recently. Lol. Not even making this up. 3. Short term renter partied in my property and violated the fire/over occupancy code. Threatening to kill then mellowing down to sue after I kicked him out. 4. Fell of a HD rental truck and tore my ACL (ER, bone bruises, etc). The back cover can't support the steps properly and the employee who rent it out knew it. Guess whos the one who got to load/unload tools..  5. Mortgage company who refused to honor the locked rate, ran credit over 12 times in a span of 2 weeks, then offer higher interest because the score went down dramatically. The same company sent the copies of credit request and show they're the only one who request it. I've dealt with many more.. IRS double charge mistake (1 year to resolve), real estate agent knowingly sold a property with many violations (didn't disclose mold, structural, etc and inspector was her brother), etc.  Disclosures: Not sue happy, PhD in science,  just wonder what the heck life at 1 am..	Yes
EDIT: This was in Indiana  Hello all. Made an alt account to ask for help.  1 weekend ago I went to a rather large cosplay convention in another city and went about my day. I went with a group of 3 and we were a Zelda BoTW group cosplay. Anyway, it has been brought to our attention that some photographer at the convention had taken pictures of random passerbys (couples, single adults, even kids!) in cosplay, and he posted our picture online to sell. One of the photos was of my group. I am the only person in our group under the age of 18, and I do not feel comfortable with my face in cosplay being on a website where someone can buy the picture. He never asked us for a waver to sign, he just took them without our consent.  We contacted the people who run the convention and they contacted the photographer, and he said its legal because the convention center is a public venue and he will not take them down. I don't think he even bothered to ask the staff if anyone under the age of 18 complained.  I know taking pictures and videos of people in public is legal, but I do NOT want my picture being sold. Is there anything I can do?	Yes
I found my name on the FCC website and my real name with my real address has a comment on it saying I do not support net neutrality. It is the same spam-botted message with many other fake comments. I emailed FCC and they haven't responded. Please someone help me, I am all for NN and this is blatantly stealing my identity for supporting something I do not believe in. Can i take it this to court?  I am from New york!	Yes
Bought a beat up house couple years ago.  Have a renter neighbor who has called cops and city inspectors at least 5 times on us.  We are only doing work that doesn't require permits.  In the past the larger work we did get permits and used contractors.    City guy comes out saying they have 3 calls about a gas barbecue that we are building apparently but actually we put in a patio of pave stones on sand which doesn't require any permits.  We assume its from the neighbor next door whom bird dogs us etc.  City said they want a picture of my non existent bbq or if we don't show them the yard they will get a warrant.      How do I get this neighbor to stop harassing us using the city?  They city guy acknowledged it was the tenant in question and that it was multiple calls.  Yes we have contacted their land lord whom lives hundreds of miles from here and she just argues that her tenants are angels.  Is this civil harassment?  Can we send a cease and desist  letter or something like this?  Can the city be asked whom is reporting these violations so we can send the letter to the correct people?  	Yes
"Context I got a really bad tattoo cover-up from one of the artists at this shop. Which is both unfortunate and confusing because she's done 2 other tattoos for me and did an amazing job. I'm glad I stopped her from finishing the shit show while I had the chance.   Now begins the task of finding someone to cover it up. This was going to be more difficult than I imagined. The artists I've contacted either want nothing to do with it, ignore me, or tell me they may be able to cover it up using a dragon or a snake. I've learned that my options are limited, and finding someone to collaborate a working design with is becoming less and less hopeful. I had one artist suggest tentacles, and when I asked if he had any other ideas he was offended and began preaching about ""how I'm the type of guy that needs everything in writing"" and emailed me later saying that ""He'd have to pass on the project"". The tattoo is so dark that another very reputable shop I contacted to cover it up said they could help me if I do tattoo laser removal to lighten it up as much as possible. Sounds like fun. No. $300 dollars and two excruciatingly painful sessions later, I saw zero results. Even the bits of the faded original tattoo you could see underneath showed no improvements. The nice lady that owns and operates the tattoo removal studio told me it could take up to 12 sessions to remove. I'm not willing to dump another $900+ and subject myself to more painful treatments on a gamble.  So I decide to try my luck again with a cover up and just black it out with a design. I've been told something organic like feathers works well for cover ups so I found some splatter like crow designs online and figured it would be dark enough to cover everything up. The same tattoo shop I got the bad cover up at has an artist named Thor there that does some really beautiful work. He's done two other smaller projects for me and he's a really nice guy, or so I thought. Now I know what you're thinking. ""Why the fuck would you go back to the same shop after the first bad tattoo? Don't you know how to learn lessons, stupid""?  Well hypothetical asshole, one of the artists there is actually a good friend of my girlfriends, and he suggested I talk to this Thor guy about covering it up for me. I call him, and he asks me to come in so he can take a look at it. I go in. His facial expression is concerning but he seems optimistic. He asks for a $60 deposit and we schedule a time for me to come in at 5 the following Monday. Thor requests some pictures for reference so he can draw a design around the dumpster fire tattoo, and that he'll send me what he comes up with so we can collaborate a design that will work and that I'll like. Sounds fucking great right? No. I finished work early that Monday and sent him a text telling him I could come early if he wasn't busy. He responds ""Nah bro"", and ""Actually if you wouldn't mind showing up about an hour later so at 6pm or so I just got a flat so I'm running late"". Sounds reasonable. Shit happens. Eventually, he tells me ""Actually I don't think that's gonna work I still have to do my first appointment before I can get yours"". So we reschedule for the following Friday at 12 when they open.  Friday couldn't come soon enough. I was really excited to get this butt butter of a tattoo covered up. Again. I had work but I busted my ass to get it done, commuted over an hour from the last customers location, bought water (over 105 degrees outside and I was on a motorcycle), paid for 2 hours of parking, and was on his shops doorstep by 11:55. Waiting on the bench, I watched the clock pass 12. I knock. No answer. So I send a text. To my extreme disappointment, but honestly not surprised because this fucking tattoo has cursed me, he responds ""I'm sorry bro I'm not going to be able to make it till 5 today"". Are you serious? I'm here and already paid for 2 hours of parking and have taken off work resulting in a loss of wages (Piece work pay). At this point I've lost trust and all faith in this tattoo shop. So I texted him back ""I'll come pick up my deposit later."" He responds ""Can't do that bro"", and my blood starts to boil. I say ""Whys that"", and he says ""Deposits are non refundable"". He never said anything about this and I didn't sign anything acknowledging it either. So I tell him ""I can take you to small claims court if you like"", and he responds ""Or you can be a man and just get your tattoo"". I can be a man really? Wouldn't a ""man"" be someone who shows up to his obligations? Wouldn't a ""man"" tell a paying customer before his appointment starts he's not going to make it? Wouldn't a ""man"" give someone their money back if they weren't happy with their services especially if he hasn't done any work for it? So, trying really hard to keep my composure, I respond ""I'm sitting outside your building right now. You steal clients money and then insult them. Not smart. I'll see you in court"". After that I get a steady stream of messages. He tells me ""sometimes shit happens"", and ""if you can't be a little patient and accept the situation for what it is then Unfortunately I'm sorry what else can I say"". He goes on to say ""You don't get your deposit back because that deposit goes towards research and development as well as the stencil has already been madeyou"". Fair enough. Except he never made the stencil. I texted him about it several times and he never answered. So I called and got him on the phone. He sounds annoyed. He tells me ""I'm still working on it, it will be finished when you come in"". Bullshit. He was going to draw it on the spot like every other tattoo I've ever gotten. Not to mention I was the one that did the ""research and development"" for him when I texted him 8 examples of what I was hoping to get done over a week prior. He continues, ""I didn't become one of the most respected tattoo artists in Tucson by stealing my clients money that's not the business I'm in"", and ""you've already had problems with other artists at my shop your patronage has been more of a hassle than anything so if you want to start throwing threats about small claims court I have to ask you to please not ever step foot in our shop again and I'll see you in court"". So now I guess the bad cover up I got from one of their other artists was my fault. Sorry to hassle you by coming back to the same shop that fucked up my arm and give you a paid opportunity to do the right thing. What I came to realize after this whole fiasco was the fact that he never intended to do the tattoo in the first place. I know this because the guy that's friends with my girlfriend that works at the shop told us ""He does that all the time. He's done it to my friends and it pisses me off"". I can't blame him for referring me to Thor. Thor does great work, and like I said, he seemed like a nice guy.   Shower Thoughts On a more personal note, this entire tattoo mess has been exhausting. I've been trying to find a solution for covering it up since the day I first got the damn thing almost a year ago. It's embarrassing to show and people constantly ask me the five WTF W's about it. This whole situation gives me anxiety, and all I want is to get it covered up. I just want a professional that takes pride in his craft and treats his clients with respect. For that I would gladly pay whatever the cost. It's been difficult to find someone with these qualities in my area. In my experiences they're disrespectful, narcissistic, and rudely opinionated. They act like they're doing you a favor for giving them your business. It doesn't help that most of these artists talk shit about one another and their clients as soon as they leave the building. The girl that did the 2 out of 3 good tattoos for me left the shop she was at before because she got tired of all the shit talking. It seems they all know each other, and it feels an awful lot like I'm walking through the fucking halls of my middle school again. I don't care about your drama, I'm just here for a tattoo.  Legal Questions Sorry this turned into a bit of a rant. Long story short is this worth taking to court? An attorney I contacted instructed me to file a complaint with the Attorney Generals Consumer Complaints Division. Small claims clerk told me that I need to find the tattoo parlors statutory agent to serve the papers too. The problem is he isn't an owner there, and I don't have his personal contact information. I think tattoo artists are like barbers where they pay rent for the chair they use. You can pay for this information. You have to pay a fee to process the claim. You have to pay someone to serve the papers to him. And then there's even more wages lost going to court. It doesn't seem worth it but from what I've learned of this guy he does it to people all the time and it's not right. There's more to running a business than the quality of your craft. I just want my deposit back. What should I do?"	Yes
Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
I am not interested in suing Starbucks. I quite like their establishment.   Out of curiosity...  Today I ordered a soy latte. They gave me one with 2% milk. Now I have diarrhea because I'm lactose intolerant. I brought the drink to the barista and told her it was incorrect. She remade the drink and gave me a $4 gift card. (Not sure why it wasn't $6 considering that's the cost of a latte.) I told her the card wasn't necessary but she insisted I have it anyway. Does accepting the card diminish my ability to win a lawsuit?   Does Starbucks give out gift cards as a sneaky method to later state the person affected was compensated?	Yes
I am currently on a study abroad trip with a US based provider ( supplied through my school ).  I was suppost to on a week long trip to Thailand with this company but they canceled it with two weeks notice.  They are giving me a refund for the program fee but I am now stranded in Thailand all alone for a week as I already have my flights and can't afford a flight home.  Is there anything I can do to get them to pay for part of my flight?  Unfortunately I signed no paperwork for anything.  I simply paid the extra fee on top of my study abroad fee	Yes
Now I will go into more detail. Two days ago I noticed a mini-tractor outside of my house, and a bunch of men with shovels and tools. I approached them and asked what they were doing. They claimed the pipe to the water main connected to their house busted, and needed to be replaced, and that they would need to dig up an area to install the pipe. I showed them my property line and asked them to go around it, which they said they would. They did not, they tore up existing concrete and left holes and patches of concrete/rocks every where.   I live in the front of an easement that has more houses in the back, I own the areas they dug in. Which from what they said and I understood, they could have gone around without damaging my property...  First of all, they started doing this without trying to contact me in any way. Which is the real reason I am pissed off. They are new Neighbors and I haven't had much contact. They are Renting the home I believe, and I don't have contact with the home owner.  What are my options... Do I call the police? Do I have to fix it myself..? It's so frustrating...	Yes
Groundwater has been leaking heavily out of our street 24/7 for 6+ months in Belford, NJ.  Water Company has been out 4 times but because it is groundwater and not a broken pipe they can't assist.  Multiple homeowners have complained to township but nothing has been done.  The water is now coming out of our yards and seems to be getting worse.  Are there any legal options we can pursue?	Yes
I know it was fucked up what I did but I did it. So I work in my dads business (I dropped out of college but am working my way back currently). There's a regular who is married, we would make small talk here and there and we eventually exchanged snapchats. Anyway she vented to me about her marriage, all the problems with it.  Short story is we started seeing each other and having sex. This went on for a few months until we were caught in a parking lot together. To make it easier to understand our families are both from cultural/traditional backgrounds, so word about our affair spread quick.  Her husband has threatened to kick my ass, gave my dad's business negative reviews on google saying they hire people who fuck other guys wives. His family started harassing me/ talking shit about me on social media. I started ignoring it as it died down but the husband wouldn't stop this shit, he hates me I get it. I did apologize.  Anyway he came into the store once and started making personal remarks to me, I had enough so I told him I didn't regret any of it. We're both from religious backgrounds and everybody knows about our affair now. I feel like I'm being blamed more than his wife and I'm tired of it. I made a mistake. I've lost friends over this and my family is angry with me. I just want people to get off my back and get this dude to leave me alone already.	Yes
"Got a letter in the mail today that the TASB had private employee information (SSN, names, etc) publicly accessible on one of their web applications.  From one of their directors:  ""It wasn't a hacking into the system, the information was essentially posted to the internet.""  The only consolidation they're offering (besides an ""oops sorry"") is a 1 year subscription to some ""life lock"" type service.  I am wondering if I have any legal recourse here.  They have no information confirming this data was obtained but there is no telling how long that information was available.  Their offices are closed so I have no further information at this moment but I'm trying to see what options we have and what information I need to request from them."	Yes
My renter neighbors are incapable of following multiple HOA rules. I've tried talking to them, they just spurt a million excuses. The biggie is with vehicles. 24/7 they would work on their cars (fluid changes, brakes, you name it) and park in the street. We've been woken up multiple times by them working on loud cars in the middle of the night.    I finally snapped, took a photo of multiple infringements, and sent it to the HOA. First time filing a complaint, our HOA claims reports are anonymous. The HOA apparently forwarded my photo to the home owner, who then gave it to the renters.   A little about the photo: The people in the photo are in the (public) street, profile view, and too far away to get a proper ID. Their house is in the photo with it's house number legible. They of course have no way of proving specifically who took the photo, simply that it likely came from my house.   So anyway, renters come over furious and start spurting nonsense about having a police officer in the family and they said taking a photo like that was illegal and they could sue me, on and on. I told them to go ahead and do whatever they thought was necessary.   Now I'm second guessing myself. My understanding of photo/video/etc taking legality in Colorado, USA is that if that unless it's somewhere that privacy should be expected (ie a bathroom, changing room, etc) it's perfectly legal to take a photo of them without their consent. It is of course best to err on the side of caution, like definitely don't go taking photos through an open window, etc. A public street is clearly uh public, right?  Good news is they've ceased working on vehicles in the street.   Tl;dr Took a photo of my neighbors violating HOA regulations in the street, neighbors got ahold of the photo, and threatened to sue me.  And sorry, on mobile.	Yes
So, my car was stolen earlier this week and was found in a parking lot last night (completely trashed, very likely totaled). In it was a sentimental item (wristwatch from a deceased relative) and some important paperwork containing sensitive personal information (SSN, bank and investment account info, etc.). Both are gone... the watch isn't really replaceable given the sentimental aspect, and the aftermath of the loss of that paperwork has/will cost me thousands of dollars between money being frozen and unable to move and so forth.   Speaking with the detective handling the investigation this morning, I asked about pressing charges if they find a suspect and he explained that DNA and/or prints don't stand on their own... if (*if*) he finds a suspect he'll basically need to get a confession out of them to pursue anything, at which point the state will press charges automatically regardless of my feelings on the matter.   So my question is, considering the items that were in the vehicle and... you know, them stealing the car in the first place... if a suspect is found by DNA or print matches, is that enough to build a civil suit on even if it isn't enough for a criminal case?	Yes
Hello all,  Did some searching through previous posts but couldn't find an exact case related to mine. Here's a bit of backstory -  Was walking our dog in a wooded area yesterday (Sunday, 7/10). Upon meeting another guy with his dog, our animals got into a scuffle. My leg ended up in the middle of it, with the other dog taking a bit ol' honking bite into my calf. Got the guy's information and gave him ours, then went straight to the hospital where I received a single stitch and some antibiotics. I forwent a tetanus shot (had a booster last year) and the rabies shot *for now*. I am currently in a health insurance coverage gap because I just returned to the states from a year working abroad (great timing, right?).  Here's what I and my family have done so far -   * Requested the vaccination and medical records of the dog that bit me.  * Provided our dog's owner information to the other dog's owner for the town's animal control officer.  * Filed a dog bite incident report to the town where the bite occurred.  * Started looking around for a personal injury attorney willing to provide advice.  I've held off on filing a police report for the time being, because the other owner has been extremely cooperative and communicative throughout the whole ordeal.  At this point I'm just looking to see if there's anything I missed or what someone like myself should do in this case, beyond lawyering up.  Any and all advice is sincerely appreciated by me and my family!	Yes
"Hello. Last night, someone broke into my vehicle and stole about $380 cash, a $300 check, two debit cards and two credit cards along with my social security number as well (I had it in my car because I had just taken it for verification purposes at school the night before). They used all the cards, and due to them making online purchases (with shipping to their home), and video surveillance at the restaurants they went (license plate number and faces) and I have a ton of proof that I am going to be handing over to the police. I suppose my question is, I want to recover this money, but the police straight up said ""it is US Government property and might as well be gone"". I want to recover, obviously. Do I need to file a civil suit after the criminal charges? Is this petty theft, or larceny? All in all, they had spent about $600 on the cards plus everything else mentioned. Do I need to lawyer up to due someone? I had no idea where else to ask"	Yes
I came back to my apartment yesterday after studying at the library to see it on fire.  The cause of the fire was determined that the back left stove was on which heated a pan which then then heated a toaster which consequently caused the outlet it was plugged into to catch on fire.  My landlord is expecting me to pay, due to negligence, for the damages to the unit, i understand im liable for my personal property damaged.  However, in the pictures i took while the fire department was there none of the knobs on my stove where on.  In addition, the outlet which was the actual cause of the fire did not have Arc Fault Circuit interrupters which would have prevented the fire in the first place.  Also my stove had broke the in early June and had maintenance done on it by that apartment complex.  I am therefore asking where do i go from here? I am a college student and do not have any money to cover the cost of the damages	Yes
I was in a car accident and the other driver was at fault. The car was totaled and my insurance is paying ~$6,000 for it and I still owe ~$7,000. I have GAP insurance so that should cover the rest of what I owe, and the insurance said the other guy's insurance will cover the deductible. I have no help for getting a new car though, can I pursue having the other driver pay for the new car?	Yes
"I'm renting a 2 bedroom in LA and got a new roommate, who signed a lease and got approved by the management company. 6 months later she said she was going away for a month and gave her keys to ""a friend"" who may stay a few nights. A month later, she never returned. She told me via Facebook messenger that she'd be back in a few weeks for a while, then said this friend wanted to sign on to the lease. I told my roommate I wasn't comfortable with her friend doing that. About a week before the end of my roommate's lease, I told her ""friend"" that she had to leave, since I needed a new roommate and she wouldn't let anyone see her room. I asked for the keys and she assaulted me, throwing me on the ground and then calling the police saying I'd attacked her. The police came and threatened to arrest both of us, I cleared out and got a restraining order. Despite this, I couldn't get her out of the apartment and I no longer feel safe there. As of July 1, my roommate no longer is on the lease, but the squatter won't leave. My actual roommate and I have told her many times to go, the police came by 4 other times and even threatened to arrest her, and the management company has served her a 3 days notice. She's still there and it's become clear to me that she squats habitually-- she knows the laws too well.  Questions-- 1. What can I do to get rent and damages from the roommate who let her in? What kind of lawyer would handle this? 2. The management knew about the squatter and hasn't acted. Is there anything I can get them to do? 3. Are there any other options besides the management evicting me and my roommate (the people on the lease) to get her out?"	Yes

"There's a local obstacle gym that we pay a monthly fee for our son to attend.  He's 11.  There are trainers on staff for structured play time as well as ""free play"" where the kids can do the various obstacles at their leisure.  During free play, the trainers are suppose to wander through the obstacles observing the kids and making sure no one gets hurt. During free play time, my son fell from about 10 feet up and landed on the safety mat.  The way he landed shattered his elbow and broke his arm in two places.  This injury required immediate surgery to correct.  He now has wires holding his elbow together.  Another surgery will be necessary in a few months to remove the wires because his bones need to be able to continue to grow.  We have insurance but have had to pay the co pay on two emergency room visits as well as the surgery and follow up doctors appointments.  I've contacted their insurance company but the rep has been infuriatingly difficult to get in touch with.  I've spoken to him once out of 7 attempts.  I've spoken to a local attorney but they declined to represent me.  I'm not looking for a million dollar payout, but would appreciate help with the expenses I've incurred.  What are my options?  Will it just be classified as an accident and I eat the cost and move on?  Do I contact my insurance company and let them fight it out with the other?  We payed a premium for an inside gym with the proper safety equipment and a dedicated staff.  Both failed in this situation.  Just looking for a solid direction to move forward in. Thanks for any advice in advance."	Yes
I have recently gone through a really bad breakup and me and my family are being harassed by my ex. She calls from a blocked number, she somehow sees what I post on instagram even though she is blocked and I'm sure she doesn't have a fake account to follow me because I am on private and know who each follower is. I would just change my number but it goes beyond calls.   I don't want to have to do it because her family is cool and her dad works in the prison system but I really don't have a choice. She has physically hit me on multiple occasions, the night we broke up she ripped my shirt off and threw a cup at my head, she once started yelling loudly that I was physically hurting her and to stop hurting her even though we were just arguing (I called my mom and told her what she was doing in case she called the cops and I was arrested), it's just a total nightmare. She is diagnosed bipolar and has been 5150'd. When she was 5150'd I let them know she had been physical otherwise they wouldn't have take her.   Do I need to put all my family on the request for protection? Can I fill out the domestic violence one if I don't have proof of the violence? Also this seems like it should be the last of my worries but I have no time I can use to take off work because I've used it all from all the stress that has caused. Will the court let me request a specific date so I can not miss work?  Any help is appreciated. I can go a week with no calls and then once they start I get so anxious and sick to my stomach. I'm already in treatment for depression and anxiety and her contacting me is the only thing that causes it to flair up.	Yes
"I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.  He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.  The day of my flight to California I texted him to confirm that he could still host me, still wanted me to come, and could still afford everything. I even told him if money was an issue for him we could reschedule and I could meet him another time.  I got on my flight, and when I landed and called him he told me his check didn't go through, and that I was on my own. I have his address, his full name, as well as some of his family members added on Facebook.  I have incurred costs from a hotel, as well as a very expensive flight back home 2 days later. I had planned to stay 2 weeks, but since he would not even agree to meet out of embarrassment I decided to leave ASAP.  Could I legally take him to court because he agreed over text and email? I had asked him multiple times, as late as before I even boarded the plane to make sure he still wanted me to come and was able to host me during my stay.   I wouldn't have got on the plane if he had just told me he didn't have the money. I'm incredibly upset by the whole situation and at this point I just want the money back for the 2 nights at the hotel and the flight back home.   Would suing him in small claims be realistic or do verbal or text agreements not hold up in small claims court?   I have him plenty of oppurtunities to speak up and potentially mitigate and costs I would incur but he literally waited until he knew I was on my way. The last text I got before landing was ""are you ok the plane?"" To which I told him I was boarding. I honestly think the guy did it purposefully. Do I have a chance at winning a suit against him if I file? The total cost for the 2 nights and the flight was $976.40."	Yes
So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	Yes
For some god forsaken reason my neighbor has decided to put up what I can only assume is industrial strength flood lights along their property line facing directly at my home.  They are probably 200ft away but extremely bright, well beyond the normal light produced by the average flood light.   I have tried to ask politely if they could use bulbs  that aren't as bright, or change the direction slightly so they aren't shining directly into my home at night. They have refused and told me it's not their problem.  Could I legally build panels covered in reflective material in front of my property to reflect and reduce the light that is shining on my property? I have tried blackout curtains but they do not completely block the light.  I obviously don't want to do this if it isn't legal, but at this point I don't know what to do.   I live in a rural area, so I'm not sure what specific laws would even be applied that I could look into, or if light pollution is even something that can be considered a nuisance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
Hello! So I live in San Francisco, CA in the Richmond district. I just moved into a new place as of the 3rd and am sharing a bedroom in a 4bd/1bth unit with a roommate from the previous place. Today, the master tenant texted me directly and asked that me and my roommate be out of the house from 9 pm to 10 pm as the landlord was coming over to fix a door in our room that leads to the fire escape, and that we needed to be out of the way as the landlord didn't know we were renting the room out (contrary to what I was told when I moved in). I was also told I was not allowed to sit in the living room either.  I became suspicious as the door works perfectly fine and I recorded this fact on my phone pre-emptively. I then took two old phones I had and set them at two different angles in my room, recording both video and audio and left the room for the hour. I came back, checked the videos- it was a full interaction of the main tenant showing our room to someone, making derogatory comments about us, implying that the room was available right now and then leaving. No landlord at all. I copied over these videos to my hard drive, then went out with my roommate to talk to the main tenant who was in the living room. She told us that she didn't know us very well, her friend needed a room, and so we had to be gone by Sep. 1, and lying to me about who was entering our room was no big deal. I informed her that I would need a written and notarized 30 day notice, which she said she didn't need to give me because I don't have a written lease with her as the main tenant. However, having dealt with eviction before, I know that a) as of August 4th, I will be fully protected under occupant/tenant rights, and b) that I can file a protest of unlawful eviction with the SF rent board, which I plan to do as soon as she actually gives me a non-verbal notice/August 4th comes, whichever one is first.  Other info: We paid our rent and security deposit in full, by check, dated, with notes, etc. and said checks have been cashed.  Texted main tenant asking for reason for eviction, she has not replied. I am not sure of how CA recording law specifically applies to recording in my own unit/room, as I placed them there under suspicion of someone entering the unit who was not the landlord. I believe that audio is not allowed, but video is- I'd just like confirmation of it.  What other actions should I take to protect myself and my roommate from being evicted and thrown out from our home?	Yes
"Hey everybody,  my friend and I are both minors who recently went fishing on a golf corse with no ""no fishing"" or ""private property"" signs. It was pretty late and there only about 5 golfers out.  We were minding our own business, walking through the rough area surrounded by trees and carrying our fishing poles when we were approached by 3 golfers. One brought a golf club with him and told us it was private property and fishing was illegal. The other guy was a little more intense and calling us names.   We said there were was no sign and we've been up here several times. We also asked if they worked there, to which they denied. We wouldn't budge and tried to walk away when Golfer 2 grabbed my friend by the back of his shirt and threatened him to leave. Before things got ugly, we dipped out.  What can we do about this? I managed to get a decent picture of the guy as I was walking away."	Yes
Sorry for the spam guys, I made an earlier thread claiming it was Customer that left it in Drive but turns out it was a Mechanic #1 instead after confirming the story with my friend.    Going to make easy simplified bullet points of the scenario:  - Mechanic #1 works on Car. - For some reason leaves Car in Drive while ignition is off.  - Mechanic #1 stops working on car and Mechanic #2 to start working on it. - Mechanic #2 starts the car (from outside the driver window) - Car rolls due to being in Drive and crashes against wall causing minor bumper damage.    Both Mechanics are now pointing fingers at each other.	Yes
Went in to get noise checked, mechanic drives car onto lift and some how punctures a tires sidewall. They want me to pay for a new tire. Doesn't seem right I should pay for their negligence.	Yes
I got into a fight at school with this girl. We had an argument and on that day, she posted on Facebook that she's was going to fight me the next day. Someone screenshot it and send it to me. Well the next day, at lunch, she was putting her hair up in a ponytail when she saw me. When the bell rung, I was walking my friend to her class when I saw her looking at me. She made it seem like she was just walking past me but I saw her friend watching and I knew she was going to throw the first punch. I was ready and she came at me. Well the police was going to charge me with an assault until I told him the whole story and showed him the screenshot of her threatening me. So I have a court day and it says crime/Traff misdemeanor. Never fought in high school. I think she was 17. No major injuries on both of us. I didn't get charged with an assault, got charged with disorderly conduct.	Yes
"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, and it's very long, but I'll give it a shot. Disclaimer: I already know I made poor choices and deserved what I got. Just asking for advice.   I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know).   Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be  a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point.   We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to  get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open.  I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?  Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.  Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did? I was terrified out of my mind..you can't just drive off with someone against their will. Or can you?"	Yes
"So I'm not sure what to do as I have never experienced something like this before.  I waited for the walk sign to turn on and went when it said to.  This girl was taking a left turn and ran right into me.  She stopped and asked if I was okay which I replied, ""I think so."" Because I was in shock, I probably didn't do everything right.  She gave me her business card and left.  A couple of witnesses called 911 and stayed with me.  The cop said she did everything right and that it was an accident, although she was at fault.  She said the sun was in her eyes.  My question is, do I have any grounds to get compensation for the anxiety this accident has caused me?  I already have bad anxiety issues and this has exacerbated it.  Also, I had to spend 6 hours in the ER, I am assuming her car insurance is going to foot the bill?  Any suggestions for next steps are greatly appreciated."	Yes
On mobile, throwaway, first time posting, etc etc.   So I'm currently in Las Vegas, Nevada on vacation. I'm originally from Alberta Canada. Tonight me and a group of girls went out for some Asian fusion. Unfortunately I am anaphylactic to peanuts. I carry meds in case of a reaction and always tell the waitress of my allergy.   So at dinner we decided to let the server just bring us food that would end up totalling $40-50 each and sharing instead of each ordering something individually. I told her at the beginning that I am severely allergic to peanuts. This allergy includes peanut oil. Server says great she understands. Awesome.   So our food comes out, one dish being chicken satay. I double check with the server that dropped it off (not our waitress) that the satay does not have peanuts. He says nope, it does not. Great! He said the dressing in the salad (which wasn't on our table yet) might have peanuts and he'll go check. So I start dishing up. I use chopsticks to put some veggie dumplings on my plate. I then grab some other food and eat it. Notice an immediate allergic reaction. Not awesome.   The waitress then hurries over and says don't eat the dumplings as they are cooked in peanut oil. Unfortunately I used the same chopsticks to pick up the dumpling as I did to eat something else. So serious cross contamination. We call the hotel paramedic and an ambulance. I spend about three hours in the hospital for observation. I gave myself my epipen and Benadryl at the restaurant. They gave me prednisone at the hospital. Had an IV and fluids given.   My question is do I have any grounds to sue? I'm pretty pissed since we're here on vacation and I felt like shit. I do have travellers insurance so the hospital stay will be covered by them. I'm really just curious what my options are. Thanks!  TLDR; told restaurant about peanut allergy, served food with peanuts, spent evening in the hospital emerg.	Yes
Currently residing in NYS and have been having on and off problems with our neighbors. We rescued our dog over a year ago and as a result of going through whatever she went through, she is experiencing problems with anxiety and fear of other dogs. We have been working with a certified trainer for almost a year and have been making great progress. We use a gentle leader, which goes around her face, and due to her dominant tendencies she will paw at it trying to get it off randomly and this sometimes leads her to stand on two back legs with us trying to calm her down. Anyways, when walking we have gotten a lot of positive feedback from neighbors about how well we're doing and the progress we've made. Except for one. The male and female that live a few houses down decided to approach us aggressively saying that we're abusing our dog and swearing, screaming, but not getting too close to us. Even when we tried to explain the training situation, they didn't want to hear it and kept yelling, so we went into our house. This happened about a month ago and due to feeling threatened at the time, we called the police within an hour of it happening. The officer showed up and after telling the situation he said that we are within our rights to train our dog how we want and if they approach us again to tell them to go away. Fast forward to a few days ago. We were walking again in our neighborhood walking and our dog pawed once at her halter and all of a sudden  the same female yelled something, however, we ignored it and kept walking. Shortly after, the female drove her car up and started yelling and cursing again. We replied with we're working with a trainer and we called the cops after last time and we were told we're within our right to train our dog how we see fit. She replied with we're lying and she's within her right to follow us and also said they've called the cops. After ignoring her, she drove off and we turned around to go back to the house. As we came closer to our house, the male was walking down the street yelling something, but we just ignored him and went inside. Again, we called the police and four officers showed up soon after. Upon answering the door, our dog was at the door where they could see and later the officer said that she looks fine and could tell nothing was happening. Anyways, after explaining the situation, one of the officers basically said to go about our business and there's really nothing they can do at this point and if they approach us again, to call the police again. I also should add that after mentioning the neighbors said they've been calling the police, the police confirmed that no one has ever called them.   Our question is what can and should we do within our legal rights? Currently, we feel unsafe and are planning to go elsewhere to walk our dog. We don't like this because we bought our house and want to enjoy the area, but at what costs? These individuals could escalate the situation to something bad next time, but we also don't think it's fair for us to go elsewhere to walk. Even though there wwere no immediate threats, this still feels like harassment. We don't want the situation to escalate or get out of hand, but at the same time, we don't feel safe or that we're able to enjoy our home and neighborhood.   Any advice would be much appreciated, thank you!	Yes
Original Post: https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/7m0485/mt_we_were_given_a_dog_by_a_coworker_of_my/ I know that first post is a mess when it comes to terminology and general formating.  The update:  We've been served a letter threatening legal action. The letter claims that in receiving the dog, there was no consideration. As far as I am aware, a gift doesn't require consideration. Am I correct in thinking so?  The second part of the letter, which is moreso why I am here, is that it is the mother of the doner that is claiming she owns the dog now. We have never had contact with this woman before today, when she dropped of the letter. When I called the mother's representing lawfirm, they refused to take my call and insisted that I have my attorney contact them directly. I cannot afford the hourly rate of local attornies, and am wondering if there is a way that I can force the lawfirm to accept my refusal to comply without needing to hire an attorney?	Yes
"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	Yes
Looking for legal advice on the below situation. My neighbor had a tree (about 50 ft tall) in their property that was adjacent to my garden and separated by a fence. Today they hired a landscape who cut all the branches of the tree while i was at work. A large number of the branches fell into my garden, destroying a good part of my garden and leaving a large amount of debris in my garden.  What recourse do i have available?  Am i entitled to compensation? Who would be responsible for this, my neighbor or the landscaper?  Thanks.	Yes
I was diagnosed with a blood clot in my leg in 2013. Medi clinic Doctor didn't prescribe blood thinners or send me for an ultrasound to confirm it or even suggest a follow up afterwards. Ended up almost dieing in the hospital with pulmonary embolisms in both lungs so bad I passed out from lack of oxygen and my stressed out heart couldn't pump enough blood. After my diagnosis (two xrays and CT scan later) I was on clot busters so strong I had to stay in ICU for 24 hours in case my brain started bleeding out. During my stay, the info pamphlet they gave me pretty much stated flat out that PE is caused by deep vein thrombosis (blood clots) in the legs.  Currently on blood thinners right now for the next 6 months and am otherwise healthy. I think the Dr that diagnosed me completely dropped the ball with not prescribing treatment or requesting an ultrasound to gain even basic knowledge about what was going on and to that effect it's probable the clot remained for years and moved to my lungs (been having breathing issues for the last couple of years)...  Thoughts?  I'm not about frivolous lawsuits, but this sounds like negligence at the very least.	Yes
"Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...  Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.  So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.  Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".  But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.  I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.  I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself. All I could picture were the pictures she used to send me. So without getting into detail, I got into my first fight. I regret in a way now, I didn't think I could go so far....  Tl:DR; Beat the shit out of a girls abusive boyfriend, no weapons involved. Definitely broke some bones. I am not proud of it believe me, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. I just want to know what to expect if he presses charges...   By the way, if the story is unnecessary let me know and I'll remove it, thank you."	Yes
I just noticed that another website probably copied one of my site's more popular posts (responsible for about 20% of my traffic). Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:  - The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.  - It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective  - This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.  - I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains. This kinda adds insult to injury.  Now since I can't proof anything I don't want to throw around accusations, but it all seems pretty clear to me. I'm placed higher on google, so I doubt I'm losing too much traffic to them because of this, though it may be some, but it's more about the principle. I link to their site because I like their service and recommend it to my readers, and they steal my content and a chunk of traffic.  So, what do you think I can/should do about this?  My first instinct was to write them an email, politely requesting they link to my site since its contents my interest their readers of that particular article, but maybe you have a better idea?  Thanks in advance for your input :-)	Yes
I made friends with a fellow nursing student about a year ago. We got along well for a most of that time until she started acting very strangely so I tried to reduce our interactions to more of an acquaintance level. I still helped her with school work and coached her through some NCLEX practice exams. I made sure to be very non-confrontational as she has mentioned all sorts of mental instability issues in the past and how she hates having any sort of direct confrontation. I have no idea if any claims about depression or anxiety are actually diagnosed.  We ended up with pretty much the SAME EXACT schedule this past semester. So naturally, we would walk to class together and occasionally go to the restroom together. Normal female things. Nothing she did gave me any cause for alarm. I never tried to bother her. I thought it was a simple, functional, school-based friendship.  This is where things get strange. She started acting very distant and would ignore about half the time when I would say hi and she started leaving class for long periods. Then she started leaving whenever I would even be in the same hall way. She'd leave class about a minute before it was over and not make eye contact with anyone. I thought maybe she was having a serious problem so I texted her to see if she was okay. If anything was wrong, etc. If I could help. I may not want to be best friends but when someone acts THAT oddly, maybe just a little compassion can change whatever situation they are in.  She assures me that everything is fine and then started ignoring me completely a few days later. I gave up on trying to figure out what was up or if I could help. I kept to myself. This was a while back.  I get a text about a week ago saying that she feels uncomfortable with how much I stalked her last semester and she didn't think it was okay for me to go to the restroom with her because she felt that I wanted an intimate relationship and would try something.  I told her I was uncomfortable with further contact after telling her it had been a while since I 'stalked' her and that the stalking she was talking about was unavoidable on both of our parts because we had five classes together in the same day. If she was following me or I her, it couldn't have been avoided but that whatever she perceived to be the case was simply us walking to class together. She was the one that showed up on campus on days that she had no classes and went to some of my classes with me (I had seven classes total that semester). I feel like if anyone should be scared of the situation, it should be me. I'm not, though. Just uncomfortable.  I'm worried that since this contact was so out of the blue and so unprovoked with specific details on how I made her feel threatened basically, that she's trying to set me up in some way. I'm genuinely worried because what if she's saying all of that and being so unpredictable because she's about to do something like file a restraining order? That would kill any future I could have as a nurse.  We are both early thirties in Nebraska if that affects regional laws.  What should I do? Save the texts and get a lawyer on retainer just in case? I don't understand why she would just now start doing all of this when we haven't really talked since last semester. This whole situation feels very wrong to me. I know she's a very good manipulator which is one of the main reasons I stopped associating with her so much. This all just feels too odd and specific to mean anything good.  **TL;DR-** Ex-class mate from last semester texts me out of the blue saying that she feels like I was stalking her. Why bring this up now, without ever indicating that feeling before? What should I do to protect myself and my future?	Yes
So this was a weird day. Today my S/O was driving their car past our city's downtown bus terminal. An individual on a bus stole a bag from another passenger, and then attempted to flee the scene. While being perused by security, the individual ran out in front of my S/O's car and was hit. The person was lifted off their feet, slammed into the windshield, shattering it, and then proceeded to stand up and flee the scene. The individual was caught a few blocks over and taken to the hospital. My S/O was found not to be at fault by police at the scene, with many witnesses corroborating the events. So I'm just wondering what possible outcomes there are from here.. could this individual press charges against my S/O? Could the individual sue my S/O? Could my S/O sue? Really just wondering about any possible outcome.	Yes
"Hey there /r/legaladvice. Using a throwaway here.  Around February of this year I was contacted by a friendly acquaintance I had known for years asking me if they could stay with me for a convention in the area that we would both be vendors at. I told them that sure, they could, and I had no problem with it. Convention comes and goes, and then about a week afterwards there was some fallout and we decided to go our separate ways.   The fallout had nothing to do with the convention but of a personal matter.   This person made it clear in no uncertain terms that they didn't want to have anything to do with me anymore, and I respected that wish and never contacted them again.   I've never once talked about this person online, blasting them, or even ""vaguebooked"" about them.  During the time this was happening, and every few weeks like clockwork, this person would send me some very nasty texts and emails, commenting on what a horrible person I was, etc. I never replied (in kind or at all) and just let them rant and rave. It finally died down a bit until this last week.  Here's where the income thing comes in.   We're both members of a fairly niche convention circuit. There's about half a dozen shows over the next few months we're both supposed to be vendors at. As far as I was concerned, the matter was closed; I sell my stuff, you sell yours, and we have the professionalism to ignore each other and get on with our lives.  Two days ago I got a very long text message filled with more ""commentary"" and a threat that if this person sees me at the next show, that ""there will be trouble."" I have no intention of interacting with this person and I finally broke my silence and emailed them, stating that I had no desire to have anything to do with them, but I wasn't going to cancel my spots at the next few shows just because they were going to be there. I also stated that they were not to contact me again, and if they did, I would consider it harassment and do what I needed to legally protect myself. I blocked this person on all social media, blocked their email, and blocked their number from my phone.   I got over this whole thing months ago, and I've already moved on from it chalking it up to a lesson learned.  This morning I have a few showrunners for this next event and a few after it contact me to ""get my side of the story"" because this person is now reaching out to them saying they feel threatened by me. In short, they're trying to get me booted as a vendor from these shows. If this happens, I stand to lose a lot of speculative income, and I'll lose the very *real* income of the thousands of dollars I've paid to secure my spot at these shows.  This person has more ""pull"" in the circuit than I do. They've been doing it for a few years and I've only been doing it for a little over one, and upon doing some digging, they have indeed gotten people banned from shows. I don't know the circumstances behind those, but I do know it's been done.  I'm unsure what to do here. I've taken a lot of written abuse from this person (all of which I've saved) off and on for months now but simply let it roll off my back because I've had other things to focus on and I never made any reply to any of it until the email I sent last night.  This convention circuit is a source of secondary income for me but it is the *only* income this person gets. I'm not trying to get this person banned from any shows ""before they get me banned"" because I absolutely *do not* want their income to be affected. I was willing to let all the verbal abuse go, but now this person is seriously making threats that could affect my income.  I just want to be able to sell my stuff in peace. That's all.  What are my options here? I'm in AZ, this person is in OR."	Yes
Earlier this week, I opened my front door to let my dog out into our fenced in yard, and the mailman was standing on the front porch with a package.  As you might expect, my dog (50 lb 10 year old mutt) was startled and started barking, and before I could react we were both pepper sprayed, the dog lunged, and the mailman fell down the front steps trying to run away.  The dog didn't bite him, but he did skin his knees and was limping when he left.  It was a substitute mailman, my normal mailman leaves packages outside the fence, but had apparently not bothered to tell the substitute that my yard has a dog.  My dog has never bitten anyone, so bite history isn't an issue.  How much risk am I at for being sued, and is there anything I can to do to prevent this from becoming a problem?	Yes
"I have been taking care of her, charging her phone, making her eat (because she will not go to the doctor and we decided that she was very lucid and all we can do is hold her hand at this point and give her her wishes (She is 85).  Her ex-DIL called tonight and started yelling and screaming at her to move to Utah or she would be there in 2 days with a gun.  I heard this.  This woman was so beserk screaming she would call police on ME saying I was scamming her ex-MIL.  She had my friend so hysterical crying that I took the phone and hung up and for the next 2 hours she called every 5 minutes.  My friend can't walk right now and her right arm ""lets her down"" as she says, but she is perfectly mentally clear, singing me old pub songs and hymns in Latin, challenging me to mathematical equations and Suduko.  She is fine mentally, but is this elder abuse?  I would think maybe an ex-wife isn't really part of the family anymore.  She has been doing this for 2 months and my friend is scared of her and doesn't want to move to Utah.  She wants to stay put and maybe have someone move in as she is being reasonable about her situation.  I am going in the morning to write down and report the frequency of the crazy ex-in-law's phone calls every night, but should she hire an attorney?  She's very scared of this woman."	Yes
"Hello guys. My friend just came over to my house almost in hysterics - about to cry. 300'pound guy who doesn't shotput for NCAA...not exactly somebody who gets like this very often. I asked him what was wrong, and he explained the situation, which I will detail below.  He said that he was on Seeking Arrangement, which is a type of dating site. He was using a picture of and pretending to be a female that we both know - we went to HS with her. While he was doing this, he struck up a conversation with a guy and they exchanged numbers, he texted him for ""shits and giggles"" supposedly. Well, that guy eventually found out that it wasn't actually the girl and instead it was him. my buddy said that he didn't admit to it or anything over text, despite the guy urging him to admit what he did. What are the repercussions for this? I'm sure it's illegal to some point, but what action could this guy take against him? Thank you everyone. I very much appreciate any help offered here and I'm sure as hell that he will too...lol. You can save the ""what is he, gay?"" Comments, I've already given them to him twenty times over. Here are the messages that the guy sent to my friend:  ""Can we FaceTime? If that's okay"" ""Are you hiding something?"" ""Okay, I'll ask you the last time before I take action against you"" You have fifteen minutes to confess what you've done"" ""Bro, why. Like you know you would've been caught.""  My buddy didn't reply to any of these and has declined calls from this man, which I believe is the right move but I could be wrong. Thanks again for any help."	Yes
"Note: Posted in r/relationships and r/askto first, someone suggested you'd be a better resource.   Hey Reddit,  I live in a condo in a town about 45 min north of Toronto, Canada. My neighbors (we share one of those metal walls on our balcony, so sound basically is like it's right beside each other) they were blasting music from about 3pm to 11:07pm on Sunday night, specifically to affect us. I found out from their drunk rants back and forth that they are upset that I sometimes play metal music after work (I've never got a complaint from them before). I'll play music sometimes off my cell phone or off my TV, but they had a very loud sound system blasting oldies rock (van halen, AC/DC, etc) all day, while making jokes like ""hey Rocco think we should play some screamo music instead?"" He'd say ""nah I hate that shit, this is real music"". It's a man and woman, probably at least late 50s, my wife and I are mid 20's. (and Disturbed/System of a Down/ Otep is the music I think they're complaining about, certainly not screamo!)   Eventually we complained to security twice, they only answered the door to security for the first complaint, which I made on my way out of the building for a rec league sport I play downtown. My wife ended up feeling unsafe as she heard them after the complaint ""they don't know who they just fucked with, they'll regret this"", ""I'll fuck them up every chance I get"", ""we'll complain to security about every little thing they do now"", etc - those were all told to the security guard and added to their file (whatever that entails).   While I was out my wife went down to complain the second time, the male neighbor walked out of the parking garage, visibly intoxicated, was most likely driving just before that. He saw my wife making the complaint, both her and the security guard noticed that he almost fell over he was so drunk. I probably would have called the cops right then if I had seen that but neither of them did, pretty sure it's too late now.   According to my wife they then made more veiled threats to us talking with each other, my wife got scared and called me and I left my game early to come home. Neighbors continued drinking and playing music until 11:07pm, their son came out at around 10:30 and told them they should be careful because 11pm (official noise complaint time) was coming up, they just laughed at him (I'm guessing he's around 15ish, and I hear him smoking bongs on the balcony pretty often). He came out at another point and asked if they had any batteries and they just laughed at him and said ""what do you think we are, the dollar store?"" - obviously they're not the best parents and really drunk.   I took recordings with my phone of the loud music and backed them all up on iCloud. Even in the bathroom on the opposite side of the unit (950 sq ft), with my cellphone music at full blast and the fan on I could hear deep bass. Security entered our unit both times (at my wife's request) and noted the loud volume we could hear inside.  These neighbors are in at least their late 50s, maybe older. They don't seem to work at all, sound like they're straight out of Sunnyvale trailer park and best friends with Jim Lahey, they really just drink and smoke cigarettes all day. They and I smoke cigarettes so we're outside often at the same times (I've never talked to them before, I don't even know what they look like, but wife does). They rent, we own. Security guard told my wife that they and their landlord will be sent a complaint letter.   I'm worried that they'll cause more problems in the future, especially if I have music on that they can hear, it's the summer and I like to have the windows open and some music on for like half an hour when I get home from work most days, but I don't even own a stereo that could play music at even half the volume they had theirs on at today. I'll likely stop that or at least cut this back now.   Any suggestions? I'll call the cops if I need to (if this persists) but I really don't want to cause even more issues, these people sound like really vengeful children. I found the website for Toronto bylaw and it says noises at anytime, not just after 11pm that effect ""quiet enjoyment of a home"" can be grounds for a cop call, but  a) we're in a nearby town and I'm not sure if the bylaw is the same (couldn't find that online) and  b) we like to make noise too, we have the occasional party or times with loud music (but not as loud) - difference is if we get a complaint we've turned it down and apologized, not turn it up and make threats and loudly complain all day (only got one noise complaint in this building from a different neighbor and did exactly that, but have got some at past residences and did the same)  Any ideas Reddit?   Tl;dr - condo neighbors (who share balcony with metal wall between) wanted to get back at me for listening to normal-Volume music by blasting really loud oldies rock from 3pm to just after 11pm while drinking, we could overhear them making non-specific threats against us, wife got really scared. One of them likely drove really drunk during the day, but no proof of that."	Yes
So this morning I woke up and let my 2 dogs out to go potty. They are both very small dogs, a chihuahua and a yorkie. I went back upstairs to get ready for work when I heard what I thought to be my two dogs fighting with each other.   So I came downstairs again, holding my 8 month old this time  and checked my back yard. This is when I saw the neighbors dog had my chihuahua in its mouth by the belly and was flinging her around.    I yelled for my husband to come down , he opened the door and the dog ran into their property through the hole he had made in the fence.    I didn't initially open the door since I didn't want him to charge at me while I was holding my daughter.  My husband then told me to call the police while he tended to our dog who could barely even move.   When the police officer arrived he was really mad. He said he has had calls about these neighbors multiple times for their dog. It is illegal to own a Pitbull in our county. And he said they cited them multiple times for it. He took our statements and went to speak with them. He took their dog in his patrol car.   The officers gook pictures of the fence, my dog and theirs. I did as well.    We took my dog to the vet and she passed away a few hours later.  I called the officer to let him know so that he may add it to his report.   I am not sure what our next step should be. I am worried about retaliation from them since they have caused problems before.    We have our suspicions about the death of our other chihuahua, and we think they might have fed her marijuana. The vet said she had died of marijuana poisoning (?). No one in our house smokes, but we know that they do since they do it in their front porch often.    It is too late to do anything about that but I feel they will try to hurt our other dog since this happened. We plan on getting cameras to monitor the back yard.    The officer suggested I take them to court over the vet bills (this was before our dog died). I don't know how any of that works.   We just bought our house a year ago so moving is not an option. They are renting, so I don't know if this is grounds for eviction from the landlord.    Please tell me what my next step should be.	Yes
Hello,  I am suing my previous employer for wrongful dismissal in the provincial court of alberta. I am not suing for defamation however it appears I have enough evidence to do so. If i chose to sue for defamation, I would then have to transfer this case to the Court of Queen's Bench. This would mean I would have to hire a lawyer and etc, and would be too much hassle.   My question is that can I still get punitive damages in small claims court due to defamation, specifically the manager disparaging my reputation to my coworkers. I am not interested in general defamation damages.  Thanks.	Yes
"This ""Dog Shelter"" is threatening legal action against my sister and her husband for supposedly ""killing their dog for no reason"", or ""because they were having a baby"", and posted on their facebook page resulting in people also sending hate messages and threatening to kill my sister, and her husband. My sister has official documents from the animal hospital explaining why the dog was actually put down due to an unknown problem that had started leaving the dog blind, deaf, and suffering. We are pretty sure it started from a text my sisters' husbands' adoption sister got from my sisters' husband about them not being sure if they should give the dog away or try to train him around the baby, resulting in the adoption sister assuming they put the dog down because of that and knowing someone at the adoption center? The Center claims to have ""proof"" even though my sister has official documents. Can the shelter actually ""take them to court/sue them"" as they say, and can my sister do anything about the shelter posting their images and profiles online threatening them?"	Yes
"Was at walmart last night and was walking up the frozen food isle to start heading to check out. Right as I reached the end of the isle I slipped smacked the side of my face along my jaw against the freezer door, landed on my butt and hit my left elbow, ankle and tailbone. Along with catching my toe on one of those end racks. Thankfully a friend was with me and helped me up. The back of my pants were soaked. Sure enough I slipped in a puddle of water. Now it had been raining, so I grabbed the first employee I saw and let them know I was injured and there was water on the floor. He spoke no English and didnt understand I needed a manager. I had to almost drag him to where I fell to even get him to pay attention. He still didn't call a manager. Went to customer service and they were gonna make me wait. So we went to jewelry where someone finally called a manager. Waited 10 min before they came up. She handed me an incident report and asked where it occurred. I told her the location and her reply was ""we have busted pipes up there that leak and need to be fixed"" and I was not the first injury. So they know there's a leak, and have neglected to fix it or put up a sign. I currently have no insurance but my jawline to my temple is killing me, my elbow hurts and it feels like I tore something in my left shoulder. What happens if I go to a doctor seeing as I don't have insurance? would walmart need to pay my medical bills. Could I sue for negligence? Or what can I do. Thank you for any and all advice in advance. I'm in Dallas Texas."	Yes
"I own an SEO company and we do legit work.  We have been in this space since 2007 and have had 0 complaints and no chargebacks.  A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results.   2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.    After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.  Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.  He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..    My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.    We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.  We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.  Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.   TL;DR client hired us and did a chargeback which we won, now is threatening legal action in the form of criminal complaints if we do not refund him."	Yes
"Hi reddit, I'm posting on behalf of a friend of mine that can't access the Internet so sorry if this doesn't make sense but I'll try. My friend's phone was dropped into water by her manager at work. The manager asked if her phone was waterproof, she said kinda and that was it. She wasn't aware of how bad the damage was until she tried to charge it after work. This caused her house to short circuit. She had an electrician come in then he called some other guy and he said it will cost $20,000 as the whole house will need to be rewired. Now I'm not sure if that number is realistic, I'm also not sure what they should do as they have just finished paying off their mortgage. When my friend told her manager what happened he basically said ""if this is you trying to get money from me don't even try"" so yeh. Also this happened in NZ if that helps and my friend is not a legal adult yet."	Yes
Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
Roommate flew into a rage this evening about a lamp I broke and wound up punching me three times in the face. I did not return any strikes, he proceeded to call the cops.   I did not stick around for the police to arrive for the reason below, which is why I need advice.  I've been effectively homeless for the last 2 months, crashing on couches and paying people a pittance with no lease etc. I've spread the love across a number of couches so no one friend gets too sick of me. Being homeless is the result of me having been kicked out of previous living quarters during an event for which I am now on unsupervised probation.  The only condition of my probation is to notify them of address changes... Well they've been so frequent and entirely unofficial that I am technically in violation of my probation. Thus why I didn't stick around for the cops.  Having reached a safe location for the evening I was able to examine myself further and I probably have a broken nose, but have no insurance or funds for medical attention (and refuse to use the ER for shit like this, I'm not dying). I would absolutely like to file charges however I suspect I'm fucked on being able to do so because of the afforementioned probation issue.  Help please?	Yes
Hello. Pretty short question. I live an apartment complex in Vermont and the septic tank busted. Causing a sink hole of sewage in the back yard. We have been given no notice that they are going to do anything about it. We live by a river, and I am unsure if the sewage is seeping into the river.   I am unsure what I can do, so any info you can provide is greatly appreciated. Thanks!	Yes
My dogs got into my neighbors yard and now she is claiming they did $300 of damages. I fixed the fence already and she's still asking for more money. Can I just ignore her or can I get in trouble with law?	Yes
"here is an update to anyone who is curious link (here) [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6mckz3/girlfriend_had_her_butt_grabed_by_a_mcdonalds/]. So today we filed a police report, the officer said that they would not go for any sexual battery type charge but rather a class C misdemeanor assault charge. That is honestly fine by me, i just want some form of punishment for ""Tyrone"" so he knows that it's not okay to grab women who don't want to be grabbed. They said they would review the tapes and im hoping to god that the cameras caught it, there is two cameras in the lobby but this was over at the drink station so they might not be able to see the physical contact that occurred. I also called the Mcdonalds corporate office and the lady seemed very understanding and polite and said that her supervisor would launch an investigation and review the tapes and contact the Franchise owner immediately. I told her that the police were already investigating and all that happened. We have no interest in sueing mcdonalds or the guy who did this, i just want him to maybe get a fine and lose his job.With that said i am tempted to call the DA's office once he is charged with the Class C assult to see if they could possibly bump it up to class B or something. Feel free to give any advice or ask questions, once this is all over i will post a final update."	Yes
"Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos.   He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
Long story short when I was younger my mother cheated on my father with a new man who would do drugs together with my mom and abuse her right infront of me. My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway.   What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all. Like get some sort of financial compensation, and move far away.	Yes
My partner co-owns a popular restaurant in our city, and I tend to deal with the general complaints and inquiries that we recieve.   Recently, a woman contacted us over Facebook complaining that she and her friends got food poisoning from our restaurant. [Here's an album of our conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/1OIvv)   In order to prove food poisoning, you must first provide evidence that the food you ate was contaminated, and that this contamination caused you to fall ill. Typically a customer would call their local health committee in order to have an inspection done, which she hasn't. We issued an inspection ourselves, regardless of always having an incredibly clean restaurant with quality produce and staff. We've always passed our inspections.  I actually used to work at the newspaper company she said she talked to, so I contacted the director of the newsroom to confirm that she was in touch with them. The director has yet to get back to me, but I find it odd that a customer would contact the media prior to contacting the restaurant itself. It feels threatening from our end.   I should note that neither of our servers from that afternoon remember ever seeing her, but we can't rely on their memory. I also eat at our restaurant often and have never felt sick afterwards.  Is there anything we can do about this lady?  **TL;DR: A woman contacted us over Facebook to say we gave her and her friends food poisoning. We've never received claims like this before, and our restaurant consistently passes health inspections.	Yes
So a guy almost hit me with his car while I crossed the street.  As he pulled around he yelled obscenities at me, I yelled obscenities back, and then he yelled that he was going to beat the shit out of me and started pulling his car over.  I told him to hold on while I wrote down his plates.  He drove off.  I called the cops.  2 questions: Firstly, I don't really care anymore and was seriously freaked out by the situation and in hindsight honestly don't really care to press charges.  How much is this going to cost me in time and money?  Secondly, I yelled obscenities back at him (but no threats).  Does that totally screw me over?  Thank you in advance, legal gods.	Yes
I’ve had this phone number for nearly 2 years now. And when I first got the phone number i would receive unwanted calls but that’s normal. I Would inform them this is no longer “so and so’s” phone number and then would block them. Over the course of time I’ve learned the previous phone number holders name and nicknames but that’s about it. Since the beginning of December I’ve been getting calls from this woman who would call looking for “so and so” and i would tell her “this isn’t ‘so and so’s’ number anymore and then would block it.” But she managed to keep getting new phone numbers and continuing to call. It turned into this degrading competition to her to see how many nasty things she could call me. I told her the whole story. How i have had the phone number for a while and that that’s how i knew who the previous owner was but that i didn’t know him in real life and she wouldn’t believe me. She would call and say awful things. Calling me a “scary ass bitch.” “That I’m just a little side hoe” that i was nothing but a “little piece of ass” for this man. So i put her phone number into Facebook and sure enough i found her and where she lives and all about her. Mind you any time she would call from a new number i would continue to block it. Then she decided to start calling from No Caller ID which i couldn’t block. I would get 40 phone calls in 5 minutes from this woman. Continuing to leave voicemails and call me horrible things. Now she’s threatening to show up to the previous phone number owners home and “beat the fuck out of me” i told her I’m filing a police report. But I’m not sure how to go about that. I’ve never had to do this before. I seriously want her to learn a lesson. She’s nearly 40 years old. It’s not like she’s a 16 year old little girl who’s got her britches up her butt. This is a grown woman calling and harassing and threatening me and I’m only barely turning 20.   Suggestions? And how should i go about filing a report?   Thank you so much in advance. 	Yes
Hello,  I sell handmade items online and do all the product photography for my items. I just did a reverse image search of some of my popular sellers. I found a website using one of my photos and my product description to sell similar items. What is the best way to go about getting them to take this down?	Yes
"We live on a lake in North Carolina where a development is going in across the street. Our driveway is directly across from one of the entrances to this new subdivision, which is mostly finished except for maybe 20 or so houses on the side of the subdivision closest to us. We had about 2.25 inches of rainfall in an hour or so yesterday which lead to a very large amount of silt deposited in our flower beds, in front of our garage door (some inside the garage), around the back of the house under our deck, etc etc. A large amount of debris traveled with the water and much of our mulch has been carried away.  As far as I can tell, the rainwater washed into the development's street, past the silt fences, quickly clogged the storm drains (because of the silt catchers they place in the drains), and then ran straight down the street, across the road between our house and the subdivision, and then down our driveway. I ran into the developer today who fed me a line about the gas company destroying the silt fence and not fixing it properly and how he's going to see if they'll fix it and clean up the silt for us. He was very clear that he's not going to take responsibility for the runoff because ""it was a 1,000-year rain that won't happen again"", and apparently other houses had mulch washed away (which I see no evidence of). He's going to send his guys out to start cleaning up the silt, but he won't pay for any landscaping because the water would have done that anyway. Which, of course, is complete BS because the silt clogged the storm drains. It seems to us, based on previous storms, that the installed drainage is not sufficient to deal with the runoff created by the subdivision. Whether or not it will get better once all of the houses are built and grass starts to grow, I can't say.   I would greatly appreciate some guidance on where to go from here? Contact our home insurer? Contact the county? There has to be a precedent for this.  Thank you."	Yes
Hello  I live with my bf and i had a pet (dog/cat, rather not say which) for 2 years before we moved in together. Once we moved in he expressed hatred for my pet. He was willing to deal with it, it seemed. But we got into multiple fights daily because of the pet's behavior. I mentioned once in passing that I feel I might have to give the pet away (this was in no way shape or form permission for him to give away my pet, just a passing thought because of our fighting). But he said, no don't do that.   One day I go to work and I come home to no pet. He decided to give it to a coworker without my permission or knowledge. Once I expressed to him how upset this made me, he promised to get it back. Well the coworker gave the pet to someone else as a gift, but was willing to work with us. He approached the person he gave the gift to.  Gift receiver said no initially. So we offered money. Person later felt bad when they found out the pet was not a random animal but in fact had a previous owner and was given away without permission(they had no idea the pet was not a stray when they received it as a gift). But would only return animal if money was offered to recoup for expenses ($200). We paid money happily.   Gift receiver starts giving us the runaround at this point. Keeps promising to return pet if we met at their house, but refused to meet anywhere else. The whole thing was shady and weird but I was desperate. When we arrived at the residence the new owner said hang tight while I find the pet. Never came back to the door. After almost an hour we knock again and they tell bf to come inside. I'm not sure what happened at this point but there was some sort of altercation and pet was never returned. We left. Situation was sketchy and we were worried about our safety.   My question is, what can we do at this point? This person has agreed to return the pet, with no problem, but now it has been a few months since we initially started going back and forth with these people. I understand the pet was given away but the pet did not belong to the person who gave them away in the first place. And what's more, we paid this person money and now we feel left high and dry. Aside from the situation i have to deal with inside of my relationship because my significant other thought it was okay to give away my beloved pet, what else can i do to deal with new owner?  TL; DR:  Boyfriend gave my pet away without my permission. Person in turn gave pet to someone else as a gift. New owner thought gift was a stray, was not aware it had a previous owner. We offered money in exchange for pet. New owner insisted we meet at their house to pick it up (this was weeks after we paid $200 to them). Upon arrival at new owners house we were met with confrontation and never received my pet. What else can I do?	Yes
"i'm posting here in hope for a miracle. this is going to be long and i apologies but i'm going to give all details in hopes some one can help my family out. we live in beaver county Pennsylvania. i'm 20 and live at home with my parents as they do what they can to help me get through community college. we live in a three house culdesac. the neighbors next to us have been calling the police claiming harassment, shooting automatic weapons wildly, their daughter has been telling the police my parents have been screaming at her and being obscene in front of her ( when in reality it's her who has said and done everything) their dogs have tried to attack people, and they told lots of people that we grow and sell weed ( i found out through a friend while in high school). this has been going on for years and the list of accusations go on and on and we need help. recently we were just smoking ribs in our back yard peacefully ( a good 200+ ft from their property and everything) and the cops showed up. were going to court for the 5th time and this is our 9th fine. we can't afford very much my parents are on/off unemployment as finding work has been here and there the best they can ( they both being 60+ with no college degrees). the daughter is in on this one and we believe her to be 17, so were sweating any sexual related claims from her in court. the police the past 8 times have done nothing but feed their attacks with barratry. they show up, tell us were being accused of X and tell us the papers will be in the mail then drive off. they refuse to even hear our side of the story or ask the neighbors questions, NOTHING. the court has grown tired of seeing us so they dread the cases and never have a pleasant attitude in the cases ( said neighbors give them shit attitude and they do a poor job of letting us actually tell our side of the case going so far as telling my parents to ""shut it"" during a hearing once) my parents want to try a lawyer but were rapidly going very broke and i'm sending this on a prayer some one here can help us before we have to leave the house we own for a new one."

A little over week ago, my bf and I offered to babysit a kitten for one of my bf's friends. We were told by her that the kitten was 9 weeks old and was litter trained. She also wrote that she would pay us around $20 a week to watch him. When she brought over the kitten, he was obviously to small to be 9 weeks and he hadn't had any of his shots. Later we found out he wasn't litter trained. Since he is so small he requires a lot of attention and we both think that he is more around 3-5 weeks old.    We contacted her about making appointments for the kitten to receive his shots and to be dewormed, along with requesting she bring kitten food instead of the cat food she ended up bringing. Soon it was obvious that she probably just wanted to dump the kitten on someone, we asked her to come pick up the kitten. She then messaged back that he was our problem now and she was not responsible for him, and if he was that much of an issue we should put the kitten down. She then blocked us.  Are any legal options we could go about returning the kitten or even reporting the owner? Is she required to pay us the money she told us she would? We have all the text messages about the kitten. As much as we love this sweet little kitten we are not prepared to raise a cat nor have the money for all the expenses that come with a new pet.	Yes
"Hello. This sort of thing never happens to me when I'm out so I'm just looking for advice/info.  My friends and I were out at a bar last night, one friend and I were a bit drunk and being stupid, there was a cup of plastic forks/knives on the table and we spilled it over (admittedly this was immature and stupid on my end but I would have cleaned it up). As we do this a bartender walks up to my friend and grabs his shirt and demands he comes with him. So I interjected and said no don't go with him. Then another bartender comes up and physically slams me to the ground, then straddles on top of me for over a half hour. Meanwhile he is aggressively pulling my left arm over my throat and choking me, so I try to fight back and get him off me. He's also laughing at me and saying things like ""you're a faggot. You can't do shit. No one is going to help you"". Then my cell phone falls out of my pocket and another worker walks over, picks it up and takes it away somewhere.  Eventually after a half hour of struggling they let me up and leave, and I had to argue with multiple workers to give me my property back. The guys wouldn't give me their names of course.  I woke up today with a large bruise on my right arm, my left rotator cuff is killing me, and my neck is red.  They could have easily asked us to leave or thrown me out the door, but instead they brought me close to the back of the restaurant and assaulted me.   Can businesses/bars do this to customers? Do I have any legal action I can take? Multiple of my friends witnessed and are willing to testify.   Thanks so much. This was ridiculous."	Yes
I drove less than a mile to the store, I drove past a downed stop sign (it was literally on the ground because somebody else hit it) and was struck by another car. Nobody was hurt, we were going fairly slow. Damage to my car was worse, he had a scuffed/slightly dented fender. My window was shattered and the door was pushed in.   I freaked out because I know I'm not supposed to be on the road and I saw the sign I drove passed. I said sorry, claimed responsibility and we took pictures.  He seemed nice and agreed not to involve the police, assuming that I'd get into trouble. Said he had no interest in taking advantage of me, however it was a company car and somebody has to pay.   I'm confused, my parents are in the hospital because my mom got injured from something unrelated. I have no idea what to do.   I don't have money, I am disabled and subsist off of SSI. What the hell do I do? My friend guessed it would cost around 1100-1500 for repairs. I have a trashbag on my window.   Why don't I have insurance/license? Long story nobody cares. Why did I risk driving without them? Well, I'm a fucking idiot apparently.   What do I do?	Yes
Basically an obese customer was denied service since we didn't have the proper equipment to handle someone of her size. (weight limit on machine is stated as 250lbs)  She writes a bad review claiming that we really denied her because she was black since she saw another large white woman in the store (but she fails to mention the other woman was half her size)   Since her review was framed in such a way to make this seem like a case of discrimination based on race, her fb post has been shared by a few thousands and as a result we've taken a hard hit on our online reviews/scores, harassing phone calls and what not.   I feel like we could have a libel case on our hands, but I'm not sure. How do these cases usually go? I ask if it's worth it since I also don't know the process of investigation for them, and I don't necessarily know if inciting this case somewhat more publicly like that would also be good...	Yes
"This happened months ago and the hoop is still sitting there, the guy has city ties and is running for common council. I couldn't care less about It but now I have a bee in my bonnet about messing with him.   My neighbor has an illegal basketball hoop on our shared street. Where we live they are illegal and the city makes you remove them. It happened to my cousin. A city official came to my next door neighbors house asking who the hoop belonged to, and she told him it was the mans hoop. The man found out because he is in some political position. He is currently running for common council I believe is the position. He has connections to the city. He stormed into the street and started screaming ""FUCKKK YOUUUU (NEIGHBORS NAME)!!!!!!!!!!! FUCKKKK YOUU!!!!!!!!!!!!!"" He did this multiple times until we went over to our neighbor and told her what was going on. Someone had called the city about his hoop and he thought it was her. It was not. My one regret is not getting it on video. The guy is a real jerk and the worst neighbor we've ever had. He is rude and disrespectful and has a very short temper. We don't care about the hoop, it was the city who came to ask about it. We didn't ask for it to be removed but now after what he has done I want to get it removed. He has city ties so I'm sure it will be hard.   My question is, can I send him a letter telling him I have video of him acting like a fool. I obviously don't but I want to mess with him. Just for shits and giggles. And what can I do about the hoop. This guy is a real dirt bag."	Yes
Hello,  The company I am having issues with are holding my account that I have them under certain restrictions (one of which is quite serious, money related) due to a claim of theirs to which I do not agree. They want to video interview me over the internet. Not sure why they wanted to do that but there is no such thing explicitly written in their ToS. I find this rather intrusive regarding my privacy, not to mention unprofessional and quite barbaric. And no, there have been no reports of any sort of fraudulent activity on my account that I know of, my track of record is excellent there, and they have already verified my account about 8 years ago. The company is based in California, USA, I am based in the EU, Romania.  Are there any USA / EU / international laws protecting my privacy over the internet that I could enforce upon them ? Do I stand a fair chance of winning such a lawsuit ?  Thank you	Yes
My sister runs a semi popular African American natural hair blog and instagram. She interviewed with a hair company in order to join their sponsorship program, which would require her to post images of her using their products on her instagram in exchange for monthly free products. After going through the interview process she was informed several weeks later that she had not gotten into the program. Flash forward to today, I am scrolling through my Facebook page and see that this company has posted one of her pictures taken from her instagram without permission. Are companies allowed to Take images from instagram without giving any sort of compensation or obtaining permission from the owner?	Yes
"(I understand this is a very complicated subject and it would be impossible to give me any straight answers here.  I'm mostly just looking for insight.  I'm going through a very scary/stressful period and I don't know whether a consultation would even be worth the energy at this point.  Any input at all is appreciated.)  Male  30 years old  So in 2015 I was diagnosed with a severe migraine variant that involves daily episodes of head pain and neurological deficit.  No fun.  This involved a great deal of emergent investigation and consultation with several specialists.  The problem isn't life threatening but it does carry some risk-factors and it's recommended that I keep a close eye on it.  Fast forward a couple years and I move to a new town.  Migraines aren't doing so hot so I set up a new patient appointment with my current provider (a Physician's Assistant).  I bring in detailed documentation of my case and we discuss my problem at length.  I watch her (presumably) enter all of this information into her computer.  At the time she seemed pretty on top of things, referred me to a new neurologist, got some bloodwork set up.  I felt like I was in good hands.  Fast forward to the present day and things are not going very well.  I am having severe issues with my neck and the neurological component of my migraines has become frighteningly pronounced.  My neurologist is booked for the month so last week I report to her office to discuss what's happening.  We decide to order a set of MRIs.  A number of things about the visit strike me as very odd/unprofessional/concerning:  - ""Wait what neurological symptoms?""  She forgot about them.  This was essentially the entire focus of my first visit.  I had given her a printed out description of exactly how my migraine auras present and we had discussed at length how important it is to monitor these because they can mimic some very dangerous things.  She kept this printout.  I checked my records after the visit and it seems none of those things had ever been recorded.  - She insisted the weakness/numbness on the right side of my body was due to a pinched nerve in my neck.  This is despite three different neurologists previously diagnosing these symptoms as brain-related, either migrainous or epileptic in nature.  I explained this to her, which she completely disregarded when placing the MRI order explained below.  - She forgot I have blood pressure issues.  - She prescribed me a muscle relaxer which the pharmacist later told me interacts with one of my other medications.  - She said she wanted a good look at the soft tissues in my neck, but ordered a spinal MRI.  I thought this sounded wrong so I checked with the imaging center when scheduling my appointment.  Wrong indeed.  I had to call her and have the order revised.  - Upon arrival at the imaging center, a confused looking receptionist told me my provider had called at the last minute and changed the order again.  I was never contacted about this.  - When ordering an MRI, the doctor/PA notes the patient's current problem so the radiologist knows what to look for.  For my Brain MRI, the order reads ""Migraine without Aura"".  I've been diagnosed with Migraine *with* Aura for 2 years.  This was established at my first appointment.  It's rather important, because frequent migraine auras can actually leave behind lesions detectable on MRIs.  No mention of the extremely complicated, localized neurological deficits I have such a detailed history of.  - Likewise, my Neck MRI order fails to mention the severe pain I've been having in the front left side of my neck, which was presumably the entire reason we were getting it done.  Instead it only mentions the numbness/weakness in my arm which (again) already has an established brain origin.  I got the MRI on Tuesday.  The imaging center said it would take up to 48 hours for the scans to be read, and then my doctor would call me to let me know what's next.  Friday rolls around and I still haven't heard anything, so I drive over to the imaging center and pick up the reports myself.  They tell me the reports were finished on *Wednesday morning* and I must have missed the call from my doctor.  I triple checked.  I'm signed up to receive multiple forms of contact.  No emails or portal messages or anything.  There are even some abnormalities noted on the report, which I thought typically meant the patient was contacted as soon as the information had become available.  Funny thing about the MRI report, it came back noting I had ""right sided neck pain"".  My pain is on the left.  I don't know who's fault that is.  It's like they're throwing darts at a board.  So now I have these reports that I have to second-guess because my provider gave the radiologist shoddy/incomplete information about my case.  I'm taking drugs that interact with each other because it's the only solution I've been offered.  The diagnosis I spent over $10,000 resolving in 2015 is now being changed by someone who isn't even technically a doctor.  I know I haven't been physically injured by anyone, but does any of this sound like malpractice?  I don't even like the idea of suing anyone, but this illness has caused me a great deal of disability and I am now looking at a situation where I may have wasted almost two thousand dollars on scans that need to be re-done because somebody else didn't do their job.  Sorry for the length of this post I'm just very wound up about the whole thing and have no idea how much of this I should consider acceptable or how I should proceed with handling it.  Thanks in advance."	Yes
I was involved in an at-fault accident recently.  This is my first accident, and hopefully my last.  The cop told me he needs to prove to the insurance company that it was not the other guy's fault.  He wrote me a ticket for failing to maintain a safe distance.  Couldn't he have acknowledged that this was not the other driver's fault in a police report, but not issue me a ticket?	Yes
"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	Yes
I'm living in Indiana. My girlfriend was on seekingarrangements and she met up with this investment banker who said he was making 500k a year and was going to pay her $500 to meet him at a hotel. At the hotel, she gets a bad feeling about him and says that never mind she doesn't want to go through with it. He hadn't paid her anything yet. He got all angry then saying she wasted his time and had to at least suck his dick. He was going to let her leave. So she pulled a gun on him and he was scared and gave her the money. She blocked him on seekingarrangement but he had her number so he texted her and found her address and facebook and is threatening to come over to her house and report her to the police and tell them that he robbed her. But really, can he even do that since what he was doing is against the law too.	Yes
Can I get in trouble for anonymously registering a domain name (let's say janesmithsucks.com if Jane Smith was my ex) and publishing true things (I could all prove in court if needed) things about my ex wife. No pictures or revenge porn or anything like that, but needless to say though they would not be things that painted her in a positive light.	Yes
I posted something on Facebook that apparently he is upset about. Is this a threat?  [this is what he said to me](https://imgur.com/gallery/a0LiP)	Yes
My girlfriend went out to a casino this past Saturday night with a group of work friends. Apparently one of the guys in the group was annoyed at my girlfriend for getting cigarette smoke in his face. According to her, he grabbed her by the back of her neck and slammed her down onto the sidewalk. She came home with nasty gashes on her face and forehead. She's asleep at the moment, but as far as I know police were not called and she declined medical attention. An employee of the casino had her sign some sort of waiver which I'm assuming said she wouldn't bring legal action against the casino.   I have no interest in bringing action against the casino but in the morning I'm going to see if she will file a police report against the guy that did this to her. I also believe that the casino will have video surveillance of the incident as well as a copy of the waiver she signed. Will we need to file with the police who have jurisdiction over the area the casino was in? Looking for any advice on how to proceed...  Thank you	Yes
"A couple months ago in U.S. Georgia I was traveling on the interstate and a FedEx Semi with two modules forced me out of my lane. Dude literally pushed me and my two year old out of the lane. Tried to flag him down and he just carried on. Ok, that's cool, lucky me I have a dash cam. Call the cops, about two minutes in the call we cross state lines into Alabama. Another fifteen minutes later dispatch advises me to just pull over (I was still following the truck) and wait for a state trooper.  State trooper shows up looks at the footage and tells me he wishes that dispatch wouldn't have told me to pull over because that truck is long gone by now and the driver needed a ""talking to"". He also said I would have to fill out a SR-13 form because since this happened in GA and he fled into AL that the police report would have to have been filed in GA (I later found out that a SR-13 is by no means a police report and more of a civilian witness report). So I thank him, and get back on the road.  The next day I contacted FedEx and a few days after that I was being transferred between a couple different people. I finally got connected with a regional manager who said he would look into it for me. About a week passes, I email him for an update, He responds saying they're still looking for the driver (Note: I've already given them Licence# and Truck# including a pic from the dashcam). He says he'll contact me inside of two days. Another week passes. I email again, he says they're still looking, and I inform him that I really don't care who the driver is that I just want my car fixed. Two more weeks pass of them giving me excuses and I call them out saying it's been over a month. Magically they find out the location of the driver and connect me with his manager. I catch the manager up with the story over the next few days. He asks to see the video. I tell him I can upload it to a google drive and give him access. He says that's fine. I tell him to give me a week to get the video from a backup drive out of state (I was in the process of moving the week he asked) and to let me edit it to a reasonable size and I'll upload it. A week goes by and I upload it.  Now this is where it gets really shady. Get an email from him a few days later, in short it reads ""Hey, Having a problem opening the video, can you send it on a flash drive?"". I reply ""Sure, In the meantime can you explain why you can't see the video and I'll try to fix it on my end"". Well I get home and check the google drive...low and behold in the drive history I can see where the mother fucker deleted the files and then restricted his own access to view only. I sent an email asking why he did this and reuploaded everything in every imaginable format so he can't use that excuse again. I guess he assumed I didn't have another backup and wanted to hide the evidence and sweep this under the rug.  So is this lawyer time? Do I need to go ahead and report it to my insurance? (I told FedEx I'd let them fix it without getting Insurance involved, but that is about to go out the window). I have everything documented but I don't know what my next step needs to be. Thanks!"

"Il  I was stupid and lucky. I parked somewhere with free parking for an event at a con. Only rule I could see was ""No overnight parking"". I get back to my car around 1am to someone calling  in my car to be towed. He said that once the mall closes you can't be parked there and it's a big fine. Luckily he let me go.   Now, this is just for curiosity sake, but he put a big sticker on my car window. On the driver's side back one. It isn't coming off easy, it's ripping like a sticker does and is leaving behind sticky shit. It's irritating. Is it legal for someone to vandalize my car like that?"	Yes
Hi all,  My parents are currently having a problem, and I was wondering if there is any legal recourse.  There are several trees that are on my neighbors property. A significant part of each tree overhanged onto my property, and the trees both provided significant privacy and shaded the property for most of the day. The power company came yesterday and cut down those trees completely. We now have the lovely view of the trailer park behind my house, without so much as a bush in between us. Additionally, my parents are concerned that their property value (and they're trying to sell) is going to go down, because you can now see the aforementioned trailer park quite clearly, and there's much less privacy and shade on our property.    My question- is there any legal recourse for my parents? I'm guessing not, since the trees weren't even planted on their property, but I figured it's something worth exploring.	Yes
Just a hypothetical.  I heard something similar happened to the hot coffee lady.	Yes
I'm just wondering if I'm opening myself up to anything here. I bought a car last year and was told that it had a clean title. When I asked if it had been in any accidents they avoided the question. I Carfaxed the car a couple months ago and found out it was a total loss rebuilt that is somehow not marked on the title.   I submitted a BBB complaint and the owner has done nothing but make up lies, saying I was told about the damage and repair before purchase, and even lying by saying I hadn't driven the car prior to purchase.  It's ridiculous, and at this point if I'm not going to be compensated I will make sure others know about their practices.	Yes
Almost ten years ago, I took a Jiu Jitsu class at the local YMCA.   During a drill on a basic technique, the girl I was paired with broke her arm after falling awkwardly. It was a spider guard technique, done under the supervision of the teacher. Not a submission or anything, just a freak accident. Minor break, i'm not sure of the details of her injury.   This will come into play later.  A few classes later, my teacher has a friend come in and practice with us. A blue belt in akido. He, the teacher, insists I practice with this person, and my hand gets broken during this practice.   I recently found out that the person was the girl's boyfriend. and he broke my hand on purpose.   Is there anything I can do? The true cause of the injury wasn't known until this year.   I know the statute of limitations is up for personal injury, 2 years, but considering that I didn't find out the true cause until recently, would the 'clock' start when I found out this information?   Is there anything I can do legally at this point?	Yes
I lived in and worked as an RA in a very old building when I was at university. There's one very uneven staircase and one day I fell from the top of it, hit my head, and fell down the rest of the staircase. I had all of the normal concussions symptoms and was diagnosed with one.   I haven't really been the same since then. I've always had bad headaches on a daily basis but I starts sleeping poorly and had more really bad headaches after this. About a year after this happened I basically had a migraine for three months, had to stop school, and developed an eye droop.   No one could figure out what was the matter, I had scans, blood work, etc. They still couldn't figure it out so said it was likely complications from severe headaches for too long. I was put on pills and Botox injections.   A few months after that I began having neurological problems, confusion, memory problems, my handwriting got really small, and I had to stop university for the second time. Once again nothing could be figured out. I had more MRIs and even a spinal tap and nothing was found. Thy said it may have partially been a complication from one of the headache drugs.   I live in pain everyday. I take pills at breakfast, supper and night, I'm just now attempting to finish the degree o should have over a year ago. My life has changed completely. Even though I'm in Canada the medication still costs a lot. I don't get to be young anymore.  A disability lawyer said I might have a case and I'm not sure if it's something I should pursue.	Yes
"Detroit Dog Rescue brought to the attention of this gentleman who posted a picture on fb of two dogs in a corner. The gentleman explains he had to ""whoop the dogs ass"" for pooping in the house. He claims it is just a joke, but nowhere does he proclaim that I am aware of. Other people have commented that they have screenshots of him stating on fb that he has drowned the dogs and thrown them in a lake.   There is a lot to this story, but I have a hard time believing this guy actually can sue Detroit Dog Rescue for Defamation of Character when he stated that he ""whooped"" the dogs.  There might be a lot of investigation work but would like to know if this guy actually has legs for this case.  Below is the link to story.

i'm currently a few states away from new york and was not notified that my uncle had passed. i found out 3 day after the incident. meanwhile, my uncle's ex-girlfriend, who was responsible for his death (i know it wouldn't hold up in court: it was a suicide on behalf of their split) has already had him buried. she had ways to contact me, knew i existed and that i would be next of kin should anything happen to my uncle, but didn't notify me. she has been taking things from his house where she did not legally live (not the address on her license, didn't receive mail there) and i want her to stop, give back my uncle's belongings, and possibly seek legal action against her. i couldn't begin to know how to google an answer, so i came here for some direction. any help would be greatly appreciated. this woman took every dime he had while he was alive, and i can't bear to let things end like this. can i get her to stop going into my uncle's house? did she have any right to take his post mortem matters into her own hands? i'm planning on getting there in a few days depending on my finances. if i can't afford the trip, what can i do so far away? and more importantly, can i go after her for meddling in our business and not respecting my uncle's last wishes? thank you in advance	Yes

"Personally, I'm more leaning towards the mechanic (my friend) being at fault for failing to follow safety precautions.  When someone hands you a Rifle, the first thing you do is check if it is loaded, even if you literally just witnessed that person emptying the Rifle right in front of you.  In the same way I feel like a car mechanic should do the same and follow basic safety precaution, like checking if the car is indeed in park before starting.    But then, I'm not sure how stupid another human being has to be to hand someone a loaded Rifle and tell them ""Oh it's not loaded""... aka 'Let's leave my car in Drive, turn off ignition and invite a car mechanic to do repairs on your car'.  I feel like the Customer does have some liability in this case, but I'm not a lawyer.    Also, I believe it was an older car that made it possible for this stupidity to happen.  I'm not a car expert but I'm pretty sure you have to step on the brakes before ignition on modern cars?  At least that's the way I learned in Driver's Ed when I was 16.  Always step on brakes before starting.    No one got hurt, the repair amount is really small, I think about $500 bucks for minor bumper damage.    But I'm wondering ultimately who is at fault considering the possibility that someone could have actually died from this.    I should probably post this in /r/Justrolledintotheshop/ or /r/mechanics and ask them as I'm sure the mechanics on there have plenty of prior cases similar to this.  Take care out there guys, there are many idiots out there that could kill you.  Anytime, anywhere."	Yes
"So there is a guy who for this story i will call ""Tyrone"" who grabed my girlfriend (19F) as she was at the drinkstation at Mcdonalds. She and i used to work there and Tyrone was an aquantence, but without warning today he grabed her, im wondering what we should do. I am going to try my best to get her to file a police report but aside from that what should we do? I belive that it was caught on tape because there is a camera over that area. The people who own this Mcdonalds have covered for an employee in the past who was accused of sexual harassment, so we are not expecting much sympathy from them. I am willing to hire a lawyer for an hour or two to send a threatening letter to the owners, ideally i would like for this guy (he might be a minor, like 16,17,18) to face criminal charges and to lose his job. If you have any questions please let me know, sorry if this is not well put together i am just upset right now."	Yes
While working as a housekeeper at a private country club, I got Tilex in my eyes. Before this incident, we were not provided with eye safety goggles, though a request had been made about masks of some sort because of the smell.   I flushed them out and immediately sought out my general manager, who had me flush them out again before sending me to the emergency room down the road. I was in and out in 20 minutes with a prescription for eye drops. I didn't actually receive any medical treatment, just was told by someone in scrubs that I did what they were gonna do and was sent home.   My general manager only gave me the incident report that she filled out about what happened and her card with information on it to take with. While I was at the ER, I told them it was a work related incident and to contact my employer. I received a bill for a little over $500 and promptly handed it to my general manager. I have now received another for a lowered amount, $267. When I received the bill for $267, I sent it to my employer with a note asking what we needed to do to take care of this and haven't heard anything.   I no longer work there because I accepted a position for an internship in another city. What legal obligation do I have to pay the remainder? I don't want it to go to collections, but I don't feel responsible for paying it, either. If it had been up to me, I wouldn't have gone to the ER at all. What is the best course of action?  TD;LR: got Tilex in eyes at work, boss sent me to ER, stuck with bill.	Yes
"Hey! My girlfriend was at fault in a minor car accident about a year ago. What I saw was minor damage to the bumper of the car in front of her. The person she hit was pretty nasty at the scene and was holding her neck saying she might be injured but refused an ambulance.   Girlfriends rates went up and she got a notice from her insurance that the other person is claiming injury.   However this other person happens to have a public Instagram and is a ""fit chick"" so lots of posts of her doing workouts/headstands/skydiving.   Is there anything my girlfriend should be doing about this? Passing along the info to her insurance?   "	Yes
If someone made a legal recording of misconduct by a superior in a work environment, could they transfer or share the right to distribute that recording, with certain conditions met, with someone else? Not necessarily the media, but a member of their family or another party who may be seeking litigation for similar reasons as the first charging party?  For example, if the defending party puts a gag order on the charging party, but the media has been signed into ownership of a third party, what are the options of the defending party if they want to enter an agreement with the charging party to confidentiality?

Yesterday evening I was on my bike stopped at an intersection when I got rear ended by a car. Long story short, got a concussion, a cut in my head that was stitched up, a bunch of bruises and spent the night at a trauma center.  The thing is, I found out last night that my insurance was cut off about a month ago so I don't have any coverage. I'm a graduate student who has less than $1000 in his account so there's no way I can pay it off right now and would hate to have to pay off the bills over time, stunting my personal expenses once I'm out of school and working. I don't know exactly how much it'll cost me yet but I'd guess the $6-7k ballpark since they took a bunch of scans too.  My intent is to get the woman who hit me to pay off my medical bills. Besides this, some compensation for my injuries and the time I'll have to take out of school would be good as well. I don't know anything about her but she didn't have the best car so I'm guessing she's not too well off. What is my best course of legal action?  Thank you for the advice.  Location: Atlanta, GA, USA if that helps	Yes
I'm traveling and recently got a hysteric call from my wife. Our cat was chilling under a car in our driveway when a neighbor walking a dog walked by. The dog got excited, pulled away from the owner, and managed to scare the cat enough to leave the relative safety of the car. The dog caught the cat and killed it.  Neighbors have video of parts of the incident I've been told.  I'm not interested compensation, as it's be meaningless. but we and neighbors have small children and this concerns me, as the owner was wholly incapable of stopping or controlling the dog. She told my wife that the cat instigated the encounter, which I'm told by a neighbor is not the case.  My wife described it as a bulldog, but I suspect she means pitbull. I'm not sure til I see video.  What action should I take to ensure a safe neighborhood... does this need to be reported to police, animal control, or some other body?	Yes

During a tag type game in gym, my son (age 12) suffered two breaks in his wrist when he ran into the unpadded wall while being pursued.  The school has been making accommodations for his injury (a  buddy to write, etc.), but they wouldn't show the gym to my wife. She found a picture online (linked below). Most of the wall is uncovered.  I have never brought legal action in my life. However, there will be medical bills from this, and other kids could be hurt in the future if the school does not add more padding. Wondering if I should contact an attorney, or if I should just go to the school with the medical bills and request they pay and also add more padding.

Hey guys, I was hit and run over by a car and I need advice on the next step. My insurance as well as the insurance provider of the person driver have all been contacted. Today I received a call from my rep that insurance of the driver is not admitting full fault and will not cover full replacement of my bike (it was totaled).  So, my rep mentioned I need to hire a lawyer to take driver to small claims court OR convince the driver's rep to back down and take responsibility in full (my insurance sides with me 100%).  MAIN QUESTION: Should I contact the driver directly (I have her info) and give her a heads up that I'm moving this to small claims court in an effort to have her convince her rep to take full responsibility so she avoids court? Or is that not kosher/illegal?  Thanks!	Yes

On September 4th, 2017; my father Tommy Wayne Baird jr was brutally beaten (held down, boot heel prints on each wrist, broken nose, sub dural brain bleeds, bruises all over his body, tased in the neck and chest with no defensive wounds, etc) and killed at the age of 49 by 4 Canton, MS police officers (of which 15 minutes of the killing was on Facebook live) after passing up an inspection sticker checkpoint and being followed for several miles while on his way to Jackson, Mississippi to get his PTSD medication from the VA clinic. He served two tours in Iraq and medically retired because of his PTSD. My father would never fight police and he did anything and everything for people; he would give you the shirt off his back if that's what it took. The articles in Mississippi news have slandered and made my father out to be a monster but he wasn’t. Any legal advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
Hi,  My boyfriend and I live together in a neighborhood with an HOA. My boyfriend is blind, and takes our dog to the park every day, which is in the center of our community.  Our neighborhood does not have sidewalks or curbs, it just has road which turns into grass. In the past, they dug a large 4ft by 4ft hole in the middle of the road and only had 4 tiny cones, one on each corner, to mark the area. My boyfriend fell into the hole and luckily didn't hurt himself. I contacted the HOA and told them, and asked if they could please use taller cones slightly outside of the perimeter, and some type of caution tape so my boyfriend would hit that with his cane before physically falling into the hole. They apologized and did this.  Today I got a text from him that he fell into a different hole. This one was right on the edge of the road, they dug up the corner of the park area 4 feet either way, and about 3 feet deep. Absolutely no parking whatsoever. It was filled completely with water because we had heavy rain yesterday.  What can we do? Are they allowed to do this? I don't want to sue anyone, I just want to know if they're required to mark construction in a certain way or not, and if they're doing it wrong I'd like to ask them to make sure it's marked correctly in the future.  His cane catches a lot of things but it doesn't catch everything.  Thanks for any help you can offer, thanks.	Yes
"I was in my car driving toward my home last night when a maniac on a motorcycle was driving right on the lines. It was immature and I regretted it almost immediately but I flipped him off. This angered him, and he began to chase me on his bike. I tried to shake him off for around fifteen minutes but he swerved in and out of traffic, and ran some red lights to try catching me. At one point, he smashed my mirror, and I began to get too scared to focus driving. I crashed right into a light post, and totaled my car. Luckily, I wasn't injured... Guy fled the scene almost immediately.   I filed a police report but they told me they didn't see evidence of having been chased. I got the breathlyzer because they assumed I might have been under the influence. I called the insurance provider, and they told me they might not cover me if the investigation deems it ""my fault"".  What are my options now? What steps should I take to bring that maniac to justice, and repair my wrecked car? Any recourses? What if the police deem it to be my fault? What then?"	Yes
I know someone who owns a golf course with her two brothers. They built it together over 10 years ago from what was a dairy farm handed down by their father.  One of the brothers has a 21 year old son that LOVES his 2nd amendment and goes out onto the course when golfers have left and shoots his guns at geeze and targets with his friends. This past 4th of July he and his buddies went out at night a fired 1,000 rounds of into the side of a mound and than posted it on social media for the public to see (this is a public course by the way).   One of the three owners cannot stand this behavior but can't really tell her brother to stop, and we're not sure if there's any legal reasons to make them stop since it's technically private property, but also a golf course open to the public.  What would you do in this situation?	Yes
"The car that hit the plaintiff has a 2 channel dashcam, so it records the front and the back. You can see that the victim was not hit nor did I feel a hit, but ""if anything"" might have been clipped - it would have been grocery bags she was carrying, making her superficially wider for the narrow ramp. Currently working with the insurance company at the moment, sent videos (in HD) and letter, but I'm curious to know what I should be prepared for? The videos show no hit. The after moments show the plaintiff making a ""mean face"" at the rear of the car, then adjusting their grocery bags from one side to another, and finally walking up the ramp showing no signs of injury. It all seems to be in my favor, but if not - how should I prepare? Secondly, if it comes out that this was a false claim, are there steps I should take against the plaintiffs?"	Yes
Today while driving a vehicle hit a wooden block that was in his lane and it shot directly into my windshield (did not bounce along the way).

So I was involved in a hit and run collision this morning. I was stopped at a stop sign at an intersection and a Honda came around the corner too fast and too wide and smashed right into the left front of my car. As I was getting out they sped off and left me stranded. My left front wheel is bent and my steering arm is bent so I couldn't steer my vehicle. I managed to drive it back down the street to my aunts house house with the wheels pointing in opposite directions and the tires squeeling and park the car until a tow truck arrived. I called the police and they told me they wouldn't send an officer out for something like this and to make a police report online. I drove around the corner with my dad in his car and we found the vehicle that hit me. When he hit me his left front turn signal lens broke off and I picked it up. It matched exactly to the Honda we found around the corner. I wrote down the license plate number and took a lot of photos. I called the police a second time and told them I found the car who hit me and they still said they wouldnt send an officer out and to make a report at the station or online. I made a report online but when I did so it said that hit and run reports made online will not be investigated. When I got my car home I called my insurance company and made a claim. I only have basic liability and no uninsured motorist coverage so I don't think they can really do anything. They took all my information I had and told me I would receive a call back within two business days. I guess I'm going to be waiting on them to call me back but I almost feel cheated that my tax dollars are going to waste when the cops say they won't do anything. What kind of bs is that. Im a mechanic for a living so I already ordered all the parts to get my car back on the road functionally not cosmetically and plan to repair my vehicle myself and take it to get aligned. Ive spent about 150 dollars on suspension components to fix everything. I live in Sacramento California if that means anything. Any advice is appreciated. I wrote this on mobile so hopefully this doesn't read too bad.	Yes
"I had 3 teeth extracted yesterday by a local oral surgeon, and after I got home and the numbness began to wear off, I realized that one of the 3 was not one I had asked them to pull. I had a referral list with x rays from my dentist that reccomended 5 for extraction, but included a note that said ""per patient which ones"". I had opted to only do 3 for now since they were patially broken and painful, was going to ask my dentist about options to save the other 2 since they hadn't been painful. Before they started I was showing the assistant which ones I wanted done, and I opened my mouth and pointed to each one. I explained also that I had no clue which teeth the numbers on the list corresponded to, and my dentist had told me to just show them which ones that they would know the numbers. I thought she seemed to understand which ones I meant, but later I realized they pulled the one in front of one I had asked them to pull. It was on the list, but as I said, I wanted to try to save it. I called the office up, but they were already closed and the best I could do was leave a message with the answering service explaining what happened. What are my options for dealing with this? ""I'm sorry"" clearly won't bring my tooth back, and I'm less interested in money than I am in being able to eat as normally as possible again."	Yes
My girlfriends son is almost 2 years old. A few weeks ago he hurt his leg, and she took him the very next day to an urgent care facility. They did X-rays and stated a sprain. A week later he was still showing pain and swelling so she took him to another imaging facility who also stated sprain after additional X-ray. Today she is at Vanderbuilt with him and the doctora there are saying a fracture.  Is there any action that can be taken against the first two facilities?	Yes
I was riding down a street in the bike lane. There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while. My bike kept going and it got run over by their car being completely destroyed. The driver was immediately apologetic and claimed responsibility. They provided me with their contact and insurance information.   So my problem here is I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I'd prefer not to get lawyers involved because she was extremely nice and wanted to work with me on this. I do want her to pay for my hospital visit and a replacement to my bike. My bike I bought new and got it in a rare situation of the bike needing to be sold because it was a year old model and got it for about half the msrp with also haggling. I'm pretty sure I can't get a bike like that again for the price I paid for it.  My main questions: 1. I have not been in a situation like this before. Do I call her insurance right away and report the situation? 2. What do I tell them? (Might sound silly but I don't to say anything wrong that will prevent me from getting covered) 3. Can I provide them with the make and model of my bike to get the msrp value for it instead of receipt value?  Thanks in advance for any advice.	Yes
So we had a guest staying with us for several months who moved out last week. She left her car in our driveway with much of her stuff in it.   We want it out for many reasons. We dont want to be liable for someone taking studd out of it (its unlocked), she may try to say that she still had belonging on our property so she can still claim squatters rights, it blocks us from taking garbage out and from using the parking space, but mostly she's a toxic person we want out of our lives asap.   We spoke to an officer who said all they can do is ticket it until it visually looks like it is abandoned. They said call back in two weeks and they'll put a tow notice and tow a week later. This is way longer than we want to wait.   We live in Rockford, Illinois.	Yes
"I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...  tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.  Full story: I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail).   The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.  I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.  A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.  I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.  So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.  So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily."	Yes
Last year I was sexually assaulted at a school dance. I don't want to give details I just want a black and white response.  The school nurse and the principle encouraged me not to press charges.

My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes

My girlfriend and I went to an all-inclusive resort in Mexico this past week. Went great, until I ate something bad and came down with severe fever, chills, pain, diarrhea, and stomach cramps. Worst infection of my life. I ended up needing medical transport and was hospitalized for 3 days, where they pushed all sorts of drugs and antibiotics. Ultrasound revealed my colon was super inflamed, and I had a condition called gastroenteritis. The hospital stay cost $16,000.  We contacted the resort, asking for a refund. We know for a fact it was something that I ate from there that made me sick, since we didn't leave the resort at any time. If they refuse, do we have legal grounds to sue?	Yes
"So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I'm in a relationship with this person. So yeh this is your typical, revenge porn or nonconsensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
I’m not sure where this falls as My knowledge of all this stuff is pretty much zero, would appreciate some help.   Riding bicycle this afternoon and I hit a huge unmarked pothole. Flipped over and messed up my knee pretty bad. I called 311 but was told, after they asked if I needed an ambulance which I said no to, I have to go into police station to make an accident report.   Went home cleaned myself up then visited hospital. Will be going back after the hospital to accident sight and take pictures of pothole then will go to police station to file accident report and provide all the paperwork from hospital.   As this was an unmarked pothole in the bike lane will the hospital bill and bike damage bill fall on the city of Chicago to pay? Or am I paying for this myself even though it wasn’t my fault? I am uninsured at the moment but will be insured at the end of August through my colleges insurance plan which I filled out paperwork for already.   Thanks for your time	Yes
"TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.  First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.  Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.    The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.  Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays.   Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?"	Yes
I'm currently living in Los Angeles, and I started chatting with someone that I met through a dating app. I stupidly sent them nudes of myself and now they are threatening to send them to everyone of my Facebook friends including my family. I sent the messages through Kik, so I know I could report them for abuse and state the exact reason and let them look at the messages, but I'm afraid they'd only get banned then just send the pictures because they would figure I reported them. I honestly have no idea what to do right now.	Yes
"I realize that this is probably a lost cause, but whatever.  For context, my girlfriends brother, called Eric for this story, works in a family-owned restaurant in a mountain town in Colorado. My GF, called Jane for this story, was going to the town to meet up with her brother, as they hardly ever see each other. He is 27, Jane is 17. Eric has been working in a restaurant to finance his wedding to his fiancé, Jordan (fake name). He also works in ski patrol during the winter and does odd jobs around the town during the summer.  The incident began when Jane arrived in town. Jane and Jordan were waiting outside the restaurant for Eric to get off his shift, and both of them go inside to ask Eric how long he has remaining in his shift before he's off. Jane goes to wait outside while Jordan talks to the manager. Jordan comes back outside, apparently looking really creeped out and distraught. Jane asks what happened, Jordan says the manager asked how old Jane was, saying ""what is she? 19? 20?"" Jordan relies and says, ""no, she's 17, why?""  The manager responds with ""well when she's wearing shorts like that she might as well be 20. She's got an ass like a 20 year old"" and then made a gesture where he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and inserted his other index finger into the hole repeatedly. (This is obviously a sex gesture).  It should be noted here that the manager of the restaurant is not the owner, and is a 42 year old man.   Jane and Jordan wait for Eric to get off work, and when he does, they tell him of the situation. Eric replies with ""I'm going to fucking beat his ass."" (Eric is very protective of Jane. For the first 6 months of our relationship, our dates were always me and Jane… and Eric. Were like brother now though.)   Jane and Jordan tried to hold him back from going into the restaurant, but they're small girls while Eric is 6'4"" 250 lbs of pure muscle. He walked back into the restaurant, and Jane and Jordan followed him. He asked the manager what he said about his sister, and he, strangely, told Eric exactly what he said, with gesture and all, and added at the end ""she's a dirty little girl, isn't she Eric?"" And winked after the last question.  Eric uppercutted the manager so hard he left the floor briefly before hitting the ground. The manger was driven to the hospital by Eric, and has a concussion, a broken cheekbone, and brief amnesia.  I should say now that this is all 2nd hand. I didn't witness any of this, but Jane and Jordan saw all of it and relayed it to me.  Is there anything they can do to keep Eric out of jail and not bankrupt him/the entire family? Thanks all!"	Yes
"So yesterday I was mowing the lawn and looked around the other side of the fence and noticed that my neighbor had installed kayak racks without my permission. They're storing two kayaks hanging off of my wood fence. The fence is inside my property line, and they don't have a fence that is tied into it. I confronted the neighbor as he was coming around the side of the house and asked them not to attach things to my fence without my permission. They apologized and gave me some BS story that they ""forgot"" to ask me and said they would take it down. What recourse do I have in this matter? Thanks."	Yes
So my dad went to the hospital for heart issues this week and while he's home and fine now there was several mixups that could have gone very badly first of all his meds were mixed up with his father's same name junior and senior secondly they had my dad down that he had a stint put in but again that happened to his father like 8 years ago and finally the biggest issue they put a portable heart monitor on his chest they wrote down the number for the monitor wrong and gave the right number to another patient so they were monitoring this other patient as if it were him needless to say if anything had gone wrong it probably would have been really bad so what we're wanting to know is does he have grounds for a lawsuit since nothing happened and B if he approaches the hospital administrators what percentage should he ask off of the bill 	Yes
I know this is super petty and I'm new to this subreddit but my ex has a Reddit account that he's been posting personal details of our relationship in. This is information that may seem like no big deal in general but is information that can cause trouble for me down the line and is, I guess, character defamation. Is there anything I can do here in order to get him to stop posting personal details? I've already had a friend and family member comment on his posts cuz they've come across them and I'm worried about him saying something that might put me in hot water. Any advice would be extremely helpful, thanks.	Yes
"Long story short, my fwb and I broke up. It went terribly, was strung out over many months, and we're both left bitter about the whole situation. We were in a dom/sub kink situation. I think there may have been some emotional abuse involved, but that's not why I'm here... he's been posting on craigslist looking for hookups for months (daily posting). I've also known about this for months. (this is essentially why we broke up). There was a posting up with the pictures he uses on his posts, and the text he uses on his posts, with a paragraph that essentially read: don't contact this dude, he's an alcoholic and gave me an STD and lots of trust issues. if you want a fwb on craigslist, reply to another posting. Also, his face is not in any of the pictures, and his name isn't any where on either of the posts (his original post, or the secondary post), so I don't think there is any way to identify who it is just from the posting.  So... today, he sends a screenshot to me and tells me he's suing me. He says it ""won't be for much"" and he ""hopes I learn a lesson from all this"". Last week, he was threatening to call the cops on me for something I didn't do. I eventually talked him down from that, but I don't think I talked him down from this.   My question is: Would a lawyer take this case? If so, what should I do?  Please let me know if you need other information to make this more clear."	Yes
"I'm currently in a 1 year lease for an apartment. It's a multi dwelling apartment, meaning that we have separate entrances, and separate driveways.  However we have an upstairs neighbor, and she has been very nasty to us.  We started to get weird vibes from her from the beginning, like she is nice to us, but only when other people are around. (Like the landlord, her neighbors, or sometimes her friends.) But when see her and no one else is around, she is cold and curt. Sometimes she would just ignore us.  For example, when we moved in the landlord said to work out parking spots with her. There is our driveway (which is insanely steep), and then a little 2 car lot at street level which is her driveway (she only has 1 car). you can also fit a car parallel to the road next to a power line pole. She said ""yeah it's really whatever, first come first serve. We just kind of figure it out. It's not assigned parking spots"" seemed pretty chill.  Actually on the night before we toured the unit before we knew that we had it, someone had ran into her car which damaged her parking so only 1 car fits there until they fix it, so she got the OK from the neighbor across the street (super kind and generous man.) to park in his dirt lot which can hold like 6-8 cars.  an example of weird vibes is that, before we had finished moving in, my father in law and I were bringing a couch I had bought, we didn't cover it and it started raining right as we got into town. We parked in one of the spots that was supposedly cool to park in, but she got home shortly after and was very impatient with us and was really demanding, asking us how long we are gonna be there cause she has a friend coming over (meanwhile it's raining and the couch I bought is getting wet). so I asked if we should park in the dirt lot, and she loudly said ""NO"".  she had the unit to herself for a few months before we signed our lease, so we are thinking she got used to how things were?  She sent us texts at 4:30pm when we were moving in saying that we were being too loud, and we apologized and explained why the sound was happening to which she replied ""great""  She send us another text, at about 9:40pm on a Saturday night, asking ""do you have carpets yet? maybe that would help..."" this was during my 'bachelor party' (I just had some friends over to play video games before I got married)  Since then she has had many parties (outside on her deck) that go late (11:00pm, 12:00am, 1:00am) on a weeknight, at one point she had a party go until 2:45am on a Friday night, with loud music, stomping (not walking, stomping), and when my wife and I woke up we noticed there were cigarette butts on our deck.. our deck that's covered in dry leaves.  Anyways.. a week or 2 after that, we were almost done unpacking. We had been given a piece of furniture by my sister and we decided to get rid of it by putting it in our driveway (not in the street) with a free sign on it.  we had seen the other neighbors leave stuff out with free signs, like a couch, an aquarium, and a cat jungle gym. There is no HOA here either.  She texted us about it, at which point we texted the landlord asking if what we did was ok, he said it was fine. So we replied, and explained that we saw the other neighbors do it, and that the landlord said it was ok. but we apologized that it was bothering her and that we would move it when we got home (we were out at dinner).  She replies with a lot of condescension and sarcasm, and claims that she has never seen anyone put furniture out on our street, and that she would never do that ""that's what the dump is for"" and that we need to remember that she lives here too, and that her associates come over.  we decided not to respond to that because it was obviously a lost cause (we suspect she had been drinking because there were a lot of typos). When we got home, the Futon was gone. we thought someone had taken it (it was dark), but when we walked down our driveway we saw that she (presumably) had dragged/pushed it down the driveway. We can't prove it was her. but it would make sense.  there was a huge scrape mark going down the length of the driveway, and the leg of the furniture was bent from being dragged.  we felt like that was an invasion, we didn't feel safe. It was a totally aggressive and dramatic move. not to mention completely unnecessary because we said we would move it. At that point we contacted our landlord to let him know what happened. he said he was unsure of what to do, if he should call her, or wait until his next time coming down (some contractors had done repairs) which he said would be ""in the coming weeks""  we said we would prefer it if he came down so the 4 of us could talk. we didn't want him to call her, because she could just make stuff up. also because she isn't nasty when he's around, we felt like it would help us all reach a amicable solution if he was there as an arbiter.  he said he would come down, but that was more than a month ago.  One night when we were showering, we heard really loud and startling stomping above our heads. We finished our shower and when we got out of the shower we saw that our neighbor had texted my wife using all caps, asking if we just started a load of laundry at 12:00am. - when we do something she doesn't like, she ramps up to 60mph at the drop of a hat, and does something physical.  Based on earlier events, we didn't reply to this text at all. But I emailed my landlord about it.  I didn't feel like we owed it to her to respond to her abusive texts if she's going to be rude and aggressive. and as the days went by we kept showering whenever we wanted to.  She stomped a few more times (at one point even doing like 'marching band' stomping.. it's hard to explain, but doing it with both feet very fast and very loud)   and at one point she texted my wife again and said that ""she had a meeting early the next morning and our late laundry is disturbing her sleep""  So I (hesitantly) replied on my phone that ""Hello &lt;neighbor&gt;. We actually haven't ever done laundry past 9:00pm, what you're hearing is our shower""  She was sarcastic in her response.. ""so? whatever it is is keeping me up at a very late hour""  This was kind of annoying to us, because she has people over stomping right above our heads several times a month late into the night, and after they leave she is cleaning up moving furniture around slamming it down on her deck.  I've been emailing all of this as it develops to my landlord, he was surprised at her response and expected her to be more laid back (don't really know why.. considering the furniture incident). My landlord said, if she complains again, just tell her that we hear her when her friends are over and lived with it.  A few days later we had to contact him again because our dryer had gone out and we were working on replacing it. He actually said our neighbors dryer went out too (and she left it on the hill outside of our bathroom window...) which angered me because she was harassing us about our furniture but she leaves her dryer outside of our window? I moved it a few feet over because I didn't want to see it, and I didn't want to contact her about it. (then the next day she left a cardboard box to a new samsung phone in the same exact spot...)  He said he has been busy with work and unable to come down, but in the meantime, if we see her, if we bump in to her, then should try to talk to her for a few minutes and just say ""look , we want to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers, but when you have friends over late we hear that too and lived with it."". He has been sympathetic to us, but hasn't actually done anything yet. He said that if she is disrespectful again, then he will call her himself, he also said if it was him, he wouldn't want to live here either.  Since her text we had tried to get our showers done earlier (before 11:00pm). Some of the times she has stomped it was when she was clearly awake. We will drive up to our house and see her flipping channels on her TV, we can hear her walking around, calling her cat inside, and on the phone etc... But as soon as we get in the shower she starts stomping. and complains that we are 'waking her up'  So just last week my wife and I shower at 10:30pm, and we hear her start stomping around above us.. I didn't know what to do, so my wife and I wrote a text on my phone but didn't send it, we wanted to sit on it.  We decided, if we saw her the next day, we would try talking to her. But if we didn't we would text her. I felt like I should text her soon because my family was coming over for the long 4th of July weekend, and I didn't want her to be stomping if they needed to shower. (we had a beach day + dinner planned, so I knew we were gonna get back late)  Well we didn't see her, so I texted her Monday July 3rd while we were at dinner saying:  ""Good evening neighbour.  I was wondering if you were stomping again during our shower last night? I guess even if you weren't, I wanted to say some things and try to clear the air.  We want to be able to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers. But here's the thing.... when you have your friends over with music playing late at night during the week, we hear that. and we've lived with it. In May you had people over until almost 3am with really loud stomping and music right above our heads as we were trying to sleep. I've even heard you take a hammer to your floor at 11:00pm You woke us up this morning at ~7:40am. with your banging furniture around on your deck right above our bedroom.  Because we live under you, we hear a lot more than you might realize, but we've lived with it.  Live and let live, that's what we've been trying to do.  We've been accommodating and respectful to you. That's all we are asking in return.""  to which she replied:  ""I think u need to learn how to live with neighbors.. have you ever lived in a multiple dwelling place before?  There is etiquette involved...and waking people up late (10pm-6am)cause thats when u decided to take a shower is not cool.    Having friends over...talking...listening to music at a reasonable hour is cool.    Leaving your trash / used furniture out on the side of the road with a Free sign on it like you just moved into the ghetto is not cool.  Having friends over ONCE in 3 months late on a Friday night is cool.    Not communicating concerns you have to your neighbor and instead hitting them with an Uber long text on a monday night....not cool  Having 3 gorgeous decks and wanting to sit outside at 8am is absolutely ok.  It is not my fault you choose to keep non-business hours. Stop taking showers late (after 10pm) and everything will be okay on my end.    If my friends stay past 10pm on a weeknight and we are loud...absolutely let me know and we will move it inside.  But if I have friends over 2-3 times a year...late on a Friday or Saturday night....suck it  buttercup.     You may want to have people over too...and you know what...i won't say anything 2-3 times a year And no....you haven't been accommodating and respectful....you have been disdainful and rude.  You didn't even acknowledge me outside one day.. walked right past me.....i smiled said hi....u were completely disrespectful and rude. I think I have addressed all your concerns.  Have a good night""  After she sent that, I emailed my landlord again.  He replied July 4th in the morning and he said he was frustrated and didn't know what to do. In the 12 years he's owned the place he's never had this problem. He said if we wanted him to, he could call her.  We spent 2 nights at my in laws because being home was too stressful at this point. We were sacred of how she would react when he called her, and we were scared to go home. Even taking a shower at my in laws was stressful. My wife has severe anxiety, and to be honest this situation is giving me a lot of anxiety too.  I emailed my landlord on the 5th, asking if he had called her yet. and he said he hasn't called her because he wanted to enjoy the holiday without any drama.  I haven't heard anything from him since then.  However since then I've looking into taking legal action (trying to get a free consultation from a lawyer here). I don't know what the landlord is going to do, if anything. or if talking to her is going to help anything at all (or make it worse).  When she dragged our futon around, was that vandalism? Should we have called the police? is it too late to call now?  Is what she's doing defined as harassment? Is that enough for us to get out of a lease? Is there any other legal action we can take?  We are scared to bump into her.. and she is always on her wrap around deck above us which means if we use our deck we would have to see her.  Rent isn't cheap in California, and if my landlord isn't gonna do anything I don't see why I need to pay thousands more dollars to be living under a bully with this stress. We have family willing to take us in until we find a new place.  We are very skeptical that he will evict her."	Yes
This is probably a waste of time, but I wanted to ask.  My mom and my brother traveled with Greyhound last week Thursday. They had never taken a bus before and tried to maneuver it the best they could. The person working the front desk refused to put a label on two of her items -- two plain cardboard boxes that contained medical records, a bag, school supplies, and toiletries. They swore up and down the luggage would arrive in our city. Well, shocked, it did not arrive.  The real issue here is the customer service is outrageously awful. We've been hung up on, laughed at, and we were given a claim number that doesn't work. It's a 30 minute wait to reach a person and then they transfer you again.  Their compensation policy only offers $250. These items are worth more than that, and were almost certainly lost by the employees who checked them in. It was either never placed on the bus or removed.   Is there anything we can do at this point? Can we sue them? Is there anyway to get in touch with someone at the very top of the hierarchy?	Yes
Hi Reddit Law,  My dad is a contractor and recently finished tile work on a new house. The owner did not want to pay the balance and my father threatened to break the tiles throughout the house with a hammer. My gut is that this isn't legal but I'm not really sure, it is his tiles and setting materials after all and this guy hasn't paid.	Yes
Happened in Missouri this week.  A company that seems to be contracted by the city was working on a line next to my house.  There was a surge of wastewater while they had the line blocked(my vague understanding of the situation) and it caused the waste to back up into my house, completely covering the downstairs floor in sludge that I assume to be mostly human waste.  I woke up sometime within the next 3 hours to find this;  went outside and got ahold of the sewage company workers who were still working outside and let them know about it, they contacted their supervisor who came to my house, took pictures, called his boss and then told me that they were taking responsibility for the  incident.  So far they've hired a company to do the cleanup, and the same company is expected to start doing the repairs(floors, carpet, drywall, etc) Monday.  They've also agreed to get the HVAC ducts cleaned out because the AC is currently circulating the smell of sewage through the house even after the cleanup downstairs.  I'm renting and my landlord and I both have concerns about the situation - most of my belongings got sloshed with sewage, including my computers and office furniture;  I'm also just cut off from the bottom of my house for the next several weeks.  My landlord's concern is that he is going to have to disclose this incident whenever he eventually sells the property and that it will damage the perceived value of the house and make it harder to sell.  I'm trying to figure out what, if any, sort of recourse we have in this situation beyond the cleanup and repair.  Nothing has been signed yet.	Yes
So basically i live on a quarter mile long driveway that i share with my neighbor who we were always friends with and kind to but he is at the very beginning near the road and I am tucked away in the woods at the end of it.  We have beach access and our neighbors have right of way to use our driveway and a path on our property only as a means of traveling to and from the beach. They have come over numerous times without warning to watch the sunset on a section of our property that leads to the beach (rather than the actual beach because they can't make it down the waterfall/stream that leads to it).  We've asked them a few times now to let us know before hand (mainly after an incident where a bunch of strangers and cars unexpectedly showed up for homecoming pictures on our land not the beach) when they are going to come down and we have always been ok with them watching the sunsets on our property leading to the beach as long as they let us know ahead of time. So basically the other day while my mom was at work and my dad was working in our garage they showed up walking down the driveway uninvited and without plans of going to the beach. My dad was outside with our three dogs (Rottweiler, golden retriever, and weimaraner all sweet hearts with no previous signs of aggression even in a house with two toddlers) and my sisters when they decided to walk down with a stranger and there three dogs (a lab, a golden retriever, and an 8 week old Australian shepard puppy they just got a week ago but hasn't met my dogs before).  My neighbors were supposed to be getting married on the section of our property that they always watch the sunset on so they said they were walking down to show the guy they brought with him the work they thought they were going to be doing to our land in preparation for their wedding.  I was not home at the time but i guess while my neighbor was walking ahead with the stranger, his fiancé was standing on our property surrounded by her dogs and now my dogs who ran up to see what was going on. I'm not sure how long the dogs were interacting for but the puppy was new to all three of my full grown dogs and the rottweiler ended up biting her and breaking her leg.  She was taken to the vet and had four puncture wounds as well but they weren't serious.  We were all very surprised to hear of the situation and upset as we are all dog lovers and offered to help in some way but we've never been in this type of situation before and didn't know how payment would work for something like that (we were still going to try to help even if we weren't liable) but my neighbors seemed pretty cool about it and said that wasn't a big concern of there's at the moment. So the dog eventually went in for surgery but never woke up from the anesthesia (we're guessing the dog was given too much for it's young age) and our neighbor told us when it happened and said to not call or text today because his fiancé and step daughter were very angry (at us? the dog? themselves? idk). So the next day my dad was coming home from work and stopped coming down the driveway because my neighbor was out and apologized for the situation he was in and my neighbor went straight to telling my dad that he has a couple thousand dollar pet bill that he's going to send him as well as a receipt for the dog that they spent $2000 on at a pet store.  Now my parents were trying to handle this situation as nicely as possible since we felt terrible and have to continue to share a driveway and think about this relationship longterm but feel like we aren't really fully responsible and don't appreciate how our neighbor is acting like it's completely our/my dog's fault and is going to demand this money from us for the incident without taking any responsibility of his own.  We've tried contacting an attorney just to figure out if it truly is on us but all so far have only been for dog bites on humans. Sorry for the grammar mistakes this is just like the 10th time reciting this so I'm getting kind of tired of it and just wanted some other opinions and feedback on the situation.  After them demanding the money basically my parents don't really want to help them pay the bills at all unless they have to but we believe that my neighbors are mostly in the wrong here and that we definitely shouldn't have to worry about the cost of the dog when the vet is the one that killed it even though my dog caused the need for surgery.  Thank you so much for any feedback this is just causing my family a lot of stress and I'd be happy to elaborate more or clear things up that weren't explained well if questions come up.  TL;DR  Neighbors have always been close friends and are legally allowed to cross a piece of our property to reach a beach that only we have access to but they always stop before getting that far and hangout on our property.  They've unexpectedly dropped down numerous times after us asking for just a heads up beforehand but they thought it would be a good idea to do that the other day with no intentions of going to the beach, a stranger with them, and their three dogs (one of which is a brand new 8 week old puppy that my three big dogs have never met).  Eventually while they were down on my property, uninvited and not there for the reason their supposed to come down, my dog with no history of any aggression bit their puppy breaking his leg.  The dog needed surgery but died due to reasons unrelated to the injury and afterwards my neighbors started acting like it was all completely our fault and that we had to pay the full vet bill as well as the cost of the dog.  Also just an FYI incase it comes up, the beach I'm referring to is public but surrounded by 40 foot cliffs and we have access to the only semi easy way of getting down on our property but my neighbors never go all the way down to the public part they are supposed to (again this wasn't a big deal to us when they would tell us ahead of time)	Yes
I am writing a memoir and doing my best to prevent any sort of defamation of character accusations before I send a chapter of my book to an online publisher. The people I am writing about include the two multimillionaire business owners (one had since passed away, one is the head of a largely recognizable brand) and a person in academia involved in highly unethical practices.   I have already read about the legal topic and done things like change names, stick to facts, not opinions, and stay in my own point of view, not jump to what another person felt or was thinking.  I have emails and articles to backup that what I am saying is true. However, for my own peace of mind, I would like a lawyer to read my chapter and suggest to me if any edits need to be made to further protect myself.   I do not have a lot of money, (less than $1000 in the bank). Is this something that I might be able to get a pro bono consultation for? Where would be the best place to look for a lawyer that would review my chapter? Does it make a difference if I look for someone who specializes in whistleblower law, literary/creative arts law, or first amendment law?  I am 60 minutes from Chicago, if it makes a difference. Thank you in advance for your help.	Yes
Hey, r/legaladvice,   As the title says, I was in a car accident where a drunk uber driver hit me, and I later found out that he had a suspended license. What are the chances that I could successfully sue uber?	Yes
Are there any laws in California about how close you can smoke to doors and windows of residences?    I live in an apartment complex with a lot of cigarette smokers.  I am highly allergic to cigarette smoke (been to the ER, multiple doctors, prescribed inhalers, EPI-pens, etc.)  The number of smokers has gotten much worse in the last few years, and it is negatively impacting my health to a serious degree.  I had to move out of a previous residence for the same problem.    The apartment complex has a small open grassy space with a barbeque where most people smoke.   [&lt;Sexy MS Paint Diagram!&gt;](http://i.imgur.com/5uOE8AX.jpg) It is within a few feet of windows and doors.  People also smoke inside the laundry room and inside the enclosed garage.  At any given time of the day or night there are around 2-4 people smoking.  I really don't want to be one of those people who complain about this sort of thing, but there are lots of children in the complex who shouldn't be inhaling this too.	Yes
The second woman that hit me made it clear she would rather pay out of pocket than have a claim on her insurance.  I realize it may not be the most ethical thing to do, but would I be breaking any laws to accept a cash payment from her, and make a claim with the other rear-enders insurance?  I realize it's a bit shady, I just need to be clear on whether or not I would be breaking any laws.	Yes
I thought it would be funny to poke a little at one of the biggest businesses in my city, so I made some stupid page that literally only got 2 likes. The article was obviously a joke, talking about how they were going to purchase a graveyard and charge entry as a new “attraction” in town. It’s kind of an inside joke I new all of the locals would get and find humor in. Apparently one of the owners of said business saw the article and didn’t like it, and said he’s going to send me a cease and desist (like I care, it’s a stupid page I just made yesterday that’s not even popular), and he threatened me with legal action.   So can they do anything? I took the post down out of respect, but was just curious  Thanks!!	Yes
 Location: Los Angela's California  I was at a bar last week with some friends and some time during the night I was at the bar getting a drink and when I turned around an extremely drunk man smashed his glass into mine while he wildly gestured about something.   At first I was in shock since he basically smashed a glass in my face but when I looked down my entire right hand was a bloody mess. I shouted and one of the bartenders saw this and called the ambulance. I  was furious with the guy who gave me a fuck of comment before the manager on staff sat me down and helped me until the ambulance got there.   I'm at the hospital and during the exam it was discovered that 3 of the tendons in my hand had been cut and I need surgery to repair them.   The broken career part of the story is that I'm an graphic designer who relies on the use of my hands to do my job. And now that my hand is still recovering I can't work or do anything and I'm concerned about what to do. I don't know who I should call, if there's some way of getting my expanses covered, what I'll do if I can't use my hand well enough in the future and I can't work as a graphic artist anymore.   I'm surviving off the money I have saved and will be okay for about a month and I have medical insurance so that's all taken care of. But I just need advice of if I can get some sort of money to help pay for my expenses and what my options are.   I don't really have the money to pay for a lawyer since al of my savings are paying for everything and I don't have a salaried job since I'm freelance at the moment.   I'm sorry for any grammar mistakes as I'm writing this with my left hand on mobile and I'm kind of dog scared shitless about what to do.	Yes
I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	Yes
I'm going to summarize a long story to ask this question; Over a year ago now I prepaid a firm to declare bankruptcy. Things seemed fine until I gave them the full amount in advance for the service. Then they disappeared for a month and when I finally did get a hold of them, they strung me along for another several months and refused to give my money back. Eventually after I reported them to the better business bureau, they agreed to pay 1/3 of the money back, but that was a month and a half ago and they still haven't sent the check... What can I do next to recover this money? This is in Ohio. Thank you!	Yes
Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	Yes
"My ex who I have been friends with is dating someone new. She tried to befriend me a year ago and I was nice to her. She gave me a bunch of clothes she didn't want and then much later asked for them back but since they were mine I gave them away. She's now saying I stole from her.   My ex gave me 1600 dollars a year ago when my family had a huge rough patch and he and I have no contract of this and he knows I'll pay him back as I earn it but now the new girlfriend is stating she can get me for 1600 dollars.  She's been sending me messages for a year and I've repeatedly asked her to stop and she doesn't. Sometimes I would respond but when I realized she was harassing me I told her to stop and asked my Ex to ask her to quit.   Two days ago I asked my ex a question through text and he ignored me and then I got a text from the girlfriend threatening me. I texted my ex very angrily stating I can't believe he would let someone else talk for him instead of just answering me. It was a low point of very angry texts but not threats. The next day he responds to me like nothing happened.   Now the new girlfriend is rep steely threatening me with her aunt who is a lawyer stating she has ""stuff I stole from her"" and my exes 1600 dollars I owe plus emotional damages that she could put against me. I've been in tears all day wondering if I'm going to end up in jail or with charges. I don't have records of all the harassing messages she sent over the last year because I gave a new phone so it seems like their case could be in their favor since I can't prove how she was harassing me. I have no idea what to do. My family says to ignore her and that she has nothing against me. Please help. "	Yes
I have two dogs who were both in their kennels. One had minor surgery yesterday and we had just gotten home when the vet called because they forgot to give me a prescription he needs, and asked me to come get it.  While I was gone my landlord came over unannounced. Apparently the house next door, he also owns, had water in the basement from storms. He wanted to see if my basement was flooding too.  However apparently he was concerned about my dogs because one (the one who had surgery) wasn't moving much (he was still groggy) and the other was whining a lot (she was fine, she just whines when she's in her kennel but someone's around and she wants out).  He said that he and his wife were afraid that the dogs were in bad shape and needed water or something, so he let them out. He got the younger one (who just had surgery) out first and apparently the other (still in her kennel) started growing. She can be defensive of the younger one so I am guessing she was upset that a stranger was messing with the younger one who wasn't well.  She had been extra attentive to him since he got home licking him and trying to give him food so I think she could tell something was wrong with him.  Apparently even though the older dog was growling, they still let her out of her kennel. They said that the younger one went under the bed and the older one tried to keep them away from it, growling and barking when they tried to get the puppy out. Apparently they kept trying to get close, and eventually the landlord pulled the puppy out from under the bed and my older girl bit his hand.   When I got home, they were still trying to get the puppy who had gone back under the bed, and my older dog was going nuts wimpering/barking/growling at them.  The landlord's wife had called animal control.  The bite had broken the landlord's skin just barely but was no longer bleeding.  Animal control came and checked my paperwork for shots and said normally they would take the dog for quarantine because it was involved in a bite incident, but they said that in these circumstances they didn't see a need to do so. They told me that I shouldn't expect any further issues with the situation and that they would talk to the landlord about what he should have done differently.  I thought that was it, however my landlord went to the ER. His wife told me that the ER didn't believe any treatment was needed but they elected to go through rabies meds just in case, so he is going through that treatment now.  Today they delivered a letter to my mailbox saying that they want me out by the end of the month or no more than 30 days from now because my animals have presented a dangerous situation on the property that keeps them from fulfilling their ownership duties safely.  He also told me in the letter that he will be keeping his ER visit and rounds of rabies meds from my deposit but that if the bills exceed it he will be forwarding me the bill.  At this point I'm not really even sure what I'm asking for other than just general advice anyone might have. It's probably obvious from my post but I am very frustrated by the situation because I had my dog properly contained and they chose to let them out even though the dog was growling, which should have been a warning sign to leave it alone. However I am not sure what the law says on this or what I'm in for.	Yes
There is a video of a woman, who is antireligious, drawing a picture of Muhammad.  And in the comments there was  a guy who found her address where she lives, and another man wrote 3 days ago that he is going to her address to address kill her because she drew the cartoon.  Im from Scandinavia, and i dont know how to report this to the police in LA. Maybe im overdramatic, but eeeh... am i really? For some reason i think this is quite important to report. Any tips?	Yes
"Hello! As a small business owner, I am looking for help from lawyers/business owners alike. I have run into a fraudulent injury lawsuit from a stranger on my property. This person claims that a piece of equipment on my property hurt him as he was passing through. The person has no proof and when asked to provide medical documentation or pictures of the injury, the person refused. Knowing what I do about the equipment in question and his story presented, it is not possible that what was claimed actually happened. In addition, the person is claiming an exorbitant amount of money. It is obvious that it is someone with a piece of shit lawyer looking to make a quick buck. As a small business owner, I do not have access to high power lawyers nor do I have the money to just pay off people for everything they threaten lawsuits with. When asking my insurance appointed lawyer how this could possibly hold up in court, I am told it is a sympathy case and there is no way to defend against it. It is absolutely infuriating that I am not protected in some way from fraudulent injury claims especially with no proof! It seems that the system is rigged against the ""big bad company"". How can a small business stay in business with no protection against these shit heads? Big companies obviously have cash to pay off people or lawyers on retainer. For me, a lawsuit can literally make or break my company. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Or how to retaliate?"	Yes
If somebody takes a photo of me without my permission and posts it with a degenerating caption, isn't that invasion of privacy or something?	Yes
"A while back, I bit down on a rock hidden inside a sandwich.  There was a loud crack and a sharp pang but no ongoing pain.  I notified staff and they talked to me and disposed of it before I could get a picture.  I didn't notice any damage or lasting pain so I didn't make a big deal out of it.  Fast forward two weeks, it's starting to hurt, I get it fixed.  I'm talking to the company, I have a picture of the food, a receipt for the dessert I got, but not the sandwich itself.  I'm trying to play nice and I don't exactly want to sue since I really like this place.  The company is saying things like ""well since you don't really have any definitive proof..."" and coming up with excuses with insurance... and offering me 1k to settle.  I declined since I didn't think it'd cover the dental work.  They bumped it up by a bit, still doesn't cover my dental work...   I kept telling them I wanted to wait till I settled the dental work.  There were quite a few complications and trips to the dentist.   Finally, most of the dental work is done and I have a pretty good idea of how much this is going to cost.  They offer the cost of my dental bills and a tiny sum of cash.  I feel like they're trying to screw me over while I'm sitting here trying to play nice.  What should I do? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Let me know if more details are necessary. Thanks for reading!"	Yes
"Located in North Dakota.   PICTURES OF DAMAGE ARE LINKED AT BOTTOM OF POST  I posted in this subreddit a few weeks ago. Long story short, I own a twinhome. My neighbors are renters. One of my neighbors moved their sump pump hose right outside my basement window, and it proceeded to come into my basement destroying my carpet and padding.   It was suggested in here to file an insurance claim, which I did.   First I filed with my own insurance company, and they said they wouldn't cover it as they would consider it to be ""flood damage"" and I don't have flood coverage. They suggested to file a claim through the other homeowners policy policy, and it may fall under their liability coverage.   So that's what I did. His insurance company sent out an adjustor, inspected the damage, and did his thing. A week later, I got a call from the insurance company saying they wouldn't cover it, since it wasn't their insured (the actual homeowner) that caused the damage, but rather the person renting the home from him. I asked if the homeowner has any liability for his renters actions, and the insurance company said no, not at all.   So now I'm in my present situation.  I paid 2300 dollars for carpet and padding, which is going to be installed on Tuesday. Admittedly, this carpet is nicer than the carpet I had to take out (5 dollars a Sq foot as opposed approx 3 dollars a Sq foot for the original).   I know my neighbor isn't going to want to pay for the damages they caused, as that is the nature of negligent neighbors. So I'm guessing my ultimate course of action will be to take them to small claims court. I'm only really armed with pictures of the damage as well as pictures of where my neighbor left his sump pump hose. Is this enough to get a judgment in my favor? I've never gone to court for anything, so any opinions are appreciated.    https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-FrQKc4fy6qVEFxemdpblNBN2c?usp=sharing"	Yes
"A friend of mine is a dog breeder and has come under fire from the locals who are angry with her because dog breeders are Literally Evil and she breeds 3 litters per year (different mothers) which apparently makes her a ""puppy mill."" She takes good care of her dogs, but has a few elderly dogs who, well, are not in excellent shape because they're old as the planet itself. She still brings them in every few months for nail clippings, general wellness exams and so on.   Well, one of the vet techs who has decided she is Evil Incarnate for breeding dogs has taken pictures of her cloudy-eyed, skinny decrepit old dogs, one of whom had an infected eye (that's why he went to the vet!) so he looks practically undead, and is posting them on social media because she is anti-breeder and wants her to be ""shut down."" Animal control went out to her house and said everything looks totally normal; so did a health inspector, but this woman is still on the warpath.   The problem is, the vet tech was fired, so it's not like contacting her boss is an option. What are my friend's options here as far as getting her to stop go? Does not seem legal at all to share patient information like this."	Yes
"I was walking with my friends in a casino when out of nowhere some random guy intentionally strong armed me right in my pregnant belly, knocked all the water I had in my hand over. Security was literally 2 feet away from me and fid notthing. As I approached security and told them if they were going to do something about it they told me "" sorry were kinda busy right now escorting someone out"" and just left.  I started to feel short of breath and in pain literally 2 mins later. I went up to another security and told them of what happened and it wasn't until I told them I was pregnant and in pain that they started to take down a report. Do I have any legal recourse?

Good Evening,    First time here, so sorry if this is already answered. Please provide link to answer if so and I will delete this post.   **SITUATION**: Other night I tapped the bumper of a man (driver), and his pregnant wife and child (passengers). Speed at impact was no faster than walking speed. There was no damage to my bumper and a slight scuff on theirs, we exchanged insurance and contact info, and I asked to pay out of pocket if he was willing. Next day they contact me and say that they are sore and taking the wife to the dr., and that the impact dislodged the plastic wheel well in their car. However, they are still willing to let me pay out of pocket for car repairs and health insurance co-pay from the dr visit. They gave me a reasonable quote that I accepted. I don't really care if they are faking and just keeping the money, this is an inconvenience for them, and I was at fault. Additionally, the quote would be cheaper than my insurance increase in the long run.    **QUESTION**: My concern is that I will pay them, but they will still try and make a claim in the future due to injury they didn't know they had yet (or something along those lines). If I have them sign a release of liability contract in front of a notary at the time of payment, will that protect me here in Oregon? If so, is there a recommended release of liability contract template I can download for free? Or am I out of my league here? I think getting a lawyer involved would contradict any future insurance premium savings I would gain from the other party not making a claim.  Thanks for your time,  everyusernametaken2	Yes
I have ulcerative colitis and in May I needed a routine colonoscopy with my new GI doctor. I signed all the waivers so I know the doctor is protected on that front but I feel like the way I was treated afterwards was not ethical. When I woke up I was immediately in pain but assumed it was just gas because it’s common after a colonoscopy. As time went on the pain kept intensifying until I couldn't move or speak loud enough to get anyone's attention. Once my mom was allowed into the recovery area around 9 am she notified the staff and they gave me a heating pad while teasing me for being a baby about a little gas. A little before 10 am I realized the pain wasn't getting better (it was a 10 on the pain scale) and asked to go to the hospital for the first time. My mom was told that a.) because it was a medical building they had to be the ones to call an ambulance and that they needed my doctor's permission to call  b.) they couldn't let me leave on my own without my doctor's permission c.) that my doctor was with another patient and I'd need to wait to talk to her.  Unfortunately my mom believed them and went back to the waiting room at their request. I kind of lost track of time but there were a few events that stood out (please keep in mind that during this entire experience I’m frozen in the fetal position, gasping for air, and I can’t speak louder than a whisper). *Someone tried to shove saltines into my mouth and when I spit them out onto the gurney I was called nasty.  *She then shoved a straw in my mouth and when I didn’t drink more than a few sips (I didn’t want any but I was trying to be compliant) she bent down to my face and told me “You need to stop acting like a brat and let me help you.” *Someone pried my hand off the side of the gurney, forced me onto my back and shoved my legs down flat. I was in too much pain to tell them to stop or make any noise. I quickly ended up back in my original position and was scolded for not working with them. *I asked to go to the hospital repeatedly and was ignored. *I asked for my mom and was told she went to lunch (which wasn’t true, she stayed in the waiting room and was told that I was just resting.) *I asked for my cellphone and was told that they couldn’t open the locker to get it because it was against policy. *My doctor finally came to see me and told me that I was being too dramatic. *My mom demanded to be let in and when I asked her to call an ambulance herself the staff finally said they’d call. When I finally got to the hospital around 2:30 pm my doctor had already called the ER and told them that it was just gas. A few hours later the hospital was getting ready to discharge me without having done any tests (I was told that since my GI was sure it was gas they’d prefer not to expose me to the radiation from an x-ray or CAT scan because I’m a young woman and they didn’t want to affect my reproductive system) when they took my vitals and realized I had started going into severe sepsis. I had an x-ray done that showed I had a bowel perforation and went into emergency surgery. I stayed in the hospital for 13 days, and ended up with a 6 inch incision and an ileostomy. Was any of this illegal? I don’t want to sue I just don’t want it to happen to someone else.	Yes
Hello r/legaladvice and the Reddit community as  whole. First I want to quickly say thank you for the advice you gave me a few days ago on this subreddit concerning my in-laws and me. You steered us away from something that could've really blown up in our faces. What I ask next of you weighs on my heart and soul so heavy I feel like collapsing from within. I'll do my best to keep it short.  Maybe 36 hour's ago baby Gia (I'll call her Gia since I've not gotten permission to use real names) was born to a mother and father that loved her deeply and have been excited to meet her. She was born with six different conditions that we know of at the moment. I just got off with the father who is my best friend (I'll call him Al for now). Al’s devastated and the nurses and doctors keep telling him they've never seen anything like this before, well at least not all at the same time in one baby. They're both very healthy adults, Al's 30 and his wife's 23. I didn't ask too many questions about her conditions because I felt he needed me to listen more than talk but what I got from it is that she has Leukemia (or some cancer like it, I'm unsure here), a very large blood clot threatening her heart an enlarged kidney, a valve in her heart is closed or obstructed somehow, she can't breathe because the blood vessels to her lungs aren't transferring blood and she has a hole in her heart. My heart is breaking as I write this so I'll just finish as fast I can. Nurses and doctors at Kaiser have told them looking over her charts and medical records that so much of this could've been caught early had they run some standard tests but because his wife was young they assumed it would be ok. Their doctor denied them several tests they asked about throughout the pregnancy and when the first ultrasound was incomplete (they couldn't even determine the sex) they refused to schedule another one. To find out the sex they had to go to one of those private 3d imagining companies. The medical staff has been sympathetic and supporting but the administration has been giving him the run-around. They told him they're doing an internal investigation and I think he's having trouble even getting her medical records from them. He asked for them early on with witnesses from the head the department but when he brings it up now they can't give him an answer as to when he'll get it or how this could've been missed. All this while poor Gia is fighting for her life, he can't even get the info he needs to get a second opinion. I have to stop now, it's hard to even see what I'm typing. Please help Reddit.   Is this grounds for medical malpractice or something like that?   What kind of attorney should Al seek? And when should he seek it?   Should he wait until the investigation is concluded? Does he have a right to read the results?   Is there another subreddit I can post this on for more help in any areas I'm too ignorant to even know I'll m missing? Also what's the best way to do this, I'm new to posting on Reddit, just lurked around on my other handle and I don't want to spam Reddit.   If there's any questions I can ask or information you guys need please let me know and I'll ask Al. This is so early on he's still dealing with the emotional blow. Btw I did ask permission to ask for help on his behalf so long as it was anonymously.	Yes
"So my dog and I were attacked by a loose dog about a year back, I fronted all vet and hospital bills, and we're about to go into mediation with the dog's owner. Thankfully, my pup recovered very well, and the worst I've got on my end is numbness on one pinky and a bad scar on the other hand.  What really gets me is that Animal Control was familiar with the family (recurring), and the owner relocated the animal citing, ""we're not sure how she reacts to smaller dogs and children."" I assume everything is based on actual damages, but the recurring theme and the fact the dog was moved into another home without notice makes me feel like it's going to happen again. Is this something to bring up in mediation?"	Yes
I bought a house beside a church parking lot that the church goers rarely use because there is a closer parking lot, so there's usually no need for anyone to use this back lot. Since living here a year I've seen prostitution (front row view right from my kitchen window while cooking), drug deals, teenagers doing donuts driving dangerously close to my house in the lot, people setting off large fireworks, all sorts of things. Yesterday was the kicker. I had to risk physical harm approaching a vehicle with an overdosing driver that still had his foot on the gas headed straight for my house where my daughter was inside to prevent him from plowing into it.   I plan to speak to the church's pastor and see if we can find a solution but I wanted to ask here first if anyone has any advice to offer. Is a mostly abandoned lot considered an attractive nuisance, and do I have any recourse to keep my family safe if they can't help resolve this? Thanks in advance!	Yes
Someone close to my family sent out a video of a family member masturbating. The video is only from the chest up but hey are talking to the camera and it is clear what the person is doing.   Would this follow under revenge porn?  It is on my spouses side of the family this is happening. Due to the shock of the situation I don't think anyone is as concerned as me that this video is being sent around.   I am leaving it up to my spouse and my children on if they should seek action. I informed them that I thought it was illegal and that it is considered a felony in the state they are in.   In the mean time should I notify the person spreading the video that it is illegal and they need to stop sending it out?  	Yes
I live in a second floor walk up. There are 3 units on each floor. We have a front entrance and a rear entrance. The rear has a balcony, which each floor shares. My neighbor recently started recording the stairs coming up to our unit and some of our balcony to try to catch another one of our neighbors smoking. Even though I know he's not trying to record me, it still creeps me out every time I walk by the camera. Is it legal for him to record?	Yes
I live in South Carolina. I saw my neighbors doing archery in the area on the side of their house which happens to run parallel to my privacy fence. I didn't think too much of it at the time. Later I found two arrows in my back yard. Now I'm afraid to let my kids play out there because I don't want them to get impaled by a rogue arrow.  Is there some regulating body I should report this to? Also is this something I should bring to the attention of the HOA?  I already plan to speak with them in person about the situation, but I figured I'd seek some advice before I do.	Yes
"Hi Reddit Lawyers. I need some advice on my case. Backstory:  April 2016- I injured my hamate bone, fracturing the hook. I did not know this until May, when pain persisted and I went to an Ortho. I had X-rays and an MRI to confirm the fracture. My ortho elected to wait for the bone to heal. Fast forward to July. Still have pain, went back to the same ortho but with a hand specialist. He also had me wait and did not perform an excision. By August, the pain was still there and I would not heal. After X-rays and a CT, we decided to excise the hamate hook. (I was told I could immediately get back to sports and life as soon as the incision healed, but that story kept changing as I followed up the procedure and had pain. Being told I could participate quickly is something for another time).  After waiting a few months with no activity, my wrist was feeling ""better."" I was not having the same pain. On July 3rd, the same pain came back. After X-rays, MRI, and CT, it was shown that my hamate hook was still there. Only half was removed. The same fracture site existed with only the tip missing in the images. I went to a new ortho and recently had the rest removed.   The standard of care for this injury is to excise the hook immediately based on my research. Non union rates of the fracture are as high as 90%. My new ortho also said that they do not even talk about letting it heal, that went out of date 20 years ago. The go to is excision. This is also coupled with the fact that the surgeon stated he removed the entire hook in the op report. He ""completely"" removed it and said he examined the fracture site- something not possible because the original fracture was still there. Apparently, all he did was cut the tip of the bone off. This, obviously, caused me to have a follow up procedure to fix that issue.  So I had to wait in pain and not continue my life, which was wrong to begin with, and my surgery was incorrectly performed. I spoke with a lawyer and was basically told my case isn't big enough for his firm. I plan on getting a second opinion. I would like to know what you guys think. If I can't find representation, should I send a letter to the original ortho? I would include what happened, what had to be done, the images from the CTs clearly showing the hook still there. Maybe compensation? What should I do? Thanks in advance!"	Yes
I have been living in my apartment for nearly 2 years now. Shortly after I moved in there was a leak in my ceiling that damaged my mattress beyond repair. My landlord grudgingly paid for me to replace it though angrily told me I could replace it for 50$. He is an angry cheapskate but told me it was fixed and we had no issues.  Fast forward to yesterday when the Same pipe burst. Soaking my mattress monitors and keyboard. I am looking at 500-600$ to replace them. Luckily for all products I have either receipts or amazon history for each purchase.   My landlord has been apologetic so far but is already talking about just giving me one of his used monitors when I fully intend for equal replacements.   As far as I know my landlord is responsible for the damages correct? I am comtemplating finding asking a lawyer or if it would even be worth going to court should this turn ugly.  I have taken pictures of all the damages and the burst pipe. Thoughts/advice?	Yes
Had a bad interaction with an employee. Attempted to 1 star review the company saying that some staff are not very welcoming to new community members. It was replied to by the owner who explained I have been trying to contact most of his employees outside of work hours for things not related to work(turns out this part was true, but he left out the part that I had no idea they worked there, and they it was through either dating apps or fetlife). I replied to defend myself from the accusation and the review was deleted. I bough a bunch of dislikes because im petty and it was cheap, how much if any trouble can I get in	Yes
"I'm in Denver, Colorado. My wife and I moved into a great condo building that we fell in love with. We had been warned that some of the residents were cranky or gossipy but we figured it couldn't be that bad.   The building was built in the late '70s and something like 40% of the peeps still there are original owners. Slowly it's changing over to young families and younger people overall but there seem to be a lot that hate to see anything change. Some families have been hassled since ""kids shouldn't be here"", things like that. Dogs as pets are not allowed in the building.   I have an emotional support dog. I submitted my doctor's note to the office, he's got his vest and everything and the HOA even gave us a little official tag to clip to his collar that shows our documentation was provided and he's allowed to be there. The HOA has been great. Told us to tell them if anyone was being a jerk and even put an article in the monthly newsletter reminding residents that there are service animals in the building, that they are allowed, and showing their pictures and names so people would know.   Despite this, there are several people who have become very verbally aggressive. Shouting at us that he doesn't belong here and calling the office to say he (and us) need to be kicked out. The office shuts it down but my wife and I are tired of being stressed every time we have to go out. Thank goodness for the dog because our anxiety levels are off the charts right now.   My wife wants to sue some of these people for harassment but I'm wondering if having a lawyer draw up a Cease and Desist letter might do the trick? If one gets it they'll all hear about it and my hope is that people will stop shouting at us. I'm nervous that someone is going to try to injure or poison my dog. I know CO is a one-party consent state, should I just start recording people? I have no clue what the best course of action is in a situation like this.   Thanks in advance and please let me know if more details are needed."	Yes
"I posted this originally in /r/relationships and was told I should speak to the police and/or an attorney about a restraining order. I wanted to post here and make sure taking these steps would be worth my time. Here's the situation:  I dated my ex-boyfriend my first semester at university (7.5 years ago). We dated casually (I was seeing other people) for about 6 months, and then he asked for us to be exclusive. I met his parents shortly after when they came to visit him at the university over the summer. My parents were also visting at the time, and they all seemed to hit it off, even exchanging contact information so my dad and his could go golfing sometime (which I'm sure was just my father being curteous, but I digress).   The following semester, my ex-boyfriend started to show his true colors. He began yelling at my both in public and private if I cursed, dressed provocatively (wearing shorts or a tank top), or if he felt I was disrespecting him. I ended the relationship shortly after. This is when his harassment started.   My ex-boyfriend would text and call me and my best friend non stop about why I left him and how he was going to kill himself. I ignored this, I knew he was just being manipulative. He started accusing my best friend of ""stealing"" me from him and turning me into a lesbian. We continued to ignore this crazy train and eventually it slowed down.   When I went home at Christmas to visit my parents I learned that my ex boyfriends FATHER had been calling my dad about the break up. He said his son had bought an engagement ring and we owed their family for the expense. My dad just laughed it off, thankfully. Nothing ever came of this.   Fast forward to now. My ex-boyfriend hasn't done much for the past two or three years to me. But my current partner and I just got engaged and my ex-boyfriend found out (I'm guessing via social media?). My partner was faculty at the university I attended. We started seeing each other at some point while I was still a student. He has since left the university and obviously I graduated. A few people knew about our relationship and ignored it; we were in different colleges and were never public about our relationship. But my ex-boyfriend has now begun harassing him on social media and even got his office phone number and is threatening to ""out"" us to all of my partner's colleagues. I don't think anything would come of it, albeit some embarrassment, but the bigger problem is that this guy is still obsessed.   I have no idea how to get this guy to stop. I've tried blocking him, obviously he's still vindictive as ever. I feel like I'm trapped in a teenage drama. I'm not a child anymore and I want this all to stop. But I'm scared to talk to him either over the phone, via email or face to face for fear of inflaming this issue even further.   Also, in case this is of relevance: I currently live in California and the guy harassing me resides in Georgia.    TL;DR my crazy ex-boyfriend won't let things go 5 years later. No idea how to get him to stop. Not sure if I need to seek legal council."	Yes
I'm looking to file a Small Claims Filing for an accident caused by a bicyclist who was in my lane going down a hill around a blind corner. What I'm looking to recouperate is the amount of the deductible from my insurance claim for the damage she caused. I've tried contacting her 4 times over the last 2 weeks to no avail. She has no auto insurance because she lives in the city, so it was as if I had an accident with a pedestrian. There were no injuries from the accident, as the bicyclist was treated at the scene and refused further care.   I've emailed the office of the Ombudsman for Hudson County, NJ, and told me that I'm to file a small claims filing for a Motor Vehicle Accident. I was provided the following forms:   * http://www.njcourts.gov/forms/10148_sc_motorveh.pdf * http://www.njcourts.gov/forms/10290_small_claims.pdf  What I'm hoping to find out from you guys is A) If I'm able to also put on the claim the $42 I was required to pay to file the complaint in addition to the $500 deductible, and B) If I'm able to place a somewhat arbitrary amount of dollars for the burden of having to take off of work to take the car to the shop, come to court and do the filing due to her negligence in the first place, and if so, what is a reasonable amount for this (I am a salaried employee so I had/will have to take PTO to do so but don't have lost wages due to this)?  If you have any other recommendations I'd love to hear it!	Yes
tldr; Someone came into my apt 3 separate times this week and stole varying amounts of candy each time. Apartment may have same locks and key for various units.  Kansas City, MO.  First off, let me start off with how my apartment building works. This is a fob entry building and you need a fob to get off any floor except the lobby. Which is why I believe it to be someone that lives in the building, namely my neighbor.  I have a roommate and we live in a small 2BR/2BA with a small entry way and living room. It's 6 regular steps to our living room, 14 to the kitchen, 15 and 17 to our rooms. I just want to show you how small it is. I came home Sunday from a 1 month trip visiting home while my roommate stayed here by herself. We have a candy bowl that I put candy in for guests and for ourselves.   I come home and see it's half full. Two days later, it's completely empty except for two pieces of candy. I ask my roommate what she did with it all, that's a lot of candy. She said she didn't touch it and her bf didn't touch it. We're both kind of freaked out but think it's stupid that anyone would come in and steal candy and nothing else. I chalk it up to a memory lapse or maybe I have carbon monoxide poisoning and did it, etc etc. I still called the front desk to let them know it was happening and refilled the candy bowl with reese's cups and hershey's kisses. I also talked to my next door neighbor and asked if he saw or heard anything recently. He said no, sorry, and closed the door. We just used a door jammer where even if unlocked, the door cannot be forced in. My 200lb brother couldn't even bust through it. I locked the doors and door jammed it every night until Thursday night, when I completely forgot to jam it.   I wake up Friday morning to go to work and all the bright, orange reese's are gone. I freak out, wake up my roommate and tell her to stop fucking with me cause it's not funny anymore. She told me she was awake all night until 5am, there's no way someone came in. Then she asked me if I woke up around 3am and I said no. She had heard someone in the living room/kitchen but thought it was me getting a snack. We call the front desk again and I head off to work around 9am.   My roommate heads off to work around 1pm and I got home around 3:30pm. Once again, the candy jar is completely empty except for the first two pieces they left the first time they stole our candy. So now they've escalated to daytime stealing. That is where I am left off night. Nothing has happened over the weekend. I called the police to report it over the phone but they want to physically come out and do a report. I went out of town and wasn't able to do it and my roommate worked all weekend. We also don't want to spook the thief because I really want to catch who is doing this. It's really freaking creepy and psychotic to just come in someones home to steal candy, just to fuck with us.   I believe it is the teenage boy because he is only 13, can't drive, and is on summer break. He also isn't the sweetest kid ever. I've seen him throw things and yelling racist obscenities at street walkers for no reason (we share the same window wall).  I had believed that perhaps someone has a masterkey or were picking our locks but my roommate actually talked to a tenant on our floor. The tenant said that when she first moved in, her key worked on three other units. I have already contacted the owner of my unit and let him know what was up and that he needs to come change my locks.  So, my problem is two part: this must be some sort of negligence/ security issue to have same lock for multiple units and how do I go about get this thief in jail or juvie. I am afraid that he will escalate from petty stealing to something worse. I don't want anyone else caught up in this after I move out. I am already hoping to do a stakeout tonight with my gopro recording as well as sleeping in the living room.   Thanks for sticking with the story and I apologize for my terrible writing. Any advice would be great, thanks!	Yes
I'm trying to get some advice for my roommates sister, and I only have the basic run down. Her sisters son died from Bacterial Meningitis, and was sick for about 2 weeks before it happened. They were controlling it with Motrin, but his fever got worse and they took him into the ER after a couple days of him not improving. He had a 103 fever upon arrival, and they just told him to keep giving him Motrin and released him. They never ran any further tests finding out that he had that, and the next day he continued to just not really wake up, and continued to look in bad shape. They took him into another hospital the next morning after being released from the ER, and they wound up admitting him and had to put him on life support that same night. 24 hours later, they pronounced him brain dead.   I just don't see any way the ER should NOT have admitted him, and possibly been able to save his life. Would they potentially be on the hook for this?	Yes
"Hello, my name is Amelia and I was hospitalized after a suicide attempt more than two years ago. I live in the twin cities metropolitan area of Minnesota. I won't specifically state what hospital because I don't want to give myself away, but I can tell you that it was supposed to be a good one.   As part of the treatment there I had a team of psychiatrists including a psychiatry resident who was the main doctor that talked to me. The head psychiatrist, who was also the head of the psychiatry residency program was a bitch to say the least. She was rude and she never talked directly to me. She talked to me in the third person. ""Well, if Amelia is good, we'll let her participate in the activity today."" ""If Amelia can keep herself safe she can go to pet therapy tomorrow."" Her terrible attitude wasn't the worst of it, however I believe that she was the one responsible for what everyone did. It all came down to her.   I was deemed suicidal by the on-call resident one night because I was displaying unsafe behaviors, and he ordered me to seclusion for the entire night. He said if I didn't go willingly I would be forced in. Confused and upset, I went into that room (because i willingly went they didn't lock it), and only a minute later, my nurse at the time, Chris (he was an asshole, didn't even treat me like a human being) was talking with that resident and some other nurses about moving all of my personal belongings to a different room that had a camera. Confused, I offered to help and opened the door. A couple nurses shoved me back into the corner and ordered that my shoes and jacket were taken off. They ripped that off and left me in the room crying with the door locked.   When I get stressed, I have problems urinating. And they did let me use the bathroom about an hour after they locked the door, but they would stare at me the whole time. And each time I couldn't void. Chris thought I was just doing this to be oppositional (I was misdiagnosed with oppositional defiant disorder) and he told me he wouldn't let me go to the bathroom anymore. The door to leave seclusion was unlocked at the time (the bathroom door always locked) but if I even touched the door they told me they'd lock it again. I was crying because I was in so much pain because I couldn't urinate, but they brushed it off because I was diagnosed with ODD, I was just being oppositional. Luckily, Chris eventually went on break, and this one aide, bless her heart, let me go to the bathroom after she gave me a lot of water, and I finally went. I think she was the only one that believed me.   Well, that wasn't even the worst of it. They made me spend the whole night in the seclusion room with the light on, no blanket and just a mattress and my pillow. The room was dirty. They never cleaned it. I could see peeled off fingernails in the corner from the last person in there (or maybe a few people before) and I told them but no one would clean it up for me. It was just me and the fingernails for the entire night. I never got to shower, wash my face, or even brush my teeth the previous night. I asked but they said no. I couldn't even brush my hair. And the worst part is, none of this was in my medical record. They didn't write that I spent the night there. They kept it vague, saying the plan was that I sit there for a few minutes.   and that's not even the worst. Because the next night I had the same nurse, Chris again. And he wanted me to sit on my bed around bed time, and when i woukdn't he threatened to send me to seclusion. I told he couldn't do that, that it's not right, but he did it anyway. When I refused to go, he ordered a couple nurses to come in while he carried my mattress to that room again. When the nurses couldn't get me to go willingly (""Come on Amelia, be a big girl and take my hand!"" mind you i was sixteen at the time) Chris and another guy named Eric came back. Then one of them suggested that instead of calling security they would just carry me there. So you know what they did? They grabbed my my arms and legs and carried me like I was an animal. I was struggling, trying to break free, and my pants were falling down because they were too big, but they kept bringing me down the hall. And they brought me into that room and dropped me on the mattress, walked out, and locked the door. And I spent my second night in a row in that room. That incident was never recorded in my record.   There's even more littler things, but that's the major stuff. I still suffer with flashbacks and nightmares among other things today. And I'm not necessarily looking for money, I just want those who were involved to pay for this. I want this on their record, so hopefully this doesn't happen to someone else. I want to feel okay again. So all I need to know, is do I have a chance to win this lawsuit? If I do, how do I go about it? Where do I start? I'm not super hopeful because it's a psych case, but I feel like I have to do something.  Thank you. TL;DR I was treated poorly by numerous psychiatric staff during a hospitalization and I was traumatized from it."	Yes
I was in a collision on my motorcycle a few weeks ago and the police report stated that the other party was at fault. My left index finger was broken and I needed surgery because there was a piece broken off in my middle joint. The surgery went well but i may not be able to fully flex or extend my left index finger for the rest of my life. Therein lies the main issue: I'm a professional musician and my surgeon says I may not be able to play again. I'll also have to take 6-8 weeks off of work due to my injuries. So with her being fully at fault, should I get a lawyer?	Yes
Looking for advice for an accident I was recently involved in as I don't really trust my lawyer knows what they're doing. I was involved in an accident involving 3 cars (including my own) as a passenger that I was at no fault in. My medical expenses are around $30k since I've been having to go to PT. One of the insurance companies is trying to settle for $5k. According to my lawyer, the alternative is to go to trial. This offer just seems ridiculous and my lawyer said they're going to counter at $15k which I still think is too low. I've been dealing with pain for a year and a half because of this, and I hear typical settlements are around 3x your medical expenses. Is this right? I really need some sound advice on how to proceed.	Yes
 Hi everybody, I'm in need of some advice/guidance. I'm about to release an app, which is basically based on seeing people in your area (through an interactive map) and then being able to message them and ultimately meet up. Unfortunately, that can obviously lead to somebody getting hurt or robbed. My question is, would I be considered liable or get into any kind of trouble if that did happen (seeing as how they used my app)? And, if so, is there any way I can protect myself from that? Sorry if that sounds unethical or something  I'm in Houston, TX, btw	Yes

"Almost 20 years ago, an extremely fucked up series of events happened to me in public schools. I'd be willing to discuss more details in a private message or an e-mail, but here's the brief sequence of events:          1.) A school administrator assaulted me in his office (grabbed me by the throat and slammed me against the wall, didn't stop choking me until another teacher who was present physically removed him)     2.) Another student pulled a stupid prank and blew up a toilet. I happened to be in the bathroom at the same time. Charges were pressed against both of us, and we were both suspended indefinitely. I spent almost 2 years awaiting trial. The trial lasted 15 minutes. The judge grilled the DA for wasting everyone's time.     3.) Started going to school in the next town over. Was brutally beaten by a student, perhaps as a ""hazing"" ritual - I had never seen him before.     4.) Dropped out of school and started using. Spent the rest of my life as a high functioning addict - until 16 months ago.     5.) Got sober, subsequently had a serious mental break down, was hospitalized, diagnosed with several severe mental illnesses.          Not sure if there's any lawsuit here. It's all super fucked up but it was also so long ago. If that idea is dead in the water, what can I do about the fact that I keep getting denied when I put in disability claims? I really can't work more than 2 or 3 days/week and even then I still have days where I just can't.           Appreciate any help, even if it's just pointing me in the right direction."	Yes
"I have a friend who I wish to help, and I have no idea how to go about it. She's a woman in her forties who lost vision in her right eye due to an accident with a burning ember. Her eye socket was badly burned and she became *mostly* blind in that eye. Her first physician treated her with some type of steroid eye drops. She was prescribed the drops and told explicitly to only use them *only* with her damaged eye, and never under any circumstances with her good eye. Fast forward approximately two months, and my friend was given a new doctor. I'm unsure about the details and reasons for the switch; all I know is it had something to do with her insurance. So, she meets with her new doctor and the doctor examines her and studies the details of her case. The woman doctor then decides that my friend should continue with the same medicine which she was originally prescribed by the first physician, with one difference: she was told to use the steroid eye drops in *both* eyes. My friend objected, and did so in a very adamant and serious and confident manner. ""But Doctor So And So very specifically and very plainly told me in no uncertain terms that I was to never, never, *never* put those drops in my good eye. He told me over and over, he really drove the point home and underlined emphatically to not let the steroid drops get anywhere near the other eye."" And so on. Somehow though, this new physician who had been assigned to her managed to eventually convince my friend to entirely disregard what the other doctor had told her. And this was a BIG and LOUD sort of conversation these two had, almost verging on a heated argument. And so, in the end, my friend submitted to the new physician's orders. She was a doctor and she knew best. And so my friend returns home, puts the medicine in both eyes, and goes to bed. When she awakens the next morning the world is blackness. She is 100% blind. I won't go into the aftermath, the bottomless depression, the sense that her life had become the worst, most terrifying nightmare, the *endless* crying, etcetera. Suffice it to say she suffers *enormously*, and the fact that she caved in and ignored her instincts only adds a whole other Hell-Factor to it all. And to make matters even worse, she's living with an abusive and horrible man who she had a kid with, and she's scared to death of him. Always has been, really. He's completely drained her bank account since the blindness, he's hit her on at least one occasion that I know of, and once, when she meekly stood up to him and refused to do something for him involving her bank, he kicked her out of his car and left her alone and stranded in the middle of downtown Seattle. ""Get out and find your own way back."" I could go on but I won't, suffice it to say her life is an unbelievably bleak and abysmal mess. No one has helped her with this, and she lives in fear. So, I'm wondering how to proceed. I'm going to anything and everything I can to assist her, but I don't know where to begin. Would a contingency lawyer be prone to rip her off to the fullest possible degree? My working hypothesis is a strong YES, and I'd be grateful if any honest and knowledgable person could explain how that scenario might play out. And lastly I should mention that proving all of this is a piece of cake. Numerous witnesses saw and heard and were present when this second doctor gave these harmful directions to my friend. So there won't be any problem with that. She has written proof as well in the form of a prescription and in the form of this doctor's hand-written note.   And I apologize for the breathless and unorganized text; I just let it all pour out as plainly as I could. And again, I would be grateful if any knowledgable person were kind enough to help with advice or information or honest help in any other form."	Yes
I moved into an apartment in CT back in May 2016 which turned out to be horrible due to no wall insulation and an unstable downstairs neighbor who moaned when I had females over for fun then smoked cigarettes and denied it and made me ill from second hand smoke. I later found out from a next door neighbor that the prior tenant living in my apartment abruptly left after a few months due to similar reasons to mine. Calls to management made no difference and they denied any smoking or problems with neighbor. They even went as far as threatening eviction for stating I was causing him a disturbance, refusing my calls about the eviction threat then stating it was sent by mistake by their Jewish lawyer during their holiday. Despite all of this, I received a lease renewal request in March 2017 and was too busy with work (I work in a hospital) to look for apartments or sign the renewal. Finally got to a point where my neighbor continued to smoke and then harass me with total denial by him and management and I decided to get the hell out. I found a nice but more expensive place and signed the lease renewal letter on June 1 as intent to vacate by July 1 which was received by them on June 8, 2017. I also left the apartment spotless and in better condition then when I moved in by leaving expensive blinds and newly painted walls. I have all letters, payments and the apartment condition documented with pictures.   Now the management company is refusing to return any security because they are saying I did not supply 30 days notice. The apartment is spotless and they only commented on the timing of receiving the lease renewal notice. Does the timing of the renewal signing and 30 days notice have anything to do with receiving back my security? Can I take them to small claims court?	Yes
"So I just was told by by my neighbor that their dog was attacked (badly apparently) by mine, in my backyard. It is not fenced, but has an electric fence. My dog will not leave but it doesn't prevent anything else from coming in obviously. If this is true, am I liable for any injuries? Does homeowners cover this?  Also part 2 of the question: my dog has never shown any aggression to other dogs, she has no scratches or cuts, there is no blood on her at all(she has white fur so it would be super easy to see). Frankly, I'm not convinced she did this at all. But if I didn't see the ""incident"" is it basically just his word against nothing? I took pictures of my dog as soon as he told me but other than that I don't have any proof of anything."	Yes
"Got in an accident a while back.  Sought legal assistance.  The lawyer I found dropped my case after a month and I felt they wasted my time.  I left them a single negative review online containing hard facts, all of which were true. I can back up any of my claims with evidence from multiple sources.  I settled with the driver on my own and figured it was time to move on.  The lawyer felt otherwise.  Since our ""falling out,"" the lawyer has taken the following actions:  * Called me to threaten legal action against me if I do not take down my factual review * Called my employer to try to convince them to fire me, saying he knows their business partners etc. * Called various family members of mine and made them feel harassed. * Has emailed me countless times threatening multiple lawsuits. * Has emailed me threatening to employ a private investigator for the situation. * Has spread multiple lies about me, which I can prove are false. * Has accused me of slander and defamation despite only writing true, varifiable things in my review (such as suggesting potential clients refer to the bar associations website where they can view public records of their censures against this lawyer) * Is threatening to sue me for legal fees from when his firm was attempting to assist me for my accident * Is threatening me with lawsuits, again  I am feeling harassed and bullied.  I plan to speak with my attorney, as well as getting a second opinion from other local attorneys about the matter.  what do you think?  1.  Do you think I can take him to court for harassment? 2.  Do you think the bar association would get involved on my behalf?  I actually contacted them a few months ago and they seemed interested, h has further harassed me since. 3.  do you think I have anything to worry about when it comes to his (IMO false) claims of slander and defamation?"	Yes
"http://m.imgur.com/a/IiDrC  About $100 worth of Pokemon cards. The boxes were kicked and scattered all across the ground.

Hi all,  so rewind to about a year ago when I began taking some medicine to remove a foot fungus in the. During one of my last treatment visits in January 2017, I saw a different podiatrist for the first time due to my other podiatrist being out of the office. This new podiatrist may have had an issue with my appearance or something because he did not really address me at all and seemed annoyed by my presence. He did not talk much even though I had asked him a lot of questions about my progress. He takes a quick look at my nails and then proceeded to cut my nails very low, despite my painful cries, without warning me or asking me to do so in the first place. After which he writes me a script for some bogus prescription that didn't help and left without saying anything. Fast forward to May 2017, and I start to develop very uncomfortable pain in one of the toes trimmed down low. Apparently, the low cutting of the toenail resulted in an ingrown toe nail in eventually both toes. A preventative measure to this is to soak your foot in salt water to help the nail grow, but my previous podiatrist did not mention anything about that.   The ingrown toenail proceeded to get infected, and resulted in the last couple of months of alot of pain, discomfort, expenses on medical supplies, and many trips to the doctor. I really find this podiatrist culpable of all of these issues, especially since the other podiatrist I saw before him did not think it was necessary to cut the nail so low, and has been coaching me through the entire process.  Can I sue that podiatrist I saw in Jan for cutting my nail too low and not giving me any advice after to prevent ingrown toenails?  Are their lawyers out there willing to see this case considering there won't be a lot of money involved?   Thanks for any legal advice you can provide!	Yes
"The accident happened in Irvine, CA. I was giving my girlfriend a ride to work on my motorcycle in the far left lane before HOV. With the intent of using the HOV lane, I waited for a break in the yellow lines, hit the turn signals, looked over my shoulder and then mirror, saw that there were no vehicles in the HOV, and made the lane change. Maybe ~10ft from the point where I changed lanes, I heard another motorcycle's tires screeching (assuming he locked up his tires), and the rider going down in my rear mirror. Pulled over and did a police report. He and his bike suffered some rashes; neither my gf, my bike and I were harmed. I received a warning letter from the DMV saying that I will be receiving a point on my license from that accident for ""failing to notice (the rider) approaching from the left rear"".  I got a copy of the report today and found out that in his statement, he said he was ""driving (his motorcycle) on I-5 s/b splitting lanes between the HOV and #1 lane (far left)..."". Is it legal to be splitting lanes in between four solid yellow lines? If legal, what can I do next time to prevent a similar accident?"	Yes
"Located in California. Last year I was involved in a small car accident where the other party had rear ended me. For several months, the other party was unreachable according to his insurance, only to suddenly then inform me that I was at fault and that they will not pay. I am currently in the process of filing a claim but I have some questions as I was/am under 18.  - What exactly does appointing a ""guardian ad litem"" mean for me? Am I still allowed to present the case in court on my own?  According to official websites, I must be appointed a ""guardian ad litem"" who will represent me since I am a minor. My parents have limited English and it would be preferred for me to present the case. - Is it possible to charge the defendant for costs of a rental car while the damaged car is being repaired? I have the intention of squeezing out as much as possible since the other party has caused an inconvenience for me and my family. If possible, how would I go about including the costs for a rental car?  So far, those are the only questions I have come across filling out the paperwork. Any other tips and advice would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
She left them with him because she was moving and couldnt bring all her things right away. Now after moving back to the same area he ducked her text and calls for months about retrieving her things. Then we came to find out that him and his wife had had a divorce and he said that she was now in possession of the unit. We got her number from him and upon texting her found out that he had stopped payment on the unit and all the items were removed or taken by the company. What do we do to get her things back or monetary compensation for the thousands of dollars worth of things that were in the storage. She is inconsolable over the loss of her things. Any help is much appreciated, if more information is needed Im happy to provide it.	Yes
So I posted something on Facebook and this guy (that I don't know) posted something and then messaged me separately. Is this a threat, and should I report him?

"My father was insured under Medicare and was diagnosed with diabetes and pulmonary fibrosis by his ""primary physician"" (which is basically a group of nurse practitioners) back in August-October 2016. They took x-rays and claimed that the mass in his right lung was due to his lung slowly hardening from pulmonary fibrosis. My father's condition grew worse over the next couple months and my mother requested for him to be admitted to the ER for further examination. They denied my father this opportunity because they said his condition ""wasn't severe enough."" They led my father to believe that his drastic weight loss was from diabetes and that his breathing issues derived from pulmonary fibrosis.  On May 3rd, 2017 he was admitted to the ER because he had trouble breathing. They took a biopsy and determined that he had Stage 4 Lung Cancer. On June 2nd, he passed away.  What can I do? What documents will I need to defend my case?"	Yes
"A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine (I am a supervisor) got into a yelling match with me over me asking him to do something he didn't want to do. He did not directly threaten me verbally at this point, but he is twice my size and was attempting to intimidate me; including him coming up close to me and asking ""You wanna say something to me?"" In a threatening tone.  I contacted our director, and the other supervisor, to alert them to this. The other supervisor comes in because they live close and I was very much under the impression I was not safe at work. The co-worker that threatened me returned; thinking I was out of the office, he began to brag about how he was about to come back in and attack me.   At this, I ask him to leave for the day and all hell breaks loose. He and the other supervisor start screaming at one another, as myself and other had to hold the two back from one another or there would have been a fight. Finally he leaves the office, and having heard what happened, our director comes in to speak with him. Our director leaves, the asshole who threatened me got to work the rest of the shift. I was promised that the situation would be resolved and I was more than happy to be patient. Weeks have passed and literally nothing has been done, even the bare minimum that the director promised.   Now when have HR coming in tomorrow with an eye to fire all three of us involved. I'm at my ropes end with this company, and I've been told by a few people that if I'm fired that I'd be in my right to sue them. Is there any truth to that?"	Yes
I don't want to disclose too much as to give away my identity. I got into some controversy on my channel, people got upset and someone on a gossip forum leaked my full name (I only reveal my first name). I've also had people leak photos of me that are only available on my FB and to access my FB you would need to know my full name. Recently, someone messaged me on my private FB account asking me questions about the controversy that went down and I feel like thats a complete invasion of my privacy. If you want to speak with me, you can email me or comment on my videos but to stalk me and look for my FB and then message me on there? That's extremely creepy and I was honestly freaked out by it. Legally, is there anything I can do about people who leak my full name? I mean, can't people on gossip forums be charged with some form of targeted harassment? Location is NY.	Yes
I'm a college student in Florida and hit a parked car in my neighborhood while I myself was parking. I've only been driving for around a year now but have always been a safe driver. I immediately parked, went up close to asses the damage and then left a note on the dented backseat passenger door telling the driver to call me. So later in the day she texts me and is very understanding and even asks if I rather not get insurance involved. We both call our parents and I'm ready to go get a quote on the damage but she doesn't text me for 2 and half months so I'm thinking she's forgotten about the whole thing or gotten it fixed herself or something.  Now she's texted me back asking if we can get her car fixed by the weekend. Just looking at the price estimates for fixing dented doors + chipped paint looks like it'll be at least a grand, I really only have a 300$ limit right now so i'm kind of screwed. What would be the consequences if we got insurance involved? (It's my dad's insurance as the car is still under my father's ownership)  Thanks in advanced for helping the nervous college kid out	Yes
Neighbor's tree fell on my car. My car is covered by my insurance but we have a $1,000 deductible.  They're long-time good neighbors and have promised to hire a professional to remove the rest of the tree. They offered to contribute to the car repair cost.   We can afford the deductible.   Legal question 1. What kind of legal document would be useful to document our verbal agreement? Is one needed?  Moral question 1. If I take them up on their offer to contribute to the car repair, what is a fair percentage to ask for?  2. Considering professional tree removal cost is $500-$1,000, should I decline their offer to contribute to the repair cost as a gesture of goodwill?   Thank you!	Yes
I don't want to give any serious details out, but my direct boss has falsely claimed that I have asked him out/ asked for his number and made advances towards him at work. None of these things are true.  Nothing serious has come of it, but is there any action I should take? This is just a shitty part time job but I don't want to get fucked over.   I only heard this from a co worker. It happened when my boss, another manager, and a few co workers went out for drinks, and I don't think anyone believed him.   Do I file with HR w/o proof? I don't even have an actual HR department, just a phone number. I just don't want to get into trouble for something I didn't do.	Yes
"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."

I apologise for the phone formatting  I recently purchased a home in mid May and was able to move in at the end of May. In the past few days we have had rather hard rains but nothing out of the norm for a summer storm. There was never any flooding problems disclosed when purchasing the home but today and Friday water is coming in from under the trim in the basement. Is there anything legally I can do about this?   Water is pooling in the front of the house on top of a brick walkpath towards the front door and it has to be draining into the soil next to the house which is draining into the basement. The carpet in the basement is getting sufficiently wet where it and the padding is completely soaked. After the storm was done half of the basement was completely soaked on the same side that the water had pooled.   Any help or advice would be appreciated. Thanks	Yes
Okay, so I really don't know where to start with this. I am 17 years old and living in Texas. I recently moved out of my mother's house to live with my sister in my father's home. My father used to live here with us, but after getting a job in another state, he moved and I went to live with my mother. I lived with my mother from ages 15-17. As I lived there with my mother I started to realize how unstable the living situation was. There were times when she would yell at me so much that I had to leave to go stay at a friend's house. This happened multiple times. The incident that occurred that made me feel that I needed to move was when I came home one morning from spending the night at a friend's house to find all of my belongings thrown on the floor in my room. The entire house was in disarray.  She said that her friend was the one who was responsible for this, but now claims that she did it. I don't know which to believe. This all happened in the midst of her coming off of Xanax, so her words were slurred and she just wasn't making sense in general. This is not the first time she has had trouble with addiction. I was fed up, and decided to take my important belongings with me and move into the house I grew up in with my sister. I also feel that it's important to add that I go to school in the same city that my mother lives in, but I have plans to commute there while still living here. I really do not want to move in back with my mother. It is an unstable living environment. So I'm asking if, legally, I'm allowed to stay here. What rights do I have? Does she have any power over me? I'm very anxious that she might try to make me live with her. Thank you in advance for your help.	No
My father plans on getting re-married later in his life.  I always thought when he passes away my brother and I would gain his inheritance and estate, but will my new stepmother be the new heir?  My father is older than her, so he will most likely pass away first.  My soon-to-be stepmother also has two children of her own.  I'm afraid she will gain all my father's assets and use them to benefit her children.  Is it still possible for my brother and I to inherit all my fathers property and assets when the inevitable happens.  We all live in California.	No
Hello all. My girlfriend and I recently rented an apartment in Atlanta, GA and have been living in it for the last 8 days. The apartment has gone from great to terrible in that short amount of time. I will list out the issues we have faced since our move in and will provide more detail if needed.  1. Potential gas leak. I informed the customer service manager of a potential gas leak in my apartment as both my gf and I smelt a strange gas-ish odor when using both the gas stove and gas-heated water. I reported this issue to them around noon of yesterday, but no maintenance personnel were sent out to investigate despite this being a potential serious issue. Concerned for our safety, I contacted the local fire department who sent out a fire unit to investigate my apartment. They found no gas leaks, but did uncover some other serious issues that I will list below.  2. Indoor AC/Water heating unit. When the fire department came to investigate the potential leak, they removed a locked maintenance door inside of my apartment. The maintenance room was locked and only the maintenance staff has the ability to look inside. After removing the door, the fire lieutenant informed me that the unit was incredibly old and that it has several code violations such as exposed wiring, no cover over the wiring, and cut wires which are just hanging out. Not to mention, the unit looks to be at least 20 years old and has never been maintained- it is truly disgusting with trash, dirt, and bugs everywhere and leads me into some of my next concerns. When the fire unit was here, they cut power to the unit and also turned the gas off to the stove and hot water as it seems they deemed it a large enough safety risk.   3. BUGS. Since we have moved in, we have seen 5 nymph cockroaches in our apartment. I say nymph because these roaches are small as if there is a nest in the area. We also photographed one of them and have identified it as a nymph German cockroach, which, from what I've read on the internet regarding infestations, basically means this complex is overrun and there is very little that can be done to eliminate the issue. I have no doubt that many of the bugs come from the maintenance room as it is truly dirty in every sense of the word. There are also cracks in the wall behind the stove which could also be an easy entrance for bugs.  4. Black mold. When the fire department came, they moved the stove to test for gas leaks. No gas leaks were found, but there appears to be black mold on the wall.   5. Bathroom faucet leak. The bathroom faucet is leaking from the wall where the faucet is attached. I have no doubt there is water damage behind the tub.  On move-in day, none of these issues were identified. We tested the stove and water and did not smell gas, we did not look in the maintenance door as it was locked and seems to always be locked unless a maintenance personnel comes to open it, we saw no bugs as they likely had no reason to come out as the apartment was vacant with no major food sources, we could not look behind the stove because it was nearly impossible to move (3 firemen were needed to move it from the wall), and the bathroom faucet did not seem to leak (at least not noticeably).  At this point, I believe the apartment is beyond repair. Management is very unresponsive here. There is always a line at the customer service office with people complaining (yesterday it seemed everyone was going on about their AC not working), so it's no doubt maintenance staff are overwhelmed, but that doesn't excuse the lack of concern for issues as serious as these.  Maintenance staff did finally get around to our unit this morning around 9 AM and told me that they will try to have the entire indoor AC/water heating unit replace, but that it will take at least a week for it to arrive. In the mean time, he flipped the power and gas back on to the stove and water heater and told me that it was safe to use- this completely contradicts the fire department as they obviously deemed it serious enough to turn off. He also told me that he will try to address the mold, however, I don't understand how he could address it without tearing the entire kitchen apart.  My girlfriend and I think it's best that we terminate the lease early and get out before anything else major happens. We have submitted a written termination request, but the management is trying to charge us outrageous fees for early termination. In the lease it seems there is no grace period if we are unsatisfied with the unit, and it seems there is a 60 day notice needed for the early termination which we will have to pay rent for the entire 60 days and then also pay another months rent as liquidated damages for early termination. The customer service manager yesterday quoted me around $2600 in total for the early termination which is absolutely insane.  I understand that we signed the lease and I did read through it before hand of course, but we had no idea that the apartment was in this condition and I don't believe some of our issues could have been identified without living in the complex. At this point, we are willing to write it off as a learning experience, but what I need to know is if there are any additional steps we can take to possibly get some of the early termination cost waved as many of these issues seem serious?   Is there anyone I can contact to help with a situation like this? I've contacted the fire department and am going to go get a copy of the report today and I've also contacted the local inspectors and am trying to get someone out here to confirm the code violations found by the fire department.  At this point my girlfriend and I are miserable and only want this nightmare to be over. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.	No
My tenant is near the end of their lease with one month left to go.  My property manager at the beginning of the rental agreement took cheques for the tenure of the lease, but he was one short.  Long story short he would pay us the rent, then cash the cheque from the tenant.  Well, for whatever reason he sent us August's rent then went to find that he miscounted and doesnt have a cheque from the tenant for the month.  To make matters worse he's had a huge falling out with the tenant and its unlikely hes going to let the mistake slide.  Now my property manager, who fucked everything up, says we have to pay him back and he's sorry.  What is my recourse here?    Do i have any recourse?  He says i can take the tenant to court and have his wages garnished.  No idea the cost behind that or the time it will take though.  If it helps this was in Alberta.	No
The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	No
I have a friend who is having some problems at work. We have no idea where to start, or if there is any legal way to help.  Recently my friend over heard a coworker (I'll call her Cindy) make a threatens statement about my friend over a text conversation that happen months ago.   My friend went to HR and assumed that Cindy would be appropriately felt with. Unfortunately the situation was turned around on my friend and now she is in more trouble than Cindy.   The head of our company spoke with my friend and said that they couldn't give my friend any sympathy over the situation because she didn't bring it up months ago. Now she has a last chance write up on her record that will never fall off no matter how long she stays at the company. This write up was for miscommunication. She is also on probabtion and they said if she gets any complaints about communication she will be fired on the spot. She now has to take communication classes with Cindy and as far as I can tell Cindy did not get in trouble at all.   I feel like this is retaliation for speaking out against a hostile employee. Cindy is friends with the head of the company and cronyism runs rampant.   Is there anything legally wrong that the employer did?   Thank you.	No
Hey there Reddits,   I live in Maryland with my boyfriend in a rental. We're unmarried, committed, and not really in any hurry to marry. We have a joint checking account, but also keep our own separate accounts. He has some (moderate) cash assets in his accounts. I have a student debt worth about half his assets.   We live in a pretty progressive area, but the local ERs/hospitals are all religious affiliated institutions, and we're gay.  In case something happens, I don't want either of us to have to fight for access/decision rights, etc.   We plan on seeing a local lawyer to get healthcare paperwork taken care of. Other than wills, medical POAs, and advanced decision directives, what else should we be working with them to do? Is there anything to worry about with his assets/my debts?  Anything else I haven't thought of?  TL/DR: Gay unmarried couple planning on seeing an attorney for health care paperwork. Anything else we should ask for to protect each other from debts/issues/etc.?  Thanks!	No
I guess it comes down to whether or not that would legally be considered an internship or training. I'm currently in the US on the Visa Waiver Program. I want to get some exposure to a certain STEM workplace at a local company (unpaid). Is there any way I can do this legally?  I'm only here for two months, so it's very short notice, and I doubt I have time to get visas allowing internships.  I asked this earlier, but it got no response and was buried.

A friend and I are renting a two bedroom condo in Atlanta, GA from the unit's owner. He has asked for an in-person meeting tonight and won't tell us why over the phone. This and some external factors has led us to believe that he would like to sell the condo, and break the lease with us (with the in-person meeting serving as an opportunity to deliver written notice to vacate).  I went to the lease to see what it says and the relevant sections reads as follows: &gt;**Early Termination by Landlord** Tenant agrees that Landlord may terminate the lease prior to the lease expiration date and Tenant agrees to vacate the property if the following conditions are met: &gt;**A:** Landlord gives Tenant sixty (60) days written notice to vacate (Tenant still owes rent through the sixty (60) day notice period). &gt;**B:** Landlord pays to Tenant an amount of $_______ as compensation for disturbing tenant's quiet enjoyment of the property and for the inconvenience of moving early. This credit will be applied to the Tenane account at the time the Tenant vacates the property and will be included with any applicable security deposit refund. The foregoing shall not relieve the Tenant of his or her responsibilities and obligations regarding any damage to the property.  Obviously, the unfilled blank in B is a huge problem. Do we have negotiating room to now agree on fair compensation or does that blank default to $0? If we can negotiate, what amount of compensation would be reasonable/typical/possible?	No
My grandfather passed away recently.  More than a year ago he added me as a co-owner on his bank account. What happens to the money in that account? Does it become part of his estate, am I entitled to it?   I thought I was entitled to at least some of it as the co-owner, but my aunt said not to spend any of it because she would have to pay creditors with it.   The whole point of putting me on his account was because he wanted me to have the money. (I was his caretaker &amp; he lived with me). It's not a whole lot - prob about 5k.   I'm in PA.  TLDR had a joint account with my grandpa, in PA, what happens to the money?	No
My rent is $1200 a month. I recently requested the apartment install a washer and dryer in my unit, which according to them, is $40 a month added to rent. It took them a month to get the washer and dryer installed, and I ever signed a new lease or any paperwork indicating that I agree to pay for the washer and dryer. The last rent bill included the cost for the washer and dryer. Can they arbitrarily increase the billable amount of my rent without me ever signing anything agreeing to pay for it? I get that I requested the washer and dryer, but they forgot to send me a new lease to sign (their mistake, not mine).	No
"I received the following email from my landlord today.  &gt; Good afternoon,  Our office has not received rent for the month of August 2017. Even though your lease is expiring and not being re-newed and you have a move out date of 08/31/2017 you are still responsible for the rent. Due to your NSF check you must pay with either a cashiers check or money order. Also when you will be completing the repairs to the property including paint and replacement of flooring's and baseboards which have been destroyed. The backyard is dug up and destroyed. The property will need to be detailed cleaned and we do have the name and rank of the unauthorized tenant you have sub-leased to. The property needs to be given back in good clean condition as which you received it or we will be contacting both chain of commands and filing in court. I hope you plan to cooperate with this.  For context: I am in the military and had a returned check *one* time and the realtor now requires me to bring a cashiers check, I was in the field and have already payed my rent, before it was late.  Here are the facts  -I have not subleased to anyone. I believe the realtor dug through my things and found my husbands information and made assumptions. He is no longer in the military; and is attending school in a different city.   -The damaged floors she is talking about are floorboards that are cheap laminate faux wood flooring, and are starting to raise at the corners. I believe it is normal wear and tear and the damage is only affecting panels in a small area, it is in no way destroyed.  -I put down a $4700 dollar deposit including deposits for the pets I have.  -I was at a 45 day training exercise and could not pay my rent while I was away. 2 weeks before I left I contacted them 3 different times to fix my online account to accept payments; they did not fix it until after my rent was late, then they slapped a late fee on it, fixed my account, and served me a 3 day notice to pay rent or quit. I paid about ten minutes after my account was fixed.   -My property manager did a walk through in May and found some damages, they did not contact any vendors, as they said they would, to make repairs. Nor have I received a list of things they claim to be damaged by me.  -I moved in after the grass had died for the year, when spring rolled around I realized the landlord had just used dead grass to cover the land as mulch, the grass never grew back and is now completely dirt except for weeds. This is what she means by ""completely destroyed."" I do admit my dogs dug a couple of holes, but those can be easily covered.  -The property manager asked my permission to let the owners enter the property to survey the second bathroom because they wanted to do renovations. I locked the doors into all rooms and placed scotch tape on the walls to see if they entered other areas of the home. They went into every room.  -The property manager made a statement that the owner of the realty did a walk through with me. I told her he hadn't, she became accusatory and refused to believe me. I have never met the owner of the realty.  - My lease states that I should not do any repairs myself.  So my question is, can the landlord force me to make repairs before I move out even if they are holding my security deposit? Also, can they contact my chain of command for this? I don't see the point if they have my security deposit and if they plan to take me to court. It seems their goal in that situation would be to simply get me in trouble. I do not disagree that I have caused some damages, but it is absolutely not something that a good contractor couldn't fix in a day or two. Please help!  -"	No
In December I bought a new house in a new neighborhood.  I received a copy of the CC&amp;Rs that made no mention of restrictions to street parking (in front of your house).  Yesterday, everyone received an email with an updated CC&amp;R document that among other things added the following restrictions...  &gt; Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall park and store Vehicles owned or in use  by such Lot Owner, tenant or occupant, either in the driveway or garage  appurtenant to the Lot owned and/or occupied by them.   &gt;Guests, invitees and licensees of any Int Owner, tenant or occupant shall likewise  park Vehicles in the driveway or garage appurtenant to such Lot Owner, tenant or  occupant's Lot.   &gt;Lot Owners, tenants and occupants shall submit written request to  the ACC for permissible street parking to accommodate guests no less than  seventy-two (72) hours prior to any planned event, and as soon as reasonably  possible for unplanned events such as funeral visitation for example.   &gt;Any vehicle observed in violation of any part of these Rules and Regulations  whether continuously or within twenty-four (24) hours of the first observed  violation, shall be considered a continuation of the previous violation and thus, be  subject to the Enforcement provisions herein.  I wasn't aware that changes to the CC&amp;Rs could be made without a vote, but apparently the neighborhood hasn't been turned over to the HOA, and the developer can change them on whim until such time.  My three questions are, can the developer really change the CC&amp;Rs at will until the development is turned over to the HOA?  Can the HOA enforce parking rules on city owned streets?  What recourse do I have as a homeowner if I receive a fine from the HOA?  Thanks in advance for any feedback or advice.	No
A little while ago I had a fire in a condo that was my fault. It caused enough damage to have to replace everything in the unit.   Good news is that I had tenant insurance with $1,000,000 in liability. Bad news is that the landlords didn't have insurance for themselves.   They have been harassing me with emails saying that my insurance isn't giving them enough ($5000 short), and that I need to pay them the difference. They are threatening to sue if I don't.   I spoke with my insurance and they said too bad for them. The amount they are getting represents depreciation of what was lost (appliances and cabinets). They should have had their own insurance.  I initially told them to contact my insurer as they are handling the liability of the claim, but they continue to come at me. I've decided to cease responding to them until they decide to contact with a lawyer.   I'm pretty sure my insurance will take care of me if they want to sue, but I want to make sure with you guys. Do I have anything to worry about here? Would the $5000 even be worth it for them to hire someone?  Thanks	No

I lived in a multi-unit complex owned by my landlord for 2 years. We dealt with numerous issues over the course of our tenancy:  Knowing that we're students with loans to pay rent, she asked us for rent 1-2 weeks early as a favor to her on multiple occasions, and we complied.   Last summer, the plumbing in the complex went out, and we were without running water for 5 days. The only compensation she offered us was a large garbage can of rain water she collected.   Further, she left a large pile of brush on our porch for weeks that we believe attracted rats into our apartment. We had to buy expensive electronic traps out of our own pockets to remedy this issue.   Finally, she told us (three mid-20s medical students with long-term GFs) that we were not allowed to have overnight guests unless we paid her $20/night for each guest. Had this been in the lease, I'd kind of get it; but she declared this rule probably 6 months into our lease after she saw an unknown car in our parking spot.  While there's not much to do about these issues now, I wanted to frame what we've been dealing with.  Now to the point of my story: Roommate A sent her a move out notice 30-days before and explicitly listed his new address (we were all going our separate ways) as the address to forward our deposit. I also called her and stated please send the required statement of deductions to my address too, and provided her with my address. 21 days comes and passes and neither I nor Roommate A have gotten anything in the mail. I write a letter to her explaining that per civil code 1950.5, her 21 day period to mail us a copy of the statement of damages has lapsed and that she has forfeited her right to any part of our deposit. I also stated that if she didn't provide us with the full deposit, or if there were any deductions from said deposit, we'd sue her for the deposit, interest, and any punitive damages allowed under the law up to $10,000.  I take this letter and send a certified copy and also place another copy directly in the mailbox. I call her the next day to inform her that we have left a letter in her mailbox and she interrupts me and says that she is out-of-town right now, but earlier she mailed the statement to Person B and it got sent back to her return-to-sender. She then stated that she would be sending the statement again shortly.   Person B did not ever give her his address. Person A gave her his forwarding address in the move-out letter, and I gave her my address over phone.   My roommates and I have concluded that either a) she's lying or b) she somehow person's B old address on file (Person B found this apartment and did all the work to obtain the lease, as Person A and I were both coming out of state). Even so, it makes no sense why it would be return-to-sender.    Does anyone have any advice as to how to proceed? I want her to provide the postmarked envelope to see if it actually exists. If we were to take this to small claims, do we have a pretty open-and-shut case, or am I misinterpreting the law?	No
Long story but here is the short version. Just turned 17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings (13 year old twins)  and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.  He reached out to teachers for help so she made him drop extra curricular activities.    He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	No
"Hi! First and foremost, my name is Tyler and I'm happy to meet you all. I've heard from a few friends of mine that this sub tends to point people in the right direction who need it, so hopefully, we can figure something out!  Okay, so, here goes. My GF and I have been together for roughly three years. As long as I can remember, the schedule has always been with her kids (not mine, even though I love them as such), that we get them on the weekends.   This is something that we communicated to our landlord when we signed the lease, and it was something he was very much aware of. Now, this is where it starts to get muddled. We had a 6 month term lease, nothing too out of the ordinary on it with things looking decent. Tbh, we got this place sort of as a last minute steal, so we were very happy.  After the 6 month lease was over, he called us in to talk to him. Now, another important factor here, is that our landlord LITERALLY lives in front of us. We live in his backyard, kinda. He had an office for a business that he used to run, and it became bankrupt. With that, he had an empty space to offer us, and he did.   Now, I checked the guy out, making sure he was clean. He had a few bad hits on his record, like road aggression, but he had a strange charge with traveling or waiting too close to a school. I can get the actual charge number as well if that would help.   Anyways, he seemed cool enough, but when we talked to him about renewal, he had mentioned that we were no longer going to do a 6 month lease, and that we would switch to a month to month. It was a little bit fishy there, but whatever. I trusted him and I never thought he would kick us out with only two weeks to find a new place. He placed a notice on our doorstep saying:  July 15, 2017  ""By this writing, this is notification that in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Lease Agreement entered into on the 1st day of July, 2017, between [all parties], per item no. 15, you are in hereby in default of the agreement.  As of this date you are being notified that this Lease Agreement is null and void. You have until July 31, 2017 by 6:00 pm to vacate the premises...""  There was more, but the important part is what No. 15 is: Rental agreement is for tenant's only. Any other persons staying on property ninety-six (96) hrs., or more than four (4) days per month, is subject to additional charges at the rate of 20$ per occupant, unless landlord has agreed.""  Now, we've talked about this with him. Since the beginning, we've had the kids every weekend, almost every month. They're sweet, sweet kids (besides the point), and they were here on Summer vacation. Now, on like, the 5th day, they decided to leave that notice.   What do I do? Tbh, to me, that no. 15 isn't very clear. Does that mean we pay it at the end of the month along with our rent? Do we notify him ahead of time? For the second, we did, we told him summer vacation is coming up and we have the kids, and he told us that was fine. Perhaps, this was his plan from the beginning.  What do I do, and is there anything I can do?"	No
I can give details if you really need them, but the short of it is, I want to leave my husband but he's threatening me with taking away financial help (for me. He says he will provide for the kids). We have two small kids under 6. We live in a high cost state, I have been a stay at home mom all this time. I am lucky to work from home part time and currently bring in $600-1000/mo depending on how busy my client is (job is in administrative medical field). While that may seem like a lot, I use this money for all my own personal stuff (I'm talking clothes, shoes, sanitary items, even occasional medical care as I am uninsured), and all activities with the kids, some clothes for the kids, I paid for everything for their recent birthday party, etc, you get the idea. Husband now pays all bills (I previously made more, he made me pay a lot of bills, long story). He has been ragging on me about GROCERIES. What happened is I had to stop paying for bills and food because I don't make that much money anymore. I do ALL cooking, cleaning, chores, doctor's appointments, grocery shopping, etc.   Sorry getting too long just trying to give you an idea. I am leaving, and he's threatening me with with holding financial support. He cancelled my credit card today (literally the ONLY access I have to ANY financial info. He has everything on lockdown. Getting a clue why I'm out?!) He now is threatening to turn off my phone, take me off car insurance, etc.   I know this cannot be legal. I do not have money for a lawyer. I was denied legal assistance through a program in our state. I feel paralyzed. I applied for housing but there is a long list. I have the divorce paperwork ready to go, asking for interim spousal support, but that takes time too. I have a job lined up, but I have to take a certification exam and that isn't until July 31. I do have family I could stay with an hour away, but with no car and no money how do I make money (can still work from home, but would like to start a really good job with good pay)? I am willing to start applying for assistance but I'm at a loss. The first thing to do is divorce but with kids it's this huge web! If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be helpful.	No
"Hi Everyone,  I'm in the middle of one of the most messed up situations I have ever heard. As a  start I am BP1 and dependent on my wife . About 10 months into our marriage my wife started constantly skipping work to meet up with a friend's brother and fool around in our car. She got bold enough to rent a hotel room to have sex with him and I caught her. This is the time she exposed herself as a narcissist as she really couldn't show any remorse.  The day I found out her parents just showed up and her mom was very angry. They went on a short walk and Upon returning her mother completely changed and said that my wife has been living in fear of me and that we should be separated. My wife talked privately with me and cried and pleaded to stay and I said whatever you told your mom obviously was taken very seriously. Her mom went into Super protection mode and did not hold my wife accountable whatsoever, while my wife blocked me out of everything.  I start living at the house alone with my dog and two cats and start losing weight and making positive changes. I talk daily with my wife with a lot of communication that was always attempting to be positive. Fast forward a few weeks her brother has a wedding near our one year anniversary. After the wedding she went to her friend's house to meet up with her Affair partner and ""see how each other feels."" I snapped the picture of her car and his car and texted her that I was done and to feel free to stop by the house and talk. I was then completely mind f***** for about 5 hours until I finally realized she didn't want to come back she just wanted that as an option. I asked her to leave and she claimed to go home to her mom's but lied and admitted later she went to the""domestic abuse shelter."" She continued by saying that she was going to commit suicide and the counselors at the shelter wanted her to go to the hospital. My best friend died November last year from suicide, looking back I see now she was playing on that to keep me roped in.  A week later I stop by Petco after a therapy appointment and see the affair Partners vehicle. So I stop and wait about 5 minutes because I wanted to ask him if he was still seeing my wife / aware of suicide threats. She had been playing this oh my phone randomly shuts off game like I'm retarded for days before this so I had very little contact and was desperate for a smidgen of Truth. I was shocked when out of the corner of my eye I see my wife driving in our car with him in the passenger seat. She saw me and turned around in the parking lot so I jumped in my car and caught up. I videotaped so that way she was unable to narc her way out of it. I foolishly thought she would pull over and say okay The Jig Is Up.  Of course her Affair partner called the cops  and they pulled over into a parking lot and so did . They asked if I was following that car and I said hell yeah that's my wife and her Affair partner and she is supposed to be in a domestic abuse shelter and suicidal. Her response to them was oh I am terrified of him he carries a gun. The police asked I said no and it moved on very quickly. They said it sounds like it's time to move on and I said no crap dude. They were super cool mostly because I was obviously taking a video and not trying to physically do anything at all and it was apparent. She felt she was completely untouchable, but had finally been caught red-handed publicly. Several days later I get served with an order to appear in court for one of those blasphemous ex parte orders of protection which is early next week.   She is claiming I was stalking her because I ""knew of her whereabouts"" and that I was carrying a gun around the house and that she was in fear of her life. She has explained over and over to her mom dad myself and anyone that I have and never will harm her in any way. But for it to fit the statue it has to be fear of her life. The third thing she referenced was from a year-and-a-half ago and she claimed when she bailed me out after a bar fight I was in a rage and try to Veer her car off the road. This was about a three-minute drive on the way to my pdoc / therapist. It even reads like complete b*******. I believe completely that I am about to walk in there and get crucified. Her narc is so strong in so many ways. She is the queen of isolating me and telling one side of stories. It's clear to me that she wants the house to herself without me around so she can move her boyfriend in and also get revenge for being caught red-handed because that's basically criticism and that's not something she deals with. Sorry for the wall of text there are more details but I try to keep it short. I will probably come back through Andrea edit. Any help advice anything would help at this point."	No
My neighbor last night drunkenly harassed me, and started banging on my front door then my back door and after several warning to go away or I would call the police, I did. They came, they did nothing but laugh at the situation, then they left. After they left my neighbor tried to have another conversation and proceeded to insult me and I ended the conversation by going back into my apartment. They she started to message me on social media ( I don't know her or have ever exchanged information) harassing me again. I have blocked her. I contacted the landlord about the event. But I want to know if I have any grounds to break my lease and move because of what happened and me not feeling comfortable here anymore.	No
My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	No
"Hi so I used to live in an apartment complex and I left in may. When I left I was told things were all good however I did not receive paperwork that states that (a mistake in retrospect). As I was told I would receive my deposit in the mail. Fast forward a month to June and I still haven't received my deposit issues with the mail at my new place I guess. I go physically to ask what's up and they say theyll email me for instructions etc. So the next day I get an email that I owe damages and the itemized list they sent in the body of the email:  Date	Description	 Amount 06/05/2017	Beginning Deposit Held	 $0.00 06/05/2017	DAMAGES	 $543.62   So multiple issues here I didn't damage the apartment they claim they had to replace the carpet but the carpet was fine aside from a single stain which they said wasn't an issue so I request an itemized list they said they'd work on it and then fast forward to today I get the same email again with the same ""itemized"" list but this time threatening legal action.  So I guess their are two issues here 1st: I never got my deposit back so the fact they're obliging me to pay over and above my deposit is ridiculous. 2nd: does what they sent in the email count as a proper itemized list or am I right to stand my ground until I receive one?"	No
I'm trying to enroll my child in kindergarten. I attended pre-reg in April and provided my lease and copy of utilities. All utilities are in my name. On lease my name is listed under occupants, but my step mother is the primary lease holder. (She signed for me 2 years ago when I first got back to the US because of the employment gap.)    Received letter stating that I am required to appear with the primary lease holder in person on a specific date/hours next week for her to sign an affidavit saying I live there. Apparently this is a new county wide requirement put in place specifically to [irrelevant opinion.] She cannot be here for it. She can't leave work and she lives out of state. They said she can't have it signed and notarized not in person. (She has never lived in the apartment and signed online. Basically my guarantor or whatever.)  I called the school board and they said a wordier version of too bad and that she has to come. Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated. I'm assuming I have to miss work and show up alone, but do I have any leg to stand on to get her enrolled?  Don't they have to enroll even homeless kids?	No
"I have been divorced for many years.  During the divorce I was ordered to pay my ex $300 a month and he was ordered to refinance and take my name off of the house and loan.  After an extended time of him not doing this I contacted my lawyer and asked why do I keep having to pay and he hasn't done anything he was ordered to do... after me nudging the attorney he finally let the judge know and the nudge put a ""Stay"" on my part of the order where I used to pay the $300 a month.  Years later and he (my ex) still hasn't done anything.  Does this mean years from now if he finally takes care of this I'm going to have to start paying him again while living on Social Security retirement or is there a time limit for someone to complete what a judge has ordered.   Needless to say I did not want to contact my attorney from years past he was worthless and I learned later he doesn't do divorces but only doors court cases for marijuana rights. "	No
The mom and I broke up before she was even born. Since then, the mom has battled substance abuse problems so that is why she resides with her uncle. My name is not on her birth certificate. I just really want to gradually become a part of her life. Recently, I reached out to the uncle and he was not supportive of it. However, I don't want to give up and I feel that I have so much to offer her. Any advice?	No
"Sorry this is going to be a long post. I'm not sure if this is actionable at all but I thought I'd post here and see what people think. I'm a 30 year old male that lives in British Columbia, Canada.  I have been very sick for the past seven years and have officially been diagnosed with an insulinoma. It is a rare pancreatic tumor on the pancreas. This is my story.  In 2010 I started becoming quite ill and went to my family doctor multiple times for a year.  He misdiagnosed me with celiac disease and then after that was ruled out by a specialist, my GP gave up on me.  I decided to take matters into my own hands and in less than an hour of researching online I discovered that I most likely was having multiple hypoglycemic attacks a day.  I went back to him and got several requisitions for blood work checking my glucose levels, and sure enough I was right.  My blood sugars were ranging from 2.7-4.1 mmol/L after meals and throughout the day, which is dangerously low. The most common form of hypoglycemia is reactive hypoglycemia.  The treatment for this is eating healthy and exercising, which I was already doing.  At the time I was a personal trainer studying kinesiology and extremely fit with about 8% body fat.  Because of this my GP ruled out reactive hypoglycemia and his diagnosis was insulinoma, an insulin secreting tumor on my pancreas which made perfect sense to me.  I was then referred to an endocrinologist for further help.  The endo did standard tests to check my liver and kidney function and to make sure I didn't have cancer, and then diagnosed me with reactive hypoglycemia without doing a single blood glucose test.  I had gone to a dietitian at my local hospital who said my diet was perfect.  I even wrote out my diet for the endo but all he said was to eat better. He said there was no way it could be insulinoma but never really gave a reason why. I then took his advice and ate even healthier by almost eliminating all carbs from my diet except for some veggies, and I got immensely worse and my blood glucose was even lower than before.    I tried to go back to the endo but he refused to see me.  I then went to endo #2 for a second opinion.  Endo #2 saw me for 5 minutes and said it was reactive hypoglycemia, but on the off chance it was an insulinoma he told me to do a 12 hour fasting blood glucose test. The test turned out negative. He told me this would rule out insulinoma, but now that i know more about the condition a 12 hour fast has never been given to diagnose insulinoma. Even when it was first discovered in the early 1900's.  There was always a 48hr supervised fast test in a hospital with strict protocols, which turned into a 72hr fast test, and today basically any blood tests with blood glucose under 3.0 and high insulin, c-peptide or pro insulin is enough to diagnose insulinoma.   Shortly after that I tried every healthy diet i could find, and the only thing I found was that the healthier i ate the worse i got. So I preformed an experiment where I only ate junk food.  The diet was less than 30g of protein a day and over 600 grams of fast acting carbs like pizza, mcdonalds, apple pie, soft drinks, candy, pasta and garlic bread.  For the first time in almost 3 years my blood glucose was normal and i felt relief of all my symptoms for two weeks.  However this was not a reasonable diet, I gained over 10 lbs in a short amount of time and still become hypoglycemic when i exercised.  I demanded endo #1 see me again with this new information and he agreed.  I saw him and told him the healthier i ate the worse i got, but the worse i ate the better my blood sugars were, which is consistent with insulinoma.  He admitted that it made absolutely no sense.  I asked him what do we do now, and he said ""i don't know"".  I asked if he could refer me to someone who could help and he said, no. If i wanted another referral for another opinion i would have to go to my GP and ask him.   Upset and confused by this endo, I returned to my GP and asked for another referral to someone new.  He did so, but endo #3 refused to see me saying that he agreed with endo #1 and there was nothing out of the ordinary about my case. I then luckily got referred to a wonderful internist who saw me right away and told me there was no way this is reactive hypoglycemia. He forced endo #3 to see me.  I then saw endo #3 and he explained to me what reactive hypoglycemia was and how i have it.  He said it couldn't be insulinoma because when my blood sugars were 2.7, my insulin levels weren't high enough.  He was wrong on multiple accounts here.  My insulin level was in fact high enough, and even if it weren't he should have tested my c-peptide during a hypoglycemic event to rule out insulinoma.  C-peptide actually gives a more accurate indicator of how much insulin is being released in the body and is crucial in diagnosing insulinomas. So i asked to go to the diabetes clinic to see if they can help me with my diet, since he was so sure it was reactive hypoglycemia.  I went to the clinic and they immediately said this is not reactive hypoglycemia.  They sent a letter to endo #3 telling him that he has to help me figure out what's going on.  So i go back to my internist who spoke with endo #3 and apparently he reluctantly said there may be something else going on here.  So then I was referred to endo #4 in a different city.  Endo #4 saw me and immediately said that there is no way this is reactive hypoglycemia.  She suspected and confirmed insulinoma after having me induce a hypoglycemic attack and having glucose, insulin, and c-peptide levels taken. I saw her in 2015, and the test only took one day.   She then sent me to endo #5 in my own city to do the appropriate image testing to locate the tumor.  Endo #5 decided to do a 72hr fast to confirm that i in fact have insulinoma.  I spoke to endo #4 who said this was unnecessary, but if she wanted to have it done then i had to do it. It took 8 months for her to do the test and get the results and she sent me a letter saying i passed the test and nothing was wrong with me.  So either i'm the first person in recorded history with an insulinoma to pass this test, or she did it incorrectly.     So i go back to endo #4 and she tells me, if she doesn't think i have an insulinoma then she thinks im drugging myself.  She told me that's the only way I could be lowering my blood glucose so low.  So I induced a hypo with high insulin and high c-peptide with a negative drug screen.  After that endo #4 and endo #3 agreed i had an insulinoma.  The interesting thing is that for this test, my insulin was actually lower than the test endo #3 used as evidence to say my insulin wasn't high enough.  This makes no sense to me how he says this confirms insulinoma when previously he said that my insulin levels weren't high enough.   So then after all that I have been undergoing imaging studies and other fun tests for the past several months and they have 100% found the tumor in the tail of my pancreas.  I'm currently waiting for a surgery date to have it removed.    I feel very outraged and angry that it has taken 7 years to figure this out, when my GP and I have told them this is what it was 6 years ago.  Over the past 7 years i've barely been able to work.  I had to quit school and stopped being a personal trainer.  In fact when I saw my internist 2 years ago, he told me my blood sugar levels were way too low to function as a normal human being let alone work, and put me on disability for the past 2 years while we figured this out.  I also ended up having blood sugar readings of less than 2.2 mmol/L, which is considered life threatening.  I don't know if this is worth pursuing legally but I've got time to kill until my surgery so i might as well look into it, thanks!"	No
As mentioned above this happened today morning, and ever since i have been super stressed.   A lady by the name of Mrs Sauvie called from CRA REVENUE COLLECTIONS DEPT, 18002679541 ext 2305  She asked me if i was so and so...confirmed it and then she went to explain to me she was calling me on behalf of CRA.  and then confirmed that my landlord is so and so..i confirmed yes.  and then she went on to say that i will be receiving a legal package in registered mail on monday/tuesday.   I was like...for what...  and she replied that this is inregards to my landlord and my rental payments.   and she said after i received the package i will have to direct all my rent payments to CRA...  I live in a condo, and i am really confused...i recently came out of rehab from an accident ( being run over by a car) and have slowly started working...  I checked up on them and it seems legit.   If i send CRA the cheques i am afraid Either my landlord of the condo board will kick me out.   I live by myself and my service dog and i am really confused...like wtf...  I called my landlord and he says its a scam...and i called the 1800 number on cra website and they transferred me to rev collections dept.   I mentioned my worries to the lady and she was like..well ya you can go to tenant and landlord board..  I mean why the hell am i in the middle of all this crap...  Please advise..should i seek legal aid..  i live in mississauga, ON so i got no idea how the rules work	No
Since the failing health and death of my great grandma, my family has been very divided and communication has been spilt between my  grandma and uncle on one side and my mom on the other. My uncle is the executor of the will and my mom does not know if he has executed the will. She is also afraid that the will may be altered to the benefit of my uncle and grandma.  Is there anyway to check to see if he has already started to execute the will through probate court? My mom is unsure if it is apathy or devious motives that he has not executed the will or communicated with her. How can she approach the situation legally to make sure the will is executed so that this ugly situation can be resolved and moved on from?	No
"Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.  Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.  Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an ""online debit card"" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this ""online debit card"" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.  Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like ""what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc"" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.  Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.  It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.  It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.    I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...  I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn."	No
Spouse and i are still technically married, nothing has been filed yet. (I plan to, can't afford it right now even with the reduced fees i was offered)  Spouse abandoned us and now lives in a different state halfway across the country and has pretty much left me with sole custody. Are there any legal hiccups that would prevent me from moving my child and i to a different state to be closer to my family?	No
My girlfriend and I got pregnant. She doesn't want to raise the child. We're both in our 30s. I have a good job, stable income, and own a home. I'm prepared to raise the child. What do I need to make sure she signs or agrees to so this all goes down legally?  She is currently 6 months pregnant. Right now she says she wants nothing to do with it's feeding or rearing, which is painful. But she had a troubled childhood so I'm trying to chalk it up to that. Forcing someone to mother a child they don't want to mother could be more damaging to a kid than esuring legal steps are taken for me to have stable full custody from day one. She doesn't seem adversarial right now, except in firmly stating she will refuse visitation or any physical caretaking. Honestly if she is this troubled I don't want her to have those roles.   What happens next?    This is in East Texas.	No
Oh my poor mom.   First of all, she has a house in Fl where she says she's living at. That's where her FL ID says she is and that's where her mail gets sent to. She's struggling with mortgage payments and has the possibility of getting the house foreclosed on. That's a whole other issue but relevant to this story. She's been making money by renting out 2 of the 3 rooms for short or long term periods. This has been going on for 3 years but recently the HOA got involved and said she couldn't do this the way she wanted to anymore. Now the HOA only wants a minimum of a 1 year commitment from the tenants and they have to be approved by them with an application. She's struggling to find people to move in but she found someone last week. When she was trying to fly back from Idaho, her new husband (diagnosed with Alzheimer's) became distressed and the plans fell through(check out my history for that story). She paid for my plane ticket and I flew back to help out with the room rental instead.   Now I'm here and going through all of her mail. She wanted me to open everything and alert her of everything going on. There were several documents from the court. Here's what I gathered:  My father is an angry person who separated himself from all of us and then accused my mom of taking his children away (he said this in a threatening email to her, we're in our 30s, wtf). She was receiving alimony but recently he was able to convince the court to reduce alimony by 75% retroactively for 3 years.  The docs show that he gets a certain amount of money from SS and has a job. Apparently he no longer works and only receives SS. Makes sense to reduce the alimony. But making it retroactive? I don't understand that.  Yet, my mom, being ignorant and not realizing what you should and shouldn't do, didn't know that she would stop receiving alimony when she got re-married and didn't tell the FL court. She received 2 more checks, she thought it was weird, called SS, they said since the checks were already made then she can cash them. (I don't think she called SS to see if it was okay if she thought getting married wouldn't cancel alimony..). She was ordered by the court to repay money from those checks but also ordered to pay another monthly sum to pay back the last 3 years of supposedly receiving too much money from the alimony.   She is now aware that she shouldn't have cashed those checks and is paying it back now but wasn't aware of the retroactive payments. She's, umm, not very good at speaking and understanding English so it sounds like a miscommunication to me. She missed 4 months of payments. My dad alerted the court and set up a court date for March. My mom was never personally served, instead, the Sheriff's Office contacted her by phone and alerted her of the date. She refused to answer any questions and said she couldn't return for a couple of months. She thought this was about the house and not about those repayments.   So of course, she failed to show up. A hearing was then scheduled for May and then a Motion for Civil Contempt/Enforcement set for July. My dad was present at the hearing in July, but not my mom and she was not represented by Legal Counsel.  The conclusion shows that she has the ability to comply with previous judgements and orders of the court and has willfully refused to do so.  My mom had absolutely no idea that she was supposed to pay these retroactive monthly payments even though a year and a half ago is when the alimony was reduced by 75%. It's odd to me that she has to make those payments back and that the payments were required to start on April of this year.   She's dealing with a lot, can't travel/leave her husbands side, can't rent out her rooms and has the possibility of being foreclosed on. Any recommendations?	No
As a 17 year old in Utah I'd like to move in with a friend. I have ptsd and I feel like the longer I stay in the house where everything happened the longer it'll take to recover. There's also been more and more conflict with my mother and my ptsd symptoms and suicidal thoughts are increasing. I'd like to know if the police would come get me even though I'm less than 6 months away from turning 18, if the people I'm staying with could get in trouble, and if I can stay in school and work without a parent/ if I'm listed as a runaway.	No
"Back in Oct. 2010 I got a DUI in FL. My license was suspended until the completion of 6mos Interlock and a DUI class. I've spent the past few years using public transportation and have also moved out of FL. Where I've most recently moved in NorCal is very, very rural (I live on 40 acres, and all the plots are 40 acres) and I'm also in the process of getting a small Tech Support business started. So, I knew I'd need to get my license squared away.  FL tells me I need to get the Interlock device on a vehicle (which I have), then go to CA DMV with the paperwork, they will verify and issue a limited license (for work, school, errands, etc.), and once they issue my temporary license to mail a copy of it, along with some paperwork, to the FL DMV and they'll start the 6mos for my Interlock ONLY THEN.  I go to the CA DMV and they told me as long as FL has a hold on my license there's nothing they can do for me, Interlock or no. The DMV worker gives me the Mandatory Actions number, but they tell me the same thing.  It seems I'm stuck in a catch-22- the lasy with Mandatory Actions actually told me ""you may have to move to FL for 6 mos."" :|  Does anyone have any insights? Feel free to ask me any questions to help clarify, etc"	No
"Situation: I am moving in (this week) to a new apartment, my roommate is moving in tonight, and she has been to the place today. We were initally allowed to move in 8/1, but that was pushed back a day because it was not ready yet. This part we have already discussed with our broker, and we are getting a day prorated back.    When she arrived today, the apartment had not yet been cleaned (we are told cleaners are coming today, so hopefully that is being taken care of while we are at work).   Prior to moving in, our broker and the previous tenant both told us that we would be getting a new stove for when we moved in. Apparently the super checked it out, and claims ""it works"" so he did not replace it, but would replace it if it did not work. My roommate checked it out, and the stove top works, but the oven does not work at all. I had her take a video of it not working, but I want to know what else I can do to ensure this is taken care of?  Our apartment is rent stabilized, so I have a feeling he did not replace it prior to us moving in so that it not working is our responsibility, and add the cost of the new appliance onto our rent.  I know I am dealing with a shady character here, so I want to go about this as professionally as I can. I am having my roommate document the apartment with all the pictures she can. I also had her keep all receipts for cleaning supplies she picked up on her way to the apartment. What else can I do to make sure we have a functional appliance without us being responsible for the cost?"	No
This person is someone I know and Im curious on what likely is going to happen to him if he is found guilty? Is he going to serve time then get deported or just get deported?

I know someone who works at Walmart. They were fired for violating the patriot act according to Walmart. My Friend who I will name Bob(23)  is the Walmart worker. Bob's friend Stu is 16. Stu's dad wanted to send him some money but couldn't because he isn't 18. Instead Stu's dad sends the money to Bob, Bob then signs for the wired money while on break (isn't the issue). Stu also signs the wire transfer. Walmart then fires Bob for violating the Patriot Act and alleges money laundering. Stu was using the money to buy something at the store. Did Bob violate the patriot act?	No

Hi Legal advice - I am just 20 days away from being done with a very evil landlord who I feel did not honor my right to quiet enjoyment and habitability and wondering if I would have any case against them given the following: - We lived over a commercial neighbor (same landlord) with inappropriate club speakers in a small building - nearly every night for 365 days was blasting pure bass and shaking my home. - Yes, I did take the recommended steps to the best of my ability: I called LL repeatedly who completely shrugged me off. I filed 311 complaints most nights that brought my community officers out a couple times and made me an inside joke at the precinct. However, the NYPD did not ever really do anything nor did they get a meter reading as I hoped.  - My landlord was otherwise negligent. Just as icing on the cake, my ceiling is collapsing, a medicine cabinet fell on my head, we had no smoke alarms or heat (the city did fine them for this), etc.  My primary question here is do I have any outlets for seeking compensation against my LL once the lease ends. I would feel like I had simply given up and let the evil LLs of the city win if I just shrugged my shoulders and went to the next apartment. Would love any advice, thank you.	No
"Sadly, my fiance and I of 10 years are getting separated. We have a wonderful 6 year old child and have owned a home together for 2 years. Due to her infidelity, staying together is no longer an option in our lives. We purchased a home in 2015 for approx. $275,000. The home is in a good neighborhood and the value has raised since the purchase. I believe it is now worth near $400,000 due to the crazy housing market of our city. Her wonderful father helped us out greatly in acquiring our home. He gave us $10,000 for a down payment and co-singed on the mortgage as well. He hasn't helped in any other way financially. We both appreciate everything he has done for us.  We both pretty much live paycheck to paycheck. Her and I have always split bills 50/50. I have 2 utilities in my name, she has 2 in hers. She generally handles the finances so the mortgage payment to the bank comes from her checking account. I pay her in cash every month for my share of the mortgage and we split all other things right down the middle. I would like to hope we both remain civil in this process, but there is no telling what will happen in the future.   What are my options? I love living here, and I would hate to lose my house that I have worked so hard for. I kind of feel she is the one who should move out do to her infidelity, but that means little in court. I have very little money in the bank, and very few assets. What will happen if we decide to sell it? What will happen if we can not agree on who gets to remain living here? What if we decide to remain ""business partners"" and keep the house and rent it out? I am lost and confused and don't know my rights. Any advice would be much appreciated."	No
We recently transferred from our old studio apartment to a new two-bed two-bath unit in the same complex. After getting all of our belongings moved over the landlord told us we would have to make sure the old unit was in immaculate condition because the new tenants were moving in the following Friday, or we would face fines equal to what the cleaning company charged.  After being up until almost 4 am cleaning they still want to charge us almost $800 for essentially renovating the entire apartment. They sent an email containing the individual fees.   1.       Carpet replacement - $400 2.       Repaint the entire apartment - $100 3.       Trash out - $50 4.       New blinds $60 (2 in living room) 5.       Cleaning $60 6.       Appliance cleaning $100 (including washer/dryer) 7.       Vacant electric - $25  This is all coming AFTER inspecting the apartment and giving the go ahead for it's to transfer. I am of the opinion that the cleaning company is gouging them and they are trying to pass the costs on to us. Rent on the old apartment was less than what they are currently charging. My girlfriend has an anxiety disorder and has been having panic attacks over this.  What are our legal options? We would rather just avoid the fees but if they insist on trying to force us I'd be quite happy to pursue damages for emotional distress. Do we have a legal leg to stand on?	No
In Kansas, you receive a temporary paper driver's license when you go apply for one. It's supposed to take 10-14 days for them to mail the real thing, but it's taken longer than that. Are private persons and businesses required to accept the paper license as if it were the real thing?	No
I am planning on signing a lease agreement in NYC with two other roommates but the landlord will only allow two of us to sign/have our names on the lease agreement. Is there some sort of legal contract that can be made to share the liability that comes with signing a rental agreement with the 3rd roommate or will it not be valid unless the contract is also signed by the landlord?	No
"I run a small social network that lets users register usernames as their handle. A company which I'll call ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" (not its real name but similar) sent me an email accusing one of my users of committing a trademark violation because she registered the name ""illusionalsunrise"" on my site. But when I search for ""illusionalsunrise"" (again, not the real name) on http://tmsearch.uspto.gov, I see that the word mark is for ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" and not ""Illusionalsunrise"" by itself.  The email sent to me also contains this paragraph:  ""From the information that we have received regarding your use, our use of this Trademark has priority over yours based upon earlier and continuous use, as well as the above federal registration. Therefore, your use is a violation of our company’s rights.

"Expanded:  My father and step-mother need to find a new apartment. My dad is in the middle of fighting for state disability, and currently has no income, my step-mother's income is enough to pay the bills but they can't afford their current place anymore.  All the apartments they can afford have a rule where all occupants must have an income equal to/greater than 2-2.5x the monthly rent, collectively.  What is the legality of my signing the lease with them, listing my income, and claiming to be a tenant/occupant without actually living there?  Off the top of my head, I don't think it would be illegal, it would just appear as if I am renting multiple properties.  But I am asking you fine folks just to be sure.  Also, what are the potential ramifications if the rent does not get paid? I understand that they would be able to come after me for the money and I would be on the hook for any unpaid rent. But would it or could it affect my credit negatively?  Could an ""eviction"" on that lease impact my current renting status in my own apartment?  Basically I'm just trying to get an idea of what I would be getting myself into. I have not agreed to do this, it is something I am considering to help out my parents.  Thank you for reading, and thanks for any advice or answers."	No
Im Located in Florida, USA. Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old.   My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.   I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.    My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.   This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.   I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!     tl/dr: ex wife keeps winning custody battle even though she knowingly is filling false accusations	No
"I am a landlord in Illinois and this is the first time I've run into this problem and am unsure of how to proceed. Here is the background and current situation.   My parents were renting a house out and after my father's death I took over the account. The tenant has been living in my unit for the past year give or take a month. The lease is over end of the month IIRC. I'm not entirely sure on this part as even though they have a lease with me they never returned a signed copy to me even though I have asked for it multiple times (I have the original lease template but not the signed lease with dates and what not). I know they have the lease because I handed it to them personally. The lease states that they must pay the rent at the beginning of the month but he contacted me and said that he and my father had an agreement where he could pay the rent in two separate portions one in the middle of the month and one at the end. Now I was not too thrilled about this arrangement but my mother informed me that such an unorthodox payment scheme was indeed what they had verbally agreed to when my father was alive.   Now this has not been much of a problem for the last year or so as we always received two checks at the beginning of the month, both post dated one for the middle and one for the end. He has always been somewhat bad with his payments because if I deposit the checks even one day late/early they would bounce and I would have to drive over there to pick it up in cash. But this month I didn't receive any checks at all. When I contacted the tenant about this (end of week 1) he said they were in the mail. So I gave it a week to show up in the mail. No checks so I said forget that I'll drive over there and pick them up (it is now week 2 at this point). Then I was informed that he was out of town and no one would be home until week 3. I stupidly waited till week 3 before attempting to collect the checks again. He then stated that his loan officer told him not to spend any money until they were approved for a loan (the f? never heard that one before). I pressed him again drove out there, no one answered the door, no check. I don't want to keep driving out there if no one is going to answer because it's a bit of a drive. I ask him to have the checks ready for Monday of week 4 (last week of the month, it's currently Sunday). I even said he could post date it for the end of the month like he usually does (this time the check is supposed to be for the entire rent plus late fee). He basically said no and that if I showed up either no one would be home or he simply would not give me a check because his hands are ""tied"" until the weekend whatever the hell that's supposed to mean (also the weekend would put us at literally the 29/30th). He also refused to post date it stating that last time he post dated it the check was deposited a day early and he was hit with an overdraft fee (again not really my problem because I'm not the one who can't pay rent). So now it' basically the end of the month, dude's been living there for free all month and is now refusing payment. I'm going to be out in the area tomorrow (Monday) so I'm thinking of serving an eviction notice but am unsure of the legalities behind it. Also because I don't actually have a copy of the signed lease I'm not entirely sure what my options are. I would like to get him out of the house and get paid for the past month.  TL;DR Tenant is refusing to pay rent and has been living for free in rental unit. Can I evict him without a signed copy of the lease and is there a way to still get paid for the month?"	No
Hi!  Our lease renewal is coming up in less than 3 weeks. We want to stay in the apartment as it's well located and nice. We contacted the landlord recently about renewing the lease and she's responded that the rent would increase by $180 (9% increase). The apartment is in California.  My understanding is that a landlord as to provide a 30 days notice before a rent increase of less than 10%, 60 days notice otherwise. Does that also apply in the case of a lease renewal coming up? Can I do anything to pay the new price later than 3 weeks from now?  Ideally I would like to reduce the increase, can we use this in our favor?  Thanks!	No
Hello, I recently quit my job at Papa Johns due to constant understaffing and extreme stress. I know they are obligated to pay me my hours worked, but I still have not received my check in the mail. Are companies required to send it in the mail, or is there a chance I will need to go pick it up? I haven't returned the uniform yet, but they can't withhold my check for that, can they? Any advice is appreciated.	No
So I (20) live with my parents and our driveway does not have enough room for 3 cars so I have been parking on the side road by our house for about a year.   Recently and progressively more intensely my neighbor has been obnoxiously complaining about my car being there. She has been making ridiculous claims such as I always park on her grass (completely untrue, I have always been careful about this) and that I leave her nowhere to park. I am only one car, occasionally I have a friend or two over but there is always plenty of space and we even park further down the road away from the front of her house/out of her way. Not to mention the fact  that she has an empty driveway she never uses. Now she has started putting her trash barrels as well as a pile of sticks/leaves in the road blocking the spot.   I don't need a lawyer as this is not a big issue but could anyone offer some advice for a response the next time she confronts me ? I've tried kindly explaining that I try to stay out of her way but it doesn't seem to work. Any thing is appreciated	No
"However yesterday they called me and asked me for my account and transit number because ""They are not in the check that you gave us""   Now I assure you I gave a legit check in fact it was from the same stack that I gave to them the last new car I bought.  I think they lost my void check. What do I do in my situation? Is it safe to have a lost check out there? Does the dealership have any standing to make me replace void check?   What if I catch them in a lie and they verbally admit they lost my check and lied about the no account number stuff. (Canada is 1 party consent I double checked)   Should I just send in another check?"	No
So in my lease for an apartment, there was a clause that stated if I didn't check out after my lease ends, they would apply a 300$ holdover fee per day. However, I vacated the apartment a week before the lease end date, and was unaware of any check out procedures. 1 day after the lease ended, I received a call telling me that I had a check-out procedure I needed to follow. I was not technically living in the home, and everything was vacated and ready to lease to the next tenant. Is there any way I can fight this fee?	No
"Like the title states I'm currently employed in Chapel Hill North Carolina and am interviewing for a new job this coming Wednesday. I've only been back from vacation for 13 days and if on Wednesday I am offered a job and give my two weeks notice the same day I will not be safe from the 6 weeks restriction. The policy verbatim from the employee handbook states   ""I understand that payment for PTO is subject to continued employment. If I am seperated for any reason within six weeks of the use of PTO I will not be entitled to receive pay for time not worked. If the PTO has already been paid, the company may deduct this from my paycheck. Payment for PTO is subject to home office verification of eligibility.""  This may be a stupid question but this is my first full time job where vacation was even offered and I'm not sure if this is common practice. Any help is appreciated."	No
Posting from the scene of the accident. I was driving down the road at ~40mph in a 40mph speed zone. A bus was stopped so I believed that it was letting off passengers. I slowed a little bit and was not in the lane of the bus. A person pulled out of the plaza unable to see my vehicle and hit in to my front fender. There is little damage to his vehicle. We exchanged information and got photos of the damage on both vehicles and license plates and insurance information. Police have not arrived yet and I have already made a claim. What next?  Damages: My vehicle: 99 Accord Coupe LX Broken headlight Tire fell off Bumper fell off  His vehicle: 02 Nissan Frontier Cracked front bumper 	No
I am simply seeking information on my rights and the regulations in this scenario.  (Indiana, U.S.)  About 4 days ago myself and a few friends signed a one-year lease on a house in our area. Almost immediately after we began our lease the property owner has put the property up for sale, and we were asked by the property management company to make time today for a showing. My concern is simply to know what my rights are and what the situation is should the property be sold.  We do have a 1 year lease August 1st is the official starting date. There is no early termination clause.   I suppose my more specific questions would be  1. Is there any reason, provided we pay rent on time and obey all terms on the lease, that we can be evicted prior to the end of the lease?  2. Should the new owner, likely an investor, want to make repairs, upgrades, or modifications to the property what authority do they have to do so. (More specifically if it will interrupt our daily lives can we protest these changes?  3. Can the new owner modify the terms of our lease in any way?	No
"I'm in Indianapolis. I have a rental house and the sewer line has a partial collapse. It will have to be replaced but the lowest estimate is $6,500 and I cannot afford that.   There is a clause in my lease stating: ""Clause 24. Partial or Total Destruction of the Premises by Acts of God / Casualty or Untenantable Conditions; If the premises are partially or completely destroyed or rendered untenantable by a fire, earthquake, tornado, explosion, terrorist act or any other occurrence or Act of God that is not caused by Tenant’s negligence or willful act (or the negligence or willful act of Tenant’s family, agent, or guest), the Landlord, in its sole discretion, may elect to: (1) repair or rebuild the premises during the period of untenantability, refunding the rent proportionally that had been paid in advance for the period starting from the date of the damage; or (2) not repair or rebuild the premises, terminate the Lease effective as of the date of the occurrence and refund the rent proportionally that had been paid in advance for the period starting from the date of the damage.""  What are my legal responsibilities to repair the sewer? If I do not repair am I protected by this clause and able to end the lease? I appreciate the help."	No
My mother-in-law is about to visit my wife and I for 3 days (Thursday night, leaving Sunday evening.)  We have strong reasons to believe that MiL's spouse will attempt to have her served for divorce, while she's staying with us.  (His motivations would likely be: (1) doesn't have to deal with her in the immediate aftermath, since she'll be 200 miles away (2) snubbing my wife and I for perceived past transgressions, and (3) MiL might be inclined to ask to stay with us, rather than return to a tension-filled situation at her domicile  (a request that my wife and I would unanimously deny.)  While we don't want to interfere with the court, we also don't want to be used as pawns in MiL's current-husband's game.  Asking her not to come is not an option that I am allowed to consider.  So I want to know where the legal limits are on how I can delay service until after we have returned her home.  * Are we allowed to lie to a process server, and claim that she is not present at our house, when she is? * If we decide to just put her up in a hotel room &amp; visit her there-- taking other precautions to not be followed-- can the court's process server just hand the documents over to another adult at my residence, and consider her properly served?	No
My wife served me with divorce papers last weekend. I have 30 days to file a response with the court in the county that she lives in.   My quick question is: when they say 'file a response with the court', does that mean I have to go in person, or can I mail it in? It'd take me three hours each way to get to the courthouse, so I'd rather not go there in person if I can avoid it.   Court is Washington County, Oregon.	No
Hi! I posted before about this issue:   TLDR my roommates threw away my fully packed belongings while I was away and decided not to come back. How do I estimate damages?  Long version: On June 10th or so I moved into a brand new apartment with 3 other people I was loosely friends with. On June 15th I went on a trip to visit friends. I had barely unpacked. During this time I basically had a mental break down and decided not to return. I told the person in the apartment I was closest with that I wasn't coming back, and would need a month or two to figure out how to have my things shipped. My boxes were still packed, and there were a few large laundry bags. The things were in the basement which has a room for storage as well as my bedroom.   I offered to pay July's rent if they couldn't find a tenant, and she declined and said they were going to turn it into an airbnb with my furniture. Then, in turning my room to an airbnb, they decided to throw out over half of my things. Nobody asked me about this, nobody informed me I had to get my stuff out, they just threw things away. I found out when I asked the friend about my stuff.  Two questions:  1: I don't even know what they've thrown out. How can I begin to estimate damages? I know they threw out a huge laundry bag, and most of my boxes (books, records, toiletries, jewelry, a box of childhood pictures) and it also seems they kept a lot of items for themselves (as evidenced in a facebook video one posted of them all wearing my stuff??).  2: I'm still on the lease. Airbnb is illegal in NYC. Does this break the lease and can therefore get me off of it?  3: I offered that if they just shipped me the rest of my stuff, I would call everything else a loss.  They've had several weeks and still haven't. Should I rescind this offer and just sue them?   Thanks for any advice you can offer, other than 'don't move in with total idiots'. I got that one loud and clear.	No
My mother is terminal and has drafted up a will leaving me all of her money and future money she hopes to receive from a malpractice lawsuit.  However she has a husband who has been a piece of shit in a lot of ways.  She cannot divorce him because she needs him as a caretaker for the rest of her time, but she doens't plan on leaving him any money.   However, I've been informed that he is by law entitled to a third of her estate regardless of what her will says. I looked it up and it seems to be the case.  Is this true or is it more complicated than that?	No
Once I am incapacitated, can't they just jave me declared incompatent and change whatever they like? Do I need to keep my attorney on retainer til then to prevent it? Is there some kind of advocate I can hire?	No
"So my roommates and I have an apartment in upstate New York. The lease ended July 19th, but the apartment complex that we lived at automatically extended our lease for an extra month, to August 20th.  Their reason being that we did not let them know that we were moving out at least 60 days before the lease ended. We were given a paper with three options, and I checked the option that said ""I will not be renewing my lease. Please send me your notice to vacate form."" And i also signed this document (I am the one that is in control of the apartment) This was May 19, 2017.  We had told them that we would be moving home (this is a college apartment) and would be back July 15 to sign any forms and to move our stuff out. On July 1st, I called to check what the prorated rent cost would be, since it's not the full month, and was told that the lease was extended one month because we had not given them notice that we were moving out at the end of the lease. I argued saying that that was not true, I had spoken with someone, and turned the form in, but she basically said ""Too bad we can't do anything about it""  The only thing that the lease states is that ""advanced notice needs to be given to move out"".   And is it even legal that they can just extend the lease and not tell us at all?   Thank you"	No
So I've worked at a company for almost 4 years as a temporary employee, which means if I get laid off I don't get unemployment. Never have I worked less than 40 hours a week, I average 60 hours of week, all mandatory.    In Kentucky if you get laid off you can get a unemployment check for 6 months or until you find another job. But not as a temporary like me.  I know people will say if you don't like it quit and find another job. But I feel like this shouldn't be allowed.	No
The initial accident happened ahead of him. People were swerving out of the way. One of the people in the initial accident got out of her car and ran across the freeway. Fate would have it that she ran right in front of my friend's car. She died on the scene.  I have another friend who was a firefighter/first responder on the scene. He said that there was nothing my friend could have done. It was the other person's fault for getting out of the car. He doesn't know my friend, so there's no bias. The family is not pursuing legal action.   Fast forward to last week. He got 2 letters in the mail (or phone calls... I don't remember the exact details.) One was that the insurance company in formed him that there will be no liability on his part. The second one was the DMV saying that they were suspending his license for being involved in a fatal vehicle vs pedestrian accident.  Any advice for him?	No
I was driving on I95 at about 40-45mph in a 65mph zone. This was due to the weather and road conditions at the time. As I continued to drive in the express lane, I hit a long puddle which pulled the nose of my car towards the middle barrier. I immediately let my foot off the gas and corrected the steering towards the lane. My car corrected and when the rear of the car hit another puddle, it pulled the car the opposite direction. My vehicle then started to hit the plastic pole barriers which no matter how much I tried to correct, pulled the car facing the outside of the highway. My car came to a stop. My front passenger bumper was then clipped by a vehicle in the lane next to me, and spun my car facing the middle barrier. We both pulled off the road, there were no injuries. I was already on the phone with the police, after the officer investigated, he wrote me a citation for careless driving.  All that being said, the officer didn't witness the accident. And I was able to maintain control of the vehicle within my lane up to a complete stop. I was also driving in a safe manner due to road conditions.  I understand that law is black and white. However with extenuating circumstances, I don't feel like I was driving carelessly. That being said, how valid is the citation? With extenuating circumstances is it something I should fight?  Also, my vehicles lease expires on Thursday and I have an $8,000 damage waiver. If I turn the vehicle in, and the insurance company doesn't pay a claim. In addition, if I choose to fight it and the citation gets dismissed will my rates go up in a no-fault state?  TL;DR: Spun out in the rain. Maintained vehicle within lane as much as humanly possible. Got clipped by another vehicle after mine came to a complete stop and received citation for careless driving. Fight or pay it?	No
Would it be illegal to start a service that allows people to rent a boyfriend/girlfriend as long as the app and website have a liability waiver and the service does not use employees but independent contractors who set their own terms and thus the website is not a direct service provider but rather a sharing economy marketplace where providers and users can find each other for a nominal revenue share?	No
Long story short, my complex uses a third party billing service for their water/sewer/trash bill.  I use about $6-8 of water a month, garbage is $16, but the sewer is over $20 (plus a $3 service fee!).  I was gone for one month, literally had 0 gallons of water used, but my bill was still over $40.    The sewage charge is supposed to be only around $8 according to the city's sewage rates.  They're definitely profiting on top of my bill... is this even legal?    Seems incredible this is even legal.	No

"I have had property 31 years. previous owners had built over on our property by 12 inches. there is a gravel road between the building and my yard. that property also belongs to me. now 13 years new owners have also been encroached on my property by the same 12"" and also had a verbal okay to use the shared lane. I have offered to purchase the back 5 acres they declined. and now they are divorcing and want to sue me for the property and also the lane. Im not sure that can be accomplished. But i would like to know if anyone knows the law in illinois. Much thanks in advance. I already have a lawyer picked out if i need to lawyer UP!"	No
I was in an auto accident nearly 2 years ago where i was fount mostly at fault.  I recently received a summons notifying me i am being sued.  They are suing for an amount that is magnitudes over my coverage.  Its Saturday so I have to wait till monday to speak to my representative.  I am afraid my insurance company will only pay so much and I'll be left with the remainder which would cripple me for a very very longtime.  Is that possible?   Is this just a scare tactic to get the most out of the my insurance? Or is there a chance they really want to get all of this from me.  as you can imagine, am very distraught	No
"After buying a week+ of groceries on Friday our refrigerator and freezer stopped being cold Sunday afternoon (was probably not working for longer but that is when we noticed). I waited until Monday morning for our landlord's office to open and they can't get anyone even in to look at it until Wednesday morning. Per our lease, they need to fix problems ""promptly"". What is the definition of promptly? Because all $200-300 of food is going to rot. So to me this morning right now is what I need. They refuse to reimburse if I get someone else to fix it.

"Hi everyone. This is my first time ever posting, so please forgive me if my formatting is weird as I am also on mobile.    I live in a college town where lack of housing close to campus is an issue. For this reason, many students, such as myself and my roommates, are stuck in apartments that are far from perfect. Over the past year in this apartment, my roommates and I have had a constant battle with our landlord company.   Directly stated in our lease in reads:  MAINTENANCE BY LANDLORD. Landlord shall: a. Comply with the requirements of applicable building and housing codes materially account health and safety.  b. Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep dwelling unit in a fit and habitable condition.  c. Maintain in good and safe working order and condition all electrical, plumbing, sanitary, heating, ventilating, air conditioning, and other facilities and appliances, including elevators supplies or required to be supplied by Landlord. d. Landlord shall not be liable for any injury caused by any object or materials which belong to, or which have been placed by, Tenants in the common areas of the premises used by Tenants.   We have had NUMEROUS problems in our unit throughout the year, however, I will only describe the ones that I think are a direct violation of this clause.   The building in which we live is a large home that is subdivided into 4 apartments, with ours being a 4 bed 3 bath, on the main and basement floors with 2 bedrooms on each floor, 2 bathrooms on the main level, and one in the basement.   Our first problem arose on the very day we moved in. My bedroom, along with the other in the basement, is carpeted. When we moved in, the carpet was SOAKING WET and the entire basement smelled of mold. We were unable to move into the basement for about two weeks and slept on the couches upstairs, which the carpet took that ENTIRE TIME to dry. The Landlord provided fans to dry the carpet. The entire basement smelled of mold, which we complained about for months, and no one was sent to check it out no matter how many times we called. Additionally, every time it rained, as the basement is carpeted, it would flood so much that we were actually able to""splash"" in the water that would flood in. I ended up getting so sick that I got bronchitis and was very sick for two months, and I now have an inhaler. Again, we called and called with no avail until a future possible tenant for the following year made a comment during a showing and the carpet was removed the next day. As we suspected, there was mold under the carpet, however, the water would still flood in. Eventually, it was mostly fixed, but then, as strange as it sounds, water then began to flood in from the ceiling fan in the basement bathroom, so much that we had to put an entire trash can underneath to catch all the water. As we prepared to move out this week, the carpet cleaners found, as we suspected and reported to or management multiple  times, a great deal of black mold in our unit.    There is a long list of other small things that add up. However, I think the mold is the biggest thing that clearly violates our lease agreement, especially since our landlord was well-aware of our living conditions the entire time. Today while turning in my keys, I said to my landlord that he apartment is u safe and unfit for living, and she said ""I agree."" I know that there are people that signed the lease and are supposed to move in August 1. I am concerned for their health and safety. Do we have grounds to sue? I am more than happy to provide and more information.  We have photo/video evidence of a LOT of the issues. Thank you!!  TLDR; my apartment is filled with mold and unsafe living conditions as a direct violation of our lease. can we sue?"	No
About 6 months ago I found out that my ex wife &amp; her new boyfriend were abusing my son. I took my son to the hospital &amp; filed a police report. Son was covered in bruises when ex dropped him off. CPS got involved &amp; all visitation was taken away from ex. I previously had him 70% of the time. Ex agreed to go to parenting classes &amp; the DA refused to press charges against her or BF despite them both admiring to the abuse.  We have now moved in to the maintenance part of CPS &amp; CPS is requiring we split custody. Both my lawyer &amp; myself are not happy with CPS caliver approach to my ex, but have discovered we don't have much recourse.   Yesterday the CPS worker called me &amp; said that she has yet to do her monthly visit with my son for July &amp; said she would meet with him on Thursday. I told her she could come by my house. She told me she had to meet with him at my ex's house since she realized she has never seen it. Side note: the original CPS order said CPS had to meet with my son once a month &amp; also meet with my ex-wife separately once a month. Which the worker has admitted hasn't happened. There is no obligation for CPS to come to my house but I have been allowing it because I don't care &amp; my main concern is my son.   So I told the worker that Thursday's are my custodial time. I have him from Wednesday-Saturday. So he was already at my exes house when I spoke to CPS. She said I have to take him to my ex's house. I told her fine but I want a specific time since I will be picking him up after they are done meeting &amp; keeping him for the rest of my time. She said she doesn't have a time since she has to be in court all day &amp; is unsure when she will get out. She suggested I just take him to my exes around 2pm &amp; then he can stay through his time with her. Essentially denying my custody time. I told her no I wanted to spend time with my son during my time. I also asked her if she had spoken to my ex to ensure she would be home. The worker told me no she hadn't yet &amp; asked if I could on her behalf. I told her no because of the no contact order I got against my ex after she threatened me.   Do I have to take my son to meet at my exes house? What recourse do I have? I just want to see my son &amp; the worker seems so against that. Help please!	No
At the beginning of June, I was in stop-and-go traffic and a woman in her car flagged me over to the side of the road. She claims I rear-ended her. I didn't think I did, and saw no evidence of damage to my car. I asked her if she wanted to file a police report, she said no. I gave her my information, never admitting fault, but not wanting to be accused of fleeing the scene of an accident. I let her take a picture of my insurance and my license, but it had my old address (I had literally just moved that day). I did not provide my new address or phone/email. When my insurance agency called, I disputed the claim and gave my version of events to the best of my ability. A few days later they called and said they were not claiming liability on the accident. Hooray, I thought I was done with this. Today, I received a letter from the state police. It has a driver Information Exchange and an Illinois Motorist Report enclosed, asking me to mail it to the department of transportation.  The reason that I'm worried is because, due to an issue with an emission test, my car's registration was expired on the date of the alleged collision. Because of that, I have a few outstanding tickets for registration violation that are currently sitting on seizure (they will boot me if they find the car). My car is currently parked in my garage until I can save enough to pay the tickets and re-register. I also have not yet reported my change of address to the DMV. I'm worried that this lady's meddling is going to get me in trouble with the DOT.  I know there's a lot there. What is my best course of action for responding to this letter? What can I do to strengthen my case that I did not collide with this woman's car? What actions should I take with the city to avoid getting an arrest warrant or something? Do I need to inform the DMV of my changed address immediately? Sorry to be so uninformed.	No
Hi, I recently had to cancel a long term Airbnb reservation in Bay Area California, because of host breaking the agreement on which we agreed on before reserving midway through my reservation.   Airbnb's case manager handled the issue and it was agreed that I would be refunded for the nights not stayed in the reservation and would be refunded 50% for the nights since which host voided the agreement. The case manager changed my reservation dates accordingly, however, since it was listed as a new reservation, the nightly price was hiked by my host (something I was neither informed about nor agreed to). The case manager also started saying I did not pay for all the dates of the reservation according to the new dates, and hence they will not refund me for them. However, according to the previous receipt and my bank statements I paid for the whole month. I mentioned it to them, but they disregarded this. Every time I try calling them on their phone line, they say they will email me. But their email just repeats what the case manager said.   How do I go about solving the issue. The amount is quite high and as a student I cannot disregard the amount completely. I have all the necessary receipts and statements from the case manager. Thank you.	No
I was backing out of my driveway and I stupid stupid stupidly was distracted and hit my neighbor's van. They were parked across the street. There's a dent in it now and I just drove off (it was around 9 pm). I later saw that they parked the van on their driveway from the street. I don't have insurance yet, and I feel bad making my parents pay for it because we're having a lot of financial troubles. I just feel so so so guilty because they're such good and nice people. :( and my car doesn't have any dents on it - just a scruff. I know I fucked up massively and I know I'm a huge fuckup for doing this.	No
We move in 10 years ago and put down a $1000(about) deposit. The house is approximately 1200 square feet. When we moved in they replaced the carpet in the front of the house that covers the front room and dining room. The carpet in the hall and 3 bedrooms was unchanged. We have a couple of damaged doors, a drywall hole that we plan on fixing before we move and pets have damaged parts of the carpet that we can't really fix without recarpeting the areas  I have read in places that due to the length of time we've been here the carpet should be replaced and walls repainted before new tenants move in anyways, so along with that what things are covered under wear and tear? Also what things should I worry about that they can take parts of the deposit for?	No
"Hello, here is my situation.   I was at a public beach on the 4th of July in Massachusetts. I was drinking with friends, and we noticed a few cops had appeared on the beach. Naturally, we shied away from said cops as we were already away from our stuff. One of our group members was not with us, and she was near all of the bags, especially mine. She was apparently questioned about the alcohol and such, and they dumped beers out of my bag. They did not stop at the beers, and searched through my entire bag, finding my wallet. They then searched my wallet and found my fake ID. I returned a few minutes later after the police had left, and was told all of this by the friend who had been questioned. Now, a week later, I receive a notice in the mail calling upon me to appear at a hearing in august to defend myself against these charges. The charges were being in possession of a fake ID, and some miscellanious charge that is specific to my municipality and that I figure I need to call in to ask for it to be identified. Was it legal for them to search my wallet? I was under the impression that police require consent or a warrant to search someone's property. I was not even present and therefore not complicit with their search.   To add to all of this, I turned 21 on the 5th......... and although that does not take away from the legal implications of this charge, there is an added ""fuck you"" factor because of that fact."	No
She also needs to get checked up at the hospital, but her mom isn't paying for any type of insurance for her even though she has the money, and shes not taking her to the hospital. My girlfriend has social security checks because of a family members death that she has been recieving since she was 12, but she can't use them because she's only 17 and they go directly to her mother's account which she spends on jewelry and food for herself instead of things like insurance etc... Theres also occasions where my girlfriend literally cannot eat because her mom won't buy her food, and her mom always tells her to get a job but won't take her anywhere to get the things required for a job. (Shes been accepted after an interview 3 times but things keep shitting up) CPS has been called multiple times but her mom fixes the issues before they get there since they apparently need a day in advance and they see that everything is okay. Is there anything we can do about this?  (We're both 17)	No
The way i worded it in the title makes this seems a lot more civil than it is. My uncle cousin and aunt lived with my grandmother (uncles mother). Friday my grandmother and aunt got into a fight and my aunt left calling it the straw that broke her back. My uncle is completely fine separating from her, but he needs to see his daughter. My aunt told my uncle not to come to her parents house or her dad will shoot him. My uncle's response was to call his cousins and nephews (including me) to do a home invasion style re-kidnapping of his daughter. I told him how shitty that will look in court, not to mention the danger we'd be in (the old man with a gun would get at least 2 of us).  After calming him down and convincing him to see a lawyer Thursday (earliest appointment) he is now irate at the thought of not being able to see his child for at least a week. It seems like he's starting to move the pieces for his raid again but this time leaving me out.  What can I do to help my uncle see his child today (sun/mon are his days off)? My grandmother went to the hospital and is working on getting a birth paper copy to give to the police, thinking this will allow him to legally kidnap the his child while the aunt is at work; will this work or at least allow him a visit?  Florida.	No
"About two years ago my wife found out that she had an older sister from her father and an old girlfriend predating her parents marriage. She was excited to meet this older sister. Her father decided to take her out of state to meet her. Upon arival she was greeted by his ex-girlfriend of 30 years prior, who he had told my mother-in-law and wife would not be there.    During their stay they had decided to go out ""for dinner and a few drinks"" which turned out to be a swingers club.. My wife witnessed her father cheating on her mother with his ex in this sleazy place and was nearly in shock the entire time. They ended up staying longer than they had told my wife and she was very shocked the entire time and having panic attacks. She has been close to her father and neither I nor her would have ever expected this from her father, who was a seemingly cool guy before this. I have known them for 11 years.    A month after the trip back home the ex-girlfriend and older daughter moved to our same state, in the same town. The divorce ensued at nearly the same time, and then her father went to vegas with his ex and they remarried.. A shocking and tragic end to a 30-year marriage. The father continued to move in with the new/old family in the same town/same state as us.     He used my wife as an excuse to keep her mother from thinking anything fishy was happening. She has suffered greatly from this, after having been closer to her father than her mother her entire life. She has been diagnosed with anxiety disorders amongst other things and was rushed to the ER for trying to take her own life about a year ago..    He hasn't paid any child support the entire time, he didn't show up for court, they went and got him, he still didn't pay, according to my mother-in-law, for support per my underage sister-in-law. My mother-in-law got the house, he kept his truck, he gave his old truck to me before the divorce...He was also lying about how much he was getting from disability, while my mother-in-law worked two jobs to support them for nearly 10-20 years.. He remained on disability and got checks for each child and ""managed the money"" by lying about how much he actually got, and spent nearly all of it on his own personal interests. We found out he got a lot more from papers he left behind in the house..    We found online he was linked with an address out of state where his 'secret family' had stayed - it actually says it was in his name, and in the old truck he gave me we found dozens of reciepts spanning years for possibly rent for his secret families apartment(money orders to the same out of state town of his secret family). He also didn't give me the title to the truck, just a bill of sale saying he sold it to me for one dollar, and my mother-in-laws dad was the previous owner.. I don't think I have a way to get the title, but that's for another question..    He seriously messed up his whole family emotionally, and the older daughter is a crack head whore prescribed adderall and xanax bars, and tried to bribe me with drugs to sleep with her.. That's when my wife ended her relationship with her, while she was still visiting her dad after the divorce.. Her dad also supposedly has a painting that my wife made when she was 9 years old that was very sentimental to her, and some other personal posessions..    My mother-in-laws lawyer has cut off contact with her for whatever reason.. My wifes dad has done a lot of work for the state and city politicians here, like manual handyman stuff, and supposedly he has some kind of dirt on the lawyer.. I reccomended getting another lawyer, I'm just tired of all the drama and would like for her to get her stuff back and for him to pay child support.."	No
So I am divorcing first and foremost as a preface. Awhile back my soon to be ex wife setup her child support from her first child with another man to be deposited in my banking account. I have sole access and rights on this account still. There recently was a large deposit through the state enforcement office of back child support paid out to her that was deposited into my account. I won't go into detail why but am I in a legal state if I refuse to withdraw and give this money over to her? Yes it sounds scummy but I have my reasons. I just wanted to ask. Thank you in advance.	No
Title. A bit of history, I believe a parking spot is included in our contract for the apartment we live in. Recently they have really dropped the ball on parking enforcement. They reassigned our spots but never gave us new placards so nobody has them displayed and this is the 4th time this week we can't get into our spot due to someone else parking there or just bad parking due to our neighbor.  We contacted the towing company and they said they can't do anything unless the landlord calls them or security calls them. We have no (nor have we ever had) security on site, our landlord does not live her AND they DO NOT provide any contact information for situations like these.   We got a hold of our landlord's number and we called and she refused to come down to the complex and sign the towing papers.  So to recap, they don't enforce the parking rules and when we tried to do the right thing by following all appropriate steps, the landlord basically refused to help us.   Is this something we can go to the city about or anything?	No
I got a ticket a month back for not stopping at a stop sign and driving 1-10 mph over the speed limit. I did not commit either of these. The information on the ticket in wrong. Although my licence information is correct, the police wrote down the wrong year, make, model, and license plate of the car. I went to court to fight the ticket but the police officer did not show up so the judge dismissed the ticket. I did not disclose to the court or police department that the ticket contained the wrong information. I received a letter in the mail saying the officer that did not show up to the informal hearing in front of the magistrate is appealing the ruling and that I am required to come to a formal hearing in front of a judge. What are the chances that the judge will rule in my favor? Does the fact that the ticket was originally dismissed influence the decision of the judge? What should I look out for during the formal hearing? I will hire a lawyer tomorrow.	No
I was paid in cash for rent and deposit on a room in a house I am subleasing. The person who paid spent one day in the house moving in and decided they didn't want to stay in the house and now are demanding that I give the money back. They hired a private investigator and found out the number for my landlord and are threatening them and me with a lawsuit if I don't give back the money. The landlord told me to just give it to them. But I don't feel they have any grounds to ask me for the deposit and rent that they agreed to pay especially since it's five days into the month and I will now have to find a replacement. 	No
"Hi, I apologize if this is the wrong place to post. I just don't know where else to put this. At the beginning of this year, I posted on r/gonewild for fun. My inbox got flooded with messages, and one of them was a man promising me a very large sum of money in exchange for sexual pictures/videos with my face in them. He said he would pay up at the end of a predetermined amount of months. I agreed because I was naive and pretty strapped for cash.   The whole arrangement started getting very demanding as soon as I entered it. What was supposed to be like a video once a week and some pictures throughout the day turned into demands to know where I was at all times and watching me over Skype while I slept. I thought he was controlling but sweet because he seemed to open up to me sometimes. So when I stopped responding to his messages out of stress, I assumed he would be a little upset, but not go as far as to distribute the images/videos I had sent him. He messaged me a few times but stopped saying anything to me soon after.   Well, today I opened up my r/gonewild account to some interesting messages and posts. (He had my r/gonewild password.) First, he posted some of the photos I had sent to him, though luckily without face. (However, they had very identifiable backgrounds.) Second, he had been messaging potential other ""sugar babies"" from my account as a way to verify his ""authenticity"", and had been sending them screenshots of ""my"" PayPal transaction with him (which, obviously, never occurred.) Right now, other than thanking the high heavens that I didn't go through with this obviously very scammy arrangement, I am scared that he is going to start posting photos of me on the internet. Not just on Reddit, but whatever other message boards people use for this kind of stuff.   What can I do to stop him? I think I pieced together enough information to know his real identity. I know his name (I think) and the state he lives in (Georgia), as well as his approximate age. First, I'm gonna try to talk to him human-to-human, and tell him to knock it off, but obviously this isn't someone that can be trusted. Could I report him for financial fraud (the name on the PayPal account isn't his, and I highly doubt he has been paying all these girls) or revenge porn? I need to operate very carefully as he has hundreds of nude images of me with face.   Thank you and please let me know if this isn't the appropriate place for this!"	No
Hi there. Quick question please; I am supposed to have my son every second Sunday as per a court order which was agreed to in mediation. Last week Sunday my visit was cancelled despite the court order saying it was non negotiable and the reason why it was cancelled is because apparently my son was sick although he was fine the previous evening when I saw him and they would not show him to us to verify that he is indeed sick. Also they did not take him to the doctor and I stay less than twenty metres from his place so there was no real reason that they needed to cancel the visit. I went to the police station to report them and the police were unable to do anything. The court order is brand new and I'm already being pushed around like this. Now the social workers have told me to forfeit this week's visitation as well because they worry that the conflict is harmful to my child however what they fail to acknowledge is that there would not be any conflict if the other party simply followed what they agreed to. Is there any justice for people who breach court orders and go against agreements? I do not understand why I must now make a second agreement if they wouldn't even follow the first. I stay in the same apartment complex as him and they still never let me see him and it's grossly unfair. Also they drive around with him in the car without a car seat. I am extremely discouraged by the judicial system!!! 	No
"I'm dealing with my TX HOA for the second time in 7 years because of some damage that has been done to my fence through poor landscaping choices on their part.  The timeline is below:  - In 2010, the HOA agreed their poor landscaping choices led to my 7 year old fence being destroyed and agreed to pay half of the replacement cost. The main destruction came from a rapidly growing bush (pampas grass) being planted too close to my fence, but some ivy/ground cover had also destroyed the bottom of my fence since it had been allowed to sit on it for years.  - When I was replacing the fence I was given permission to remove the ivy that was in front of it to avoid rotting out my new fence pickets.  I have before and after pictures showing the ivy was effectively removed.  I have this in writing and gave my HOA rep a copy of these when I this new ivy was planted.   - 5-10-2016 - After the ivy was replanted randomly one day I emailed my HOA rep explaining the history and politely requested that it be removed so that we didn't have a repeat of the previous incident - On 6-7-2016, after ""discussing it with the board"", the HOA rep told me the landscaping company would ""have the work completed by the end of the work day on Thursday, the 9th.""  The landscaping company came and possibly cut it back a little, but it was not removed as expected.  The company also dropped off a dozen or more bags of potting soil, so I waited for something to happen.  - A year later, 7-12-2017, nothing more had happened.  The bags of potting soil are still sitting in the public space and the ivy is clearly growing all along the bottom of my fence and has begun to rot out all of the pickets and the lowest fence runner.  I once again ask my HOA rep to remove the ivy. - 7-25-16 - My HOA replys saying they will instruct the lawn service to cut the ivy back.  There is not explanation for why they ivy won't just be removed. - 7-29-16 - I email asking the above question.  I never get a response.   - Today - The landscaping company has come by and cut the ivy back to ~1' from my fence.  My HOA rep emailed telling me that it was completely removed, and I replied to tell her it was not completely removed and once again requesting that it be.    What I would like advice on is: 1. Can I legally force my HOA to remove the ivy?  I was given permission in writing before to remove it due to damage that it had previously created.  It is frustrating that they can replant it, refuse to remove it, damage my fence again, and there is nothing I can do about it. 2. How much damage is enough to seek compensation?  I have about 20' of a 7 year old fence with the bottom 3-6"" completely rotted away, this includes pickets and a some of a pretreated runner (http://imgur.com/a/KufJ3?).  The rest of the fence is in great shape (see pics).  I know structurally it isn't destroyed, but this ivy has done damage to my property and I'd like to know what my options are.  Thank you for reading the long post.  TL:DR HOA replanted and now refuses to remove ivy that I previously removed with their permission.  This ivy damaged my fence in the past and has now done so again.  How do I get them to stop and/or pay for the damage?"	No
I recently filled for joint custody of my daughter in the state of West Virginia due to the mother not letting me see my child. The court date got set back and since then she moved out of state without the judges approval or filling for relocation. Me and her were never married. Is she able to do that ?  	No
I received a letter in the mail yesterday with my address but someone else's name on it requesting to pay for a property tax ownership change fee and I have not sold my property. I called the city about it and they said they had an ownership change on record about two weeks ago. The person said to ignore the bill and she'd look into what happened, so waiting to hear back right now. Should I be contacting a lawyer or something about this (not that I can afford one right now) or am I paranoid?	No
"So a little backstory here, my neighbor is in her late 20s and ever since she moved in I haven't paid her much attention due to the fact that she is white trash...  constantly blaring rap music and yelling at her kids all kinds of obscenities.  The other day a few of these kids were in our backyard swearing and woke up my gf so she went out there and told them to beat it and they told her to fuck off, etc.  The kids are like 11 and younger.. but then the mom comes out cussing and swearing at my gf and they exchange some words.    On the weekend my gfs daughter who is 8 and has some mental issues went outside to play with her friend who also lives in the neighbourhood and I hear my crazy bitch neighbor cussing at her as soon as she walked out the door.  I lost my shit and went out there and told her if she was gonna talk shit to an 8 year old she could talk shit to me.  She proceeded to tell me her ""niggers"" would be by later to handle me and all this other crap.  Anyways, fast forward a few days and literally anytime I leave my house to head to work, take out trash, anything this bitch starts yelling from her backyard or her windows all kinds of crazy shit.  I've been ignoring it for the most part but it's annoying as hell when I'm just trying to live my life here and any chance she gets she and her kids are harassing me, my gf and her little one.  I have hesitated on contacting police as I know she's the type that would just start calling me cop caller or something else instead..  anyone have any legal advice or any options on what I could do?  I've thought about video taping from my phone every time I go outside but it's kind of obvious and could escalate the situation..  I'm open to anything though, any advice is much appreciated..  thanks."	No
So I've learned that somewhat recently there have been cases in which plaintiffs have won cases against companies which have websites which are not ADA complaint (sites which are usable by the blind/deaf).  My understanding throughout my career (which was probably false) was that only US Government agencies were required to comply with these rules.  I have heard of many cases in which lawyers have sued small businesses over failing to have wheelchair ramps, elevators, etc. in the past but only recently that website operators and mobile app owners are being sued. I am quite concerned that there could be a liability by simply having a website. What's worse is that it seems the DOJ has not even finalized any regulations on the subject.  How can plaintiffs justify damages by not being able to access free websites? I've never understood how a disabled individual could justify damages for being unable to access a restaurant or other business.	No
Is it legal to post videos which are sent around on what's app groups on a personal website or a personal you tube account  (which runs ads) without permission from the creator? (Many times the creator is unknown as the videos are forwarded many times over.)  Thanks in advance. 	No

I work for a well-known company in Canada (Ontario), I’ve been with them for roughly 4 years. Now I was originally hired out of nepotism, as my boss and bosses boss are both related to my Fiance and family friends.  First year or so I was good, everyone was impressed with my work, took no sick days, gave no trouble. Towards the end of the second year I have started having medical issues, mainly migraines. At first they were sympathetic towards me, but after a while they started to think I was lying. I went from maybe 1-2 specialists before this job, to almost 10. I was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor causing my migraines, Endometriosis, Lichen Sclerosis, Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD, and they are still looking for other diseases I’m exhibiting on top of all the stupid BS I’ve gone through in my life. Its fucking exhausting.  I started with just an agreement with therapy every Thursday morning, I would come in a little late so I could go to a session and gradually decrease frequency. Eventually I got referred to more specialists in the larger town I work in, and tried booking them before work as I work odd hours. Normally this works out well, but the odd time I need to go get a scheduled ultrasound, or specific blood work done that takes an hour or so. Although I try my best to work around my work schedule, sometimes it ends up overlapping a bit, or an appointment runs a little late because of hospital emergencies. Normally I call and let them know what’s going on and how late I might be.  As of late though I’ve been getting a lot of comments like “I heard your appointment went late” and “oh what kind of doctor is that?”, “I didn’t know they scheduled MRI’s for that late”, and my personal favorite “From now on we need all your appointments in writing”(I email all appointments work interfering or not) I know neither my boss or bosses boss believe me. I come in after an appointment with disapproving looks, and snide comments. I’m starting to get nervous and anxious every time I have an appointment now. I’ve shown them the paperwork that confirms everything I’ve told them, but they just think I’m still making all this shit up.  Has anyone dealt with this type of situation before? Is there anything I can do going forward? I have a 2 month span with roughly 9 appointments….. I’m just so tired of everything. My Fiance supports the idea of leaving and I’m looking, but I can’t leave out right due to financial reasons. There’s no reasoning with either of my bosses either.  **TL;DR, sick, boss doesn't believe me, what do?**	No
So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them.   For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.  I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?  My business is in Pennsylvania and they are located in New York.   Thanks for your assistance.	No
"Moved in to a new place April 1st that I will not be returning to until September 1st. I have been transfering my share of the rent to one of their accounts yet I realized that every single month they pay the rent like a week late and every time I tell them to pay it on the first its all ""Dude chill"" and ""The landlord is cool with it"" even though when I met him he was some passive old dude, who I feel is just taking it late to avoid confrontation but could screw us.   If we do get charged a late fee or even get served an eviction for late rent, is there any steps I can take to cover myself since I was always transferring money to them a day before it was due? All our names are on the lease.  Or am I overreacting to this situation"	No
I (28M) was involved in an altercation last Sunday morning with my boyfriend (28M) that resulted in us both going to jail. I need to know how much trouble I am in and if self-defense is an option. Here is the backstory:  Saturday was a great day for us both. We had been to the pool with friends and decided to go out later that evening. Once we got to the bar, he noticed some friends and asked if we could buy his friends a drink, so I ordered 3 drinks and a water for myself. Once the bill came, he noticed the total and started yelling at me because he thought I was only paying for water and the rest was a flirtatious tip for the bartender.  Not true.  He forgot about the three drinks I ordered for him and his friends.  That was enough for me to say I wanted to go home.  Upon leaving the bar, he was still irate with me because of the bar tab, which was US $18... I ignored him which set him off even more so he sideways punched (think slap, but with a fist) me in the face, twice.  Trying to get away from him, he ripped my shirt off of me. I ordered an Uber and he grabbed my phone and cancelled it.  I was able to use my Apple Watch and ordered another one.  Embarrassed and heartbroken, I just wanted to get home.  Once we got home, I asked him to leave.  I didn't care about my phone at that point.    I thought he left so I went to my guest bedroom and locked the door.  I thought being in the guest room I would hear him as he would enter the master first.  I was wrong, he broke the door down and pounced on me while I was asleep punching me repeatedly in the face.  Scared to death, I reached around for whatever I could find while he was choking me and grabbed a metal table decoration and began striking him.  Blood started pouring everywhere.  The decoration caught his forehead and backside of his hand.  Once he realized I wasn't backing away he got off of me.  I begged him to give me my phone or his so I could call 911.  He refused so I immediately started to run outside to get help.  He stopped me and said he was calling them from my phone.  I went out into my courtyard to wait on the responders, with the decoration piece in hand because I was afraid he might try to harm me again.   Once they arrived, he told them I was trying to kill him bc I was mad at him due to a bar tab... I couldn't believe it.  The guy I thought I was falling for was absolutely trying to ruin my life.  We were both arrested.. me for aggravated assault and him for battery.    Fast forward to now.  He has been trying to communicate with me through friends and directly.  He still has my phone and wallet but I was able to get a new phone.  He has told me he was going to be honest and let the prosecutor know I was defending myself but he wanted to talk to me first.  I have not responded to a single message nor have I sent messages through friends to him.  We both have no-contact-orders.  If he tells the prosecutor the truth, will the charges be dropped?  A few details to consider: He is at risk of being deported to Brazil.  We have only been together a few months.  Yes the signs were there and I just thought we could get past it.  I have a previous charge of failure to report an accident and currently on probation.  I have never been involved in a fight or an abusive relationship until this.  I have been financially supporting my bf and he is currently involved with another case where is seeking support from Georgia Victims of Crime. I think he's trying to do the same using me.	No
Hello legaladvice peeps,  In 2016, I worked for a smallish tech company with a whole host of problems, including sexual harassment, unequal pay given to employees with the same responsibilities, internal nepotism, etc etc. I was asked by a journalist to speak on these problems, in particular about how several employees banded together to bargain for an HR representative and equal pay for the same work.   I spoke to the journalist already, but I've negotiated anonymity and am debating going on-record. The thing is, I signed an NDA, and I'm not sure if it's enforceable in this instance. I can send a copy of it privately if you're curious. But this article will come out within the time period specified by the NDA (2 years). My question is, can an NDA protect against claims of employer retaliation? AFAIK, that's not a business strategy, intellectual property, or anything of the like. It's just how I was treated by my employer, and as far as I can tell, collective bargaining is a federally protected action.  Anyway, any help would be appreciated, here.	No
Last night, my roommate told me about a copyright notice from our ISP. It was the third one and first that I knew about. I have no idea who did the other two. Unwittingly, I said it might have been me. I live in a house of 3 and my landlord owns the account. He called me today and I said that I did it for the most recent notice. He then said he needs to call my ISP tomorrow or else the internet will get shut off. I thought that this was a simple warning and would have never admitted it had I known our internet would go down and he would possibly need to mention me to our ISP.   I live in Washington and I'm in the military. Should I talk to a military lawyer right now or wait until my ISP possibly contacts me? I have no idea if my landlord will be able to work this out without mentioning me. I know I'm an idiot for outing myself but I didn't know that this was the last straw for our internet service. I'm pretty scared and I need everything I have right now to get out and be financially straight. What should I do?	No
Our landlord lives in another state and will be in town this weekend.  He wants to see that the mower does not work, our bathroom sink is actually leaking, and hopefully to fix them.  However, he wants to come while we're at work.  Is this legal?  He has already tried to change the due date for rent from what his lease specifies; he does not seem to know landlord laws very well . Thank you!	No
Hi. I went to Miami with a girl, and had her sign an electronic contract that we were splitting all costs. Total came to $507 for the trip. This included festival tickets, rental car, gasoline, lodging, and parking fees. I paid for all pre-trip because I get good deals on things if I do. I have texts also backing up that we agreed to split them all.   She gave me $55 before we left for Miami. When we got back, she said she was moving to Tennessee (lie, found out where she works in our local mall) and would pay me gradually as she was settled. She's sent me $65 over the course of two months, and an $50 Amazon gift card.   She blocked my number and all my social media accounts, so I contacted her boyfriend. He said he would pay me back the $, but he wants to see my messages with her from Feb - July. I have all of the messages, I never deleted them. But we were actually friends and some of them are about her selling nudes online for $ and him cheating on her. I would rather do this a legal route through small claims court, but how much is it just to file a claim? How much stress is it?	No
I have moved out of an apartment recently, my official final day being today.   Over the past few days I have been removing all of my stuff from the apartment, and went back earlier thisafternoon to collect the remainder of my things.   Upon entry I find that the apartments maintainable men have come in, and check the status of the apartment, as well as they have stolen a variety of my personal items and tools.  What do i need to do to take action against the complex? They have already claimed to have no information about anything being removed, and don't have any explanation why the maintainance men were in the unit, without my permission, before the official conclusion of my lease.   (Indiana, United States)	No
Water service stopped completely 2 days, ago going into this weekend. Looking for advice on how to either get regulatory leverage on the Landlord to get the water running again, or to be able to use this situation as a means of legally breaking my lease, if possible (this is the latest in a long running series of absurdities in this living situation and I'm tired of fighting).  In the bills that the landlord sends out so that we can pay our split of the it (single meter for 3 units) there is is an outstanding balance of over $15,000. I guess they finally decided enough was enough  I've called code enforcement on the matter but have not been able to make contact with the officer overseeing my case, and now it's the weekend and I doubt they have weekend hours, though her voicemail doesn't explicitly state this. I'm bracing to go without water though I will make calls tomorrow at the least.  Is there anything more I can do? are there any regulatory agencies that could force the landlord to be proactive on this? Is there any way I could use this situation to break my lease?  I don't want to take over the water bill b/c of not wanting to be accountable for collecting bill payments from 3 different people and possibly being stiffed and because the usage rate indicates that there has to be some kind of leakage going on.  Any advice would be appreciated.	No
Can someone advise me what would happen if my foster child were to say smash someone's car windows?  Would that be my financial duty, would it be the state's, or would the biological parents be responsible?	No
So, 24yo, about 6 months pregnant.  Long story short, I was dating this guy and found out about his child pornography charges. I left him and then later found that I was pregnant. I am pro choice in the sense that it's none of my business what another woman does with her body, but abortion is not for me.   At first we were on the same page. He told me his side of the story with the porn and agreed that he would sign over all rights to me as long as he still got some kind of supervised visitation. I more recently was given access to the full federal file and found out that the story he gave me was super watered down and straight up false in some cases. Since I've found that out, he's been super wishy washy about whether or not he's actually going to sign over the rights.  For a while I was considering adoption. He went and sent in an appeals to the federal judge here to have his restrictions lifted (he can't be alone with anyone under the age of 18 without supervision, can't step foot on school or day care properties, etc.) so that he could get full custody. He won't tell me whether or not the appeals was actually granted.   We've since gotten back on the same page again and he's agreed to sign everything over, but I'm concerned that he'll change his mind again at the last minute and I'll be thrown into a legal battle unprepared.   I can't really afford a lawyer right now and I've never had to deal with anykind of legal issues in my life. I have no idea where to even start. Help, please?	No
"Accidental kitchen fire left residue in 2 rooms. They were repainted by a company for ~2k. I said I would wash the walls by a certain date for a discounted price(around 300 less), they came over before the agreed upon date and started without speaking to me. They painted for 1 day and charged 2000$ for 2 rooms?   The above is more understandable than what my landlord did afterwards. He charged 55$/h for 10 hours of ""labor"" Which is him driving to Home Depot (which is 5 min away) to get some finish for a door. He charged us 700$ for replacing a 30$ door. There has to be some way to call BS on this right?  Any help on what to do here would be very appreciated, I realized I messed up but I don't want my roommates to have to pay for what I have done."

My fiancée and I rent a house in Vermont (if that matters) from her grandfather who owns the house. It's all legal, we have a signed lease etc. we've been here 1 year with nothing go wrong or any mishaps or damage, and have a good relationship with the landlord. We pay our rent and bills on time every month, etc.  we've had one of my friends sleep here 3 nights total over the past month, once each weekend. Anyway, our landlords wife (Fiancée's grandmother) was very upset about my friend sleeping in here and subtely threatened evicting us. Are there any grounds for this? Aren't I allowed to have a friend sleep here every now and again? He was quiet and respectful and didn't cause any damage or cause any trouble.  And just to clarify, this is not a regular thing and won't become a regular thing.	No
As the title suggests, the gas meter stopped working a couple of years ago and my dad never reported it and no one from the gas company ever checked or inquired. I told my dad that he could get into trouble sooner or later but he is too stubborn about this. He believes that it is their duty to check it and correct the issue. So i guess this is how it will go on. What could be the legal consequences of this if they find out later? Will my dad be held accountable?	No
I just moved from one part of the state to another. I live in a 2 bed with another roommate whom I'd only met once before. It's typical to have roommates that are essentially strangers when you live in a large city.   Anyway, I hate it here. I'm extremely depressed and my roommate is constantly having people over, doing drugs and stuff. I'm 21, here for college and they're 18 here for college too. Last night he left 5 people I've never met alone in our apartment while I was at work. He takes my food even though I said I wanted to buy separate groceries. I'm a sexual assault victim and having people over that I don't know in my safe place is just too much and is really taking a toll on my mental health. I can't do it. I've told him he needs to chill with bringing people over multiple times but he doesn't listen.  I know his parents and it's my name, the roommates, and their dads name on the lease. Can I leave and have my name taken off? Thanks.	No
"I divorced my spouse July of last year and part of the settlement involved being awarded a portion of their 401k. The 401k was operated by the local chapter of their union.   In December of last year the provider of the 401k merged with the international chapter's 401k provider and since then noone seems willing or able to help me.  I've been told to basically stop calling/emailing the international chapter's investment department as ""we've not received the final calculations from the previous provider and cannot give you an update""  What, if anything, can I do to compel them to follow the court order?"	No
Hey all, I'm just looking for a few next steps to take regarding this. I moved out sometime mid-may and was greeted with a $137 bill for alleged damages to the apartment. To be fair, the feet of my couch did damage some linoleum flooring so I wasn't expecting the security deposit to cover all of it. I paid my $137 bill and went about my business.   Late June they decide to send a revised statement with adjusted amounts charging $2000+ for replacing flooring and $400 for painting. This is after they cashed the original check as well. This amount is close to a whole other month of rent and I can't just take this in stride. Is there anything I can do to contest this?	No
Hello - over the last few years, I noticed my skin had been getting progressive worse like I'm really allergic to something.  I've documented the deterioration of my skin the whole time at my doctor's behest.  Over the last two years, I've worked with my doctors to try everything possible - from steroids to light therapy to daily injections.  Nothing worked.  My doctor began to wonder if it was an environmental issue and encouraged me to stay away from my old, musty office for two weeks and see what happens - lo and behold, my skin turned almost back to normal for the first time in years.    I came back to my boss and talked to her about options for me to continue working - I offered telecommuting, working in another office across the street and coming in for meetings, etc.  She refused to work with me on anything.  I'm now taking medical leave.  What options do I have?	No
I live in California, client is in Europe. We only had email agreements to do a 3k video project. The resulting video was not professional quality. It was so low quality it started going viral a bit since filmmakers were enthusiastically denouncing every aspect of it.  I gave the client a full refund, but now I have this video which to me is a silly (and expensive) reminder of a project gone terribly wrong. Can I make it public on YouTube? I removed all reference to the company in the Title/Description, and note that the client is not affiliated with it and was given a full refund. But the video itself still contains their name/brand.  Is this fine to publish, or can I be sued for liable, brand infringement, or some other offense I'm unaware of. At this point I feel like it's mine, I paid for it, and should be able to publish it. I even refunded the fee for the script, which their whole team had signed off on and already paid for. I had hoped to retain them so was being nice there, and then they bailed.	No
My co-tenant wants off the renewal lease of a rent stabilized lease in NYC and we submitted a notarized letter from him and I stating such.  Now, my landlord won't take him off the lease unless he provides a current proof of new address and photocopy of his ID.  He doesn't want to provide either.  What can I do?	No
A friend of mine used to live in an apartment complex in a college town. This was about 3 years ago - when he left, the apartment sent a bill for $2,100 for repairs and damages after balancing out the deposit. My friendly firmly believes that there is no way the damages have been that much. Recently, they filed a lawsuit in the county court and he has to appear. He is thinking about hiring a lawyer and was planning to start a petition. Any suggestion(s) would help.	No
They told him it was a federal offence and he had no idea. What can he do?	No
Just like the title says, I paid to have a background check and such done and the application fee said non refundable whether we were approved or declined. The owner may not be leaving as planned and the house won't be availiable to rent. they used a service called rentscreener.com. Thanks in advance	No
How do I get proper legal advice on this? do I approach a tax attorney or an accountant? I used TurboTax to file taxes for the past two years.  Is getting proper legal advice going to be more expensive (or close) to paying this debt directly?  If I can get advice on this directly that would be great, but I am almost more afraid and need advice on getting the proper legal advice itself.	No

"In PA - I have a co worker who books travel arrangements for employees. Person is a full time employee w our company. On the side, my co-worker owns a travel agency.

State (Alabama) (will answer questions!!) Hi I'm 17 and been have been in joint custody for a long time and I'm tired of it!! I'm so tired of my mom and want to go live with my dad I have already been kicked out once at the age 15 and forced back into my mom's home because she can do that apperntly.I am about to snap on my mom and on my stepdad I can't stand this anymore. I go back to my dad's every other weekend and sometimes a week I'm summer when school is over.Besides that I feel like im treated really bad at my mom's and ive already called dhr many times and nothing has happened over the three times I've called them. Sorry for really bad grammar but I need help with this like really badly!! Any leads or tips to help me get out of this	No
The other side has told me that they have drafted some kind of stipulation or other agreement to announce to the court at the upcoming hearing, which was supposed to be the date of the trial. They say it closely tracks the original agreement. I am not sure if this is proper or necessary.	No
Title says it.  Daughter had rented a high-rise apartment and it the toilet flooded and damages were caused. $60k worth in total remediation. The landlord is demanding that the Dad and Daughter pay for it. They are threatining to sue.  So far the daughter had been in the spotlight. However, I believe the legal counsel for the landlord had conducted a deed search and found that she had no assets. So they are now focusing on the dad.  Daughter has no assets. Dad has 50% of the house and several land claims in northern BC that he fully owns. Mom owns the other 50% of the house and the single car the family uses. Mom and Dad are in debt ~$180k in credit lines. So only possible way anyone can get any money out is to force a sale on the house or dad's land claims.  Regular surburban house. No separate basement or secondary suite units. Can the judge force a sale? If so, how does that work? How does one purchase half a house?  Side Question: How does one find all the assets belonging to a certain person? Public information? Where can I find this? I need to know what they know.	No
"I know this is not really that complicated of an issue (based on the information I have at the moment), but I want to be sure I have some good standing, and I'm very angry so I imagine this will be a venting session.  We have been neighbors for roughly 6 years, haven't had a lot of major issues.  The one big point of contention is that they have their water drainage on my property, but I've been kind of letting that go as they've been mostly nice and I don't like to fight with my neighbors, and it hasn't really caused me that many issues besides the general stress of feeling taken advantage of.  I have a tree.  My neighbor doesn't like my tree.  She asked me to cut it down, because the squirrels were taking the walnuts, climbing to the top of a telephone pole, and leaving droppings on her car.  I told her I would not be cutting down my tree, because I like my tree.  SO.  I get a text from her today, saying that she had a surveyor come and they actually own 2' past their fence into my property.  They are currently renting, but planning on purchasing the house, and when the purchase is complete they are going to move the fence 2' over.  That didn't sound right, so I pulled out my deed, and according to the town records and the taxes I've been paying, there is no way in hell they own 2' more past this fence.  HOWEVER, if she moves the fence 2' over, the tree is then on her property and she could justify cutting it down.  I asked her to give me her surveyor's contact info, because I needed to know why my deed and the surveyor were not matching up.  She said that when they purchased the house she would gladly give me a copy of the info.    I really can't help but feel that she is just outright lying to me, and would simply have moved the fence over, and is expecting me to just be like ""Oh, okay, that's fine, I'm not going to follow up on this at all.""  I plan on going to get some sort of clarification or back-up on my deed, and possibly any public information on their property.  I am considering contacting a lawyer, but man, spending any more money on this seems so ridiculous.  Any advice or thoughts would be greatly appreciated."	No
I live in Eugene Oregon. I paid the Security deposit in full with my own money. The tenants I lived with were people I didn't know (craigslist). they re-signed the lease under my nose and had the full security deposit, all of which was my money paid with a check in my name, transferred to the new lease. I went to the property management company and they said there is no way to get the money back unless I track down the individuals who are living there and get them to sign an agreement saying that the Deposit will be given to me after their lease is up in July 2018. This seems very unlawful considering the check is in my name, I was not notified of them re-signing, and I am no longer on the lease/living there. Any advice would help! thanks.	No
My wife filed for assistance when my son was born. I didn't know I had I son, two years later I received a letter to be DNA swabbed at DFS, which I obliged . Even before the results were in I knew he was mine so I contacted my wife and we got married 12 years later, present day, I get called into HR and was told there was a order for back child support to garnish my wages. Look at the paperwork and my son's name is on it. WTF! I've raised this kid and I owe child support. Apparently the case was never properly closed. My question is what is fastest way to resolve this and if any is there any recourse for the state fucking up?	No
I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up. He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.  Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car. He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point... I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt. I also have a text message from a couple weeks ago where he threatens to fight me if I ever talk to him or if he sees me with the girl he was dating (neither of these things have happened but it is still a credible threat).  I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor. I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes. Will they take me in for my warrant? Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted? Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order? Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing. I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.  My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school. Is this a good plan?  Thank you	No
[TX] I was driving in the left lane of traffic on highway 361 preparing to pass another car that was 1000 feet in front of me, I realize that I might have gotten into the left lane a little early but they were going slow and we were the only people on the road. As I'm coming up on the car I see a black SUV sitting in the median facing the wrong way and I slow down kind of panicking that they're going to pull out in front of me. I do not change lanes because I'm watching the SUV to see if they pull out in front of me. As I pass the SUV they turn their lights on and I realize it was a cop, I was not speeding at any point. I get pulled over and issued a ticket for driving in the left lane, the cop will not listen to the fact that I was preparing to pass a car until I saw him facing the wrong way in traffic and slowed down. What are my chances of fighting this? It's a $500 ticket and as I wasn't impeding the flow of traffic I don't really see what I did to warrant a ticket. The law is so ambiguous, and there is not place (that I can tell) that tells you when you can officially get into the left lane to pass.    Also worth noting, I have a Conceal Carry License but I've never owned a gun or really had anything to do with guns. Got it because my boyfriend is in the military and wanted me to get a gun and I kinda forgot I had it. The cop ran my DL and saw that I have a CCL and came back screaming that he could arrest me for not giving him my CCL with my DL but when I took the class they told is that we're under no obligation to give the officer our CLL granted we do not have a gun on our person, which I most definitely did not. I would really like to file an official complaint for this because as far as I can tell, he's just making up law to suit himself but I want to be sure that this is correct before I raise hell at the police station.	No
"I'll summarize what had happened:  I was driving up to an onramp, and traffic was moving up when the car in front of me slammed on their brakes and I slammed on mine but my car still hit their back bumper. The person behind me had a lot of distance from me, and his car was unaffected but I immediately notice him running to the car in front of me. They spoke a foreign language to one another for a while before I could get their information. When I asked the young driver what had happened, for their side of the incident and why they slammed on their brakes, they said I hit them and caused them to hit another car in front of them. Moments later, the ""witness"" turned out to be the front (car that my car hit)  drivers father. This was my first accident, and I drive on this street/onramp daily for work, it seemed extremely fishy to me that he waited until we parted to mention that was his daughter and he was following her. I sustained a neck injury, and leg injury from the accident, and the others said they're fine with no injuries. I was already on the phone with my insurance when I asked them if they had any injuries. Their insurance card stated it expired back in February.     Should I report this to my insurance or have them investigate?"	No
I live in a dorm and we have a full kitchen/living area that 2 rooms share, and one of the guys that lives in the other room is absolutely disgusting. He made food over two weeks ago and hasn't cleaned anything up and it has started to grow mold in our kitchen because of him. I have tried numerous times to get him to clean it up, and his excuse is that he will clean it when he needs to use them again. I have taken pictures and documented every time I have talked to him about it.   Can I throw away his pots/pans because they are becoming a legitimate health hazard? Or should I try to go through the University to force him to clean his stuff up?	No
"I currently live in an apartment that has a roach problem. Our lease states that the landlord is responsible for all pest control services. They have sent an exterminator twice and getting them to do that was like pulling teeth. They don't answer the phone and it took two weeks for us to get the exterminator to come the second time and we had to call her ourselves because they said she had our number and it was now ""on her"" to get ahold of us. The exterminator came and said we are definitely not the issue, that the roaches must be migrating from a different apartment and unless they treat all of the building it will continue to be an issue. They treated the outside and halls, but not the individual apartments. I don't believe the landlord is going to treat all of the apartments and so the roach problem won't be fixed. Since it's in our lease that they cover pest control does that mean we can terminate it and move if this issue persists? Sorry if this is ramble I'm very stressed. Thank you for your advice in advance"	No
Hi, Forgive me for being an older guy with limited technology experience.  I recently had to move because of certain personal circumstances.  Because of my personal financial situations and some strange incidents, I am living extremely cheaply and I am living with college students.  All of the the roommates use a mobile application called Venmo.  From my own research, it appears that Venmo does create a record of transactions.  The landlord wants all of to use Venmo to pay him.  However, in the future if any legal disputes arise, how would I show records of Venmo in a court?  Is the validity of the records created by Venmo the same as those on a bank statement and other paper documents?	No
So basically she has been with this guy on and off for like 8 years now. She has broken up with him like 3 times now, but he always finds some way back in. I know he smokes weed and cigarettes. Sometimes he will use mine and my little sisters bathroom (I'm 16 and she's 13) to take a crap and smoke. He has taken my things and sold them when I was younger and seemingly convinced my mom he didn't do it. He is a previous sex offender but is off parole. He also used to do drugs. He just got back out of jail and a got back together with my mom recently. He always acts like he owns the place.   The point of this is I have told my mom time and time again to kick him out or I am gonna leave. However since I'm only 16 and she claims I can't. My whole family knows he's a dick. Am I able to go stay with a differently family member? Can I file some kind of restraining order against him? What are the legal issues with this whole process?	No
The housing market in the city I go to school in is very competitive this time of year and landlords tend to accept multiple applications for a single rental before determining who they're going to rent to. I have good rental history, but every year I still need to put in several applications on 'available' rentals in order to find a place because of this. I understand taking 2 or 3 applications because students might not have the best credit/rental history and you want to make sure you find someone, but I've heard of the property management company I just tried renting from taking 40+ applications for a single apartment. This seems like kind of a racket to me because that's $1600 in just applications. I had another experience recently where I paid the $80 (2 people) background check/application fee with a property management company for a rental and when I did I was told by their office lady that I was sure to get it but that it would take a few days to do the background check. After a week I called them back for an update and they said the address I put in the application for had just been rented to someone else, and I'm pretty sure they didn't even do a 'background check' on me because the references/landlord I put on the application never heard from them. They didn't even seem to remember who I was. If it's legal to accept multiple applications and deny people without reason what's stopping someone from just 'renting' a house for the application fees with no intention of actually renting the property to anyone.	No
Mom has a tenant who claimed that she would move out on 7/31 even after not paying rent for July. Tenant is basically forcing us to take her deposit as her last month's rent. * She went to the house on the first to get the keys back only to find that the door to the house was blocked from the inside with a boatload of clothes and leftover stuff. * She would go on to change the door lock and the garage door opener such that she would not be able to get in without contacting her first.  * The tenant would proceed to call the police claiming that she still lived there and the door was opened for her. * Attempted to contact the tenant for further information regarding whether or not she would continue living there, but no reply. Also no access to the house because of the police.  * The lease turned into a month to month agreement after original lease expired. Tenant's son's name is on the lease.  * What would be the best course of action for my mom to take?	No
Moved into a new house this past weekend. Noticed that the bathroom mirror to the 1st floor bathroom and 2nd floor bathroom were taken. Called the seller and she says that because they're decorative, she had a right to take them. Also noticed a couple wall light fixtures missing. What do I do? Do I take her to small claims court? Nothing in the sales contract mentions her taking the mirrors or light fixtures . Are bathroom mirrors considered decorative?	No

My son's car has been egged several times over the last few months.  The second time it happened we made a police report but it's happened 3 times since and we haven't called it in.  They have also gotten my husband's car and our house.  What I want to know is, is this considered illegal?  The egg just washed off so no real damage, but my son thinks it's kids at school doing it because he is gay.... would that make it a hate crime if egging isn't even a crime?  I am so frustrated.  We only have room to park one car in the driveway, not that it would deter them, but it seems like whichever one of us is parked on the street is getting it, just us, not our neighbors.  Our neighbor behind us did get it once, but not since.  My son's car is just a $2000 car, but my husband and I drive much nicer cars and don't want to have to deal with this crap.  It happened once on a Friday night, but all other instances were on Sunday nights.	No
Hello Everyone!  So my girlfriend is currently a DACA recipient from Honduras and has been here in the United States for 13 years. She always talks about wishing her and her family the ability to become legal residents but she says the only way she can is either for her to marry a citizen  (were not in a rush to get married) or to wait for her sister who was born here to turn 21.   Is there another way? She went through k-12 here in the US and is going to start college soon. And she works as well.  Thank You!	No
I signed a lease on October 24th stating that my monthly would be $869, and this was the price that I had been using all year to calculate my living expenses. But, when my first month was due today the price said $979. I was shocked because that was not the price I agreed to. I went through all my documents again, and it turns out that I and the building manager signed my first lease agreement on 8/24. They sent me a second agreement on 8/25 at a higher price that I, the building manager, and my co-signer signed too. Can they do this? Am I now legally bound to the second one with an increase in price they didn’t specifically tell me about?	No
A few days ago, I was in an accident where the other driver seems to think I could be at fault for this. I was driving with no stop light or stop sign at the intersection and the other driver seems to think it was my fault.  This is the closest thing I could find that shows the type of intersection. http://imgur.com/a/8LE92 I am the blue car and the person that hit me is the white car. The only difference is there were three lanes on each side on the street going east to west.   The white car tried to cut across the lanes and crashed into my passenger side. I was in the far left lane and the white car made it across the two lanes next to me and I guess the driver expected me to let him through? Is there some law that says I should have stopped or any way I could be found even partially at fault?   And sorry if this question is better off being asked in another sub. Thanks!	No

"A year ago my roommate &amp; I cosigned a year long lease. We are both on the lease as tenants. We are in a rent-controlled apartment.   Our lease will end in 45 days and I wish to leave. However, my roommate wishes to renew.  My landlord asked me to send a written notice saying I am giving up the rights to the apartment AND the security deposit (fairly significant amount). I will need to get the security deposit from my roommate.   However, my roommate is not being forthright as to his plans on how I will get the deposit back from him or his future roommate.   Here are my conundrums:   1) Once I give up the rights to the apartment - how can I ensure that my name from the lease is removed &amp; I will not be responsible for any future damages. Would the original lease with both our names on it just terminate and he becomes the sole person responsible for damages?  2) Can I ""refuse"" to give up my rights to the deposit in my 30-day notice? Since my roommate is not being forthright, I rather the landlord just force us to vacate and him ""reapply"" for the place, etc. I do not wish to give up my rights to the deposit till I have a clear idea of how I might get it back.   Please advise."	No
From my understanding, different states have different rules regarding marriage, in all sorts of different ways. Without getting into a story that is the length of a novel, are there any major reasons why a woman marrying a terminally ill man would abruptly change plans and want to get married in Florida instead of New York? Would it change anything when the worst happens with regards to inheritance and his children?	No
I recently picked up the deposit for an apartment I had with a friend from work. We've since become not very friendly, and have barely spoken since we've moved apart. He's demanding I provide the full half of the safety deposit to him. The deposit came out to around 350 dollars. The problem is in a month he will be getting our electric deposit which comes out to around 250 dollars. He's refusing to take 50 dollars to make it even so he can just keep the deposit. And is now threatening legal action against us. So my question is does he have a leg to stand on in this?	No
Let's say I write a book about a now pretty unknown legend. The word has had various different meanings over the years. And if I ever make a movie I don't want the studio to be a dick. And take down other works people might make. What's the best way to make sure I can legally do that, before any studio  gets their hands on the script?	No

Hello - I was wondering what would be best to do in this situation. Some guy crashes into my girlfriend's car in front of our house in the middle of the night. A neighbor ended up getting the license plate number. Girlfriend only has liability insurance and her insurance company just told her they can't/won't do anything. The person left a note but ins't answering phone calls. We have his name, phone number, place of work (hopefully), and license plate number. Should we confront him at his work? or would that hurt our case. Should we file a police report or give him more time? Thanks for the help!	No
I am trying to move into an new apartment in Oregon with my emotional support cats. When I applied for the apartment, I just stated that I had one cat, which was true at the time. Since then, I have gotten a second cat, and both are accounted for to assist with an emotional disability in a letter from my mental health provider. I sent that letter to my new landlord at least a week ago. When I went in to sign the lease today, he snapped at me and said that he is very uncomfortable with me having multiple pets and that seeing the letter state multiple animals was a breach of trust and threatened that I don't want to start my lease on a bad foot. I hate conflict, so in the moment, I panicked and didn't press the issue. I just filled out an agreement for one assistance animal and went ahead and signed the rest of the lease with the landlord assuming I will only have one animal.  It is very important to me to have both cats for both my own well being as well as theirs, and my doctor agrees. My questions are: Do I have the right to argue for my second animal, and if so, how should I go about it? Is my landlord reacting appropriately? I appreciate any advice!	No
First off- I don't believe there is anything nefarious going on (such as sexual molestation).  I do have a lawyer from my past custody issues, but he is currently not on retainer.  Before I take it there, I want to know if I'm overreacting, and if the family court will even care.  I know that co-sleeping is not illegal, and it is not in violation of our current parenting plan.  I have two sons (7 and 9) and have been divorced for 5ish years.  My current issue is that my ex-husband is co-sleeping with our nine year old.  My son sees a pediatric psychiatrist for ADHD, and in mentioning it to her, she believes it's unhealthy and detrimental for his development.  I think it's also unhealthy, and given that my son is in the beginning stages of puberty (and the fact that he's not a toddler), the co-sleeping situation to me is just flat out weird.    I've been discussing this with him for months, since March 2017 that I have written proof of (we communicate via Our Family Wizard).  I understand that transitioning him to his own room can be a process, but given that it's nearly August, I feel that this process should be completed at this point.  He's full of excuses and he doesn't think it's weird or unusual in the slightest.  I believe that my ex-husband is lonely and very co-dependent on our children, which is also unhealthy.  Having my son in his room at night is likely a crutch for his emotional instability.  Will family court even address this?  Thanks.	No

GEORGIA.   Three days ago the apartment two floors above mine had a broken pipe and that apartment, the apartment above mine, and my apartment flooded. I had two inches of standing water and sagging ceiling and peeling walls.   The apartment complex brought in several industrial fans and also wet vac'd the water.  All but one room (master bedroom) in the apartment was uninhabitable during this time.   Now the apartment is saying they aren't going to compensate me for any rent, not going to replace the carpet or linoleum and MIGHT help me with the increased power bill resulting from the five industrial fans running 24/7.   I have renters insurance which will cover electronics and furniture etc but I am not sure what, if anything, the apartment complex is responsible for. Can they just leave carpet and padding that were in 2 inches of standing water?  Do they not have to compensate me somehow for the period of time that the apartment was uninhabitable?  What are my rights here?  Thank you!  TL;DR Apartment flooded. Couldn't live in it for a week. Landlord not replacing carpeting or compensating for unlivable time. Am I screwed?	No
So my ceiling fell in on my apartment in one room a couple of days ago due to a leak from the apartment upstairs. There was water damage and mold everywhere. I was contacted by property leasing and was asked if I'd like to move to another unit. Fiancé and I said that was fine if we could get movers to help move our things as the new apartment is upstairs and fiances back isn't the best and it would probably kill us both. Landlord is supplying 2 men to help us move tomorrow. We started thinking about fees to move utilities to our new apartment and contacted the property leasing company asking if we could at least pay half of our rent this month since we have to pay all of these fees and we're not in a financial place to do so. That was a no. So I asked to speak to our landlord directly, and was told that all communication had to go through the property agency. So I firmly asked to reconsider because there's absolutely nothing we could have done to have this happen and how could we be expected to stay in a unit with mold that's actively being renovated on. We were met with the fact that we're lucky they aren't charging us to switch units and that we're also lucky they didn't start renovating before we moved our things. We were also told that a landlord supplying movers was absolutely unheard of. I'm just wondering if there's anything we're able to do legally?	No
"A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him.   I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers.   The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on.   Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon.   A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design.   Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success.   We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.   We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either).   Would love some advice! Thank you in advance."	No

"Just like it says in the title our web designer has chosen to not only restrict our access from the site but has now completely taken it down.

Hello!  I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.  This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.  When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?  Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.  Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.  I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.  I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.  At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.  I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)  It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.  **tl:dr University won't accept payment via an AmeriCorps award, won't release transcript, how do I negotiate with them?**	No
"California.   Our apartment lease is no pets. Roommate has, to the best of my knowledge, an actual disability as prescribed by his therapist. He told me about this and said that his therapist recommended he get an Emotional Support Animal. He said he would handle all the paperwork side, we worked out ground rules for how the dog would be taken care of and he went to get the dog.   I found out that:  1. Roommate did not tell the landlord about the dog until discovered 2. When discovered, roommate just told landlord that the dog was an ESA 3. Landlord said fill out this form and give us a copy of the prescription to ""request"" the accommodation. Don't have the dog in residence until we accept your request.  4. Roommate filled out the form but did not provide a copy of the prescription. Landlord then specifically asked for the prescription and re-iterated that the dog cannot be in residence yet. He gave the prescription. (it is from a legit therapist, not some pet loophole site) 5. Dog has been in residence this whole time.   Care for the dog and relations with our neighbors have been smooth this whole time. To our knowledge none of them have raised any complaints to the landlord and we were clear with them that we would resolve any issues they have with the dog.   Landlord has not yet gotten back to roommate on the request paperwork. It's been over a week now. I'm worried they're prepping to evict us.   Roommate is saying that yes he screwed up but the whole process is very confusing and he's had the prescription the whole time so they can't do anything to him. He thinks that the ""dog cannot be in residence"" part isn't enforceable. Is it?   If they do try to evict over the dog, can they also evict me? Both our names are on the lease."	No
"as title says, the old landlord has not paid back deposit. it has been several months, i told him he needs to sure her, i believe it was around 400 dollars. here's some more info    *landlord is in another state, California to be exact   *the apartment was bought out i believe, but they dropped the same landlord because of ""illegal issues' i don't know the details but i can try to find out   *he has already waited a few months, and the landlord hasn't responded to him but has been taking rent from other tenants. she wont answer any of his calls.    now here's my question, can he sue  and will there be a problem since shes out of state? since he has not been paid back within a few months, can he sue for more than what was owed? i will try to get more details when i can"	No
We live in Virginia for starters. A little background I'm 24, my husband is 32. We've been together for 4 years and married for 3. We have one child together and have purchased a home while married.   He has been verbally and emotionally abusive to me for a long time now, and has cheated on me in the past. In recent events he's brought it to my attention that he's miserable and that this isn't the life he wanted for himself.   I've made it clear to him that the only thing I want out of this marriage is our daughter, I don't want spousal support, child support, none of the property. Just her.   The problem I've run into however is I currently don't have any means of acquiring any money, he's our sole bread winner.   So my question is, what the hell do I do.   I can't keep doing this with him, I'm at the end of my emotional threshold.	No
I'm trying to get on disability (height is 4'10 with a few mental disorders that have been left untreated, and 27 years old). The only diagnosis that I have are over 10 years old. It feels like I've developed another disorder as I feel like I can't go outdoors and have trouble completing my job because of this. I know that you have to have documentation of your disorders to get on disability but without insurance, I can't readily get up-to-date diagnoses. What is it that you guys recommend?	No

I want to make a clothing company that my get me into legal trouble and was wondering if I could be sued or if I'm fine. For example the company supreme has a plain white shirt that says supreme within a box, would I get in legal trouble if I made a similar shirt that said sub-par? The reason I think I will get in trouble is because The North Face company sued a company called the South Butt and switch their sign. So I just want to know if they would be able to sued?	No
I am moving out in purchased a home and my landlord has attempted to come in to show my apt. I gave them a list of days and times that are good because I work 12 hour overnights at a hospital. They tried to come in and I had the hotel lock on. They said they were going to come in even though I was sleeping and they wouldn't enter the apt. Their lawyer called me now and stated if I have the hotel lock on again or don't let them in whenever they want I will be evicted. What can I do ?	No
This crap is so confusing. I'm sorry for the long winded stuff.  In the final hearing, the judge granted that her ex husband can have the internal PC components he wants by a third party. This was granted because there is no faith that he will not damage the computer and claim no knowledge. His brother is under his guise and affiliated and related to him. Is he a true third party or is this stoppable?	No
"Short and sweet. My husband screwed around behind my back a lot in the past. I'm 9 months pregnant.  I had a bit of a moment today and texted my mother saying pretty much ""kinda wish I could Leave him I can't get over the shit""  He saw and has decided we need to do something so we are discussing a marriage consoler but he also would like to put the baby up for adoption to avoid ""getting trapped"" and child support. Is there a way to put his fears to ease and avoid him paying child support? I am some what attached to the baby by this point and have already started a nursery and have a baby shower in a week so im a bit commited. Financially if I were alone with a child I would be doomed but I will have family who will help.  He has a great paying job and doesn't want to feel like he's getting screwed.    *TL;DR* I want to ensure my husband doesnt have to pay child support in case we do divorce. Is there anything I could do?"	No
Title basically explains it.  My apartment manager has known there has been a bug problem for years.  In the winter it's not too bad but it's getting really bad this summer time around.  Me and my sister saw one each in our bedrooms now which hasn't shown up before and we're not sure what to do other then moving out which we've been saving up to do.  We want to know if we have any other options to make management take this problem seriously.  I would see them in the laundry room and the hall ways.  We see about 5-10 every morning in our bathroom and kitchen (main problem areas).  They fumigate those areas 2x every summer but I don't think it's enough because they are coming from the electrical wiring and the pipes.  I've bought electrical plugs to plug up any unused outlets but sometimes they come from side of the outlet covers that aren't sealed in.  We've probably been one of the newest tenants in the last 5 years that lived here the longest because every one else who is young has moved out within a year.  Everyone else that lives in the complex are families of 12 with 1-3x little loud dogs.	No
Location Vic/ Australia  I received a caution/ drug diversion for possession/ being under the influence of LSD along with a caution for possession of a air rifle last year (I'm young and stupid, that's a cop out but that's the truth).   I'm currently trying to apply for a working visa for Canada and for jobs. They ask about previous convictions and cautions including driving offences. I understand it's in my best interest to be truthful but I also know it could ruin my chances to mention these offences.   What I want to know is will they show up on a background check for my visa? I was told by police they wouldn't show up on police records checks for work as they are only cautions but I don't know if the visa application is more in depth.   Tl;dr received cautions in aus, will they show up on visa application for Canada?	No
I share a home in New York State with my significant other of six years. We have lived in our home for almost four years. We are not married so my SO bought the house and everything is in his name (mortgage, insurance, taxes, deed, and so on). He and I came up with an agreed upon figure that I would contribute every month towards the mortgage and expenses. The mortgage is about $1,600 every month and I contribute $700.   Because I am contributing to our home I'm starting to feel as though I should legally own part of the house. My biggest fear is that if my SO, heaven forbid, dies that I will have no legal right to our home.   Where should we start? Would it be better for my SO to leave me the house in a will?   Thanks in advance.	No
I'll start with that I'm living in Atlanta, GA. I moved here and have been living in this apartment since June. Last week the apartment complex was taken over by new management. Over the weekend I got a letter stating that starting in September my flat rate water/sewer bill is gone and in it's place will be a $46 sewage, pest control, trash, and management fee + water charge based on consumption.   The issue is that in my lease I signed for the $xx flat rate water/sewage fee and the rest was just included in the rent. Is it legal for the new management company to charge this new rate or are they breaking the lease?	No
I moved into an apartment in Kalamazoo Michigan last June, and this month my job wanted to transfer me to a different city, so I began the process of finding someone to sublease. My landlord made me aware that there had been a fire here and that's why the last tenant left. What they didn't tell me was that the fire marshall had told them that they could not legally rent this apartment because it's too close to the fence next door. There are two large fences, a chain-link and a wooden one running right along the side of the apartment. According to the mire marshall, that can't be that way if they're going to have someone living here.   Right after I renewed my lease back in March, the company that owned the building sold it to an individual, who I assume still has no idea that they/he have been renting this apartment illegally.  Now that I know this, I don't think I can go any further trying to sublease, but I'm moving at the end of the month and need to be done with this place by then.  What are my options for dealing with this?	No
Hey legal helpers, my brother-in-law just moved to the USA a week ago and is approved for his Green Card but we're still waiting for it to be sent along.  In any case, he got unexpected Misdemeanor citation when he was caught swimming at a county quarry by sheriffs in Iowa. Does anyone have any experience in guessing how this could affect his immigration status? His record is very clean excluding this one screw up.  Thank you much for any advice or ideas!	No
Hi All,  So apologies if this isn't the right place to post this, but I wasn't sure where else to turn, and didn't know if I had any legal options here.  So in a nutshell, I've been with my company for just over 3 and a half years. During that time I've had a few pay rises, but nothing too dramatic - started on £20k, year later £24k, year later £28k. I know that sounds like quite big jumps, but I've gone above and beyond for these guys - worked loads of (unpaid) hours of overtime, and considering how much I do for them, it's low for what I should be paid (many of my colleagues have told me this).  So it came to the time of year for the meeting I have to discuss my future/salary. Only this time they say they can't pay me any increase, due to changes at the company. Instead, they say they'll offer 'profit share' to us. What this meant, was a small percentage of our profits would come to me every quarter, this worked out to about £800/quarter. So not a great deal, but better than nothing. I tell them I'm invested in the company, I want to be here for the long haul, and if they can't offer me money, I'd be more than happy to take share options in the company. They didn't give me an answer on this.  Fast forward 6 months - we're told the company is being bought out. I organise a meeting to stress that I'm really due a pay rise (or share options) and stress that I don't want to start at the new place on a low salary, as that'll make me seem like a low level employee to them. They say they can't do anything until we start at the new place.   At the new place, they say we're all going to keep our jobs, and the salary will be in line with what we've had before. I'm offered £29k (so a £1k increase). Not great. My title changes from Production Manager to 'Creative Accountant Executive') - which does also feel like a step down. I'm told we'll have a meeting in the coming weeks to discuss this all, but I'm eating fed up of waiting by this point.  Anyway, we start a the new place. It's pretty cool, much the same as my last place, exact same kind of job, with some new duties. I go down the pub that night to discuss how it was for my colleagues, and they tell me something interesting - they were all offered share options in the new company (shares at a discounted cost). They got offered more depending on seniority, and if they didn't want to take them, they were offered a bonus. Admittedly, I'm the youngest of them  - the next oldest colleague has been with them just over 5 years. But he was offered in the region of £50k. Which seems a lot. Maybe I'm missing something,I don't claim to know all the details -  but should I not have been even considered for this? Do I have any legal precedent to stand on? Please advise, any help much appreciated.	No
I live in a [Mitchell-Lama](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/mitchell-lama-rentals.page) co-op.  I moved from a 2 bedroom to a 3 bedroom in 2011.  They never transferred billing of my garage fee to my new apt.  I wrote the management company &amp; CC'ed the President of the Board telling them to do so.  They didn't.  I figured screw them, I did my duty, I informed them, they ignored me.  I wash my hands of the situation.    Now 6 years later they're sending me a bill for six years of monthly fees.  My question is...do I have to pay?  Is there any kind of statute of limitations?  It is after all their job to bill me.  Their screw up, not mine.       PS:  Just so nobody thinks I'm that bad a guy...  After all, why shouldn't I pay for my garage space...  This was an incompetent, possibly corrupt Board with an utterly incompetent &amp; almost certainly corrupt management company.  They were already fighting with me on other issues.  So I felt justified not paying, if they're too incompetent to bill me, even after I brought the situation to their attention.	No
"Hello everyone, i have a question for the best minds at r/legaladvice because I don't know what to do.  Let me give you some backstory.  I live in Kentucky.  My older brother lives in Athens, Georgia.  He's had psychotic breaks twice before, both timed he gets violent and talks about how people have a death wish and how they're going to die, one time he drove a golf cart with a .30/.30 rifle and pellet gun towards a house owned by someone he just had a loud argument with before veering off to an adjacent house and busting out windows and destroying it in his rage.  This was his first episode.  The second happened on Monday, he told me he had suicidal thoughts and needed help then went dark and wouldn't answer me, come to find out he got arrested for attempting to jump out in front of traffic and told the police officers to kill him and he had no reason to live.  He was also very careful to tell them he was on acid, so they wouldn't think he was nuts (he later proudly told this to my Aunt, unprompted).  Currently he's in a mental institution for monitoring, and is to be released on Monday.  I think that my brother needs serious help, and he is refusing to do any sort of inpatient care.  He doesn't have insurance.  I can't believe that the police are letting him go after he was attempting suicide and assaulting police officers.  From what I understand that's how the system works in Athens, they're overcrowded and just try to shuttle people through the system.  He is on probation from the first incident, but just has to do call check-ins and that's it.  He was diagnosed as mentally ill and was given medication but stopped taking it.  My brother is very manipulative, and when I spoke to him last he's still on the ""pink cloud"" where everything is going great and he had a support system and is on medication and everything is going to be great.. but I'm terrified that he's lying to me and he's just going to go back to the same old habits and next time someone could get very hurt when he has one of these psychotic breaks.  He won't listen to reason.  How can, or can I even, go about getting him involuntarily committed if he hadn't really done a great act of violence yet?  As I said he's manipulative, and likely that the mental health professionals swallowed everything he told them even though it's very unlikely that he is going to follow through with this and his psychosis builds on itself until it's too much to even bear.  The living arrangement that he'd be returning back to is with another violent psychotic person, who has said that he is going to shoot my brother if he sees him again, and he still has my brother's stuff even though he's officially filed an eviction notice with the state of Athens.  I fear that Athens is going to let him go because they buy that it's just an isolated incident, buy whatever he told them and would rather do nothing so they can get someone who is ""really sick"" in that bed but I'm not buying it.  Sorry if this is jumbled up, this is just a Readers Digest version and I'm just upset about this whole thing so...  TL;DR I think my brother is being affected by relationships and the environment of Athens, including the police and they want to just let him go but I think he has a serious mental health issue and he could turn violent.  How do I go about getting him out of Athens, with state help preferably, and into a care facility he needs?  He also has no insurance and my parents are unwilling to help pay.."	No
So I'm making a short documentary, and I was wandering how to make the music.	No
Tl;dr: In Baltimore, MD, is it legal to rent my separate entrance in-law suite (with its own kitchen and its own bathroom but with one shared door that would probably remain locked on both sides)? If so, would the person be considered a roommate rather than a tenant? What legal precautions should I take to ensure this is done correctly?       Background: My husband and I recently moved into our 6 bedroom home in Baltimore City. It was a renovation, and we designed it so it can eventually be separated into two distinct residences fairly easily. Our main residence (front entrance) would be 4 bedrooms, 2.5 baths and there would also be a small 2 bedroom, 1 bath apartment with a rear entrance. To do this (not including the legal steps of getting a permit of occupancy change), we'd need to turn one door into a wall, add a wall to divide a hallway in two, and install a small kitchen in the rear living area, currently used as a large mudroom. I don't believe we need to get any further construction permits since our renovation plan, which included stub out lines gas, water, and drain lines for the future rental kitchen, was approved by the city, so we plan to do the drywall and kitchen installation ourselves.    Because we think our parents/in-laws may need this space in the future, we're less inclined to separate the space fully and keep at least one door. I believe this is (aptly) called an in-law suite. But in the meantime, we'd like to rent it to friends or other folks, maybe Air B&amp;B it, etc. So we'd like to keep the door locked on our side as well as give the tenant/roommate the option to lock the door on their side.      I understand what I'd need to do to get a legal second apartment, but I'm less familiar around what legal/contractual precautions to take for renting an in-law suite to a roommate (or if that person is still considered a tenant). I'm also not sure if the shared door locking thing is considered a violation of the housing code if the rear apartment/in law suite has their own method of egress through the back door, which would be their main entrance. The property would be owner-occupied regardless of whether it's an in-law suite or a separate apartment. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!	No
I bought my house with a substantial down payment from my mother. Part of the contingency to that was she was on the deed. So we are joint tenants even though she doesn't live here or even in state. I was not married at the time. I now am and we have two daughters together. My mother is borderline psychotic and I am concerned that if something happens to me before her she will kick out my husband and daughters from our family home.   Can a will override the entire property going to her?  What about her will to her husband if she passes and her will states all her real property pass to him will he inherit half of my home?   What options do I have?	No
"In January 2017, I gave my landlord 30 (at least if not a few days extra) day notice that I was moving out in the third week of February 2017. The management office stated that they would only charge me part of the rent for Feb. I even called the office a week before Feb to ensure that they would be charging me the agreed upon amount  for; I have automatic withdrawn for rent. Come February they took out the full amount of rent. I called the management office, they said that they would cut me a reimbursement check. Here I am in July and still haven't received my reimbursement. I have called once a month with the same response ""Oops, not sure what happened. We will send the check in the mail"". It's only $90 but it's the principal and it's owed to me. Other than continuing to call them, can I do anything else or should I forfeit the money and move on?"	No
Hi r/legaladvice!   Here's a complicated issue for you all. This is regarding my aunt and uncle, and my aunt has to make a decision regarding a forbearance agreement by the middle of August. I've tried to keep the explanation succinct and impersonal.  There are 3 important parties in this discussion. Company, Partner A (Anna) and Partner B (Bob). Anna &amp; Bob are getting a divorce after 20+ years of marriage. The company was started by Bob, but Anna has signing rights. Bob has become an expat and has essentially dumped the failing company onto the company executives and Anna.  Company has been struggling for the past 10 years, and losing money. A unknown number of years ago (between 5 and 10) a loan of 1M was taken out for the company. The collateral was the family home. This was the only home at the time.  Now, Bob lives in [expat country] in a house that was purchased by both Anna and Bob but the house is listed only under Bob's name. Anna lives in Canada in the family home. Divorce agreements were set up such that Bob would keep the expat house and Anna would keep the Canadian house.  A couple of weeks ago, the bank decided that the company was too much of a liability and sent the executives a forbearance agreement. The forbearance asked for 600,000$ against Anna's family home. The company must prove that they are doing better by February or the bank will seize the house as payment. Note that the husband (bob) is not risking his own home and that Anna would not receive any money from the home since it is in his name.  Please advise! Anna doesn't know if she should sign this forbearance or not. Either, Anna doesn't sign and the bank could sell the house and she would receive approximately 900,000 after the bank takes what is owed. She would then need to split that with her husband. If she signs the forbearance than the company *might* do well in the next 6 months, OR the house might need to be sold in February and she would get half of 400,000.  Any advise regarding any of these things would be greatly appreciated.	No

Hello,  As the title says, I am on my ex (husband's) insurance plan as a dependent. I am not able to get onto a different health insurance plan without cancelling this one. They say that only the primary account holder can have me removed from the plan, but my ex and I are not on speaking terms. Is this legal? Do I really have no say in this? I live in Canada, btw.  Thanks in advance...	No
"I noticed that my LL is getting mail from companies that assist in foreclosures on the outside of the envelope (We live in the same house and 1 mailbox). I looked up the house it looks like they were issued a ""Notice of Lis Pendens"" on March 2017.   He hasn't told me anything and I am wondering if I should get ready to move out. I'm about to buy a house that is going to close in 60-90 days. How long does it usually take to get into foreclosure status and do you think the LL will ask me to leave soon? I don't want to get movers twice."	No
I had a monthly parking service with Impark and I no longer needed to use their parking lot after April. I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.   I didn't deal with it right away because I had to go on vacation 1.5 months. Now that I'm back, I see that they have added on even more additional charges. On top of the $93.25, they also added on $50 (rejected payment charge) + $30 (late admin fee)+ $1.5 (tax) for the months of June and July. Now they say that I owe them $174.75 or my debt will be collected by a collection agency and will affect my credit.    I find it absurd that I have to pay $174.75 when I haven't parked in their parking lot since I cancelled at the end of April. Is there any way I can dispute this or will I have to pay them the money?	No
As stated I'm having to go in tomorrow at 5 am for an emergency procedure. I had today off, and just left the doctors where I found out. I haven't told my job yet. I'm a front office manager at a hotel.   Normally I wouldn't be too worried, but I'm concerned due to the fact we've just gotten a new general manager, who for lack of better words is a complete idiot. He can't do ANYTHING by himself. He's only been at our property for less than a week. No one on the property really knows how to do what I do on a daily basis. This is what I'm concerned about. I'm concerned since I will be out for a minimum of two weeks- they will replace me. Especially seeing as this is going to make everyone's lives really difficult.  How should I handle this situation with my employer and do I have any rights? All our handbook states is if you require more than three days off you need a doctors note.	No
Hi,  My question has to deal with being unpaid during a medical accommodation request.  Backstory: I had been out of work with severe migraines from April 4th through June 21st when my neurologist cleared me to return to work, but with a work from home stipulation to deal with my chronic migraines more efficiently.  Since the 21st HR has been processing my accommodation to work from home and I have been told that I can not work until it is complete.  I am an hourly employee and the company that pays medical leave stopped paying me the day I got a doctor note saying I could come back to work.  In their eyes I'm cleared to work, but my company won't pay me for this time.  I work for a large Silicon Valley [United Sates] tech company and have not been paid in over three weeks despite me being able to physically work.    Is this legal? Is there anything that I can do here?  Let me know if you need further information.  Thanks in advance!	No
She asked for all original copies so she could bring them to wherever and have them copied. She said I wouldn't have to sign anything and it would be fine, because they just need proof that the person coming here knows a citizen from America.  This seemed really sketchy to me, 1 because I haven't known them THAT long... and 2 - she asked not to tell my mom (who keeps all of those documents for me) and lie to her and say that it was for work purposes.  My question is - is this as sketchy as I think it is? My mom told me it was definitely not OK to give those documents over and not to 'vouch' for anyone coming especially someone I don't know.  What are your thoughts?	No
"I moved into a house several months ago and on account of having cash upfront, the landlord did not run a background check or check my credit, nor did I sign anything permitting him to do so. He doesn't have my social security number and didn't ask for any identifying information, so I could be John Doe instead of Joseph Doe, for all he knows, though I'm not.  There have been problems getting him to repair anything in a timely and correct manner. He commented that I ""have a problem with everyone"" and referenced a suit I'm named in; It's a class action lawsuit that I was invited to join and an issue with a company and their business practices, not an individual, so it barely has any relevance. I asked how he knew about it and he said that ""he has a guy.""  I know that background checks etc. can be run at the inception of tenancy, but the lawsuit was filed about three months after I moved in. Is he allowed to essentially keep a tab on me, or does it not matter since, if you search the Court Index, you can find my name listed as a plaintiff, and it's therefore considered public information?   Thanks for any help."	No

"I live in Texas first of all. My 5 year-old son just told me that he ""snuggles"" and sometimes co-sleeps (my language, not his) with his stepfather. He also told me this happens nearly every morning after his mom goes to work and that his stepfather is only wearing underwear while they're under the covers. Apparently, they also watch videos or play games on his phone in this state.  He continued to say that he sleeps between them some nights and his mom is ""totally naked"". I'm more than a little disturbed by all of this. He sleeps in his own bed 100% of the time when he's with me, which is 50/50 on a week on week off basis. Clearly he doesn't ""need"" this.   Where does the law/judges/cps stand on this behavior? It seems like alienation at the very least to me."	No
My soon to be ex husband came over and took my tv. (Were separated) I said no and was blocking the tv. He kicked me in the stomach and punched me in the arm to shove me away and grabbed the tv. I grabbed his shirt as he was leaving and it tore. He said great now when you call the cops it will look like you attacked me and you'll be arrested. He did this all in front of our 3 yr old son. What can I do? If anything. I didn't touch him (besides grabbing his shirt). 	No
"I am working in New York at a college and I recently enlisted in the Army National Guard. I am being sent for basic training a few months from now and because of basic and AIT combined I will be gone for upwards of 6 months. Now everyone including my boss has been in the loop about this since before I even went to MEPS and no issues or objections to it. I have given them the notice of my ship date which again is a few months from now and I know under USERRA notice has to be 30+ days before shipping or asap which I have done. Now I feel as if the closer my ship date comes I am experiencing hostility from co-workers/boss saying things like ""really? you have to go in the fall when the school year is extremely busy? it kind of screws us while your gone 6 months is a long time"" and stuff like that. I am a hard worker and I love my job but my biggest fear is them replacing me while im gone (which I know they cant do under USERRA) and just saying some other reason to fire me when deep down its cause me being gone is that bad. So does USERRA protect against unemployment AND reprimand? Because it seems kinda ridiculous I have to deal with this every day when Im making a huge life choice/sacrifice."	No
I rent a room/bathroom in company housing. I have a month-to-month rental agreement which specifies the room I'm staying in, and indicates that they must give 30-days notice to terminate the agreement (unless I fail to pay rent, in which case 14-days).  In a couple weeks, my company is having a big meeting with people from other offices, and needs to provide housing for these people. I've been informed that they want me to move to a smaller room, so they can provide my room for someone. I have one week to move. It's a hassle, as all my belongings are here, and I'd have to make a project of moving twice in as many weeks.  I believe they are not legally required to force me to leave, but I'm concerned that they could terminate my housing contract (or my employment) if I refused. I'm not sure what to do.  My state is one-party consent for recording, so I'm considering recording any future talk I have about this.	No

"Long story short, we held off on filing the eviction notice and was kind enough to give him until Sept 1st to move out, or else be evicted by the Sheriffs.   Well now his dad decided to type out a letter (HIS agreements, nothing from a law office), along with a $1,000 that ""if deposited then you agree to these terms."" Now we are moving forward with the eviction notice.   Question 1: I'm not depositing the check and I want to send it back to the address listed on the check. Do I need to cross out whatever is written on the check and write ""void"" in its place?   Question 2: Would I need to have the Sheriff put the eviction notice on his bedroom door? Roommate comes in through the garage and won't notice anything on the front door."	No
This is a follow-up to a post I previously made here but have since deleted. Basically, I signed a lease with a student apartment electronically last week. Someone from their office called me an hour later and told me they ran out of spots and that he would add me to a wait list. I received a rent reminder later that day and I called after that to ask them why I was going to be held accountable for paying rent when they said they ran out of spots. The girl who answered told me they don't cancel leases and I would need to fill out a relet form. I explained that I signed another lease because their office told me they ran out of spots, and I was not going to pay for a unit I don't have. She asked me my name and confirmed that I had not been assigned a unit. She said to call the next day at noon and speak to a manager about the situation, because she was new and didn't know what else to tell me.    So I called the following day and asked for a manager. I explain the situation to him and ask to terminate my lease. He say they don't cancel leases and I need to fill out a relet form, and that he'd email me one. I try to explain the situation again, reiterating that I was not going to pay for something I don't have, but he said there was nothing he could do. So I got off the phone. I explained the situation later to my dad and he called up there himself. After making a big fuss, the leasing manager sent him a relet form as well, because she said they can't cancel leases, but said she'd waive the fee if they found someone.    I email the first manager and ask why I was put on the wait list if there was a spot available for me. He says that I was told I was the last unit when I signed (which there is no evidence of, no phone calls, emails, or voicemails BUT I do have a voicemail of the guy from their office that told me there was no spots left). I also signed the lease electronically, so how was I told this when I signed? Either way, I send in the relet form and have been trying ever since to find someone to relet/sublease my apartment to in case they don't find anyone.    Today is the day my rent would have been due so I know I'm not late in paying them, had they not found someone. But an hour or so ago I get a message from Adobe sign (what I used to electronically sign the lease) that said:    &gt; Lease from [Apartment Complex] Agreement Exchange Cancelled. I have cancelled the agreement exchange for Lease from [Apartment Complex] even though you have already completed and returned it. This transaction has been terminated by Adobe Sign and the document has been removed from our Adobe Sign accounts. No further steps are required on your part.    I emailed the apartment complex to get an explanation because I'm not sure what this means, but I haven't gotten an answer yet. So now I'm just trying to figure out if my lease has been terminated or not, and if they're still going to hold me accountable for my rent? I don't think this was cancelled because I didn't pay yet, because the rent is due on the 1st and isn't considered late until the 4th. But they haven't given me any notification of any sort before this that they intended to cancel the lease, only that they would try and replace me with someone and if not, I was responsible for the lease.    Sorry that this is so long but this has been giving me a lot of anxiety this past week. And I have to make sure this is finished, because I explained the situation to the other apartment complex and they are willing to let me sublease in case I am held accountable by the other apartment complex but they need to know ASAP if I need to sublease or not.	No
We moved into an apartment in the middle of summer and on the second day I received a call from maintainance stating that they knew the AC was broken but they were not sure if the office had let us know but they were working on it. It has not been a week and 3 days and still, no AC. In addition to the AC our screen door is also broken, so air flow has been minimal. We have a upstairs room with a  vaulted ceiling and it has been a miserable sauna. What can I do?	No
"To preface this with a little bit of background, I have chronic migraines where I frequently get to deal with going temporarily blind, followed by several hours of excruciating pain worsened by light or sound. It sucks, but it's the hand I was dealt. Migraines, while often seemingly random, are triggered by several things for me, most notably by strobing or flickering lights and by cinnamon.   I moved recently into a new apartment close to my college campus, where the lease guarantees me the use of three assigned parking spots in a garage underneath the apartment complex. When I moved in I noticed that there were 5-6 flickering lights inside the apartment complex's garage, and I quickly called the property management company to ask if they could please fix the lights, even just by removing the ones that flickered if replacement was too costly. I called the property management company on August 3rd, and received a text from them that same day indicating that the lights would be fixed by this last Monday (August 7th). While this was slower than I would've hoped for such a simple fix, it wasn't entirely unexpected and I resigned myself to wait.   Monday the 7th came and went with no update from the property manager and no fix for the strobing lights. I asked for an update and received none. I had experienced two migraines that can be directly attributed to the lights (aura started immediately after being in the garage), but they were in the evening and I just dealt with them while I waited. On Tuesday evening the lights in the garage triggered another migraine, and I called to try and get an update on the light situation and got nothing but a voicemail. This morning I woke up to drive to work and hadn't even gotten my car out of the garage before the aura began, meaning I couldn't go to work for at least half a day (I'm preparing to leave for work when I finish writing this). This problem is costing me time and money, because each time I have a migraine I have to take two pills that cost cost over $100 each (Treximet, average price of $927 for 9 tablets) and I have currently lost $89.40 in wages for today (4 hours at $22.35 an hour). I cannot have this problem continue, for the sake of my financials and my sanity, but the landlord texted  me this morning with a real gem.  ""I do not have an exact day or time for the lights in the garage at this time.""  Understandably I was pretty upset by that and texted her to say it would be unacceptable and that a more rapid remedy was necessary. It's been almost an entire week (this is the 5th business day since my complaint) and they still can't even remove 6 light bulbs?  Her response:  ""No, I will not meet that demand. You do not have control over the building or the HOA. You are free to park street side.""  She suggests that I park street side, where there is only very rarely available parking (college town, right next to a college campus) and where my car and its contents are sitting out in plain view rather than sitting protected in a garage. I cannot park outside because, having gone for a short walk, there are no spots available on the entire street while my lease guarantees me a spot in the garage.   According to hud.gov, it would appear as though the property management company has to make reasonable accommodations for a person with a disability (chronic migraines count, and I am registered with my college's office of disability services): [link here](https://portal.hud.gov/hudportal/HUD?src=/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/disabilities/inhousing). I think that asking that flickering light bulbs be at least removed, even if not replaced, is more than reasonable.   At this point I'm at my wits end. I'm considering contacting the office of disability services for my college to see if they can provide me with any help to try and get this problem fixed any faster. I just want to know if I'm being unreasonable with all this, and if anyone has any advice that might help me more than trying to get someone else to step up to bat for me since the property management company refuses to listen to me. I'd also like to know if I have any grounds for a civil suit to reclaim my lost wages and the (so far) $400+ cost of medication that has been incurred just past the date they said it would be fixed."	No
"5 years ago my step father and mother helped me get a mortgage for a farm business I started, somewhere in the purchase process it went from a Co-signer arrangement to my step father alone being the only one on the note.     However, we had an written agreement that he was just the intermediary of the property and it was a rent to own with a term of 30 years or until the mortgage was paid off.  I never pressed the issue for them to sign it as I was young and trusting, but they did make changes and return via email in the email stating ""Your mother and I are very comfortable with how this reads"".    Three years later, as agreed upon that if the first document jeopardized the good health of the business we would amend it, so I  presented a second contract that re-iterated the language in the first at that they verbally agreed and gave me enough reassurance that I proceeded with remodels and the creation of our bed and breakfast.   At this point I have spent 50k in improvements. remodels, landscaping and ect, most of which I did myself.  We are almost finished with the remodels for our bed and breakfast and were scheduled to open July 1st.    Now they are claiming that the first agreement is void due to some weird dates they defined as the term of the operating agents of the business and they are attempting an unjust eviction at the moment.   They presented a crazy lease, that tripled my rents and would have tricked me into surrendering the property and all my possessions, I refused to sign and stated my reasoning being that I cannot agree to theft.  A day later out of retaliation, they came up with the Sheriff and served what I believe to be a fraudulent ""Notice to Quit"".  In the notice they claim I must surrender all my property, and that my tenancy was only for 6 months.  (Pretty sure this is no good for them)  My question is, is their case history of promissory estoppel being upheld in a real estate transaction.  In addition, the language of our agreement stated it was to be a transfer not a sale.    I do not see how there is any way for them to pay me for the damages they have caused without selling the property (I believe they are broke and desperate).   This would additionally breach our agreement as we agreed that this land was not to be sold back to any banks.    Thanks,"	No

"Family lawyers of Reddit (or anyone that can help or advise.). I was in a relationship with a Spanish girl 5 years ago, I am in the UK, she became pregnant almost immediately or so I thought. When we went for a scan they said the she was 12 weeks pregnant but I had only known her for 9 weeks. Things soon started to fall apart between but obviously I wanted to find out if I had a child and obviously to be there for it and support it. Despite several attempts by myself and family members to get her to agree to a paternity test she flat out refused and ultimately asked me to leave her alone. A lawyer at the time said you would be surprised how often this happens and we all assumed that there was a high chance that the child isn't mine. 5 years later, this week she gets in touch with me. Saying we need to speak about our daughter. I of course reply and ask if she is now willing to consent to the paternity test, she agrees initially. I start to organize it with her between the two countries. Then she starts to flip out, saying that I will doctor the results so that it is negative (not something I would ever do I just want an answer and to be there for my child if they are mine). She then starts the familiar insults and randomness of old. ""Maybe it's better if we don't have proof."" ""She looks like you."" ""I will tell her you want nothing to do with her."" I repeatedly ask her if she will consent to the paternity test to which I get a no, a maybe, you haven't asked about her or for more photos (a route I'm trying not go down until I know and I think that she's trying to trap me emotionally) and then I ask one last time urging her to think about the child and not her pride and to drop the insults and negativity and I get no reply, it's been about 7 hours. Now yes it certainly looks like she's not sure if I'm the father, maybe knows that I'm not or has something else to hide. But ultimately I just want to know, what actions can I take, if any, as a potential father to get a paternity test agreed to or enforced. How would me being in the UK and mother and child in Spain make this more difficult? Thank you in advance for your comments and help."	No
"Short  backstory: My husband has a 9 year old son from a previous marriage.  He and his ex-wife have joint custody, but due to the distance between our houses, we see his son every other weekend during the school year and every weekend in the summer. He and his ex-wife are amicable and co-parent without problems. His family hates the ex-wife and have been at odds with her since they were engaged. We all live in different suburbs of a city that straddles two different states; the ex-wife and his family live in one state and we live in the other. We're all about a half hour drive from one another.   A few months ago, I received a panicked call from my husband's aunt stating that she had filed a suit in family court for full custody of his son, alleging that his son had been abused over the past nine years and was in urgent danger for suicidal ideations. She also said she had attempted to get emergency sole custody and was denied. The only reason she was telling me this was because a guardian ad litem had been appointed and he was asking where his son was. She was worried he was going to remove our son from his mother's home and place him in DFS care, and she wanted us to know.   My first question was 1) what made her think our son was suicidal, 2) if she felt this way, why wouldn't she either tell us this so we could take action, and 3) why didn't she file to have my husband and I take custody, as a third-party suit seemed unnecessary when there was a perfectly good set of parents available to take over.   Her answers were: 1) she said that while showing her and another aunt Minecraft, our son got upset that he had made a mistake and then said, ""It's no big deal, because if I mess up again I can just kill my character and start over.""  2) She felt like if she told us we wouldn't take it seriously, and 3) She claims she had asked if we could be given sole custody and the courts said no, because we had moved across state lines (with his ex's permission).   Since then the situation has gone from baffling to very hostile.  The aunt forwarded us her suit, expecting us to give our blessing to this. Her filing was filled with a large number of exaggerated events, things completely unrelated to our son (he has step-siblings who live with his mom as well, and about half of the allegations were about them), several of the allegations had already been written off as unsubstantiated or no evidence by DFS (she has sent them to the ex's home 4-5 times over the last nine years; the first three times the social worker said there was absolutely nothing to investigate, and the last couple of times they refused to even go to the house), and the rest were based in misunderstandings that would be been easily cleared up if they had talked to one of us before freaking out.   My husband has talked to the guardian ad litem, they've all been in front of the judge twice, and we have been encouraged to get our own lawyer even though no one has really involved my husband in the suit beyond asking him what he thought about the situation.  His ex-wife's lawyer feels there is a case for a harassment suit and is recommending an order of protection when this is all done.  The judge was very harsh with his aunt (used to be a lawyer and is acting pro se in the suit) and told her to stop being melodramatic and working outside of the scope our son and his current situation.   The GAL said at the last court hearing there wasn't much else to do except ask some follow-up questions at our son's school once teachers are back. We felt like everything was pretty much wrapped up.   Throughout all this, both of the aunts have been texting us and emailing the GAL asking for access to my stepson as well my daughter from a previous relationship. We have stated several times that we'd like to wrap up the court case and get guidelines from the judge as to how to proceed with visitation.  Our son has been having panic attacks since being interviewed by the GAL because he's worried he'll never see him mom again, he's aware the suit was brought by his aunts, and that his aunts have mentioned his mom was a bad parent.  My husband and I feel like them seeing him now would really mess him up.  We've tried to explain this, but they say we're just being vindictive by withholding the children from them.   In our last exchange, his aunt who filed the suit said the GAL had told her things were working in her favor and that we were delusional if we felt like things would stay the same.  Prior to this I felt like this last round of interviews and the upcoming court case were formalities, but now I'm kind of worried.   I guess my questions are the following:   1) Can third party custody be granted in a case where there's a perfectly good set of parents available?   2) Is it true that we can't be granted full l custody bc we crossed state lines?   3) Can a petitioner asking pro se get information from the GAL that wasn't also given to us?   Note: We've seen a lawyer, but she won't talk further to us until we pay her initial fee, which we're doing tomorrow. This is more to set my mind at ease than to direct action.  Thank you in advance for any advice you have!"	No
Hello, I entered into an illegal sublet agreement with the lease holder in February, 2017 who had taken a security deposit and overcharged us on bills. However, while moving in we were notified by the landlord that the lease holder had no permission to do this and we signed under a new sublet agreement with the landlord with an additional deposit.  We had to end our sublet earlier than the termination date and the lease holder doesn't want to come back to finish her lease, wants us to remove all of her furniture and items, and is refusing to give back our security deposit.   We found out about the bills when we found out from the landlord that the rent is $400 cheaper than what the lease holder demanded, but after discussing with her we relented to just paying her that amount, even without proof of receipts. Stupid, I know, but I was naive and she was adamant and pregnant so we just dropped it.   Can we sue them for the overpaid bills and the lack of security deposit or is it null because we signed into a sublet with the landlord? As a subletter am I responsible for terminating the sublet early? I have the lease agreement (with the landlord because I'm assuming the one signed with the lease holder is void) and to me it seems like there isn't a clause about such an event except for one part which I'm not sure if it says that I am the responsible one for the termination or if it is the lease holder's responsibility. From websites I've looked at it seems that it's not the subletter responsibility.  Other than ending early, we've been as helpful as we can and the landlord initially told us she empathized with us and that she would give back our additional security we had given to management, but now I think that the lease holder lied to her and now the landlord is saying she can't guarantee it. They've been coming in and out with repairmen and showing the apartment while we've been here busy packing so it's been a bit of a bother as well.  We're both not well off financially so I don't know how much it would cost to sue or how we can go about getting our security back, if we even can.  Very sorry about the long wall of text. Any information and advice would be greatly appreciated, thanks.	No
So, I'm probably about to take a position as a server and wanted to know how paying child and tips works. I know I can expect normal garnishment from my check, but I want to be able to get ahead and put a good dent in my back owed.	No
I'm considering leaving my husband. I go back and forth on that issue, but one of the biggest points of consideration is that I am a stay at home mom and we live in Hawaii. There is zero chance I would be able to leave him and find a job that pays enough here for me to afford a place for my son and I. Even with child support, it simply isn't attainable or would be a quality of life I would want for us. I would really like to move back to the mainland. I'm not sure where yet; it will depend on where I find work.   Will I get into legal trouble if I move to another state with our son without my husband?	No
I became in a dispute with an apartment complex manager about late payments. she took me to court and the 2 attorneys, her and mine, made a stipulation that the judge endorsed and we both signed. I paid the amount of the stipulation. 6 months later, a collection company calls me, stating that I owe that apartment complex another set amount. I checked the amount and found out they increased the daily rent and are attempted to get more money out of me. I am wondering what I can do about this. Thanks!	No
For the last 5 months my paycheck have been arriving late. By a week or more.  I have proof that they were later for the past 2 months.  What can I do?  It's hard to make and keep a budget.  	No
I've had this great and unique idea for a business for a while, and i want to pursue it later in my life when i actually have the capital to do so. But right now i'm a broke intern, and i want to have some sort of protection on it. Is this possible at all?	No
My old roommate (lease ended on 6/9)is threatening to bring me to civil court. I moved out on 4/9 because I purchased a house but continued to make monthly payments for two months because she refused to sign the new lease with the sub letter who she initially agreed on. When she moved out she raked up $1200 in damages to the master bedroom that she occupied and she wants me to pay half of it....this does not seem particularly fair to me since I did not occupy the master bedroom and already fulfilled my legal  obligation to pay half the rent when she refused to sign the new lease for the sub-letter...help?  Also can she even serve me papers now if the bill is not due for another month? 	No
"My boyfriend and I have rented an apartment for the past year, and it's been a terrible experience.   To name a few issues to establish a feeling of our stay: we've made multiple noise complaints because the neighbors downstairs have family parties that have very loud music playing with all their doors and windows open that last until late hours of the night. Management told us no one else complains and that it used to be worse, so basically deal with it. Those same neighbors have confronted us multiple times and even left a note taped to our patio that they are calling the cops because they believe we throw trash onto their balcony. We never did. We don't even use our balcony. Management then told us she's diabetic or something and gets moody so ignore it.   The whole place is also horribly infested with cockroaches and nothing we did ever helped.   We did not get along with the maintenance people because they entered our patio without telling us a few times to do some work on the lights and also threw away a box I had up there when they did work on the lights. Once I caught one of them I caught looking into our bathroom window when I was home alone (no proof they were just working on the wall. Just creepy because I looked up, made eye contact and he suddenly left). We weren't friendly after that but not malicious either.   Also the landlord was always incredibly nosy and once entered our apartment without prior notice while we were in the bedroom doing things. When confronted she said she put the wrong paper under our door and just had to come in and get it. However she was in there for at least three minutes. I believe it could be longer because we didn't hear the door open. We heard our things being moved around. We were freaked out and didn't come out until she left.   Also the building is very old, so they're always under construction. When a yearly inspection was done, we were instructed not to talk about any issues to the people coming out to evaluate. The water is frequently turned off. The whole building is shifting, and our walls developed cracks while we lived there too. We didn't expect much. It's a bad area and cheaper than most places we could get into. We needed to move quickly and settled.   So here's where I need advice. Yesterday my boyfriend and I were moving furniture. We moved a few items (couches and futon) by the dumpster because we didn't need them. We have seen other tenants do this previously, but obviously just because everyone else is doing it doesn't make it right. A maintenance worker approached us as we were nearly finished saying to dump it up front, which yes is illegal. We said okay. We loaded some stuff onto our truck. We put the cushions and smaller item into the dumpster, which filled it up. The other things we would move later because we needed a break. So as we're leaving, another guy comes up and tells us again. We say ""yeah later we will; we were informed."" We leave to go drop our stuff off.   As we're coming back, we get a long email. It says that we were being fined for an hour of labor because they the maintenance guys moved the stuff back to the patio, for a fee to get the bulky items removed, and for a broken step to be repaired. Now this step was actually cracked before we got there. I have no photo evidence of that. It partially broke off as I was walking down WITHOUT furniture. I slipped a bit, but I have no injuries besides a preexisting injury hurting a little more than usual. However it doesn't look like I was hurt like no bruises or scratches. I took a photo where you can see it had been previously repaired because the part that didn't break off has a cemented over crack. Another lady is actually the person that broke the rest off and kicked the pieces down. However when we called the landlord, she said it was our fault because we hadn't used a dolly to carry couches down the stairs. Not sure how we would do that but okay. She said she had photo evidence of the items near and in the dumpster and that it obviously looked like we had dropped furniture on the step causing it to break. She said we only conveniently mentioned it broke before we carried furniture down it after being accused. It looks like a huge he said she said though because their story seems likely even though it didn't happen like that.   I went back today and all that was carried back up to the patio was cushions and the futon, not even everything. We arranged for bulky item pick up on Thursday. I also read over our lease and there's a clause that states we have to follow all rules they make and another saying if either party sues we have to pay up to $500 for their attorney fees.  So basically should I sue over it or suck it up and pay the fees? Because I understand that I probably can be charged for putting the furniture in the back even though I didn't really know. It still was our bad putting it back there. At the same time though we didn't break the step. The landlord is refusing to work with us, and since we already have a bad relationship with them, I don't think they will work with is. She hung up on us saying we were being uncivil for saying we're going to consult with a lawyer and that we didn't break anything and would have removed the items. Also if we sue we have to pay for their fees. This is a horrible situation and I still don't know the cost. We haven't even had a pre-move out inspection yet. I think they're going to try to screw us as much as they can. Do I have options?   If anything is unclear I can answer more in the comments. I have the emails of noise complaints, but most of the follow ups from management were verbal. I have a photo of the stairs partially broken. I have a photo of them repairing the stairs. I have a photo of half our items on the balcony."	No
"I went to a big box store and parked. When I got out I was stuck between two large SUV which limited my view going back. I honestly slowly went back when a car blasted their horn and sped. I would say around me but at no time were we closer than 8 feet. I let it go I did not even honk back or give them the finger or yell anything to them.  I had already put my windows down because the temperature was only ~80 degrees. My mistake. I happened to use the same exit as that person because there are only really two ways to get out.  I left at least one car space probably more. The passenger gets out of the car. Cars are coming into the big box store so I cannot go around. I am blocked on the right by a sidewalk and the passenger coming at me. There are cars already behind me.  The guy comes at me with fists drawn and in a threatening manner already yelling ""I am going to kick your fucking ass."" I panic and remembered I had pepper spray. I fumble for it as he is already at my car screaming. I yell ""GO back to your car"" at least 4 times and he takes a swipe at me and then spits at me right into my face and eye. I spray the pepper spray directly into his face. He immediately walks away and then his wife (driver of car) starts screaming at me. I call 911 the moment the situation was calmer.  He and she are screaming at me. I finally close my window (I forgot to do that) The police are there in about two minutes which is really quick. I tell my story. The other guy is warned to stay over there cause he keeps trying to get close to me. The police tell me that his story does not make sense and to tell me my story twice now. 4 more officers come. I tell them each and they warned me that I might be arrested because pepper spray is ""illegal"" in new jersey and that ""spitting does not constitute an assault""  Luckily a supervisor says that my pepper spray (bought on amazon which limits which size I can buy in my state) is legal and that spitting does constitute an assault or something else. I was still quite amped up to understand exactly what he said.  At the end, all of the officers told me had it happened to them they would have done the same or even more (one officer said I would have beat the living shit out of him) But they gave me my license, my pepper spray back, and a police report number no ticket was issued to me. I am not sure of the other person.  They said that the passenger already said that he will be pressing charges against me. The police told me at 9 am Monday to go to the police station pick up the police report and file charges against the passenger.  I would like to know what am I facing? Can I use a self defense claim? I never left the vehicle, he came into my vehicle trying to punch me and spit into my face.  What would I counter charge him with? Can I press charges against the driver of the vehicle as well as she preventing me from leaving.  Was anything I did illegal?"	No
Question. Me and my ex got divorce about 7 years ago. In the MSA, she got the house.  The title/ deed and mortgage are still both still in my name. She wants me just sign the deed over so she can refinance, but I don't trust just signing over the deed without her promising to payoff the existing mortgage and releasing me from liability to the house and mortgage.  Do I need any other paperwork or is the MSA and deed transfer enough?	No
I'll preface this by saying I've been ticketed for this before, went to court, did a day's community service, wiped my hands of it. So recently I was at a park drinking, some officers came around and ticketed me. Especially since I only thought it was a ticketable offense, mixed with the fact that it was dark out, me and my friends were not yelling or playing music, I stuck around after the cops left. Not even a half hour later some new cops came around and arrested me, telling me I shoulda listened the first time around. Now I'm facing a real court date.   Will they probably just give me a ticket in court or am I facing a real problem here? I had no other charges in the system when I left (I double checked). Should I get a lawyer? This is my first arrest ever so I have no idea how to handle this.	No
"I'm considering suing my doctor for medical malpractice. This doctor works out of  ""Clinic Name LLC.""  What do I need to know in regards to the LLC at the end of the clinic name? Does this mean I cannot sue him for malpractice or is he protected from lawsuits because he works at this clinic?"	No
Long story but here is the short version.  17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.   He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	No
So about 4 days ago my first born was well, born. He was born at home with no health issues although mama had to go to the hospital for a hematoma that was ironed out in no time. After we got home we both had been up at this point for about 40+ hours and were exhausted. He had passed his 24 hour visit with no issues and we were just about ready for bed when my SO asked if his hands were blue. I had told her they looked red if maybe a teensy bit blue and we decided to go to the ER for our new parental Paranoia, after telling them this they brought him to the NICU and said they needed blood, some pee and a 48 hour watch. Obviously we didn't want to but we waited the 48 and as we were relaxing my SO was holding the baby in the chair and he had been angled funny and lost his breath from his head being against the his chest. The doctor knew this but it was shift change so she communicated it to our new doctor, he says 5 more days are necessary even though my baby has been told he's healthy, a good eater, and clean of any infections. Do we really have to wait the 5 days or can we do an alternative and leave. I know AMA isn't allowed but is there any other way?	No
I'm in the middle of getting my flight (China Eastern from US to Japan) cancelled in order to attend my great grandmother's funeral. In order to get the full refund, they're asking for legal proof of relation in addition to the death certificate since we don't have the same last name. Her grandson (my father) doesn't have the same last name either. Any tips for how to go about this? When I google I only see stuff about immigration.	No
