I found my name on the FCC website and my real name with my real address has a comment on it saying I do not support net neutrality. It is the same spam-botted message with many other fake comments. I emailed FCC and they haven't responded. Please someone help me, I am all for NN and this is blatantly stealing my identity for supporting something I do not believe in. Can i take it this to court?  I am from New york!	Yes
"Hi Reddit Lawyers. I need some advice on my case. Backstory:  April 2016- I injured my hamate bone, fracturing the hook. I did not know this until May, when pain persisted and I went to an Ortho. I had X-rays and an MRI to confirm the fracture. My ortho elected to wait for the bone to heal. Fast forward to July. Still have pain, went back to the same ortho but with a hand specialist. He also had me wait and did not perform an excision. By August, the pain was still there and I would not heal. After X-rays and a CT, we decided to excise the hamate hook. (I was told I could immediately get back to sports and life as soon as the incision healed, but that story kept changing as I followed up the procedure and had pain. Being told I could participate quickly is something for another time).  After waiting a few months with no activity, my wrist was feeling ""better."" I was not having the same pain. On July 3rd, the same pain came back. After X-rays, MRI, and CT, it was shown that my hamate hook was still there. Only half was removed. The same fracture site existed with only the tip missing in the images. I went to a new ortho and recently had the rest removed.   The standard of care for this injury is to excise the hook immediately based on my research. Non union rates of the fracture are as high as 90%. My new ortho also said that they do not even talk about letting it heal, that went out of date 20 years ago. The go to is excision. This is also coupled with the fact that the surgeon stated he removed the entire hook in the op report. He ""completely"" removed it and said he examined the fracture site- something not possible because the original fracture was still there. Apparently, all he did was cut the tip of the bone off. This, obviously, caused me to have a follow up procedure to fix that issue.  So I had to wait in pain and not continue my life, which was wrong to begin with, and my surgery was incorrectly performed. I spoke with a lawyer and was basically told my case isn't big enough for his firm. I plan on getting a second opinion. I would like to know what you guys think. If I can't find representation, should I send a letter to the original ortho? I would include what happened, what had to be done, the images from the CTs clearly showing the hook still there. Maybe compensation? What should I do? Thanks in advance!"	Yes
I have been living in my apartment for nearly 2 years now. Shortly after I moved in there was a leak in my ceiling that damaged my mattress beyond repair. My landlord grudgingly paid for me to replace it though angrily told me I could replace it for 50$. He is an angry cheapskate but told me it was fixed and we had no issues.  Fast forward to yesterday when the Same pipe burst. Soaking my mattress monitors and keyboard. I am looking at 500-600$ to replace them. Luckily for all products I have either receipts or amazon history for each purchase.   My landlord has been apologetic so far but is already talking about just giving me one of his used monitors when I fully intend for equal replacements.   As far as I know my landlord is responsible for the damages correct? I am comtemplating finding asking a lawyer or if it would even be worth going to court should this turn ugly.  I have taken pictures of all the damages and the burst pipe. Thoughts/advice?	Yes
"There's a local obstacle gym that we pay a monthly fee for our son to attend.  He's 11.  There are trainers on staff for structured play time as well as ""free play"" where the kids can do the various obstacles at their leisure.  During free play, the trainers are suppose to wander through the obstacles observing the kids and making sure no one gets hurt. During free play time, my son fell from about 10 feet up and landed on the safety mat.  The way he landed shattered his elbow and broke his arm in two places.  This injury required immediate surgery to correct.  He now has wires holding his elbow together.  Another surgery will be necessary in a few months to remove the wires because his bones need to be able to continue to grow.  We have insurance but have had to pay the co pay on two emergency room visits as well as the surgery and follow up doctors appointments.  I've contacted their insurance company but the rep has been infuriatingly difficult to get in touch with.  I've spoken to him once out of 7 attempts.  I've spoken to a local attorney but they declined to represent me.  I'm not looking for a million dollar payout, but would appreciate help with the expenses I've incurred.  What are my options?  Will it just be classified as an accident and I eat the cost and move on?  Do I contact my insurance company and let them fight it out with the other?  We payed a premium for an inside gym with the proper safety equipment and a dedicated staff.  Both failed in this situation.  Just looking for a solid direction to move forward in. Thanks for any advice in advance."	Yes
"http://m.imgur.com/a/IiDrC  About $100 worth of Pokemon cards. The boxes were kicked and scattered all across the ground. There were twelve damage counter dice and two larger dice, and I only have two damage counters left. Both coins I had were also lost. The large stack of unsleeved cards to the right are the disfigured and frayed cards, and the stack to the left are the sleeved cards that survived.  She refuses to reimburse me for the destruction of my property, as I ""left them there"" after she kicked them, because the 911 dispatch told me to separate myself from her, and I should be lucky my mother even bothered to pick them up.  Additionally, I've paid my rent for July and August already. She's agreed to repay the $250 frpm August's rent, but, seeing how July is only half over, I'd like half of the rent from July, if at all possible. What can I do, Reddit?"	Yes
I came back to my apartment yesterday after studying at the library to see it on fire.  The cause of the fire was determined that the back left stove was on which heated a pan which then then heated a toaster which consequently caused the outlet it was plugged into to catch on fire.  My landlord is expecting me to pay, due to negligence, for the damages to the unit, i understand im liable for my personal property damaged.  However, in the pictures i took while the fire department was there none of the knobs on my stove where on.  In addition, the outlet which was the actual cause of the fire did not have Arc Fault Circuit interrupters which would have prevented the fire in the first place.  Also my stove had broke the in early June and had maintenance done on it by that apartment complex.  I am therefore asking where do i go from here? I am a college student and do not have any money to cover the cost of the damages	Yes
Hi all,  My parents are currently having a problem, and I was wondering if there is any legal recourse.  There are several trees that are on my neighbors property. A significant part of each tree overhanged onto my property, and the trees both provided significant privacy and shaded the property for most of the day. The power company came yesterday and cut down those trees completely. We now have the lovely view of the trailer park behind my house, without so much as a bush in between us. Additionally, my parents are concerned that their property value (and they're trying to sell) is going to go down, because you can now see the aforementioned trailer park quite clearly, and there's much less privacy and shade on our property.    My question- is there any legal recourse for my parents? I'm guessing not, since the trees weren't even planted on their property, but I figured it's something worth exploring.	Yes
N.CA   So I was involved in a collision like two weeks ago and my dumbass admitted fault because it was my first accident.  Talked to my adjuster (I have full coverage) and I told her how it happened and she told me that it was not completely my fault. My insurance already gave me a check for the damage of my car &amp; everything. Yesterday the other driver called me twice but I didn't answer because I was working, and today his insurance called wanting to talk about it and I told them they can talk to my adjuster if they have any questions. I'm freaking of maybe being sued, like the other guy was an Uber so he can claim lost wages, and everything I google leads me to law websites so I'm stressing.	Yes
