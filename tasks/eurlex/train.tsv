COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 2368/89
of 28 July 1989
amending Regulation (EEC) No 3951/88 fixing catch possibilities for 1989 for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Regulatory Area as defined in the NAFO Convention
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 170/83 of 25 January 1983 establishing a Community system for the conservation and management of fishery resources (1), as amended by the 1985 Act of Accession, and in particular Article 11 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas, in accordance with Article 3 of Regulation (EEC) No 170/83, it is incumbent upon the Council to establish the total allowable catches (TACs) by stock or group of stocks, the share available for the Community and also the specific conditions under which the catches must be made; whereas, in accordance with Article 4 of the said Regulation, the share available for the Community is to be allocated between the Member States;
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 3951/88 (1) fixed catch possibilities for 1989 for certain fish stocks and groups of fish stocks in the Regulatory Area as defined in the NAFO Convention;

"COMMISSION REGULATION (EEC) No 1369/89 of 19 May 1989 fixing for the 1989 marketing year the maximum levels of the withdrawal prices for tomatoes grown under glass
THE COMMISSION OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community,
Having regard to the Act of Accession of Spain and Portugal,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72 of 18 May 1972 on the common organization of the market in fruit and vegetables (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1119/89 (2), and in particular the last subparagraph of Article 18 (1) thereof,
Whereas, under the last subparagraph of Article 18 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 1035/72, producers' organizations may be authorized, in view of the characteristics of the market under consideration, to fix, under certain conditions, withdrawal prices above the levels referred to in Article 18 (1) (a) of that Regulation;
Whereas the market in tomatoes grown under glass has different characteristics from those of the market in open-grown tomatoes; whereas tomatoes grown under glass are mainly 'Extra' class and class I products, the prices for which are considerably higher than those for open-grown products;
Whereas, in order to provide more effective support for the market in tomatoes grown under glass, producers' organizations or associations of such organizations should be allowed to fix their withdrawal price at a level higher than the Community withdrawal price; whereas, in accordance with the last subparagraph of Article 18 (1), it appears that the maximum level of the withdrawal price for these products can justifiably be fixed by applying, to the prices fixed for the 1988 marketing year, a variation of the same order as that applied by the Council when fixing the basic prices and buying-in prices for tomatoes;
Whereas the measures provided for in this Regulation are in accordance with the opinion of the Management Committee for Fruit and Vegetables,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
For the 1989 marketing year, producers' organizations or associations of such organizations may fix withdrawal prices, not exceeding the following maxima, in ecus per 100 kilograms net, for tomatoes grown under glass:
- June (11 to 20): 30,25,
(21 to 30): 27,83,
- July (1 to 10): 26,06,
(11 to 20): 24,41,
(21 to 31): 22,63,
- August: 22,63,
- September: 22,63,
- October: 22,63,
- November: 22,63.
Article 2
The producers' organizations shall supply the following information to the national authorities, who shall communicate it to the Commission:
- the period during which withdrawal prices are applicable,
- the levels of withdrawal prices proposed and of those applied.
Article 3
This Regulation shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Communities. It shall apply with effect from 11 June 1989.
This Regulation shall be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in all Member States.

"COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1250/89 of 3 May 1989 fixing the basic price and the standard quality for slaughtered pigs for the period 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to Council Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 of 29 October 1975 on the common organization of the market in pigmeat (1), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 1249/89 (2), and in particular Article 4 (4) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (3),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (4),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (5),
Whereas, when the basic price for slaughtered pigs is fixed, account should be taken of the objectives of the common agricultural policy and of the contribution which the Community desires to make to the harmonious development of world trade; whereas the objectives of the common agricultural policy are in particular to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, to ensure that supplies are available and that they reach consumers at reasonable prices;
Whereas the basic price must be fixed in accordance with the criteria laid down in Article 4 (1) of Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 for a standard quality defined by reference to Council Regulation (EEC) No 3220/84 of 13 November 1984 determining the Community scale for grading pig carcases (6), as amended by Regulation (EEC) No 3530/86 (7);
Whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2759/75 has been amended to make the basic price applicable in future from 1 July of each year; whereas Regulation (EEC) No 2266/88 (8) fixing
the basic price and the standard quality for slaughtered pigs for the period 1 July 1988 to 31 October 1989 should in consequence be repealed;
Whereas experience acquired of carcase classification indicates that it would be possible to simplify the definition of standard carcase quality,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
For the period 1 July 1989 to 30 June 1990 the basic price for slaughtered pigs of the standard quality shall be ECU 2 033,30 per tonne.

"COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 4/2009
of 18 December 2008
on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 61(c) and Article 67(2) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (2),
Whereas:
(1)
The Community has set itself the objective of maintaining and developing an area of freedom, security and justice, in which the free movement of persons is ensured. For the gradual establishment of such an area, the Community is to adopt, among others, measures relating to judicial cooperation in civil matters having cross-border implications, in so far as necessary for the proper functioning of the internal market.
(2)
In accordance with Article 65(b) of the Treaty, these measures must aim, inter alia, to promote the compatibility of the rules applicable in the Member States concerning the conflict of laws and of jurisdiction.
(3)
In this respect, the Community has among other measures already adopted Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (3), Council Decision 2001/470/EC of 28 May 2001 establishing a European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters (4), Council Regulation (EC) No 1206/2001 of 28 May 2001 on cooperation between the courts of the Member States in the taking of evidence in civil or commercial matters (5), Council Directive 2003/8/EC of 27 January 2003 to improve access to justice in cross-border disputes by establishing minimum common rules relating to legal aid for such disputes (6), Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and in matters of parental responsibility (7), Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims (8), and Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters (service of documents) (9).
(4)
The European Council in Tampere on 15 and 16 October 1999 invited the Council and the Commission to establish special common procedural rules to simplify and accelerate the settlement of cross-border disputes concerning, inter alia, maintenance claims. It also called for the abolition of intermediate measures required for the recognition and enforcement in the requested State of a decision given in another Member State, particularly a decision relating to a maintenance claim.
(5)
A programme of measures for the enforcement of the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in civil and commercial matters (10), common to the Commission and to the Council, was adopted on 30 November 2000. That programme provides for the abolition of the exequatur procedure for maintenance claims in order to boost the effectiveness of the means by which maintenance creditors safeguard their rights.
(6)
The European Council meeting in Brussels on 4 and 5 November 2004 adopted a new programme called ‘The Hague Programme: strengthening freedom, security and justice in the European Union’ (hereinafter referred to as The Hague Programme) (11).
(7)
At its meeting on 2 and 3 June 2005, the Council adopted a Council and Commission Action Plan (12) which implements The Hague Programme in concrete actions and which mentions the necessity of adopting proposals on maintenance obligations.
(8)
In the framework of The Hague Conference on Private International Law, the Community and its Member States took part in negotiations which led to the adoption on 23 November 2007 of the Convention on the International Recovery of Child Support and other Forms of Family Maintenance (hereinafter referred to as the 2007 Hague Convention) and the Protocol on the Law Applicable to Maintenance Obligations (hereinafter referred to as the 2007 Hague Protocol). Both those instruments should therefore be taken into account in this Regulation.
(9)
A maintenance creditor should be able to obtain easily, in a Member State, a decision which will be automatically enforceable in another Member State without further formalities.
(10)
In order to achieve this goal, it is advisable to create a Community instrument in matters relating to maintenance obligations bringing together provisions on jurisdiction, conflict of laws, recognition and enforceability, enforcement, legal aid and cooperation between Central Authorities.
(11)
The scope of this Regulation should cover all maintenance obligations arising from a family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity, in order to guarantee equal treatment of all maintenance creditors. For the purposes of this Regulation, the term ‘maintenance obligation’ should be interpreted autonomously.
(12)
In order to take account of the various ways of resolving maintenance obligation issues in the Member States, this Regulation should apply both to court decisions and to decisions given by administrative authorities, provided that the latter offer guarantees with regard to, in particular, their impartiality and the right of all parties to be heard. Those authorities should therefore apply all the rules of this Regulation.
(13)
For the reasons set out above, this Regulation should also ensure the recognition and enforcement of court settlements and authentic instruments without affecting the right of either party to such a settlement or instrument to challenge the settlement or instrument before the courts of the Member State of origin.
(14)
It should be provided in this Regulation that for the purposes of an application for the recognition and enforcement of a decision relating to maintenance obligations the term ‘creditor’ includes public bodies which are entitled to act in place of a person to whom maintenance is owed or to claim reimbursement of benefits provided to the creditor in place of maintenance. Where a public body acts in this capacity, it should be entitled to the same services and the same legal aid as a creditor.
(15)
In order to preserve the interests of maintenance creditors and to promote the proper administration of justice within the European Union, the rules on jurisdiction as they result from Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 should be adapted. The circumstance that the defendant is habitually resident in a third State should no longer entail the non-application of Community rules on jurisdiction, and there should no longer be any referral to national law. This Regulation should therefore determine the cases in which a court in a Member State may exercise subsidiary jurisdiction.
(16)
In order to remedy, in particular, situations of denial of justice this Regulation should provide a forum necessitatis allowing a court of a Member State, on an exceptional basis, to hear a case which is closely connected with a third State. Such an exceptional basis may be deemed to exist when proceedings prove impossible in the third State in question, for example because of civil war, or when an applicant cannot reasonably be expected to initiate or conduct proceedings in that State. Jurisdiction based on the forum necessitatis should, however, be exercised only if the dispute has a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court seised, for instance the nationality of one of the parties.
(17)
An additional rule of jurisdiction should provide that, except under specific conditions, proceedings to modify an existing maintenance decision or to have a new decision given can be brought by the debtor only in the State in which the creditor was habitually resident at the time the decision was given and in which he remains habitually resident. To ensure proper symmetry between the 2007 Hague Convention and this Regulation, this rule should also apply as regards decisions given in a third State which is party to the said Convention in so far as that Convention is in force between that State and the Community and covers the same maintenance obligations in that State and in the Community.
(18)
For the purposes of this Regulation, it should be provided that in Ireland the concept of ‘domicile’ replaces the concept of ‘nationality’ which is also the case in the United Kingdom, subject to this Regulation being applicable in the latter Member State in accordance with Article 4 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community.
(19)
In order to increase legal certainty, predictability and the autonomy of the parties, this Regulation should enable the parties to choose the competent court by agreement on the basis of specific connecting factors. To protect the weaker party, such a choice of court should not be allowed in the case of maintenance obligations towards a child under the age of 18.
(20)
It should be provided in this Regulation that, for Member States bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol, the rules on conflict of laws in respect of maintenance obligations will be those set out in that Protocol. To that end, a provision referring to the said Protocol should be inserted. The 2007 Hague Protocol will be concluded by the Community in time to enable this Regulation to apply. To take account of a scenario in which the 2007 Hague Protocol does not apply to all the Member States a distinction for the purposes of recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions needs to be made in this Regulation between the Member States bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol and those not bound by it.
(21)
It needs to be made clear in this Regulation that these rules on conflict of laws determine only the law applicable to maintenance obligations and do not determine the law applicable to the establishment of the family relationships on which the maintenance obligations are based. The establishment of family relationships continues to be covered by the national law of the Member States, including their rules of private international law.
(22)
In order to ensure swift and efficient recovery of a maintenance obligation and to prevent delaying actions, decisions in matters relating to maintenance obligations given in a Member State should in principle be provisionally enforceable. This Regulation should therefore provide that the court of origin should be able to declare the decision provisionally enforceable even if the national law does not provide for enforceability by operation of law and even if an appeal has been or could still be lodged against the decision under national law.
(23)
To limit the costs of proceedings subject to this Regulation, the greatest possible use of modern communications technologies, particularly for hearing parties, would be helpful.
(24)
The guarantees provided by the application of rules on conflict of laws should provide the justification for having decisions relating to maintenance obligations given in a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol recognised and regarded as enforceable in all the other Member States without any procedure being necessary and without any form of control on the substance in the Member State of enforcement.
(25)
Recognition in a Member State of a decision relating to maintenance obligations has as its only object to allow the recovery of the maintenance claim determined in the decision. It does not imply the recognition by that Member State of the family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity underlying the maintenance obligations which gave rise to the decision.
(26)
For decisions on maintenance obligations given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol, there should be provision in this Regulation for a procedure for recognition and declaration of enforceability. That procedure should be modelled on the procedure and the grounds for refusing recognition set out in Regulation (EC) No 44/2001. To accelerate proceedings and enable the creditor to recover his claim quickly, the court seised should be required to give its decision within a set time, unless there are exceptional circumstances.
(27)
It would also be appropriate to limit as far as possible the formal enforcement requirements likely to increase the costs to be borne by the maintenance creditor. To that end, this Regulation should provide that a maintenance creditor ought not to be required to have a postal address or an authorised representative in the Member State of enforcement, without this otherwise affecting the internal organisation of the Member States in matters relating to enforcement proceedings.
(28)
In order to limit the costs of enforcement proceedings, no translation should be required unless enforcement is contested, and without prejudice to the rules applicable to service of documents.
(29)
In order to guarantee compliance with the requirements of a fair trial, this Regulation should provide for the right of a defendant who did not enter an appearance in the court of origin of a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol to apply for a review of the decision given against him at the stage of enforcement. However, the defendant must apply for this review within a set period which should start no later than the day on which, in the enforcement proceedings, his property was first made non-disposable in whole or in part. That right to apply for a review should be an extraordinary remedy granted to the defendant in default and not affecting the application of any extraordinary remedies laid down in the law of the Member State of origin provided that those remedies are not incompatible with the right to a review under this Regulation.
(30)
In order to speed up the enforcement in another Member State of a decision given in a Member State bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol it is necessary to limit the grounds of refusal or of suspension of enforcement which may be invoked by the debtor on account of the cross-border nature of the maintenance claim. This limitation should not affect the grounds of refusal or of suspension laid down in national law which are not incompatible with those listed in this Regulation, such as the debtor’s discharge of his debt at the time of enforcement or the unattachable nature of certain assets.
(31)
To facilitate cross-border recovery of maintenance claims, provision should be made for a system of cooperation between Central Authorities designated by the Member States. These Authorities should assist maintenance creditors and debtors in asserting their rights in another Member State by submitting applications for recognition, enforceability and enforcement of existing decisions, for the modification of such decisions or for the establishment of a decision. They should also exchange information in order to locate debtors and creditors, and identify their income and assets, as necessary. Lastly, they should cooperate with each other by exchanging general information and promoting cooperation amongst the competent authorities in their Member States.
(32)
A Central Authority designated under this Regulation should bear its own costs, except in specifically determined cases, and should provide assistance for all applicants residing in its Member State. The criterion for determining a person’s right to request assistance from a Central Authority should be less strict than the connecting factor of ‘habitual residence’ used elsewhere in this Regulation. However, the ‘residence’ criterion should exclude mere presence.
(33)
In order to provide full assistance to maintenance creditors and debtors and to facilitate as much as possible cross-border recovery of maintenance, the Central Authorities should be able to obtain a certain amount of personal information. This Regulation should therefore oblige the Member States to ensure that their Central Authorities have access to such information through the public authorities or administrations which hold the information concerned in the course of their ordinary activities. It should however be left to each Member State to decide on the arrangements for such access. Accordingly, a Member State should be able to designate the public authorities or administrations which will be required to supply the information to the Central Authority in accordance with this Regulation, including, if appropriate, public authorities or administrations already designated in the context of other systems for access to information. Where a Member State designates public authorities or administrations, it should ensure that its Central Authority is able to access the requisite information held by those bodies as provided for in this Regulation. A Member State should also be able to allow its Central Authority to access requisite information from any other legal person which holds it and controls its processing.
(34)
In the context of access to personal data and the use and transmission thereof, the requirements of Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data (13), as transposed into the national law of the Member States, should be complied with.
(35)
For the purposes of the application of this Regulation it is however necessary to define the specific conditions of access to personal data and of the use and transmission of such data. In this context, the opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor (14) has been taken into consideration. Notification of the data subject should take place in accordance with national law. It should however be possible to defer the notification to prevent the debtor from transferring his assets and thus jeopardising the recovery of the maintenance claim.
(36)
On account of the costs of proceedings it is appropriate to provide for a very favourable legal aid scheme, that is, full coverage of the costs relating to proceedings concerning maintenance obligations in respect of children under the age of 21 initiated via the Central Authorities. Specific rules should therefore be added to the current rules on legal aid in the European Union which exist by virtue of Directive 2003/8/EC thus setting up a special legal aid scheme for maintenance obligations. In this context, the competent authority of the requested Member State should be able, exceptionally, to recover costs from an applicant having received free legal aid and lost the case, provided that the person’s financial situation so permits. This would apply, in particular, where someone well-off had acted in bad faith.
(37)
In addition, for maintenance obligations other than those referred to in the preceding recital, all parties should be guaranteed the same treatment in terms of legal aid at the time of enforcement of a decision in another Member State. Accordingly, the provisions of this Regulation on continuity of legal aid should be understood as also granting such aid to a party who, while not having received legal aid in the proceedings to obtain or amend a decision in the Member State of origin, did then benefit from such aid in that State in the context of an application for enforcement of the decision. Similarly, a party who benefited from free proceedings before an administrative authority listed in Annex X should, in the Member State of enforcement, benefit from the most favourable legal aid or the most extensive exemption from costs or expenses, provided that he shows that he would have so benefited in the Member State of origin.
(38)
In order to minimise the costs of translating supporting documents the court seised should only require a translation of such documents when this is necessary, without prejudice to the rights of the defence and the rules applicable concerning service of documents.
(39)
To facilitate the application of this Regulation, Member States should be obliged to provide the Commission with the names and contact details of their Central Authorities and with other information. That information should be made available to practitioners and to the public through publication in the Official Journal of the European Union or through electronic access to the European Judicial Network in civil and commercial matters established by Decision 2001/470/EC. Furthermore, the use of forms provided for in this Regulation should facilitate and speed up communication between the Central Authorities and make it possible to submit applications electronically.
(40)
The relationship between this Regulation and the bilateral or multilateral conventions and agreements on maintenance obligations to which the Member States are party should be specified. In this context it should be stipulated that Member States which are party to the Convention of 23 March 1962 between Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland and Norway on the recovery of maintenance by the Member States may continue to apply that Convention since it contains more favourable rules on recognition and enforcement than those in this Regulation. As regards the conclusion of future bilateral agreements on maintenance obligations with third States, the procedures and conditions under which Member States would be authorised to negotiate and conclude such agreements on their own behalf should be determined in the course of discussions relating to a Commission proposal on the subject.
(41)
In calculating the periods and time limits provided for in this Regulation, Regulation (EEC, Euratom) No 1182/71 of the Council of 3 June 1971 determining the rules applicable to periods, dates and time limits (15) should apply.
(42)
The measures necessary for the implementation of this Regulation should be adopted in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 laying down the procedures for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission (16).
(43)
In particular, the Commission should be empowered to adopt any amendments to the forms provided for in this Regulation in accordance with the advisory procedure provided for in Article 3 of Decision 1999/468/EC. For the establishment of the list of the administrative authorities falling within the scope of this Regulation, and the list of authorities competent to certify the right to legal aid, the Commission should be empowered to act in accordance with the management procedure provided for in Article 4 of that Decision.
(44)
This Regulation should amend Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 by replacing the provisions of that Regulation applicable to maintenance obligations. Subject to the transitional provisions of this Regulation, Member States should, in matters relating to maintenance obligations, apply the provisions of this Regulation on jurisdiction, recognition, enforceability and enforcement of decisions and on legal aid instead of those of Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 as from the date on which this Regulation becomes applicable.
(45)
Since the objectives of this Regulation, namely the introduction of a series of measures to ensure the effective recovery of maintenance claims in cross-border situations and thus to facilitate the free movement of persons within the European Union, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale and effects of this Regulation, be better achieved at Community level, the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality as set out in that Article this Regulation does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve those objectives.
(46)
In accordance with Article 3 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, Ireland has given notice of its wish to take part in the adoption and application of this Regulation.
(47)
In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of the United Kingdom and Ireland, annexed to the Treaty on European Union and to the Treaty establishing the European Community, the United Kingdom is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application. This is, however, without prejudice to the possibility for the United Kingdom of notifying its intention of accepting this Regulation after its adoption in accordance with Article 4 of the said Protocol.
(48)
In accordance with Articles 1 and 2 of the Protocol on the position of Denmark annexed to the Treaty on European Union and the Treaty establishing the European Community, Denmark is not taking part in the adoption of this Regulation and is not bound by it or subject to its application, without prejudice to the possibility for Denmark of applying the amendments made here to Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 pursuant to Article 3 of the Agreement of 19 October 2005 between the European Community and the Kingdom of Denmark on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (17),

Article 5
Jurisdiction based on the appearance of the defendant
Apart from jurisdiction derived from other provisions of this Regulation, a court of a Member State before which a defendant enters an appearance shall have jurisdiction. This rule shall not apply where appearance was entered to contest the jurisdiction.
Article 6
Subsidiary jurisdiction
Where no court of a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to Articles 3, 4 and 5 and no court of a State party to the Lugano Convention which is not a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of that Convention, the courts of the Member State of the common nationality of the parties shall have jurisdiction.
Article 7
Forum necessitatis
Where no court of a Member State has jurisdiction pursuant to Articles 3, 4, 5 and 6, the courts of a Member State may, on an exceptional basis, hear the case if proceedings cannot reasonably be brought or conducted or would be impossible in a third State with which the dispute is closely connected.
The dispute must have a sufficient connection with the Member State of the court seised.
Article 8
Limit on proceedings
1. Where a decision is given in a Member State or a 2007 Hague Convention Contracting State where the creditor is habitually resident, proceedings to modify the decision or to have a new decision given cannot be brought by the debtor in any other Member State as long as the creditor remains habitually resident in the State in which the decision was given.
2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply:

Article 9
Seising of a court
For the purposes of this Chapter, a court shall be deemed to be seised:
(a)
at the time when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court, provided that the claimant has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have service effected on the defendant; or
(b)
if the document has to be served before being lodged with the court, at the time when it is received by the authority responsible for service, provided that the claimant has not subsequently failed to take the steps he was required to take to have the document lodged with the court.
Article 10
Examination as to jurisdiction
Where a court of a Member State is seised of a case over which it has no jurisdiction under this Regulation it shall declare of its own motion that it has no jurisdiction.
Article 11
Examination as to admissibility
1. Where a defendant habitually resident in a State other than the Member State where the action was brought does not enter an appearance, the court with jurisdiction shall stay the proceedings so long as it is not shown that the defendant has been able to receive the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time to enable him to arrange for his defence, or that all necessary steps have been taken to this end.
2. Article 19 of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 shall apply instead of the provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted from one Member State to another pursuant to that Regulation.
3. Where the provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 are not applicable, Article 15 of the Hague Convention of 15 November 1965 on the service abroad of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters shall apply if the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document had to be transmitted abroad pursuant to that Convention.
Article 12
Lis pendens
1. Where proceedings involving the same cause of action and between the same parties are brought in the courts of different Member States, any court other than the court first seised shall of its own motion stay its proceedings until such time as the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established.
2. Where the jurisdiction of the court first seised is established, any court other than the court first seised shall decline jurisdiction in favour of that court.
Article 13
Related actions
1. Where related actions are pending in the courts of different Member States, any court other than the court first seised may stay its proceedings.
2. Where these actions are pending at first instance, any court other than the court first seised may also, on the application of one of the parties, decline jurisdiction if the court first seised has jurisdiction over the actions in question and its law permits the consolidation thereof.
3. For the purposes of this Article, actions are deemed to be related where they are so closely connected that it is expedient to hear and determine them together to avoid the risk of irreconcilable judgments resulting from separate proceedings.
Article 14
Provisional, including protective, measures
Application may be made to the courts of a Member State for such provisional, including protective, measures as may be available under the law of that State, even if, under this Regulation, the courts of another Member State have jurisdiction as to the substance of the matter.

Article 18
Protective measures
An enforceable decision shall carry with it by operation of law the power to proceed to any protective measures which exist under the law of the Member State of enforcement.
Article 19
Right to apply for a review
1. A defendant who did not enter an appearance in the Member State of origin shall have the right to apply for a review of the decision before the competent court of that Member State where:
(a)
he was not served with the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence; or
(b)
he was prevented from contesting the maintenance claim by reason of force majeure or due to extraordinary circumstances without any fault on his part;
unless he failed to challenge the decision when it was possible for him to do so.
2. The time limit for applying for a review shall run from the day the defendant was effectively acquainted with the contents of the decision and was able to react, at the latest from the date of the first enforcement measure having the effect of making his property non-disposable in whole or in part. The defendant shall react promptly, in any event within 45 days. No extension may be granted on account of distance.

Each Member State may indicate the official language or languages of the institutions of the European Union other than its own which it can accept for the completion of the form.
2. The competent authorities of the Member State of enforcement may not require the claimant to provide a translation of the decision. However, a translation may be required if the enforcement of the decision is challenged.
3. Any translation under this Article must be done by a person qualified to do translations in one of the Member States.
Article 21
Refusal or suspension of enforcement
1. The grounds of refusal or suspension of enforcement under the law of the Member State of enforcement shall apply in so far as they are not incompatible with the application of paragraphs 2 and 3.
2. The competent authority in the Member State of enforcement shall, on application by the debtor, refuse, either wholly or in part, the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin if the right to enforce the decision of the court of origin is extinguished by the effect of prescription or the limitation of action, either under the law of the Member State of origin or under the law of the Member State of enforcement, whichever provides for the longer limitation period.
Furthermore, the competent authority in the Member State of enforcement may, on application by the debtor, refuse, either wholly or in part, the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin if it is irreconcilable with a decision given in the Member State of enforcement or with a decision given in another Member State or in a third State which fulfils the conditions necessary for its recognition in the Member State of enforcement.
A decision which has the effect of modifying an earlier decision on maintenance on the basis of changed circumstances shall not be considered an irreconcilable decision within the meaning of the second subparagraph.
3. The competent authority in the Member State of enforcement may, on application by the debtor, suspend, either wholly or in part, the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin if the competent court of the Member State of origin has been seised of an application for a review of the decision of the court of origin pursuant to Article 19.
Furthermore, the competent authority of the Member State of enforcement shall, on application by the debtor, suspend the enforcement of the decision of the court of origin where the enforceability of that decision is suspended in the Member State of origin.
Article 22
No effect on the existence of family relationships
The recognition and enforcement of a decision on maintenance under this Regulation shall not in any way imply the recognition of the family relationship, parentage, marriage or affinity underlying the maintenance obligation which gave rise to the decision.
SECTION 2
Decisions given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol
Article 23
Recognition
1. A decision given in a Member State not bound by the 2007 Hague Protocol shall be recognised in the other Member States without any special procedure being required.
2. Any interested party who raises the recognition of a decision as the principal issue in a dispute may, in accordance with the procedures provided for in this Section, apply for a decision that the decision be recognised.

(a)
if such recognition is manifestly contrary to public policy in the Member State in which recognition is sought. The test of public policy may not be applied to the rules relating to jurisdiction;
(b)
where it was given in default of appearance, if the defendant was not served with the document which instituted the proceedings or with an equivalent document in sufficient time and in such a way as to enable him to arrange for his defence, unless the defendant failed to commence proceedings to challenge the decision when it was possible for him to do so;
(c)
if it is irreconcilable with a decision given in a dispute between the same parties in the Member State in which recognition is sought;

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE
of 8 November 1990
amending Directive 78/660/EEC on annual accounts and Directive 83/349/EEC on consolidated accounts as regards the scope of those Directives
(90/605/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 54 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Directive 78/660/EEC (4), as last amended by Directive 90/604/EEC (5), applies to the annual accounts of public and private limited liability companies in particular because those types of company offer no safeguards to third parties beyond the amounts of their net assets;
Whereas, in accordance with Directive 83/349/EEC (6), as last amended by Directive 90/604/EEC, Member States need require only companies covered by Directive 78/660/EEC to draw up consolidated accounts;
Whereas, within the Community, there is a substantial and constantly growing number of partnerships and limited partnerships all of the fully liable members of which are constituted either as public or as private limited liability companies;
Whereas these fully liable members may also be companies which do not fall within the law of a Member State but which have a legal status comparable to that referred to in Directive 68/151/EEC (7);
Whereas it would run counter to the spirit and aims of those Directives to allow such partnerships and partnerships with limited liability not to be subject to Community rules;
Whereas the provisions covering the scope of the two Directives in question should therefore be explicitly supplemented;
Whereas it is of importance that the name, head office and legal status of any undertaking of which a limited liability company is a fully liable member should be indicated in the notes to the accounts of such member;
Whereas the obligation to draw up, publish and to have audited the accounts of partnerships and limited liability partnerships may also be imposed on the fully liable member; whereas it should also be possible to include these companies in consolidated accounts, drawn up by such member or established at a higher level;
Whereas some of the partnerships covered by this Directive are not subject, in the Member State where they have their head office, to entry in a register, which makes it difficult to apply accounting obligations to them; whereas, in particular in these cases, special rules are necessary according to whether the fully liable members are undertakings which fall within the law of the same Member State, another Member State or a third country,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Directive 78/660/EEC is hereby amended as follows:

Copies of the accounts must be obtainable upon request. The price of such a copy may not exceed its administrative cost. Appropriate sanctions must be provided for failure to comply with the publication obligation imposed in this paragraph.';
4. the following Article is inserted:
'Article 57a
1. Member States may require the companies referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 1 (1) governed by their law, which are members having unlimited liability of any of the companies and firms listed in Article 1 (1), second and third subparagraphs (entity concerned), to draw up, have audited and publish, with their own accounts, the accounts of the entity concerned in conformity with the provisions of this Directive.

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 103 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas Article 1 (1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 (1) provides that the unit of account to be used in the legal instruments relating to the common agricultural policy is to be the ECU as defined by Council Regulation (EEC) No 3180/78 of 18 December 1978 changing the value of the unit of account used by the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (2), as last amended by Regulation (EEC) No 2626/84 (3); whereas, however, Article 15 (2) of Regulation (EEC) No 1676/85 stated that the said Article 1 (1) was to be valid until 31 March 1987 only;
Whereas, on the basis of experience acquired with the agri-monetary system since the introduction of the ECU as agricultural unit of account, that time limit may now be abandoned;
Whereas the Commission has proposed to the Council that the ECU should be introduced into the common agricultural policy on a permanent basis; whereas in view of the urgency of the matter and in order to avoid the injurious consequences of a decision not being taken, in view of the time necessary to carry out the procedure laid down in Article 43 of the Treaty, interim measures should be adopted,

Whereas heavy buying in of butter has been one of the major features of the last few weeks; whereas this situation is far from normal for the time of the year, in view of the seasonal nature of milk production; whereas it is a situation which appears to have been brought about as a result of the announcement of the Commission's proposal to lower the intervention price for butter for the 1986/87 milk year;

After consultation with the Advisory Committee on Restrictive Practices and Dominant Positions,
Whereas:
I. THE FACTS
The parties
(1) Deere and Company is incorporated under the law of the State of Delaware in the United States of America. Its registered office is at John Deere Road, Moline, Illinois, 61265 (USA). It has its European Office at Steubenstraße 36, Postfach 503, D-6800 Mannheim. It sells and distributes in some Member States of the Community through a number of branches or wholly owned subsidiary companies which appoint independent local dealers ; in other Member States it appoints independent national dealers which, in their turn, themselves appoint independent local dealers.
(2) Within the common market, Deere and Company trades under the following names: (1) John Deere Export - the division (located in Moline) which manages its relations with independent national dealers;
(2) John Deere Vertrieb Deutschland - the German branch which deals with local dealers in Germany;
(3) John Deere Italiana - the similar Italian branch;
(4) John Deere SA - the subsidiary in France - which deals with local dealers in France;
(5) John Deere Ltd - the similar UK subsidiary.
John Deere Export reports to a Deere and Company Vice-President Export located in Moline and the other branches and subsidiaries report to a Vice-President Europe, Africa, Middle East located in Mannheim (both also responsible as their titles imply for operations outside the Community). These (1) OJ No 13, 21.2.1962, p. 204/62. (2) OJ No 127, 20.8.1963, p. 2268/63. two report to a Senior Vice-President and Managing Director - Overseas Operations, who is on Deere and Company's main board and located in Moline. In what follows the Deere group is referred to as Deere.
(3) The independent national dealers within the EEC involved in this case are: (1) NV Cofabel, Peperstraat 4A, 3071 Erps-Kwerps, Belgium;
(2) NV Louis Nagel & Co., PO box 76, 6500 AB Nijmegen, Netherlands;
and
(3) Dansk Oversøisk Motor Industri A/S (DOMI), Sdr, Ringvej 35, 2600 Glostrup, Denmark.
There was also a national distributor in Greece - D. Avrassoglou SA - but it is understood that it has ceased trading.
The product and market
(4) The product involved is agricultural machinery. There is a wide variety of agricultural machinery, some manufactured by specialists. Some manufacturers, Deere among them, produce a wide range. In addition, some motor vehicle manufacturers, who otherwise have no interest in the sector, produce agricultural tractors. The product involved in this case is all the farm equipment including agricultural tractors sold by Deere.
(5) The markets principally concerned are those in which farmers or contractors buy agricultural machinery, usually from dealers at a retail level, in which retail dealers buy from manufacturers or from distributors at a wholesale level and in which distributors at a wholesale level buy from manufacturers or other distributors. The way in which Deere markets its products, described in paragraph 1 above, is typical.
The position of the parties
(6) Deere is a major manufacturer of agricultural machinery - for example it is the world's fourth largest tractor manufacturer, and second largest manufacturer of fodder machinery. It also manufactures industrial equipment. In 1983 its total turnover was $ US 3 908 million, of which 3 314 were of farm equipment. Its turnover of agricultural machinery in the Community was ... ECU. Its market share varied from Member State to Member State, and for different types of farm equipment - for example, in 1983 it had ... % of the EEC market for combine harvesters (varying from ... % in Italy to ... % in Greece) and ... % for tractors (... % Italy - ... % Netherlands - all these figures are approximate, and there are differences in the statistical bases from State to State).
(7) Cofabel had a turnover of Bfrs ... in 1981, almost all consisting of farm equipment. Nagel's turnover, similarly, was Fl ... and DOMI's Dkr ... of which ... was of Deere equipment.
The proceedings
(8) On 3 September 1982, the National Farmers Union of the United Kingdom made a complaint concerning the alleged refusal of Cofabel to supply a tractor to a member. The member complained that Cofabel refused to supply him, even though he offered to pay in Belgian francs and take delivery in Belgium, because ""the John Deere factory in Germany forbids such"" (original English).
(9) On 14 October 1982, inspectors in the Commission's service visited Cofabel's office in Erps-Kwerps, and on 18 and 19 November, Deere and Company's European Office. They took copies of about 150 documents relating to ""over the border sales"".
(10) On 12 November 1982, Deere, in the name of John Deere Vertrieb Deutschland, applied for negative clearance for the Article 13 of the general conditions of sale to be used from the first day of that month as an annex to its local dealer's contracts within Germany. This Article read (original German):
"" - The article supplied is intended for sale at home.
- Should nevertheless resale abroad follow (direct or indirect, with or without modification), the orderer will in such event have no claim to annual bonus or participation in special sales promotion programmes.
- For the resale of articles in non-EEC countries the deliverer will debit an additional surcharge of 10 % - calculated on the deliverer's asking price for the articles.
- The deliverer reserves the right in such event to assert further claims, in particular the right summarily to cancel the contract
"".
(11) On 12 August 1983 the Commission sent a Statement of Objections to Deere and the independent national dealers listed in paragraph 3 above. On 31 August 1983 Deere and again on 29 September lawyers representing Deere exercised its right to inspect the Commission's files, as did Cofabel on 7 September.
(12) On 12 October 1983 Cofabel, Domi and Nagel and on 18 October Deere replied to the Statement of Objections without asking for an oral hearing.
(13) On 21 March 1984, the Commission submitted to Deere the quotations from the documents in its file on which it might base its decision, some of which had been referred to specifically in the Statement of Objections and some of which were added in response to Deere's reply.
(14) On 27 April 1984 Deere, through its lawyers, commented on these quotations. It has not produced any material invalidating the Commission's evidence or reversing the Commission's interpretation of it.
Deere and Company's distribution policies and system
Parallel trading - its causes and effects
(15) Deere has allowed its various branches a certain independence in marketing policy. Some Deere branches or national dealers, observing conditions in their national markets, have quoted lower prices or offered higher discounts than the branches or dealers in other Member States. In addition, currency fluctuations, in particular of the pound sterling, and policies of national governments have, from time to time, caused prices in different Member States to differ. This has led some farmers in higher-price States to seek to import from States where prices were lower and some dealers with lower prices to seek export business where prices were higher - in other words, it has tended to make parallel trading profitable. Deere's reaction to the problems thus caused was to attempt to inhibit parallel trading. There is evidence of its policies, of the effects of these policies, and of its reaction to these effects throughout the documents copied by the Commission's inspectors.
The formal agreements
(16) Some of the forms of contract used by Deere or by its independent national dealers contained clauses forbidding exports - see, for example: (1) Article 1 (e) of John Deere Export's Dealer Agreement (the standard contract made with national dealers), which read : ""The Goods purchased from the company shall be sold to the Dealer exclusively for agricultural use, and only for use in, or to purchasers residing in, the Dealers Area of Responsibility"" (original English) - Nagel signed its contract in this standard form on the 3 October 1967;
(2) Articles 3 and 5 of Cofabel NV's standard distribution contract with Cofabel's local dealers - these read ""Article 3. The distributor undertakes to sell the Company's goods only to customers established in the area which is conceded to him ... Article 5. It is forbidden for the distributor to sell machinery to clients situated outside the area conceded to him. Any inquiry or order emanating from such a client should be transmitted to the Company. If the distributor, in spite of this, effects sales of goods in an area conceded to another distributor, the Company reserves the right not to execute the order or reduce by from 3 % to 7 % the distributor's discount for the machines. The Company will choose which independently. For its part, the Company reserves the right to effect sales anywhere in Belgian territory whenever the distributor does not wish or is not able to sell because of special circumstances."" (original French and Dutch);
(3) Article 12 of the former (1972 to 1977) general sales conditions annexed to the contracts with their local dealers by John Deere Vertrieb Deutschland - this read : ""The purchaser undertakes, as far as no contrary legal regulation prevents not to resell articles supplied abroad with or without modification either directly or indirectly. By breach of this undertaking he loses. without prejudice to any claim of the deliverer and with effect from the date of the order, his right to every rebate and any other benefit"" (original German). Article 13 of the conditions valid from 1977 to 1982 is similarly worded.
(4) Article 13 of the German conditions of sale the subject of the application for negative clearance (paragraph 10 above).
(17) Other contracts do not contain such clauses (see John Deere SA's standard local dealers' contract) or even contain words such as ""... but does not constitute any territorial restriction"" (see John Deere Ltd's contract - original English). These contracts do contain clauses such as one limiting John Deere SA's undertaking to accept orders to ""... the extent that these are in relation with the needs of the concessionaire's area of influence"" (original French) or a statement that ""... the Dealer's performance will be evaluated exclusively on the activity carried out in the described Area of Responsibility"", or making access to Deere credit conditional on unspecified ""... standards or requirements of uniform application ..."" (original English).
The implementation of the agreements and other practices
(18) Deere has treated contracts whether or not containing an export ban as if they did.
(19) From 15 October 1975 Deere has sought, using the terms of the contracts or other means, to persuade or constrain its dealers not to export - in other words, it has sought to persuade the affected dealers to accept an export ban as a concerted practice.
(20) Deere's local dealers with such contracts have understood exports to be forbidden. Deere has told dealers that, in the context of its overall distribution system, parallel trading was undesirable or unfriendly. Deere has refused or threatened to refuse to supply goods known to be intended for export. Deere, according to the Manager of John Deere Vertrieb Deutschland, has cancelled the contracts of dealers who export. Deere has sought to supply with specifications difficult to export. Deere has instructed its staff to demand prompter payment for goods known to have been exported and refuse quantity or special discounts or other aids to selling. Finally, Deere has charged 5 % on exports. In its German contracts this last is due only for non-EEC exports - however, the Manager of John Deere Vertrieb Deutschland has said that the 5 % is collected also for deliveries into EC-countries wherever ""... possible in order to make this kind of business even more difficult for dealers."" (original English). There is evidence of all these facts in the documents quoted in the Statement of Objections and in the letter to Deere on 21 March 1984 (see paragraph 13 above). As was said in the Statement of Objections, many other documents could be cited dating from 1974 until October 1982.
Deere's knowledge of the illegality of its conduct
(21) Deere and Company knew that such conduct, and, in particular, the contractual export ban, was contrary to EEC and national competition law. It was advised on this by its in-house counsel. Senior management of Deere and Company in Moline, including a member of the main board, was fully informed.
Effects of the agreements
(22) All the national distributors mentioned in paragraph 3 above have been affected. All Member States except Italy, Ireland and Luxembourg are mentioned in the documents as being involved. These documents also comment on the substantial price differences being maintained between different Member States and on the effects of such differences.
II. LEGAL ASSESSMENT
A. Article 85 (1)
(23) Article 85 (1) provides that all agreements between undertakings and concerted practices which may affect trade between Member States and which have as their object or effect the prevention or distortion of competition within the common market shall be prohibited as incompatible with the common market.
(24) Deere and the parties listed at paragraph 3 above, and their various local dealers, are undertakings within the meaning of Article 85 of the EEC Treaty, and the contracts between them are agreements within the meaning of that provision.
(25) These agreements, and the concerted practices for their implementation, had among their objects the prevention of any trading in Deere products by any party other than Deere outside the Member State in which the party is situated. This has been clearly stated by Deere both in internal correspondence and in correspondence with its national distributors and its own local dealers. This has been understood and accepted by the national distributors and the local dealers, even though not always observed by them. This unlawful object is given effect to in some cases contractually and in others by a separate understanding backed by reprisals or threats of reprisals if the understanding is breached - contracts which do not contain explicit bans do contain clauses which make punitive measures possible (see paragraph 17).
(26) Deere has argued that Deere staff claimed to have taken action when they had not, that instructions to penalize parallel trading were disobeyed and that its attempts to prevent parallel trading were ineffective. Instructions were, however, given with the object of preventing parallel trading, senior Deere staff did say that action had been taken and there were communications with dealers requesting them not to export and threatening various consequences if they did. The burden of proof is, therefore, on Deere to show that such instructions were never obeyed and such requests were always ignored in order to establish that they had no effect ; and in the Commission's view, having regard to all the evidence, Deere has not discharged this burden. The Commission, therefore, concludes that these instructions and communications had effects.
(27) Comment on the sales conditions applied in Germany from 1 November 1972 (paragraph 16 (3) above) is perhaps called for. The export ban contained in these sales conditions is qualified by the words ""... as far as no contrary legal regulation prevents ..."". However, the Commission holds that such an article constitutes an export ban in spite of this saving clause ; the article is worded to read as if exporting is forbidden and imposed without explanation or negotiation by a company that ought to know the law on a multitude of small dealers ; such dealers are less likely to know the law and unlikely, in the circumstances, to consult a lawyer ; it is most unlikely, therefore, that the dealer would know that an export ban is contrary to Community law and could not in consequence of that fact be enforced against intra-Community exports. In other words, and in view of the fact that export bans are illegal within the common market, the drafting of this export ban constitutes a reversal of a general rule of Community law in respect of what should be only a derogation. Moreover, categoric interpretations of this clause by Deere to dealers, without any mention of the saving clause, are recorded. Deere's own in-house counsel expressed doubts as to the legitimacy of such a device.
(28) Special mention should also be made of the Article 13 subject to Deere's application on 12 November 1982 for negative clearance (see paragraph 10). The object of this Article is to inhibit exports. The second indent provides a penalty for all exports. The third indent provides a penalty for exports outside the EEC ; Deere staff say they apply this clause within the EEC when they can (see paragraph 20). The fourth indent contains the threat of a very severe penalty for exporting.
(29) Thus Deere's contracts and conduct have, among other things, prohibited exports by its customers (and required national distributors to prohibit exports by their local dealers). The Court of Justice said in the Miller International Schallplatten GmbH case, ""... by its very nature a clause prohibiting exports constitutes a restriction on competition"" (Case 19/77, Ground of Judgment 7, [1978] ECR 131). Deere has sought to prevent purchasers of Deere's products in the higher-priced Member States from benefiting from a unified market.
(30) Deere's products have a significant part of the agricultural machinery market within the European Economic Community (see paragraph 6). Deere's own documents show that substantial differences in price for Deere products have existed between different Member States of the Community, that such differences have persisted and that, in consequence, there was persistent pressure for parallel trading (which Deere tried persistently, albeit often unsuccessfully, to prevent). Under these circumstances, the Commission is entitled to conclude that the restrictions in question are not of negligible effect, and have had a direct and actual influence on the pattern of trade between Member States.
(31) Article 85 (1) of the Treaty does, therefore, apply to these agreements, including the sales conditions of the Article 13 treated at paragraph 27 above.
B. Article 85 (3)
(32) Article 85 (1) of the Treaty may be declared inapplicable pursuant to Article 85 (3) in the case of agreements which contribute to the improvement of the production or distribution of goods while reserving to users a share in these benefits, provided they contain no restriction which is not indispensable to the achievement of the benefits and do not enable the parties to eliminate competition in respect of a substantial proportion of the goods concerned.
(33) Deere has not notified any of these agreements, or any part of them, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation 17, seeking application of Article 85 (3) of the Treaty, and, therefore, no decision in application of Article 85 (3) may be taken.
(34) In any event, even had they been notified, the agreements could not have been declared exempt from the application of Article 85 (1) because the restriction of parallel trading does not appear to be indispensable to any improvement of distribution to which a network of appointed dealers might give rise.
C. Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17
(35) Under Article 15 (2) of Regulation No 17, the Commission may impose fines of from 1000 to 1 000 000 units of account or a sum in excess thereof, but not exceeding 10 % of the turnover in the preceding business year of each of the undertakings participating in the infringement, where, either intentionally or negligently, they infringe Article 85 (1) of the Treaty. In fixing the fine, regard shall be had both to the gravity and to the duration of the infringement.
(36) Deere's infringement is very serious since it involves an export ban and, consequently, the prevention of competition between the dealers in Deere's products established in different Member States.
(37) The infringement is of long duration. There has been a formal export ban since 1967. In fixing the fine the Commission has taken account of Deere's action in application of export bans since 1975 (see paragraphs 16, 19 and 20 above).
(38) The application for negative clearance under Article 2 of Regulation No 17 of 12 November 1982 does not constitute a notification for the purpose of Article 15 (5) of that Regulation and, therefore, does not even protect from fines subsequent use of Article 13 of the German General Conditions of Sales, which was the subject of that application.
(39) Deere acted intentionally. There was knowledge of the pressure for parallel trading, knowledge of its policy to prevent this trading and of the doubtful legality of many of the steps taken in order to prevent it throughout the Deere group within the Community (with the possible exception of Johne Deere Italiana) and among Deere and Company's top management in Moline, Illinois.
(40) The Commission therefore considers that a fine should be imposed on Deere.
(41) On the other hand, since receiving the Commission's Statement of Objections in August 1983, Deere and its national dealers have taken steps to remove export bans from their contracts, and Deere has begun to instruct its employees in Europe how to comply with the Community's rules on competition. In addition, the agricultural machinery sector is depressed and Deere's profitability much reduced. The Commission has taken these into consideration in deciding on the amount of the fine.
(42) Dealers which accept contracts containing export bans are also guilty of an infringement and, if the agreements are not notified, they also are liable for fines. However, the contractual export bans in this case are contained in preprinted standard contracts ; clearly, therefore, the dealers had not taken the initiative to have the bans included in their contracts and had largely ignored them. Moreover, this is the first such case in the agricultural machinery sector. The Commission feels it appropriate, therefore, not to impose a fine on the dealers in this case.
D. Article 3 of Regulation 17
(43) Under Article 3 (1) of Regulation No 17, the Commission may, if it finds that there has been an infringement of Article 85 of the Treaty, require by decision that the undertakings concerned bring such infringement to an end.
(44) It appears necessary to require Deere and all its national distributors within the Community to remove all intra-Community territorial restrictions from their agreements and practice and to refrain from seeking to reimpose such restrictions by other means,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DECISION:
Article 1
The contracts entered into by Deere and Company with its national dealers within the common market, the various contracts containing export bans entered into by Deere and Company, its subsidiaries and national dealers with their local dealers, together with the practices with which contracts have been applied since 1975 so as to prohibit, discourage or penalize trading by dealers outside the Member State in which they are established constitute an infringement of Article 85 (1) of the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community.
Article 2
Article 1 applies to Article 13 of the General Conditions of Sale of John Deere Vertrieb Deutschland, the subject of its application pursuant to Article 2 of Regulation No 17. Negative clearance for this Article 13 is not granted.
Article 3
The undertakings concerned must bring the infringement referred to in Article 1 to an end immediately and shall refrain from taking any measure having the same object or effect.
Article 4
1. The following fine is imposed on Deere and Company : 2 000 000 (two million) ECU, that is DM 4 465 720.
2. This sum shall be paid, within three months of the date of notification of this Decision, to the following account(s) in the name of the Commission of the European Communities: - account No 260/00/64910,
- Banking institution(s) Sal. Oppenheim & Cie, Untersachsenhausen 4,5000 Köln 1.

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE
of 15 September 1986
on specific training in general medical practice
(86/457/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 49, 57 and 66 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas Council Directive 75/362/EEC (4), as last amended by the 1985 Act of Accession, and Council Directive 75/363/EEC (5), as last amended by Directive 82/76/EEC (6), on freedom of movement for medical practitioners, contain no provisions regarding the mutual recognition of diplomas attesting to specific training in general medical practice or the criteria to which such training should conform;
Whereas, although the Council did not consider that the time was right to take appropriate measures on the matter at Community level, it nevertheless noted that in a number of Member States there was a growing tendency to emphasize the general medical practitioner's role and the importance of his training; whereas it accordingly requested the Commission to study the problems connected with this development;
Whereas the point has now been reached where it is almost universally recognized that there is a need for specific training for the general medical practitioner to enable him better to fulfil his function; whereas this function, which depends to a great extent on the doctor's personal knowledge of his patients' environment, consists of giving advice on the prevention of illness and on the protection of the patient's general health, besides giving appropriate treatment;
Whereas this need for specific training in general medical practice has emerged mainly as a result of the development of medical science, which has increasingly widened the gap between medical research and teaching on the one hand and general medical practice on the other, so that important aspects of general medical practice can no longer be taught in a satisfactory manner within the framework of the Member States' current basic medical training;
Whereas, apart from the benefit to patients, it is also recognized that improved training for the specific function of general medical practitioner would contribute to an improvement in health care, particularly by developing a more selective approach to the consultation of specialists, use of laboratories and other highly specialized establishments and equipment;
Whereas improved training for general medical practice will upgrade the status of the general medical practitioner;
Whereas, although this situation seems irreversible, it has developed at different rates in the various Member States; whereas it is desirable to ensure that the various trends converge in successive stages, without however forcing the pace, with a view to appropriate training for every general medical practitioner in order to satisfy the specific requirements of general medical practice;
Whereas, to ensure the gradual introduction of this reform, it is necessary in an initial stage to institute in each Member State specific training in general medical practice which satisfies minimum quality and quantity requirements, and supplements the minimum basic training which medical practitioners must receive in accordance with Directive 75/363/EEC; whereas it is immaterial whether this training in general medical practice is received as part of, or separately from, basic medical training as laid down nationally; whereas, in a second stage, provision should be made to subject the exercise of general medical practice under a social security scheme to completion of specific training in general medical practice; whereas further proposals to complete the reform should subsequently be put forward;
Whereas this Directive does not affect the power of the Member States to organize their national social security schemes and to determine what activities are to be carried out under those schemes;
Whereas the coordination, pursuant to this Directive, of the minimum conditions governing the issue of diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications certifying completion of specific training in general medical practice will render possible the mutual recognition of these diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications by the Member States;
Whereas, under Directive 75/362/EEC, a host Member State is not entitled to require medical practitioners, in possession of diplomas obtained in another Member State and recognized under that Directive, to complete any additional training in order to practise within its social security scheme, even where such training is required of holders of diplomas of medicine obtained in its own territory; whereas this consequence of Directive 75/362/EEC will remain in effect as regards the exercise of general medical practice under social security schemes until 1 January 1995, from which date the present Directive requires all Member States to make the exercise of general medical practice in the context of their social security schemes subject to the possession of specific training in general medical practice; whereas medical practitioners established in practice before that date under Directive 75/362/EEC must have an acquired right to practise as general medical practitioners under the national social security scheme of the host country even if they have not completed specific training in general medical practice,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Each Member State which dispenses the complete training referred to in Article 1 of Directive 75/363/EEC within its territory shall institute specific training in general medical practice meeting requirements at least as stringent as those laid down in Articles 2 and 3 of this Directive, in such a manner that the first diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded on completion of the course are issued not later than 1 January 1990.
Article 2
1. The specific training in general medical practice referred to in Article 1 must meet the following minimum requirements:
(a) entry shall be conditional upon the successful completion of at least six years' study within the framework of the training course referred to in Article 1 of Directive 75/363/EEC;
(b) it shall be a full-time course lasting at least two years, and shall be supervised by the competent authorities or bodies;
(c) it shall be practically rather than theoretically based; the practical instruction shall be given, on the one hand, for at least six months in an approved hospital or clinic with suitable equipment and services and, on the other hand, for at least six months in an approved general medical practice or in an approved centre where doctors provide primary care; it shall be carried out in contact with other health establishments or structures concerned with general medical practice; however, without prejudice to the aforesaid minimum periods, the practical instruction may be given for a maximum period of six months in other approved health establishments or structures concerned with general medical practice;
(d) it shall entail the personal participation of the trainee in the professional activities and responsibilities of the persons with whom he works.
2. Member States shall be entitled to defer application of the provisions of paragraph 1 (c) relating to minimum periods of instruction until 1 January 1995 at the latest.
3. Member States shall make the issue of diplomas, certificates, or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded after specific training in general medical practice, conditional upon the candidate's holding one of the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 3 of Directive 75/362/EEC.
4. Member States shall designate the authorities or bodies competent to issue the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded after specific training in general medical practice. Article 3
If, at the date of notification of this Directive, a Member State provides training in general medical practice by means of experience in general medical practice acquired by the medical practitioner in his own surgery under the supervision of an authorized training supervisor, that Member State may retain this type of training on an experimental basis on condition that:
- it complies with Article 2 (1) (a) and (b), and Article 2 (3),
- its duration is equal to twice the difference between the period laid down in Article 2 (1) (b) and the sum of the periods laid down in the third indent hereof,
- it involves a period in an approved hospital or clinic with suitable equipment and services and a period in an approved general medical practice or in an approved centre where doctors provide primary care; as from 1 January 1995, each of these periods shall be of at least six months' duration.
Article 4
On the basis of experience acquired, and in the light of developments in training in general medical practice, the Commission shall submit to the Council, by 1 January 1996 at the latest, a report on the implementation of Articles 2 and 3 and suitable proposals in order to achieve further harmonization of the training of general medical practitioners.
The Council shall act on these proposals in accordance with procedures laid down by the Treaty before 1 January 1997.
Article 5
1. Without prejudice to the principle of full-time training laid down in Article 2 (1) (b), Member States may authorize specific part-time training in general medical practice in addition to full-time training where the following particular conditions are met:
- the total duration of training may not be shortened because it is being followed on a part-time basis,
- the weekly duration of part-time training may not be less than 60 % of weekly full-time training,
- part-time training must include a certain number of full-time training periods, both for the training conducted at a hospital or clinic and for the training given in an approved medical practice or in an approved centre where doctors provide primary care. These full-time training periods shall be of sufficient number and duration as to provide adequate preparation for the effective exercise of general medical practice.
2. Part-time training must be of a level of quality equivalent to that of full-time training. It shall lead to a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification, as referred to in Article 1.
Article 6
1. Irrespective of any acquired rights they recognize, Member States may issue the diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification referred to in Article 1 to a medical practitioner who has not completed the training referred to in Articles 2 and 3 but who holds a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification issued by the competent authorities of a Member State, attesting to completion of another additonal training course; however, the Member States may issue such diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification only if it attests to a level of skill equivalent to that reached on completion of the training referred to in Articles 2 and 3.
2. In adopting their rules in accordance with paragraph 1, Member States shall specify the extent to which the additional training already completed by the candidate and his professional experience may be taken into account in place of the training referred to in Articles 2 and 3.
Member States may issue the diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification referred to in Article 1 only if the candidate has acquired at least six months' experience in general medical practice in a general medical practice or a centre where doctors provide primary care, as referred to in Article 2 (1) (c).
Article 7
1. From 1 January 1995, and subject to the acquired rights it has recognized, each Member State shall make the exercise of general medical practice under its national social security scheme conditional on possession of a diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification as referred to in Article 1.
However, Member States may exempt from this condition persons who are undergoing specific training in general medical practice.
2. Each Member State shall specify the acquired rights that it recognizes. However, it shall recognize the right to exercise the activities of gneral medical practitioner under its national social security scheme without the diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualification referred to in Article 1 as having been acquired by all those doctors who on 31 December 1994 possess such a right under Directive 75/362/EEC and who are established on its territory on that date by virtue of Article 2 or Article 9 (1) of that Directive.
3. Each Member State may apply paragraph 1 before 1 January 1995, subject to the condition that any doctor who has completed the training referred to in Article 1 of Directive 75/363/EEC in another Member State shall be able to establish himself in practice on its territory until 31 December 1994 and to practise under its national social security scheme by virtue of Article 2 or Article 9 (1) of Directive 75/362/EEC. 4. The competent authorities of each Member State shall issue on request a certificate granting doctors possessing acquired rights by virtue of paragraph 2 the right to practise as general medical practitioners under its national social security scheme without the diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 1.
5. Paragraph 1 shall in no way prejudice the possibility, which is open to Member States, of granting, in accordance with their own rules and in respect of their own territory, the right to practise as general practitioners under a social security scheme to persons who do not possess diplomas, certificates or other formal evidence of medical training and of specific training in general medical practice obtained in both cases in a Member State, but who possess diplomas, certificates or other evidence of either or both of these types of training obtained in a non-member country.
Article 8
1. Each Member State shall recognize under its national social security scheme, for the purposes of the exercise of the activities of general medical practitioner, the diplomas, certificates, or other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 1, issued to nationals of Member States by other Member States in accordance with Articles 2, 3, 5 and 6.
The certificates from the competent authorities of the Federal Republic of Germany, stating that the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications awarded by the competent authorities of the German Democratic Republic are recognized as equivalent to those listed in the first subparagraph, shall also be recognized.
2. Each Member State shall recognize the certificates referred to in Article 7 (4) issued to nationals of Member States by other Member States, and shall consider them as equivalent within its territory to the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications which it issues itself, and which permit the exercise of the activities of general medical practitioner under its national social security scheme.
Article 9
Nationals of Member States to whom a Member State has issued the diplomas, certificates or other evidence of formal qualifications referred to in Article 1 or Article 7 (4) shall have the right to use in the host Member State the professional title existing in that State and the abbreviation thereof.
Article 10
1. Without prejudice to Article 9, host Member States shall ensure that the nationals of Member States covered by Article 8 have the right to use the lawful academic title, or, where appropriate, the abbreviation thereof, of their Member State of origin or of the Member State from which they come, in the language of that Member State. Host Member States may require this title to be followed by the name and location of the establishment or examining board which awarded it.
2. If the academic title of the Member State of origin, or of the Member State from which a national comes, can be confused in the host Member State with a title requiring, in that State, additional training which the person concerned has not undergone, the host Member State concerned may require such person to use the title of the Member State of origin or of the Member State from which he comes in a suitable form to be indicated by the host Member State.
Article 11
On the basis of experience acquired, and in the light of developments in training in general medical practice, the Commission shall submit to the Council by 1 January 1997 at the latest a report on the implementation of this Directive and, if necessary, suitable proposals with a view to appropriate training for every general medical practitioner in order to satisfy the specific requirements of general medical practice. The Council shall act on those proposals in accordance with the procedures laid down in the Treaty.
Article 12
1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
They shall also notify the Commission of the date of entry into force of these measures.
2. As soon as a Member State has notified the Commission of the date of entry into force of the measures it has taken in conformity with Article 1, the Commission shall publish an appropriate notice in the Official Journal of the European Communities, indicating the designations adopted by that Member State for the diploma, certificate or other evidence of formal qualifications and, where appropriate, the professional title in question.

"COUNCIL DECISION of 29 July 1991 adopting the 'Youth for Europe' programme (second phase) (91/395/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 235 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the Member States, when they signed the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, declared themselves determined to lay the foundations of an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe;
Whereas, in order to achieve that objective, the Treaty provides for powers to take action to ensure freedom of movement for employed and self-employed persons and those receiving services;
Whereas specific measures should be taken to assist young people to develop their sense of initiative and to foster an awareness in them of their abilities and responsibilities;
Whereas, when they met on 13 December 1976 (4) and 12 July 1982 (5), the Council and the Ministers for Education, meeting within the Council, were resolved on the need adequately to prepare young people for adult and working life, and adopted action programmes relating thereto;
Whereas the European Council, meeting on 28 and 29 June 1985, adopted the conclusions of the ad hoc Committee on a People's Europe, which called for the promotion of youth exchanges within the Community and for an effective network of exchanges within and between Member States;
Whereas the European Parliament, in its resolutions of 12 March 1981 on youth activities (6), of 7 June 1983 on a European Communities programme to promote youth exchanges (7) and of 16 December 1983 on a European voluntary service scheme for young people (8), advocated strengthening Community activities in this field;
Whereas youth exchanges are an appropriate method of enabling young people to understand more about the European Community and its Member States and of promoting social cohesion within the Community; whereas they thus contribute to the training and preparation of young people for adult and working life and to the development of a greater awareness of their abilities and responsibilities;
Whereas, since substantial improvement in the quality and quantity of youth exchanges and mobility can be achieved by a series of support measures at Community level complementing the measures taken by the Member States and taking into account the experience and the current contribution of bodies already working in this field;
Whereas on 16 June 1988 the Council adopted Decision 88/348/EEC establishing the 'Youth for Europe' action programme (9) to promote youth exchanges in the Community; whereas it is now expedient to extend that programme;
Whereas a programme lasting three years is called for;
Whereas an amount of ECU 25 million is estimated as necessary to implement this multiannual programme; whereas, for the year 1992, in the framework of the current financial perspective, the funds estimated as necessary are ECU 10 million;
Whereas the amounts to be committed for the financing of the programme for the period after the budget year 1992 will have to fall within the Community financial framework in force;
Whereas the Treaty does not provide, for the adoption of this Decision, powers of action other than those of Article 235,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:

COUNCIL REGULATION (EEC) No 1539/88
of 24 May 1988
opening, allocating and providing for the administration of a Community tariff quota for apricot pulp originating in Turkey
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 113 thereof,
Having regard to the proposals from the Commission,
Whereas the Annex to Council Regulation (EEC) No 4115/86 of 22 December 1986 on import into the Community of agricultural products in Turkey (1) provides for the opening by the Community of an annual Community tariff quota of 90 tonnes at zero duty for apricot pulp originating in Turkey; whereas such a quota has been opened for the period up to 30 June 1988 by Regulation (EEC) No 1639/87 (2); whereas the tariff quota in question should therefore be opened for the abovementioned volume for the period 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989;
Whereas, in accordance with Article 119 of the Act of Accession of Greece, the Council adopted Regulation (EEC) No 3555/80 of 16 December 1980 determining the arangements to be applied with regard to imports into Greece, originating in Algeria, Israel, Malta, Morocco, Portugal, Syria, Tunisia or Turkey (3); whereas the Council has also adopted Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87 of 11 August 1987 laying down the arrangements for trade between Spain and Portugal on the one hand and Algeria, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Tunisia and Turkey (4) on the other; whereas this Regulation applies therefore to the Community with the exception of Greece;
Whereas it is necessary, in particular, to ensure to all Community importers equal and uninterrupted access to the rate laid down for that quota to all imports of the products concerned into all Member States until the quota has been used up; whereas, however, since the quota is to cover requirements which cannot be determined with sufficient accuracy, it should not be allocated among the Member States, without prejudice to the drawing against the quota volume of such quantities as they may need, under the conditions and according to a procedure to be determined; whereas this method of management requires close cooperation between the Member States and the Commission and the latter must in particular be able to monitor the rate at which the quota is used up and inform the Member States thereof;
Whereas, since the Kingdom of Belgium, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg are united within, and jointly represented by the Benelux Economic Union, all transactions concerning the administration of shares allocated to that economic union may be carried out by any one of its members,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
1. From 1 July 1988 to 30 June 1989 the customs duty applicable to the following product, originating in Turkey, shall be suspended in the Community with the exception of Greece at the level and within the limit of a Community tariff quota as shown herewith:
1.2.3.4.5 // // // // // // Order No // CN code // Description // Amount of quota (in tonnes) // Quota duty (%) // // // // // // // // // // // 09.0203 // ex 2008 50 91 // Apricot pulp neither containing added spirit nor added sugar in immediate packings of a net content of 4,5 kg or more // 90 // 0 // // 250, 1. 9. 1987, p. 1.
2. Within the framework of this tariff quota, the Kingdom of Spain and the Portuguese Republic shall apply a customs duts calculated in accordance with the provisions of the Act of Accession and Regulation (EEC) No 2573/87.
3. If an importer notifies an imminent importation of the product in question in a Member State and requests the benefit of the quota, the Member State concerned shall inform the Commission and draw an amount corresponding to its requirements to the extent that the available balance of the reserve so permits.
4. The shares drawn pursuant to paragraph 3 shall be valid until the end of the quota period.
Article 2
1. Member States shall take all appropriate measures to ensure that their drawings pursuant to Article 1 (3) are carried out in such a way that imports may be charged without interruption against their accumulated shares of the Community quota.
2. Each Member State shall ensure that importers of the product concerned have access to the quota for such time as the residual balance of the quota volume so permits.
3. Member States shall charge imports of the product concerned against their drawings as and when the product is entered for free circulation.
4. The extent to which the quota has been used up shall be determined on the basis of the imports charged in accordance with paragraph 3.
Article 3

(1) Whereas it is necessary to improve the comparability between the Member States in the data for changes in real gross domestic product (GDP), both with a view to the application of Article 2 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97 of 7 July 1997 on speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the excessive deficit procedure (3) and the resolution of the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact (Amsterdam, 17 June 1997) (4) and for the purpose of multilateral surveillance more generally;
(2) Whereas the implementation and supervision of Economic and Monetary Union require comparable, up-to-date and reliable information on the structure and developments in the economic situation of each Member State;

COUNCIL DECISION
of 26 September 1988
adopting a pilot project on remote sensing applied to agricultural statistics
(88/503/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 43 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Whereas, in order to meet the needs of the common agricultural policy, action is needed to identify and measure as accurately and rapidly as possible the areas under main crops, and in particular those for which production aid is granted on an area basis;
Whereas, for the management of the agricultural markets, reliable regionally-based estimates of production must be available in good time;
Whereas the availability of forecasts for the production of crops which have the greatest impact on world markets, in third countries, is also relevant to the management of agricultural markets and for the independence of Community decision-making;
Whereas remote sensing could be likely to offer a response to these needs, which have not been met to date by the existing agricultural statistics and forecasting systems; whereas it could enhance the accuracy, objectivity, speed and frequency with which observations are made when statistical data are collected; whereas it could help perfect agricultural forecasting models, and in particular establish regionally-based agricultural forecasting models;
Whereas remote sensing must be incorporated into the existing statistical systems to make good sepcific deficiencies or weaknesses and to replace to better advantage certain aspects of the work currently being carried out;
Whereas remote sensing could have applications - in its own right or as an adjunct - in the establishment and collection of agricultural statistics;
Whereas a consultation procedure setting up close co-operation between the Member States and the Commission on the basis of past and present experience gained by the Member States in incorporating remote sensing in existing statistical systems, in particular through the medium of the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics set up by Decision 72/279/EEC (2);
Whereas remote sensing could help align the Member States' various agricultural statistical systems, by establishing a common means of collecting and transmitting information;
Whereas remote sensing could enable savings to be planned in the future, either directly in the cost of drawing up sampling plans and of collecting statistical data, or indirectly in expenditure of the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF);
Whereas steps should be taken to develop the operational applications of remote sensing to agricultural statistics in the short, medium and long term, and to continue the measures embarked upon;
Whereas these operational applications of remote sensing to agricultural statistics must be conducted in a manner which is compatible with the programme adopted by Decision 85/318/EEC (1) on the establishment of an information system on the state of the environment and natural resources in the Community,
HAS DECIDED AS FOLLOWS:
Article 1
1. The pilot project on remote sensing applied to agricultural statistics, set out in the Annex, is hereby adopted for a period of five years from 1 January 1989.
2. It shall be carried out by the Joint Research Centre in close collaboration with national laboratories and bodies, including statistical departments.
3. The amount of financing estimated as necessary for the total duration of the project amounts to 35,5 million ECU, divided into annual tranches as shown in the Annex.
4. The Council shall review the project, including its financial aspects, on the basis of the first report referred to in Article 3, before 30 April 1991.
Article 2
The Commission shall be responsible for the execution of the project and shall annually inform the Member States of the state of progress of the work, in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 4.
Article 3
1. The Commission shall submit to the European Parliament and to the Council by 31 December 1990 a report on the state of progress of the work and, where necessary, proposals on the review of the project as provided for in Article 1 (4),
2. On completion of the project, and in any case not later than 31 July 1994, the Commission shall report to the European Parliament and to the Council on the overall results of the activities provided for in this Decision and on the use of the financial resources allocated to these measures.
Article 4
1. Where the procedure laid down in this Article is to be followed, the chairman shall refer the matter to the Standing Committee on Agricultural Statistics, hereinafter referred to as the 'committee' either on his own initiative or at the request of the representative of a Member State.
2. The representative of the Commission shall submit to the committee a draft of the measures to be taken. The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft, within a time limit which the chairman may lay down according to the urgency of the matter, if necessary by taking a vote.
3. The opinion shall be recorded in the minutes. In addition, each Member State shall have the right to ask to have its position recorded in the minutes.
4. The Commission shall take the utmost account of the opinion delivered by the committee. It shall inform the committee of the manner in which its opinion has been taken into account.
Article 5
This Decision shall take effect on 1 January 1989.

"COUNCIL REGULATION (EC) No 1100/98 of 25 May 1998 amending Regulation (EEC) No 1615/89 establishing a European forestry information and communication system (EFICS)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 213 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Whereas the period of application of Council Regulation (EEC) No 1615/89 of 29 May 1989 establishing a European forestry information and communication system (EFICS) (1) expired on 31 December 1997;
Whereas several Community measures have already been undertaken to establish the system based mainly on an analysis of the reliability and comparability of the data obtained from Member States' forest inventories and on improving coordination of the statistical work undertaken by international organisations on the forest sector; whereas that work has demonstrated the timeliness of the process initiated by the Community and the benefits which the latter can expect from the continuation of that work;
Whereas the system cannot be implemented unless the Member States take appropriate measures to that end; whereas such measures must be specified in a work-programme prepared by the Commission and presented to the Standing Forestry Committee;
Whereas the implementation of Community policies, the European Union's international commitments as part of the post-Helsinki process and the special session of the United Nations General Assembly (1997) (UNGASS) and the work of the European Environmental Agency require that the measures to be taken to improve the quality of international forestry data and to improve the use of the computer and data-processing techniques most suitable for disseminating those data, should be reinforced;
Whereas, furthermore, the European Parliament Resolution of 30 January 1997 on the European Union's forestry strategy (2) stresses that the Commission must ensure that EFICS is effectively implemented; whereas the own-initiative opinion of the Economic and Social Committee of 24 April 1997 on the situation and problems of forestry in the European Union and potential for developing forestry policies (3) notes the importance of improving information in the forestry sector and the contribution that EFICS could make to that, in particular by including data on forest protection;
Whereas the above Regulation should therefore be extended and amended to take account of the above requirements,
HAS ADOPTED THIS REGULATION:
Article 1
Regulation (EEC) No 1615/89 is hereby amended as follows:
1. Article 1 shall be replaced by the following:
'Article 1
In order to collect and provide objective, reliable, comparable and pertinent information on the structure and operation of the forestry sector in the Community, and thus:
- improve consideration of the interests of the forestry sector in international discussions,
- facilitate the implementation of measures in favour of the forestry sector under existing Community policies,
- facilitate implementation of Member States' policies relating to forestry or having an impact on the forestry sector,
- permit access by the general public to information on the European forestry sector,
a European forestry information and communication system (EFICS), hereinafter called ""the System"", is hereby set up, the objective of which is to collect, coordinate, standardise, process and disseminate information concerning the forestry sector and its development`.
2. Article 3 shall be replaced by the following:
'Article 3
The Commission shall set up the System in close cooperation with the Member States and international bodies active in the field of European forestry statistics during a period commencing 1 January 1989 and ending on 31 December 2002.
To improve the comparability and completeness of the data at the European level, implementation of the System may require that Member States, after obtaining the opinion of the Standing Forestry Committee set up by Decision 89/367/EEC (1), adjust or supplement their procedures for the collection of data, in particular where the evaluation of forestry resources and the monitoring of the timber and forestry products market are concerned.
The Commission shall, where appropriate, support measures undertaken by Member States and international organisations such as the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Economic Commission for Europe and intended to meet the specific requirements for setting up the System.

The opinion shall be by a majority as provided for in Article 148(2) of the Treaty for the adoption of decisions which the Council is requested to take on a proposal from the Commission. Member States' votes in the Committee shall be weighted as set out in the said Article. The chairman shall not have a vote.
3. (a) The Commission shall adopt the envisaged measures where they are in accordance with the opinion of the Committee.
(b) Where the envisaged measures are not in accordance with the opinion of the Committee, or in the absence of an opinion, the Commission shall present the Council without delay with a proposal on the measures to be taken. The Council shall decide on the proposal by qualified majority.

Whereas, in view of the ecological sensitivity of the Mediterranean environment and the pressures to which it is exposed, the environmental operations carried out at regional, national, Community and international level must be intensified and made more effective;
Whereas, since the region forms an ecological entity, protection of the Mediterranean would be inconceivable without a combined effort by all the coastal States;
Whereas, by virtue of geomorphological and socio-economic similarities, the Atlantic coast of the Iberian peninsula, south of the river Tagus, is an ecological entity linked with the Mediterranean region;
Whereas the Community should contribute to implementation of the environmental operations by providing financial support for certain specific measures;
Whereas a management committee should be set up to assist the Commission in implementing this Regulation,

COUNCIL DIRECTIVE
of 16 September 1985
concerning the coordination of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of certain activities in the field of pharmacy
(85/432/EEC)
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Articles 49 and 57 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas persons who hold a diploma, certificate or other formal qualification in pharmacy are for that reason specialists in the field of medicinal products and, in principle, must have access in all the Member States to a minimum range of activities in that field; whereas, in defining that minimum range, this Directive does not have the effect of limiting the activities accessible in the Member States to pharmacists, in particular with regard to medical biology analyses, and does not give them any monopoly, since the creation of a monopoly continues to be a matter for the Member States alone;
Whereas, moreover, this Directive does not ensure coordination of all conditions of access to and pursuit of activities in the field of pharmacy; whereas, in particular, the geographical distribution of pharmacies and the monopoly of the supply of medicinal products continue to be matters for the Member States;
Whereas, with a view to achieving mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in pharmacy, as required by Council Directive 85/433/EEC of 16 September 1985 concerning the mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in pharmacy, including measures to facilitate the effective exercise of the right of establishment relating to certain activities in the field of pharmacy (4), the broad comparability of training courses in the Member States enables coordination in this field to be confined to the requirement that minimum standards be observed, thus leaving the Member States freedom of organization as regards teaching;
Whereas this Directive does not prevent the Member States from requiring supplementary conditions of training for access to activities not included in the coordinated minimum range of activities; whereas for this reason a host Member State which lays down such conditions may subject thereto nationals of Member States who hold one of the diplomas referred to in Article 4 of Directive 85/433/EEC;
Whereas the coordination provided for by this Directive covers professional qualifications; whereas, as regards such qualifications, most Member States do not at present distinguish between professional persons who pursue their activities as employed persons and those who are self-employed; whereas, for this reason, it appears necessary to extend the application of this Directive to employed professional persons;
Whereas further training is being developed in the Member States in certain aspects of pharmacy which is intended to extend certain areas of knowledge acquired during the training of pharmacists; whereas, therefore, with a view to mutual recognition of diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications in pharmacy specialities and in order to put all members of the profession who are nationals of the Member States on an equal footing within the Community, some coordination of the requirements for training in pharmacy specialities is necessary where there are specialized forms of training common to several Member States which can entitle a person to use a specialist title, without such training being a condition of access to the activities included in the coordinated minimum range of activities; whereas such coordination does not seem possible at this stage, but constitutes an objective to be attained as soon as possible together with the relevant mutual recognition,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
1. Member States shall ensure that holders of a diploma, certificate or other university or equivalent qualification in pharmacy which meets the conditions laid down in Article 2 shall be entitled at least to access to the activities mentioned in paragraph 2 and to pursue such activities subject, where appropriate, to the requirement of additional professional experience.
2. The activities referred to in paragraph 1 are:
- the preparation of the pharmaceutical form of medicinal products,
- the manufacture and testing of medicinal products,
- the testing of medicinal products in a laboratory for the of medicinal of medicinal products,
- the storage, preservation and distribution of medicinal products at the wholesale stage,
- the preparation, testing, storage and supply of medicinal products in pharmacies open to the public,
- the preparation, testing, storage and dispensing of medicinal products in hospitals,
- the provisions of information and advice on medicinal products.
3. Where at the time of adoption of this Directive a system of competition based on tests exists in a Member State for the purpose of selecting from among the holders referred to in paragraph 1 those to be appointed to control the new pharmacies to be set up under a national geographical distribution system, that Member State may, by way of derogation from paragraph 1, retain this competition system and may oblige nationals of the Member States holding the diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications in pharmacy referred to in Article 2 (1) and Article 6 of Directive 85/433/EEC to take part in such a competition.
Article 2
Member States shall subordinate the award of the diplomas, certificates and other formal qualifications referred to in Article 1 to the following minimum conditions:
1. Training leading to the award of the diploma, certificate or other formal qualification shall ensure:
(a) adequate knowledge of medicines and the substances used in the manufacture of medicines;
(b) adequate knowledge of pharmaceutical technology and the physical, chemical, biological and microbiological testing of medicinal products;
(c) adequate knowledge of the metabolism and the effects of medicinal products and of the action of toxic substances, and of the use of medicinal products;
(d) adequate knowledge to evaluate scientific data concerning medicines in order to be able to supply appropriate information on the basis of this knowledge;
(e) adequate knowledge of the legal and other requirements associated with the practice of pharmacy.
2. In order to be accepted for such training, the candidate must have a diploma or a certificate which entitles him to be admitted for the course of study concerned to the universities of a Member State or to higher education institutions recognized as having equivalent status.
3. The diploma, certificate or other formal qualification shall testify to the completion of a course of training covering a period of at least five years and comprising:
- at least four years of full-time theoretical and practical training in a university, in a higher education institution of a level recognized as having equivalent status, or under the supervision of a university,
- at least six months of in-service training in a pharmacy open to the public or in a hospital under the supervision of the pharamaceutical department of that hospital. 4. By way of derogation from point 3:
(a) if at the time of the adoption of this Directive two courses of training coexist in a Member State, one of which lasts five years and the other four years, the diploma, certificate or other formal qualification testifying to the completion of the four-year course of training, shall be considered to fulfil the condition concerning duration referred to in point 3 provided that the diplomas, certificates or other formal qualifications testifying to the completion of the two courses of training are recognized as equivalent by that State;
(b) if, because, there are insufficient places in pharmacies open to the public and in hospitals near training establishments, a Member State is unable to provide six months of in-service training, it may, for a period of five years following the expiry of the time limit laid down in Article 5, make provision for no more than half of that training period to involve activities as a pharmacist in an undertaking which manufactures medicinal products.
5. The course of training referred to in point 3 shall comprise as a minimum theoretical and practical training in the following subjects:
- Plant and animal biology,
- Physics,
- General and inorganic chemistry,
- Organic chemistry,
- Analytical chemistry,
- Pharmaceutical chemistry, including analysis of medicinal products,
- General and applied biochemistry (medical),
- Anatomy and physiology; medical terminology,
- Microbiology,
- Pharmacology and pharmacotherapy,
- Pharmaceutical technology,
- Toxicology,
- Pharmacognosy,
- Legislation and, where appropriate, professional ethics.
The balance between theoretical and practical training shall, in respect of each subject, give sufficient importance to theory to maintain the university character of the training.
Article 3
Not more than three years after the expiry of the time limit laid down in Article 5, the Commission shall submit to the Council appropriate proposals on specializations in pharmacy and in particular hospital pharmacy. The Council shall examine these proposals within one year.
Article 4
This Directive shall also apply to nationals of Member States who, in accordance with Council Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (1), are pursuing or will pursue, as employed persons, one of the activities referred to in Article 1 of Directive 85/433/EEC.
Article 5
1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to comply with this Directive before 1 October 1987. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
2. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the main provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.
Article 6
Where a Member State encounters major difficulties in certain fields when applying this Directive, the Commission shall examine these difficulties in conjunction with that State and shall request the opinion of the Pharmaceutical Committee set up by Council Decision 75/320/EEC (2).
Where necessary, the Commission shall submit appropriate proposals to the Council.
Article 7
This Directive is addressed to the Member States.

"COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 2005/92/EC
of 12 December 2005
amending Directive 77/388/EEC with regard to the length of time during which the minimum standard rate of VAT is to be applied
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 93 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee (1),
Whereas:
(1)
The second subparagraph of Article 12(3)(a) of the sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes - Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (2), lays down that the Council shall decide on the level of the standard rate to be applied after 31 December 2005.
(2)
The standard rate of value added tax (VAT) currently in force in the various Member States, combined with the mechanisms of the transitional system, has ensured that this system has functioned to an acceptable degree. It is nonetheless important to prevent a growing divergence in the standard rates of VAT applied by the Member States from leading to structural imbalances within the Community and distortions of competition in some sectors of activity.
(3)
It is therefore appropriate to maintain the minimum standard rate at 15 % for a further period long enough to cover the ongoing implementation of the strategy to simplify and modernise current Community legislation on VAT.
(4)
Directive 77/388/EEC should be amended accordingly,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
The first and second subparagraphs of Article 12(3)(a) of Directive 77/388/EEC shall be replaced by the following:
‘The standard rate of value added tax shall be fixed by each Member State as a percentage of the taxable amount and shall be the same for the supply of goods and for the supply of services. From 1 January 2006 until 31 December 2010, the standard rate may not be less than 15 %.
The Council shall decide, in accordance with Article 93 of the Treaty, on the level of the standard rate to be applied after 31 December 2010.’
Article 2
1. Member States shall bring into force the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive with effect from 1 January 2006. They shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
2. When Member States adopt the measures, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such a reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such reference shall be laid down by Member States.
3. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the text of the provisions of national law which they adopt in the field covered by this Directive.
Article 3
This Directive shall enter into force on the day of its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union.

"SIXTH COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 92/20/EEC of 26 March 1992 on summertime arrangements
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITIES,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 100a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission (1),
In cooperation with the European Parliament (2),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (3),
Whereas the Fifth Council Directive 89/47/EEC, of 21 December 1988 on summertime arrangements (4) introduced a common date and time throughout the Community for the beginning of the summertime period for 1990, 1991 and 1992 and, for the end of that period in those years, two different dates, one for Member States apart from Ireland and the United Kingdom and one for Ireland and the United Kingdom;
Whereas, for as long as Member States apply summertime arrangements, it is important for the establishment and functioning of the internal market that a common date and time for both the beginning and end of the summertime period should be fixed in the whole Community area from 1993 onwards;
Whereas, for geographical reasons, Ireland and the United Kingdom should, however, be afforded the possibility of fixing, for one or both of the two years 1993 and 1994, an end date for summertime different from that provided for the other Member States;
Whereas Article 4 of the Fifth Directive provides that the Council, acting on a proposal of the Commission, shall adopt before 1 January 1992 the arrangements to apply from 1993 onwards;
Whereas, for geographical reasons, common summertime arrangements should not apply to the overseas territories of the Member States;
Whereas it is appropriate to re-examine the summertime period from time to time and whereas provisions should therefore be adopted for 1993 and 1994,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
For the purposes of this Directive, the expression 'summertime period' shall mean the period of the year during which time is advanced by 60 minutes in relation to the time for the rest of the year.
Article 2
Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that in each Member State the summertime period for 1993 and 1994 begins at 1 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday in March, that is to say:
- in 1993: on 28 March,
- in 1994: on 27 March.
Article 3
1. Member States shall take the measures necessary to ensure that in each Member State the summertime period for 1993 and 1994 ends at 1 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the last Sunday in September, that is to say:
- in 1993: on 26 September,
- in 1994: on 25 September.
2. Ireland and the United Kingdom may, however, take the measures necessary to ensure that the summertime period for 1993 and 1994 ends at 1 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on the fourth Sunday in October, that is to say:
- in 1993: on 24 October,
- in 1994: on 23 October.
3. Should Ireland and the United Kingdom decide, before 1994, to bring the end of their summertime period into line with the dates provided for in paragraph 1, they shall notify the Commission, which will inform the other Member States thereof.
Article 4

"COUNCIL DIRECTIVE 93/104/EC of 23 November 1993 concerning certain aspects of the organization of working time
THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 118a thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1) ,
In cooperation with the European Parliament(2) ,
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee(3) ,
Whereas Article 118a of the Treaty provides that the Council shall adopt, by means of directives, minimum requirements for encouraging improvements, especially in the working environment, to ensure a better level of protection of the safety and health of workers;
Whereas, under the terms of that Article, those directives are to avoid imposing administrative, financial and legal constraints in a way which would hold back the creation and development of small and medium-sized undertakings;
Whereas the provisions of Council Directive 89/391/EEC of 12 June 1989 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work(4) are fully applicable to the areas covered by this Directive without prejudice to more stringent and/or specific provisions contained therein;
Whereas the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, adopted at the meeting of the European Council held at Strasbourg on 9 December 1989 by the Heads of State or of Government of 11 Member States, and in particular points 7, first subparagraph, 8 and 19, first subparagraph, thereof, declared that:
'7. The completion of the internal market must lead to an improvement in the living and working conditions of workers in the European Community. This process must result from an approximation of these conditions while the improvement is being maintained, as regards in particular the duration and organization of working time and forms of employment other than open-ended contracts, such as fixed-term contracts, part-time working, temporary work and seasonal work.
8. Every worker in the European Community shall have a right to a weekly rest period and to annual paid leave, the duration of which must be progressively harmonized in accordance with national practices.
19. Every worker must enjoy satisfactory health and safety conditions in his working environment. Appropriate measures must be taken in order to achieve further harmonization of conditions in this area while maintaining the improvements made.';
Whereas the improvement of workers' safety, hygiene and health at work is an objective which should not be subordinated to purely economic considerations;
Whereas this Directive is a practical contribution towards creating the social dimension of the internal market;
Whereas laying down minimum requirements with regard to the organization of working time is likely to improve the working conditions of workers in the Community;
Whereas, in order to ensure the safety and health of Community workers, the latter must be granted minimum daily, weekly and annual periods of rest and adequate breaks; whereas it is also necessary in this context to place a maximum limit on weekly working hours;
Whereas account should be taken of the principles of the International Labour Organization with regard to the organization of working time, including those relating to night work;
Whereas, with respect to the weekly rest period, due account should be taken of the diversity of cultural, ethnic, religious and other factors in the Member States; whereas, in particular, it is ultimately for each Member State to decide whether Sunday should be included in the weekly rest period, and if so to what extent;
Whereas research has shown that the human body is more sensitive at night to environmental disturbances and also to certain burdensome forms of work organization and that long periods of night work can be detrimental to the health of workers and can endanger safety at the workplace;
Whereas there is a need to limit the duration of periods of night work, including overtime, and to provide for employers who regularly use night workers to bring this information to the attention of the competent authorities if they so request;
Whereas it is important that night workers should be entitled to a free health assessment prior to their assignment and thereafter at regular intervals and that whenever possible they should be transferred to day work for which they are suited if they suffer from health problems;
Whereas the situation of night and shift workers requires that the level of safety and health protection should be adapted to the nature of their work and that the organization and functioning of protection and prevention services and resources should be efficient;
Whereas specific working conditions may have detrimental effects on the safety and health of workers; whereas the organization of work according to a certain pattern must take account of the general principle of adapting work to the worker;
Whereas, given the specific nature of the work concerned, it may be necessary to adopt separate measures with regard to the organization of working time in certain sectors or activities which are excluded from the scope of this Directive;
Whereas, in view of the question likely to be raised by the organization of working time within an undertaking, it appears desirable to provide for flexibility in the application of certain provisions of this Directive, whilst ensuring compliance with the principles of protecting the safety and health of workers;
Whereas it is necessary to provide that certain provisions may be subject to derogations implemented, according to the case, by the Member States or the two sides of industry; whereas, as a general rule, in the event of a derogation, the workers concerned must be given equivalent compensatory rest periods,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:

(a) in the case of activities where the worker's place of work and his place of residence are distant from one another or where the worker's different places of work are distant from one another;
(b) in the case of security and surveillance activities requiring a permanent presence in order to protect property and persons, particularly security guards and caretakers or security firms;
(c) in the case of activities involving the need for continuity of service or production, particularly:
(i) services relating to the reception, treatment and/or care provided by hospitals or similar establishments, residential institutions and prisons;
(ii) dock or airport workers;
(iii) press, radio, television, cinematographic production, postal and telecommunications services, ambulance, fire and civil protection services;
(iv) gas, water and electricity production, transmission and distribution, household refuse collection and incineration plants;
(v) industries in which work cannot be interrupted on technical grounds;
(vi) research and development activities;
(vii) agriculture;
(d) where there is a foreseeable surge of activity, particularly in:
(i) agriculture;
(ii) tourism;
(iii) postal services;
2.2. from Articles 3, 4, 5, 8 and 16:
(a) in the circumstances described in Article 5 (4) of Directive 89/391/EEC;
(b) in cases of accident or imminent risk of accident;
2.3. from Articles 3 and 5:
(a) in the case of shift work activities, each time the worker changes shift and cannot take daily and/or weekly rest periods between the end of one shift and the start of the next one;
(b) in the case of activities involving periods of work split up over the day, particularly those of cleaning staff.
3. Derogations may be made from Articles 3, 4, 5, 8 and 16 by means of collective agreements or agreements concluded between the two sides of industry at national or regional level or, in conformity with the rules laid down by them, by means of collective agreements or agreements concluded between the two sides of industry at a lower level.
Member States in which there is no statutory system ensuring the conclusion of collective agreements or agreements concluded between the two sides of industry at national or regional level, on the matters covered by this Directive, or those Member States in which there is a specific legislative framework for this purpose and within the limits thereof, may, in accordance with national legislation and/or practice, allow derogations from Articles 3, 4, 5, 8 and 16 by way of collective agreements or agreements concluded between the two sides of industry at the appropriate collective level.
The derogations provided for in the first and second subparagraphs shall be allowed on condition that equivalent compensating rest periods are granted to the workers concerned or, in exceptional cases where it is not possible for objective reasons to grant such periods, the workers concerned are afforded appropriate protection.
Member States may lay down rules:
- for the application of this paragraph by the two sides of industry, and
- for the extension of the provisions of collective agreements or agreements concluded in conformity with this paragraph to other workers in accordance with national legislation and/or practice.
4. The option to derogate from point 2 of Article 16, provided in paragraph 2, points 2.1. and 2.2. and in paragraph 3 of this Article, may not result in the establishment of a reference period exceeding six months.
However, Member States shall have the option, subject to compliance with the general principles relating to the protection of the safety and health of workers, of allowing, for objective or technical reasons or reasons concerning the organization of work, collective agreements or agreements concluded between the two sides of industry to set reference periods in no event exceeding 12 months.
Before the expiry of a period of seven years from the date referred to in Article 18 (1) (a), the Council shall, on the basis of a Commission proposal accompanied by an appraisal report, re-examine the provisions of this paragraph and decide what action to take.
Article 18
Final provisions
1. (a) Member States shall adopt the laws, regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with this Directive by 23 November 1996, or shall ensure by that date that the two sides of industry establish the necessary measures by agreement, with Member States being obliged to take any necessary steps to enable them to guarantee at all times that the provisions laid down by this Directive are fulfilled.
(b) (i) However, a Member State shall have the option not to apply Article 6, while respecting the general principles of the protection of the safety and health of workers, and provided it takes the necessary measures to ensure that:
- no employer requires a worker to work more than 48 hours over a seven-day period, calculated as an average for the reference period referred to in point 2 of Article 16, unless he has first obtained the worker's agreement to perform such work,
- no worker is subjected to any detriment by his employer because he is not willing to give his agreement to perform such work,
- the employer keeps up-to-date records of all workers who carry out such work,
- the records are placed at the disposal of the competent authorities, which may, for reasons connected with the safety and/or health of workers, prohibit or restrict the possibility of exceeding the maximum weekly working hours,
- the employer provides the competent authorities at their request with information on cases in which agreement has been given by workers to perform work exceeding 48 hours over a period of seven days, calculated as an average for the reference period referred to in point 2 of Article 16.
Before the expiry of a period of seven years from the date referred to in (a), the Council shall, on the basis of a Commission proposal accompanied by an appraisal report, re-examine the provisions of this point (i) and decide on what action to take.
(ii) Similarly, Member States shall have the option, as regards the application of Article 7, of making use of a transitional period of not more than three years from the date referred to in (a), provided that during that transitional period:
- every worker receives three weeks' paid annual leave in accordance with the conditions for the entitlement to, and granting of, such leave laid down by national legislation and/or practice, and
- the three-week period of paid annual leave may not be replaced by an allowance in lieu, except where the employment relationship is terminated.
(c) Member states shall forthwith inform the Commission thereof.
2. When Member States adopt the measures referred to in paragraph 1, they shall contain a reference to this Directive or shall be accompanied by such reference on the occasion of their official publication. The methods of making such a reference shall be laid down by the Member states.
3. Without prejudice to the right of Member States to develop, in the light of changing circumstances, different legislative, regulatory or contractual provisions in the field of working time, as long as the minimum requirements provided for in this Directive are complied with, implementation of this Directive shall not constitute valid grounds for reducing the general level of protection afforded to workers.
4. Member States shall communicate to the Commission the texts of the provisions of national law already adopted or being adopted in the field governed by this Directive.
5. Member States shall report to the Commission every five years on the practical implementation of the provisions of this Directive, indicating the viewpoints of the two sides of industry.
The Commission shall inform the European Parliament, the Council, the Economic and Social Committee and the Advisory Committee on Safety, Hygiene and Health Protection at Work thereof.
6. Every five years the Commission shall submit to the European Parliament, the Council and the Economic and Social Committee a report on the application of this Directive taking into account paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.

on the education of the children of migrant workers

Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, and in particular Article 49 thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission,
Having regard to the opinion of the European Parliament (1),
Having regard to the opinion of the Economic and Social Committee (2)
Whereas in its resolution of 21 January 1974 concerning a social action programme (3), the Council included in its priority actions those designed to improve the conditions of freedom of movement for workers relating in particular to reception and to the education of their children;
Whereas in order to permit the integration of such children into the educational environment and the school system of the host State, they should be able to receive suitable tuition including teaching of the language of the host State;
Whereas host Member States should also take, in conjunction with the Member States of origin, appropriate measures to promote the teaching of the mother tongue and of the culture of the country of origin of the abovementioned children, with a view principally to facilitating their possible reintegration into the Member State of origin,
HAS ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
This Directive shall apply to children for whom school attendance is compulsory under the laws of the host State, who are dependants of any worker who is a national of another Member State, where such children are resident in the territory of the Member State in which that national carries on or has carried on an activity as an employed person.
Article 2
Member States shall, in accordance with their national circumstances and legal systems, take appropriate measures to ensure that free tuition to facilitate initial reception is offered in their territory to the children referred to in Article 1, including, in particular, the teaching - adapted to the specific needs of such children - of the official language or one of the official languages of the host State.
Member States shall take the measures necessary for the training and further training of the teachers who are to provide this tuition.
Article 3

"Directive 2004/35/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council
of 21 April 2004
on environmental liability with regard to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage
THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL OF THE EUROPEAN UNION,
Having regard to the Treaty establishing the European Community, and in particular Article 175(1) thereof,
Having regard to the proposal from the Commission(1),
Having regard to the Opinion of the European Economic and Social Committee(2),
After consulting the Committee of the Regions,
Acting in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 251 of the Treaty(3), in the light of the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee on 10 March 2004,
Whereas:
(1) There are currently many contaminated sites in the Community, posing significant health risks, and the loss of biodiversity has dramatically accelerated over the last decades. Failure to act could result in increased site contamination and greater loss of biodiversity in the future. Preventing and remedying, insofar as is possible, environmental damage contributes to implementing the objectives and principles of the Community's environment policy as set out in the Treaty. Local conditions should be taken into account when deciding how to remedy damage.
(2) The prevention and remedying of environmental damage should be implemented through the furtherance of the ""polluter pays"" principle, as indicated in the Treaty and in line with the principle of sustainable development. The fundamental principle of this Directive should therefore be that an operator whose activity has caused the environmental damage or the imminent threat of such damage is to be held financially liable, in order to induce operators to adopt measures and develop practices to minimise the risks of environmental damage so that their exposure to financial liabilities is reduced.
(3) Since the objective of this Directive, namely to establish a common framework for the prevention and remedying of environmental damage at a reasonable cost to society, cannot be sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore be better achieved at Community level by reason of the scale of this Directive and its implications in respect of other Community legislation, namely Council Directive 79/409/EEC of 2 April 1979 on the conservation of wild birds(4), Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora(5), and Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy(6), the Community may adopt measures in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity as set out in Article 5 of the Treaty. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, as set out in that Article, this Directive does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that objective.
(4) Environmental damage also includes damage caused by airborne elements as far as they cause damage to water, land or protected species or natural habitats.
(5) Concepts instrumental for the correct interpretation and application of the scheme provided for by this Directive should be defined especially as regards the definition of environmental damage. When the concept in question derives from other relevant Community legislation, the same definition should be used so that common criteria can be used and uniform application promoted.
(6) Protected species and natural habitats might also be defined by reference to species and habitats protected in pursuance of national legislation on nature conservation. Account should nevertheless be taken of specific situations where Community, or equivalent national, legislation allows for certain derogations from the level of protection afforded to the environment.
(7) For the purposes of assessing damage to land as defined in this Directive the use of risk assessment procedures to determine to what extent human health is likely to be adversely affected is desirable.
(8) This Directive should apply, as far as environmental damage is concerned, to occupational activities which present a risk for human health or the environment. Those activities should be identified, in principle, by reference to the relevant Community legislation which provides for regulatory requirements in relation to certain activities or practices considered as posing a potential or actual risk for human health or the environment.
(9) This Directive should also apply, as regards damage to protected species and natural habitats, to any occupational activities other than those already directly or indirectly identified by reference to Community legislation as posing an actual or potential risk for human health or the environment. In such cases the operator should only be liable under this Directive whenever he is at fault or negligent.
(10) Express account should be taken of the Euratom Treaty and relevant international conventions and of Community legislation regulating more comprehensively and more stringently the operation of any of the activities falling under the scope of this Directive. This Directive, which does not provide for additional rules of conflict of laws when it specifies the powers of the competent authorities, is without prejudice to the rules on international jurisdiction of courts as provided, inter alia, in Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters(7). This Directive should not apply to activities the main purpose of which is to serve national defence or international security.
(11) This Directive aims at preventing and remedying environmental damage, and does not affect rights of compensation for traditional damage granted under any relevant international agreement regulating civil liability.
(12) Many Member States are party to international agreements dealing with civil liability in relation to specific fields. These Member States should be able to remain so after the entry into force of this Directive, whereas other Member States should not lose their freedom to become parties to these agreements.
(13) Not all forms of environmental damage can be remedied by means of the liability mechanism. For the latter to be effective, there need to be one or more identifiable polluters, the damage should be concrete and quantifiable, and a causal link should be established between the damage and the identified polluter(s). Liability is therefore not a suitable instrument for dealing with pollution of a widespread, diffuse character, where it is impossible to link the negative environmental effects with acts or failure to act of certain individual actors.
(14) This Directive does not apply to cases of personal injury, to damage to private property or to any economic loss and does not affect any right regarding these types of damages.
(15) Since the prevention and remedying of environmental damage is a task directly contributing to the pursuit of the Community's environment policy, public authorities should ensure the proper implementation and enforcement of the scheme provided for by this Directive.
(16) Restoration of the environment should take place in an effective manner ensuring that the relevant restoration objectives are achieved. A common framework should be defined to that end, the proper application of which should be supervised by the competent authority.
(17) Appropriate provision should be made for those situations where several instances of environmental damage have occurred in such a manner that the competent authority cannot ensure that all the necessary remedial measures are taken at the same time. In such a case, the competent authority should be entitled to decide which instance of environmental damage is to be remedied first.
(18) According to the ""polluter-pays"" principle, an operator causing environmental damage or creating an imminent threat of such damage should, in principle, bear the cost of the necessary preventive or remedial measures. In cases where a competent authority acts, itself or through a third party, in the place of an operator, that authority should ensure that the cost incurred by it is recovered from the operator. It is also appropriate that the operators should ultimately bear the cost of assessing environmental damage and, as the case may be, assessing an imminent threat of such damage occurring.
(19) Member States may provide for flat-rate calculation of administrative, legal, enforcement and other general costs to be recovered.
(20) An operator should not be required to bear the costs of preventive or remedial actions taken pursuant to this Directive in situations where the damage in question or imminent threat thereof is the result of certain events beyond the operator's control. Member States may allow that operators who are not at fault or negligent shall not bear the cost of remedial measures, in situations where the damage in question is the result of emissions or events explicitly authorised or where the potential for damage could not have been known when the event or emission took place.
(21) Operators should bear the costs relating to preventive measures when those measures should have been taken as a matter of course in order to comply with the legislative, regulatory and administrative provisions regulating their activities or the terms of any permit or authorisation.
(22) Member States may establish national rules covering cost allocation in cases of multiple party causation. Member States may take into account, in particular, the specific situation of users of products who might not be held responsible for environmental damage in the same conditions as those producing such products. In this case, apportionment of liability should be determined in accordance with national law.
(23) Competent authorities should be entitled to recover the cost of preventive or remedial measures from an operator within a reasonable period of time from the date on which those measures were completed.
(24) It is necessary to ensure that effective means of implementation and enforcement are available, while ensuring that the legitimate interests of the relevant operators and other interested parties are adequately safeguarded. Competent authorities should be in charge of specific tasks entailing appropriate administrative discretion, namely the duty to assess the significance of the damage and to determine which remedial measures should be taken.
(25) Persons adversely affected or likely to be adversely affected by environmental damage should be entitled to ask the competent authority to take action. Environmental protection is, however, a diffuse interest on behalf of which individuals will not always act or will not be in a position to act. Non-governmental organisations promoting environmental protection should therefore also be given the opportunity to properly contribute to the effective implementation of this Directive.
(26) The relevant natural or legal persons concerned should have access to procedures for the review of the competent authority's decisions, acts or failure to act.
(27) Member States should take measures to encourage the use by operators of any appropriate insurance or other forms of financial security and the development of financial security instruments and markets in order to provide effective cover for financial obligations under this Directive.
(28) Where environmental damage affects or is likely to affect several Member States, those Member States should cooperate with a view to ensuring proper and effective preventive or remedial action in respect of any environmental damage. Member States may seek to recover the costs for preventive or remedial actions.
(29) This Directive should not prevent Member States from maintaining or enacting more stringent provisions in relation to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage; nor should it prevent the adoption by Member States of appropriate measures in relation to situations where double recovery of costs could occur as a result of concurrent action by a competent authority under this Directive and by a person whose property is affected by the environmental damage.
(30) Damage caused before the expiry of the deadline for implementation of this Directive should not be covered by its provisions.
(31) Member States should report to the Commission on the experience gained in the application of this Directive so as to enable the Commission to consider, taking into account the impact on sustainable development and future risks to the environment, whether any review of this Directive is appropriate,
HAVE ADOPTED THIS DIRECTIVE:
Article 1
Subject matter
The purpose of this Directive is to establish a framework of environmental liability based on the ""polluter-pays"" principle, to prevent and remedy environmental damage.
Article 2
Definitions
For the purpose of this Directive the following definitions shall apply:
1. ""environmental damage"" means: (a) damage to protected species and natural habitats, which is any damage that has significant adverse effects on reaching or maintaining the favourable conservation status of such habitats or species. The significance of such effects is to be assessed with reference to the baseline condition, taking account of the criteria set out in Annex I;
Damage to protected species and natural habitats does not include previously identified adverse effects which result from an act by an operator which was expressly authorised by the relevant authorities in accordance with provisions implementing Article 6(3) and (4) or Article 16 of Directive 92/43/EEC or Article 9 of Directive 79/409/EEC or, in the case of habitats and species not covered by Community law, in accordance with equivalent provisions of national law on nature conservation.
(b) water damage, which is any damage that significantly adversely affects the ecological, chemical and/or quantitative status and/or ecological potential, as defined in Directive 2000/60/EC, of the waters concerned, with the exception of adverse effects where Article 4(7) of that Directive applies;
(c) land damage, which is any land contamination that creates a significant risk of human health being adversely affected as a result of the direct or indirect introduction, in, on or under land, of substances, preparations, organisms or micro-organisms;
2. ""damage"" means a measurable adverse change in a natural resource or measurable impairment of a natural resource service which may occur directly or indirectly;
3. "" protected species and natural habitats"" means: (a) the species mentioned in Article 4(2) of Directive 79/409/EEC or listed in Annex I thereto or listed in Annexes II and IV to Directive 92/43/EEC;
(b) the habitats of species mentioned in Article 4(2) of Directive 79/409/EEC or listed in Annex I thereto or listed in Annex II to Directive 92/43/EEC, and the natural habitats listed in Annex I to Directive 92/43/EEC and the breeding sites or resting places of the species listed in Annex IV to Directive 92/43/EEC; and
(c) where a Member State so determines, any habitat or species, not listed in those Annexes which the Member State designates for equivalent purposes as those laid down in these two Directives;
4. ""conservation status"" means: (a) in respect of a natural habitat, the sum of the influences acting on a natural habitat and its typical species that may affect its long-term natural distribution, structure and functions as well as the long-term survival of its typical species within, as the case may be, the European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies or the territory of a Member State or the natural range of that habitat;
The conservation status of a natural habitat will be taken as ""favourable"" when:
- its natural range and areas it covers within that range are stable or increasing,
- the specific structure and functions which are necessary for its long-term maintenance exist and are likely to continue to exist for the foreseeable future, and
- the conservation status of its typical species is favourable, as defined in (b);
(b) in respect of a species, the sum of the influences acting on the species concerned that may affect the long-term distribution and abundance of its populations within, as the case may be, the European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies or the territory of a Member State or the natural range of that species;
The conservation status of a species will be taken as ""favourable"" when:
- population dynamics data on the species concerned indicate that it is maintaining itself on a long-term basis as a viable component of its natural habitats,
- the natural range of the species is neither being reduced nor is likely to be reduced for the foreseeable future, and
- there is, and will probably continue to be, a sufficiently large habitat to maintain its populations on a long-term basis;
5. ""waters"" mean all waters covered by Directive 2000/60/EC;
6. ""operator"" means any natural or legal, private or public person who operates or controls the occupational activity or, where this is provided for in national legislation, to whom decisive economic power over the technical functioning of such an activity has been delegated, including the holder of a permit or authorisation for such an activity or the person registering or notifying such an activity;
7. ""occupational activity"" means any activity carried out in the course of an economic activity, a business or an undertaking, irrespectively of its private or public, profit or non-profit character;
8. ""emission"" means the release in the environment, as a result of human activities, of substances, preparations, organisms or micro-organisms;
9. ""imminent threat of damage"" means a sufficient likelihood that environmental damage will occur in the near future;
10. ""preventive measures"" means any measures taken in response to an event, act or omission that has created an imminent threat of environmental damage, with a view to preventing or minimising that damage;
11. ""remedial measures"" means any action, or combination of actions, including mitigating or interim measures to restore, rehabilitate or replace damaged natural resources and/or impaired services, or to provide an equivalent alternative to those resources or services as foreseen in Annex II;
12. ""natural resource"" means protected species and natural habitats, water and land;
13. ""services"" and ""natural resources services"" mean the functions performed by a natural resource for the benefit of another natural resource or the public;
14. ""baseline condition"" means the condition at the time of the damage of the natural resources and services that would have existed had the environmental damage not occurred, estimated on the basis of the best information available;
15. ""recovery"", including ""natural recovery"", means, in the case of water, protected species and natural habitats the return of damaged natural resources and/or impaired services to baseline condition and in the case of land damage, the elimination of any significant risk of adversely affecting human health;
16. ""costs"" means costs which are justified by the need to ensure the proper and effective implementation of this Directive including the costs of assessing environmental damage, an imminent threat of such damage, alternatives for action as well as the administrative, legal, and enforcement costs, the costs of data collection and other general costs, monitoring and supervision costs.
Article 3
Scope
1. This Directive shall apply to:
(a) environmental damage caused by any of the occupational activities listed in Annex III, and to any imminent threat of such damage occurring by reason of any of those activities;
(b) damage to protected species and natural habitats caused by any occupational activities other than those listed in Annex III, and to any imminent threat of such damage occurring by reason of any of those activities, whenever the operator has been at fault or negligent.
2. This Directive shall apply without prejudice to more stringent Community legislation regulating the operation of any of the activities falling within the scope of this Directive and without prejudice to Community legislation containing rules on conflicts of jurisdiction.
3. Without prejudice to relevant national legislation, this Directive shall not give private parties a right of compensation as a consequence of environmental damage or of an imminent threat of such damage.
Article 4
Exceptions
1. This Directive shall not cover environmental damage or an imminent threat of such damage caused by:
(a) an act of armed conflict, hostilities, civil war or insurrection;
(b) a natural phenomenon of exceptional, inevitable and irresistible character.
2. This Directive shall not apply to environmental damage or to any imminent threat of such damage arising from an incident in respect of which liability or compensation falls within the scope of any of the International Conventions listed in Annex IV, including any future amendments thereof, which is in force in the Member State concerned.
3. This Directive shall be without prejudice to the right of the operator to limit his liability in accordance with national legislation implementing the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims (LLMC), 1976, including any future amendment to the Convention, or the Strasbourg Convention on Limitation of Liability in Inland Navigation (CLNI), 1988, including any future amendment to the Convention.
4. This Directive shall not apply to such nuclear risks or environmental damage or imminent threat of such damage as may be caused by the activities covered by the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community or caused by an incident or activity in respect of which liability or compensation falls within the scope of any of the international instruments listed in Annex V, including any future amendments thereof.
5. This Directive shall only apply to environmental damage or to an imminent threat of such damage caused by pollution of a diffuse character, where it is possible to establish a causal link between the damage and the activities of individual operators.
6. This Directive shall not apply to activities the main purpose of which is to serve national defence or international security nor to activities the sole purpose of which is to protect from natural disasters.
Article 5
Preventive action
1. Where environmental damage has not yet occurred but there is an imminent threat of such damage occurring, the operator shall, without delay, take the necessary preventive measures.
2. Member States shall provide that, where appropriate, and in any case whenever an imminent threat of environmental damage is not dispelled despite the preventive measures taken by the operator, operators are to inform the competent authority of all relevant aspects of the situation, as soon as possible.
3. The competent authority may, at any time:
(a) require the operator to provide information on any imminent threat of environmental damage or in suspected cases of such an imminent threat;
(b) require the operator to take the necessary preventive measures;
(c) give instructions to the operator to be followed on the necessary preventive measures to be taken; or
(d) itself take the necessary preventive measures.
4. The competent authority shall require that the preventive measures are taken by the operator. If the operator fails to comply with the obligations laid down in paragraph 1 or 3(b) or (c), cannot be identified or is not required to bear the costs under this Directive, the competent authority may take these measures itself.
Article 6
Remedial action
1. Where environmental damage has occurred the operator shall, without delay, inform the competent authority of all relevant aspects of the situation and take:
(a) all practicable steps to immediately control, contain, remove or otherwise manage the relevant contaminants and/or any other damage factors in order to limit or to prevent further environmental damage and adverse effects on human health or further impairment of services and
(b) the necessary remedial measures, in accordance with Article 7.
2. The competent authority may, at any time:
(a) require the operator to provide supplementary information on any damage that has occurred;
(b) take, require the operator to take or give instructions to the operator concerning, all practicable steps to immediately control, contain, remove or otherwise manage the relevant contaminants and/or any other damage factors in order to limit or to prevent further environmental damage and adverse effect on human health, or further impairment of services;
(c) require the operator to take the necessary remedial measures;
(d) give instructions to the operator to be followed on the necessary remedial measures to be taken; or
(e) itself take the necessary remedial measures.
3. The competent authority shall require that the remedial measures are taken by the operator. If the operator fails to comply with the obligations laid down in paragraph 1 or 2(b), (c) or (d), cannot be identified or is not required to bear the costs under this Directive, the competent authority may take these measures itself, as a means of last resort.
Article 7
Determination of remedial measures
1. Operators shall identify, in accordance with Annex II, potential remedial measures and submit them to the competent authority for its approval, unless the competent authority has taken action under Article 6(2)(e) and (3).
2. The competent authority shall decide which remedial measures shall be implemented in accordance with Annex II, and with the cooperation of the relevant operator, as required.
3. Where several instances of environmental damage have occurred in such a manner that the competent authority cannot ensure that the necessary remedial measures are taken at the same time, the competent authority shall be entitled to decide which instance of environmental damage must be remedied first.
In making that decision, the competent authority shall have regard, inter alia, to the nature, extent and gravity of the various instances of environmental damage concerned, and to the possibility of natural recovery. Risks to human health shall also be taken into account.
4. The competent authority shall invite the persons referred to in Article 12(1) and in any case the persons on whose land remedial measures would be carried out to submit their observations and shall take them into account.
Article 8
Prevention and remediation costs
1. The operator shall bear the costs for the preventive and remedial actions taken pursuant to this Directive.
2. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4, the competent authority shall recover, inter alia, via security over property or other appropriate guarantees from the operator who has caused the damage or the imminent threat of damage, the costs it has incurred in relation to the preventive or remedial actions taken under this Directive.
However, the competent authority may decide not to recover the full costs where the expenditure required to do so would be greater than the recoverable sum or where the operator cannot be identified.
3. An operator shall not be required to bear the cost of preventive or remedial actions taken pursuant to this Directive when he can prove that the environmental damage or imminent threat of such damage:
(a) was caused by a third party and occured despite the fact that appropriate safety measures were in place; or
(b) resulted from compliance with a compulsory order or instruction emanating from a public authority other than an order or instruction consequent upon an emission or incident caused by the operator's own activities.
In such cases Member States shall take the appropriate measures to enable the operator to recover the costs incurred.
4. The Member States may allow the operator not to bear the cost of remedial actions taken pursuant to this Directive where he demonstrates that he was not at fault or negligent and that the environmental damage was caused by:
(a) an emission or event expressly authorised by, and fully in accordance with the conditions of, an authorisation conferred by or given under applicable national laws and regulations which implement those legislative measures adopted by the Community specified in Annex III, as applied at the date of the emission or event;
(b) an emission or activity or any manner of using a product in the course of an activity which the operator demonstrates was not considered likely to cause environmental damage according to the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when the emission was released or the activity took place.
5. Measures taken by the competent authority in pursuance of Article 5(3) and (4) and Article 6(2) and (3) shall be without prejudice to the liability of the relevant operator under this Directive and without prejudice to Articles 87 and 88 of the Treaty.
Article 9
Cost allocation in cases of multiple party causation

Article 10
Limitation period for recovery of costs
The competent authority shall be entitled to initiate cost recovery proceedings against the operator, or if appropriate, a third party who has caused the damage or the imminent threat of damage in relation to any measures taken in pursuance of this Directive within five years from the date on which those measures have been completed or the liable operator, or third party, has been identified, whichever is the later.
Article 11
Competent authority
1. Member States shall designate the competent authority(ies) responsible for fulfilling the duties provided for in this Directive.
2. The duty to establish which operator has caused the damage or the imminent threat of damage, to assess the significance of the damage and to determine which remedial measures should be taken with reference to Annex II shall rest with the competent authority. To that effect, the competent authority shall be entitled to require the relevant operator to carry out his own assessment and to supply any information and data necessary.
3. Member States shall ensure that the competent authority may empower or require third parties to carry out the necessary preventive or remedial measures.
4. Any decision taken pursuant to this Directive which imposes preventive or remedial measures shall state the exact grounds on which it is based. Such decision shall be notified forthwith to the operator concerned, who shall at the same time be informed of the legal remedies available to him under the laws in force in the Member State concerned and of the time-limits to which such remedies are subject.
Article 12
Request for action
1. Natural or legal persons:
(a) affected or likely to be affected by environmental damage or
(b) having a sufficient interest in environmental decision making relating to the damage or, alternatively,
(c) alleging the impairment of a right, where administrative procedural law of a Member State requires this as a precondition,
shall be entitled to submit to the competent authority any observations relating to instances of environmental damage or an imminent threat of such damage of which they are aware and shall be entitled to request the competent authority to take action under this Directive.
What constitutes a ""sufficient interest"" and ""impairment of a right"" shall be determined by the Member States.
To this end, the interest of any non-governmental organisation promoting environmental protection and meeting any requirements under national law shall be deemed sufficient for the purpose of subparagraph (b). Such organisations shall also be deemed to have rights capable of being impaired for the purpose of subparagraph (c).
2. The request for action shall be accompanied by the relevant information and data supporting the observations submitted in relation to the environmental damage in question.
3. Where the request for action and the accompanying observations show in a plausible manner that environmental damage exists, the competent authority shall consider any such observations and requests for action. In such circumstances the competent authority shall give the relevant operator an opportunity to make his views known with respect to the request for action and the accompanying observations.
4. The competent authority shall, as soon as possible and in any case in accordance with the relevant provisions of national law, inform the persons referred to in paragraph 1, which submitted observations to the authority, of its decision to accede to or refuse the request for action and shall provide the reasons for it.
5. Member States may decide not to apply paragraphs 1 and 4 to cases of imminent threat of damage.
Article 13
Review procedures
1. The persons referred to in Article 12(1) shall have access to a court or other independent and impartial public body competent to review the procedural and substantive legality of the decisions, acts or failure to act of the competent authority under this Directive.
2. This Directive shall be without prejudice to any provisions of national law which regulate access to justice and those which require that administrative review procedures be exhausted prior to recourse to judicial proceedings.
Article 14
Financial security
1. Member States shall take measures to encourage the development of financial security instruments and markets by the appropriate economic and financial operators, including financial mechanisms in case of insolvency, with the aim of enabling operators to use financial guarantees to cover their responsibilities under this Directive.
2. The Commission, before 30 April 2010 shall present a report on the effectiveness of the Directive in terms of actual remediation of environmental damages, on the availability at reasonable costs and on conditions of insurance and other types of financial security for the activities covered by Annex III. The report shall also consider in relation to financial security the following aspects: a gradual approach, a ceiling for the financial guarantee and the exclusion of low-risk activities. In the light of that report, and of an extended impact assessment, including a cost-benefit analysis, the Commission shall, if appropriate, submit proposals for a system of harmonised mandatory financial security.
Article 15
Cooperation between Member States
1. Where environmental damage affects or is likely to affect several Member States, those Member States shall cooperate, including through the appropriate exchange of information, with a view to ensuring that preventive action and, where necessary, remedial action is taken in respect of any such environmental damage.
2. Where environmental damage has occurred, the Member State in whose territory the damage originates shall provide sufficient information to the potentially affected Member States.
3. Where a Member State identifies damage within its borders which has not been caused within them it may report the issue to the Commission and any other Member State concerned; it may make recommendations for the adoption of preventive or remedial measures and it may seek, in accordance with this Directive, to recover the costs it has incurred in relation to the adoption of preventive or remedial measures.
Article 16
Relationship with national law
1. This Directive shall not prevent Member States from maintaining or adopting more stringent provisions in relation to the prevention and remedying of environmental damage, including the identification of additional activities to be subject to the prevention and remediation requirements of this Directive and the identification of additional responsible parties.
2. This Directive shall not prevent Member States from adopting appropriate measures, such as the prohibition of double recovery of costs, in relation to situations where double recovery could occur as a result of concurrent action by a competent authority under this Directive and by a person whose property is affected by environmental damage.
Article 17
Temporal application
This Directive shall not apply to:
- damage caused by an emission, event or incident that took place before the date referred to in Article 19(1),
- damage caused by an emission, event or incident which takes place subsequent to the date referred to in Article 19(1) when it derives from a specific activity that took place and finished before the said date,
- damage, if more than 30 years have passed since the emission, event or incident, resulting in the damage, occurred.
Article 18
Reports and review
1. Member States shall report to the Commission on the experience gained in the application of this Directive by 30 April 2013 at the latest. The reports shall include the information and data set out in Annex VI.
2. On that basis, the Commission shall submit a report to the European Parliament and to the Council before 30 April 2014, which shall include any appropriate proposals for amendment.
