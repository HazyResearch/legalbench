## Task Description

This is a multiple-choice task in which the model must select the answer that best characterizes the merger agreement.

## Task Construction

This task was constructed from the [MAUD dataset](https://www.atticusprojectai.org/maud), which consists of over 47,000 labels across 152 merger agreements annotated to identify 92 questions in each agreement used by the 2021 American Bar Association (ABA) [Public Target Deal Points Study](https://www.americanbar.org/groups/business_law/committees/ma/deal_points/). The task is formatted as a series of multiple-choice questions, where given a segment of the merger agreement and a Deal Point question, the model is to choose the answer that best characterizes the agreement as response.
