Text: the texas code does not define election laws, and we have found no case construing this phrase. thus, we first look to the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of election laws. see perrin v. united states, 444 u.s. 37, 42, 100 s.ct. 311, 314, 62 l.ed.2d 199 (1979) (noting that it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction ... that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning). we think that the common meaning of election laws is laws that specifically govern elections, rather than generally applicable laws that may affect elections. if the texas legislature wanted 31.003 to cover the latter, we doubt that it would have inserted the adjectival modifier election directly before the noun law. by forming an open compound phrase such as election law, the texas legislature meant a combination of separate words that are so closely related as to constitute a single concept. chicago manual of style 6.33 (14th rev. ed. 1993). an election district, for instance, is not a district devised for many functions, including elections; it is a district created for the purposes of elections. 5 oxford english dictionary 116 (2d ed. 1989). moreover, an election board is not an agency that carries out all the responsibilities of a municipality, including elections; it is an agency charged with the conduct of elections. blacks law dictionary 519 (6th ed.1990).

Text: however, lederman does not cite, nor have we found, any minnesota decision that applies 541.051, subd. 1(c) to actions against an owner for injuries incurred during construction. indeed, the statutory language cautions against such a reading. section 541.051, subd. l(c)s reference to actions alleging negligence in the maintenance, operation or inspection of an improvement to real property suggests an improvement that already has been completed, but that must be kept in a state of repair. for instance, blacks law dictionary defines maintenance as [t]he upkeep or preservation of condition of property, including cost of ordinary repairs necessary and proper from time to time for that purpose. blacks law dictionary 953 (6th ed.1990); see also gorton v. mashburn, 995 p.2d 1114, 1116 (okla.1999) (maintenance is best characterized as after-care or upkeep.); websters third new international dictionary 1170, 1581 (1960) (defining inspection as an examination ... of an installation and operation as the quality or state of being functional or operative). in this case, constructing the shoreline suites constituted more than mere repair, the improvement as it existed at the time of ledermans injury could not be called an installation, and the suites were not functional or operative.

Text: both parties agree that an interpretation of the 1976 act is critical to this inquiry. before passage of this legislation, youthful offenders could be sentenced under the provisions of the youth corrections act codified at 18 u.s.c. 5010. however, if a youth was sentenced as a youthful offender, under subsection 5010(b) or (c) of the yca, his or her release was conditioned upon a finding that the prisoner was responding well to rehabilitative treatment. the core concept underlying the legislative history of the yca emphasized the use of the period of confinement for the education and rehabilitation of youth offenders. once the offender was thought to be rehabilitated and ready to rejoin society, he was to be released. often this meant that youth offenders were confined for longer periods than adults found guilty of the same offense. but this was determined to be a necessary quid pro quo for the youths treatment.

Text: p. bator, p. mishkin, d. shapiro and h. wechsler, hart & wechslers the federal courts and the federal system 690 (2d ed. 1973). neither section 60b nor the rhode island statute at issue in wheeler attempts to confine medical malpractice actions to the state courts. rather, each creates a screening mechanism through which every malpractice claim must proceed before being pursued in court. no ouster of federal jurisdiction results when, by reason of the policies expressed in erie, a federal court requires that a states rule barring an action from proceeding in its courts must be applied to bar the action from the federal court. this principle is exemplified by woods v. interstate realty co., 337 u.s. 535, 69 s.ct. 1235, 93 l.ed. 1073 (1949), in which the supreme court held that a federal court sitting in diversity must apply a state door-closing statute barring an unregistered foreign corporation from bringing suit in the state courts and dismissing an action brought by a foreign corporation in the federal court. in woods, the court observed
