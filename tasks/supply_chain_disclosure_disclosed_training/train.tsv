"SUPPLY CHAIN TRANSPARENCY

For many years, 99 Cents Only Stores has had in place a policy against purchasing any merchandise manufactured as a result of human trafficking or slavery and, in fact, as a result of any coercive, abusive, or unlawful practice.

In 2004, 99 Cents Only Stores adopted the following policy, which has been on its intranet at all times since:

“It is the Company’s policy not to purchase products known to be manufactured using exploitive or unfair labor practices. This means not purchasing products known to be manufactured by the use of: forced labor, abusive labor practices, child labor, or other practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured.”

Given the largely closeout nature of much of the Company’s merchandise, its price points, and the ever-changing nature and composition of the merchandise it purchases and offers for sale, it is not feasible for the Company to comprehensively verify product supply chains or audit supplier compliance, but the Company does send its own employees to a number of the overseas factories from which it buys product for tours and announced inspections. Further, the Company also requires its direct suppliers to certify, in writing, that their products sold to the Company are not the result of any proscribed practices and that the supplier complies with the laws of all countries in which the supplier does business. In fact, the Company’s vendor contracts contain the following requirement:

“It is Purchaser’s policy not to purchase products manufactured using exploitive or unfair labor practices, such as forced labor, abusive labor practices, or child labor. Neither will Purchaser buy merchandise made as a result of any practices that are illegal in the place at which the products being offered are manufactured. By signing or shipping under 99 Cents’ PO, Seller attests to the fact that after a diligent inquiry, Seller has ascertained that no product that is the subject of this Purchase Order has been manufactured using any such forced, involuntary, exploitive, or unfair labor practices.”

 Any supplier found to have falsely certified its compliance with the Company’s policy will no longer be used by the Company as one of its vendors. The Company’s buyers are also expected to comply with this policy, although it is not feasible for the Company to maintain a formal accountability program or to provide regular training on these topics to employees and managers operating in these areas, for the same reasons explained above."

Abbott believes in being a socially responsible company and doing what is right, not just by our customers, but by the world in which we live. Abbott is committed to safe and fair working conditions, beyond our employees and the stores in which our products are sold, but also extending to the partners in our supply chain. Abbott always has had and will continue to have a zero tolerance policy regarding human trafficking and slavery. Abbott has a global policy against trafficking and slavery in supply chains. Abbott engages in verification of product supply chains to evaluate and address risks of human trafficking and slavery. Specifically, Abbott utilizes a supplier classification model to determine appropriate activity level to assess risk. A supplier may receive a letter, a survey or an on-site audit (usually announced ahead of time) based on this model. Information received from the supplier is then assessed to determine whether to take further steps. Currently, this verification is conducted by Abbott employees in its Global Purchasing Services Compliance department.

 

Abbott’s Supplier Guidelines state our expectations to suppliers conducting business with Abbott that they are prohibited from engaging in illegal behavior, including human trafficking and slavery. Abbott’s internal Code of Business Conduct also incorporates standards prohibiting slavery/trafficking or engaging in illegal behavior. Abbott requires direct suppliers to certify that materials incorporated into Abbott’s products comply with local and national laws of the country or countries in which they are doing business. Certifications are also obtained from suppliers that they comply with standards as outlined in our Supplier Guidelines. Abbott maintains internal accountability standards and procedures for both employees and contractors failing to meet company standards regarding slavery and trafficking. In particular, Abbott employees worldwide train annually on Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct. Likewise, all contractors assigned to Abbott are required to review and abide by Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct.

 

Employees and contractors assigned to Abbott who fail to abide by Abbott’s Code of Business Conduct may be subject to reprimand or other adverse consequences, up to and including termination of employment or assignment. Abbott provides training to its employees and management who have direct responsibility for supply chain management, regarding human trafficking and slavery, particularly with respect to mitigating risks within the supply chains of products."

"California Transparency in Supply Chains Act 

Human trafficking and forced labor is a global issue that requires the combined efforts of countries and companies to raise awareness and combat all forms of trafficking. The United Nations defines it as an act of recruiting, transporting, transferring, harboring or receiving a person through a use of force, coercion or other means, for the purpose of exploiting them. Every country is affected by human trafficking, and men, women, and children can fall victim. Abercrombie & Fitch has taken proactive steps to mitigate the risk of human trafficking and forced labor in our supply chain. 

Verification 

In order to verify that A&F's product supply chains do not use goods produced by forced or child labor, we regularly review updates to the U.S. Department of Labor's List of Products Produced by Forced or Indentured Child Labor so we can more closely monitor factories that may operate in the countries listed. Factories are also required to go through a rigorous approval process before they join our supply chain, including working with Sourcing, Sustainability, and Quality Assurance departments to make sure the factories meet company standards. 

Auditing 

To ensure all the factories in our supply chain are fulfilling their obligation, Abercrombie & Fitch hires independent, third-party monitoring firms to audit them regularly. The auditors are experts in the local laws of the countries in which we produce, and they speak the local languages. Each audit consists of a factory walk-through, confidential interviews with workers, and a review of relative documentation (e.g. payroll, time records, employee age verification, etc.). We typically audit factories once per year, but we can visit more or less depending on the factory's performance and track record. To maintain the integrity of the audit, we do not provide the audit date to the factories ahead of time. However, to ensure the necessary personnel is available and the documentation can be gathered in time, we do offer a two-week window during which we will audit the factory. 

For the factories that need to be audited more frequently, such as certain High Risk factories, or when A&F is looking into using a new 3rd party monitoring firm, one or more associates from Abercrombie's Sustainability department will shadow the audit with the representatives from the monitoring firm to ensure A&F's Code of Conduct is followed. 

Certification 

All business partners are contractually required to adhere to Abercrombie & Fitch's Code of Conduct, which states that ""Abercrombie will not tolerate the use of convict, indentured, slave, bonded, or other forced involuntary labor, including human trafficking, either directly or indirectly, by its vendors, or by any subcontractors utilized by its vendors."" When a vendor accepts a purchase order, they are confirming their compliance with our Code of Conduct and our zero-tolerance stance on human trafficking and forced labor. 

Internal Accountability 

We have a zero-tolerance policy for involuntary labor, human trafficking, and child labor. If any of these findings are uncovered during an audit, the factory must take immediate steps to correct the problem. The factory is required to alert A&F on how they are correcting the issue and an A&F associate will work directly with the factory to ensure there are no recurrences. In addition, a full follow-up audit will be performed at the factory 6 months later to confirm the issue has been resolved. 

Training and Awareness 

All internal team members and managers directly involved in Supply Chain Management were required to take a training course on human trafficking and slavery that discusses the risks of human trafficking for business, and actions that can be taken to mitigate the risks. We are happy to report that all participants passed the course, and found it to be very informative. 

All of our major vendors were trained on human trafficking in mid-2011, during which they reviewed the clause in our Code of Conduct regarding involuntary (forced) labor and human trafficking. They also discussed how human trafficking is defined so that they understand the different acts, means, and purposes of human trafficking."	Yes
"In 2010 the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 (SB 657) was passed and will go into effect on January 1, 2012. This law requires large retailers and manufacturers who do business in the state of California, and have annual gross worldwide sales of over $100 million U.S. dollars, to be transparent about the efforts they have undergone to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in their supply chain. 

Acer is a member of the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition (EICC), an alliance of the world’s leading information and communications technology (ICT) companies. The EICC has published the Electronic Industry Code of Conduct (EICC Code) which establishes conduct standards for global ICT companies to improve working and environmental conditions. Acer actively works as part of the EICC to provide safeguards which prohibit supply chain use of slavery and human trafficking. 

Acer has adopted the EICC Code and requires adherence to this Code by its employees and direct suppliers. Acer also supports and participates in the EICC’s Freely Chosen Employment task force which is designed to help identify opportunities to share best practices among members, expand the code of conduct, and make recommendations on available tools and training. 

Acer has taken multiple actions to eradicate use of forced labor, slavery and human trafficking in its supply chain. These actions include: 

Supplier risk assessment 

Acer assesses the risk of inappropriate labor practices in its suppliers’ operations by evaluating several factors. These factors include supplier: assessment questionnaires, operational characteristics, business risk dynamics, results of prior audits and other relevant factors. Acer also considers the concerns of outside parties in making these risk assessments.

Supplier audits 

Acer conducts announced on-site audits of its suppliers to ensure compliance with the EICC Code and takes seriously all forms of non-conformance. Audits are conducted by Acer employees and/or third-party consultants retained by Acer. Suppliers are selected for audit based on the results of the risk assessment analysis described above.

Additionally, Acer participates in the EICC Validated Audit Process (VAP), which employs an independent audit manager to inspect procedures and tools, and verify audit results. Acer employs varied auditing processes to ensure a robust audit program with complementary methods to validate and continually improve Acer’s supply chain adherence to the EICC Code.

Supplier Declaration 

Acer requires all direct manufacturing suppliers to sign a Declaration of Compliance with the EICC Code. This Code obligates the suppliers to adhere to Acer’s standards of upholding the human rights of workers and treating them with dignity.

Supply Chain Management Employee Training 

Acer has launched a training program for its employees with manufacturing supply chain responsibility. This training ensures that Acer employees in procurement roles are fully aware of the standards Acer has established for its suppliers to eradicate slavery and human trafficking in the Acer supply chain. The training also provides supply chain management employees with strategies to identify and respond to inappropriate supply chain labor practices. Acer’s supply chain personnel are also made fully aware of the responsibilities imposed on Acer’s suppliers via the EICC Code and the audit program Acer has instituted to ensure supplier compliance with this Code."

"Company Disclosure Statement Pursuant to the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010

The California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010 requires retailers and manufacturers that do business in California to publicly disclose their efforts to eradicate slavery and human trafficking from their supply chains.

Alere supports the rights of all individuals to be free from slavery in the workplace. Alere abhors the practice of human trafficking and slavery and applauds efforts being made globally to eliminate this practice. When entering into written contracts with its suppliers, Alere policy is to include in those contracts a requirement that they comply with laws applicable to the business being transacted, which include laws prohibiting slavery and human trafficking. By signing our contracts our suppliers certify that they conduct their business in compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to laws that prohibit slavery and human trafficking. A supplier's failure to honor its legal and contractual obligations to Alere would be a violation of law and a breach of contract. Alere endeavors to do business with reputable suppliers with proper business standards. Alere does not believe that additional verifications or independent audits are necessary to ensure that its suppliers comply with laws regarding slavery and human trafficking of the country or countries in which they are doing business."

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is committed to sourcing quality merchandise and developing meaningful relationships with its vendors who share common principles of social responsibility. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. aims to cooperate with its vendors and their subcontractors on a systematic, long term basis to ensure our sourced merchandise is produced under socially responsible conditions.

Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. is constantly looking for ways to improve in the area of corporate social responsibility.  In connection with this effort, we encourage our vendors to adopt a comprehensive program of responsible practices and to prepare a corporate responsibility (or “sustainability”) report if they do not already do so. 

All vendors and their factories must follow our ""Code of Conduct"", which details our policies in regard to child labor, involuntary labor, human trafficking, disciplinary practices, non-discrimination, health and safety, environmental protection, wages and benefits, working hours, employee relations, and other items.

Code of Conduct

The Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. Code of Conduct summarizes the basic requirements concerning working conditions that must be satisfied by each vendor for every location. Bed Bath & Beyond Inc. reserves the right to change and supplement the Code of Conduct at any time.

Vendors shall familiarize workers with the Code of Conduct and display it, translated in the local language, at each of their facilities in a place readily visible and accessible to workers. Vendors shall ensure that their contractors and suppliers adhere to the Code of Conduct.

Child Labor

Vendors shall not use child labor. The international standard for defining “Child Labor” is found in the International Labor Organizations’ Convention 138 on Minimum Age for Employment (1973) which provides as follows:  “The minimum age […] should not be less than the age of compulsory schooling and, in any case, shall not be less than 15 years.” If the country of production has a more restrictive definition of child labor, then Bed Bath & Beyond will not produce product made by persons in violation of that country’s laws. Vendors must verify the age of their workers and maintain copies of their workers’ proof of age.   Vendors must follow all applicable laws and regulations regarding working hours and conditions for minors. 

Involuntary Labor

Vendor shall not use involuntary labor. “Involuntary Labor” is defined as work or service which is extracted from any person under threat or penalty for its non-performance and for which the worker does not offer himself or herself voluntarily, and includes all manner of prison, bonded, indentured and forced labor.

Human Trafficking 

Vendors and all direct suppliers to such Vendors shall comply with the laws addressing human trafficking and slavery of the country or countries where the Vendors do business. For purposes of this Code of Conduct, the operative standard for defining “Human trafficking” is taken from the U.N. Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Palermo Protocol):   “[…] the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation.   Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labor or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, [or] servitude; […]”

Vendors shall certify that they have implemented procedures to manage all aspects of the supply chain to ensure they comply with laws on slavery and human trafficking. Workers must be allowed to maintain control over their identity documents.

Health and Safety

Vendors shall provide workers with a clean, safe, and healthy workplace in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.

The work environment must be safe and sanitary to ensure there are no unreasonable risks to the health and safety of all workers. Factories must implement procedures and safeguards to prevent accidents and injuries to workers; procedures and safeguards include, but are not limited to, inspection of buildings, machinery, and fire extinguishers. Regular and recorded health and safety training shall be provided for all new or reassigned workers and management.

Vendors shall ensure that workers have access to clean drinking water, sanitary washing facilities, and an adequate number of toilets.

Aisles, exits, and stairwells must be kept unblocked at all times. The workplaces must provide adequate lighting and ventilation.

Vendors must maintain appropriate chemical safety ensuring proper chemical storage, eye wash stations, and Personal Protective Equipment for workers, as applicable.

Environmental Protection

Vendors should ensure that every manufacturing facility complies with environmental laws, including all laws related to waste disposal, air emissions, discharges, toxic substances, and hazardous waste disposal, as well as procedures for notifying local authorities in the event of an environmental accident resulting from the Vendor’s operations.

Factories must take steps to ensure that all input materials and components were obtained from permissible sources consistent with international treaties and local laws and regulations. Appropriate and adequate environmental training should be provided to all workers and management.

Wages and Benefits

Vendors shall provide wages and benefits that comply with all applicable laws and regulations or match the prevailing local manufacturing or industry rates, whichever is higher. Overtime pay shall be calculated at the legally required rate, regardless of whether workers are compensated hourly or by piece rate.

Factories must compensate all workers in accordance with the law and where applicable with contractual agreements. Workers must be provided with written and understandable details regarding their employment and compensation.

Working Hours

Vendors shall not require workers to work, including overtime, more than 60 hours per week or more than any maximum number of hours per week established by applicable laws and regulations, whichever is less. Vendors shall guarantee that workers receive at least one day off during each seven day period.

Employee Relations

Vendors shall respect the right of workers to take advantage of any laws relating to employee management relations.

Dormitories and Canteen

Factories that provide residential and dining facilities for their workers must provide safe, healthy, and sanitary facilities.

All areas of the dormitory facilities shall be kept secure, clean and have safety provisions (such as fire extinguishers, first aid kits, unobstructed emergency exits, emergency lighting, etc.). Emergency evacuation drills shall be conducted at least once a year. Additionally, Factories shall provide appropriate washroom facilities, including adequate toilets and showers segregated by gender. The facility should also have security measures to protect employees and their property.  Dormitories must be in compliance with all housing laws and regulations, occupancy requirements, and health and safety laws. 

Legal Requirements

Vendors shall comply with all legal requirements applicable to the conduct of their businesses, including those set out above.

Management at the Company has also participated in webinars and attended presentations organized by reputable third party industry groups with respect to the requirements of the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act of 2010. Internal team members with direct responsibility for supply chain have also participated in training on slavery and human trafficking.

Social Compliance Audits

Though the amount of product sold in our stores that is imported directly by us is a very small portion of our business, Bed Bath & Beyond, buybuy BABY, and Harmon, Harmon Face Values have developed a Social Compliance Audit Program for all vendors of direct import merchandise.  In addition, Bed Bath & Beyond and buybuy BABY have instituted the same requirements for vendors of private label products whether imported or domestically sourced.  The requirements of the Social Compliance Audit Program are communicated to vendors through our Quality Assurance Manual.

All vendors or Buying/Selling Agents are required to be fully knowledgeable of all factories and labor arrangements used in the production of goods. 

The Company has partnered with an ISO accredited, worldwide, independent laboratory to implement the Social Compliance Audit Program.  Audits initiated by the Company are conducted on a semi-unannounced basis. All vendors or their agents must allow the Company’s partner to conduct both scheduled and unscheduled inspections of their facilities for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the Code of Conduct and employee health and safety standards. During audits, the Company maintains the right to, among other things, review all employee related books and records maintained by the vendor and to interview workers outside the presence of factory management.  The audit also includes protocols to assess risks of human trafficking and slavery.  Any deficiencies identified in a Social Compliance Audit must be remedied within a reasonable timeframe.  

All vendors are required to sign our Import Vendor Compliance Guide Acknowledgment Form, which confirms their acceptance and certifies their compliance with all of the above policies."	No
