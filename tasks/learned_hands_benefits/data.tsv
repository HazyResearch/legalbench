So I've worked at a company for almost 4 years as a temporary employee, which means if I get laid off I don't get unemployment. Never have I worked less than 40 hours a week, I average 60 hours of week, all mandatory.    In Kentucky if you get laid off you can get a unemployment check for 6 months or until you find another job. But not as a temporary like me.  I know people will say if you don't like it quit and find another job. But I feel like this shouldn't be allowed.	Yes
Pretty much summed it up in the headline but one more detail I need to add.  The mail from the food stamp office comes to my house.  I called her and asked about it and she told me that they knew she didn't live there but she didn't have her PO Box set up.    I'm concerned that she told them that she does live here, but not me.  Is this something that could come back on me?  What exactly are the requirements for counting a child as a member of the household, when they don't live with you the majority of the time?	Yes
My aunt and her long-term boyfriend (father of her kids) received food stamps or EBT from August-January (the food stamp people also claim they gave them money for February but aunt says nothing showed up on the card) she would get about $150 a month until the food stamp use was discontinued. Her boyfriend failed to report the overtime her made in his job and now they had a letter sent to their home asking him to sign a letter and authorize for them to ask his work place for his pay stubs. Is there a possibility that they go to prison or will they just have to pay the money back? Its urgent. Thank you!	Yes
"I am a 27 year old and have been on the ""Healthy Michigan Plan"" through Michigan medicaid due to being a graduate student with no income.  Back in February I received a one-time inheritance payment of $26,000 which would bump me over the limit for 133% of the federal poverty level which is the designated level for benefits eligibility.  My negligence to report the ""income"" change within 10 days indicates that I may be responsible for overpayments by medicaid.  I had been confused about whether the inheritance counted as income and would be treated as such by medicaid.  I did some research and am unsure as to whether the income reporting is annually or monthly.  Since that one time payment, my income has returned to zero. What are my options at this point?  I have used medical services since that time using my medicaid insurance. Will reporting the income now start a shit storm that will require legal counsel?"	Yes
This is post ended up having quite a few questions but they're all  in regards to money.  I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ?   My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?  This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.  Please help me, I want to live my life on my own as soon as I can, I don't live with physical abuse or anything too bad but there is some problems and it's just one of those homes where you don't want to stick around past your due.  The day I turn 18 is going to be a great day and I want to get an idea of what I have to do.  I appreciate anything you can help me with even if it's only one thing, thank you in advance to/if anyone that can help.	Yes
Hello to anyone reading this,  I am a 20 year old male and I have a mentally disabled mother. I dont live with her though, its not that i don't want to, but i can't because I'm going to college and living with my dad and trying to get a degree. It's hard to put up with my mother, but I'm finally doing my best and putting my emotions behind to help her. She gets money every month from the SSA, BUT it does not go to her it goes to a cousin of hers who is using the money. I can't really say she is really doing so, but from my mothers view I think she is. My mom is not that crazy, she can tell when things are not going right. Most of mother's illness was emotional to me as a child so I chose to ignore it, but now I want to help her. I'm tired of seeing her like this. I need to know where her money goes and how I can direct it to me, so I can take care of her. I feel like an asshole for choosing to ignore her when i was little, but i never understood any of it. No one in my family wanted to tell me what was wrong, but I had to find out for myself.  Please, if anyone can tell me what I need to talk to the SSA to let me take care of my mother. Any papers? Forms? I know that she cant take care of herself due to the fact that she doesnt get the money directly to her, but she lives alone.	Yes
"Time is of the essence here because my savings is dwindling. I applied for unemployment benefits for the state of Ohio about 3 weeks ago, after being laid off May 30th from a company I worked for about a year and a half.   The status was ""pending"" as it takes about 3-4 weeks for them to begin paying. I filed each week, and met the requirements dictated by the state.  I was told by someone at the unemployment office that my company had until 7/13 to respond and that a determination would be made by 7/14. I was unable to check the status yesterday. When I logged in today, it appeared my claim has been closed out. I was unable to view the status of my previous claims filed, or file my weekly claim. There was a determination in my correspondence inbox.   This is where my confusion arose, maybe I'm reading thing wrong, but the determination said that the state had ALLOWED my claim, and listed the weekly amount payable. However, when I click on the payment summary, it list my claims as ""DENIED"".   I created an album so you can see what it is I am seeing. If anyone is familiar with this any advice or clarification would be greatly appreciated. I'm just looking for answers. I'm completely broke, and was counting on that money to see me through. I found a new job and will be starting next week, but I was counting on the $1200 from unemployment claims to get me through to my first paycheck.   Thanks in advance for your responses. Below is the album.   http://imgur.com/a/7ak2f"	Yes
A fellow Redditor told me over on personal finance that if your hours at your job get butchered to the point where you only have one small shift a paycheck, it can be viewed as constructive dismissal and might be grounds for unemployment qualification even if you quit.  My question is, is this true? And if so, are their any technicalities and conditional rules to look into before I try to apply? I worked at McDonald's for three months and in my last month of work they cut me to one day a week, and eventually one day a paycheck. So, naturally, I quit. I'm looking for a new job but could really use some cash to hold me over, even if it's just enough to keep my phone turned on and pay my ride for gas when they take me to interviews.	Yes
I'm trying to get on disability (height is 4'10 with a few mental disorders that have been left untreated, and 27 years old). The only diagnosis that I have are over 10 years old. It feels like I've developed another disorder as I feel like I can't go outdoors and have trouble completing my job because of this. I know that you have to have documentation of your disorders to get on disability but without insurance, I can't readily get up-to-date diagnoses. What is it that you guys recommend?	Yes
TLDR is, degree, terrible job, want to change my life in any way I can. It's incredibly depressing, and I want to know what are my options. I heard conflicting things:  * it's easy/hard to get tuition paid on unemployment  * you have to be a minority they recognize  * you actually have to be on unemployment for &gt;24wks before they even consider helping you, which seems incredibly counter-productive  * even if you get it, you're not getting essentials covered by UI, just tuition  Help me /r/legaladvice you're my only hope. As I'm too broke to do much else. Thanks for reading	Yes
Hi All, first of all I'm not sure if this is the right forum, but here goes.   My parents live in Virginia, they have VERY little in assets. (Rent home, few posessions, old car, small life insurance policy, small pension my dad receives, dad is on disability, both are receiving social security).   My mom recently broke her hip and had to go to the hospital. the recovery will take months and my mom will not be able to take care of my dad. (thankfully we have my sister stepping in to take care of him for now, she lives close by). We would like to see if we could get my dad to qualify for medicaid so that he can receive long term care that is paid for. No one in my family can afford paying for the type of care that he needs.   I understand that the limitations for medicaid are very strict. A family friend has told us that we need to transfer all assets to my sister or I (I would prefer it be my sister) in some sort of trust so that the government does not recognize any assets under their name and they can qualify for medicaid.   Basically I think we need to start talking to a lawyer to facilitate this. But I need a list of items to go into the meeting with the lawyer with to make sure that we can get this accomplished. Any advice or assistance in navigating this would be helpful. Thanks!	Yes
Hey so I was planning on buying my cousin's 2013 Honda Fit, KBB value around $7000 for getting to work and college. Me and my mom live in NJ and she receives SSI, food stamps, Medicare, and we're living on public property. So I've seen mixed messages online that if I buy the car the value might be treated as an asset and can reduce our benefits. These programs have a asset limit, but I've seen some stuff saying that cars don't count towards these assets. I don't want my mom to lose healthcare or any income benefits as she's disabled and money's tight. The only reason I could afford this Fit is my cousin letting me pay the money over time. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
I am currently receiving support from social services, idk why, this is just how my life turned out.  They have asked for all of my bank information for the past 12 months. I don't know what this means.  Why would they want that?	Yes
With severe issues--lists on both physical and mental side. I thought she was my soul mate :(  Bipolar--Do I call the cops? She has signed an eviction notice i also signed, she is packing up, but over the past week she has cut herself enough to bleed and doing and saying alot of things kids are 12 and the 15f is noteworthily taking after her mother maybe I am /was? holding out so much hope for them all Is there any government program for poverty? on the streets but she's a hard one to help..	Yes
I filed for unemployment on July 4th. I had no hours at all from July 2nd to July 12th. That's basically two weeks of no work and I see no reason this will change. I am in effect unemployed.  I quit my previous job. My concern is that I will be denied unemployment because I quit that job, because when I look at the eligibility verification, it lists only the job I quit, not the job I have now where my hours have been cut to nothing.  I should say what is going on his not due to any misconduct on my part. I have been trying very hard at this job, but nothing I do makes the store manager happy. So she cut me down to no hours for one week, four hours the next, making me basically unemployed. I assume she isn't firing me because she is trying to get out of me possibly getting unemployment.  If anyone has any idea for what recourse I have, I'd appreciate it. I am looking for a new job but it's been slow going.  If I get denied I do plan to appeal, I'm just wondering what my odds are of not getting denied, since I'm filing unemployment for the job where my hours have been cut, not the job I quit. I live in massachusetts.	Yes
"I work at a large healthcare organization that was just taken over by a much larger entity. We expected changes would be coming but we were just formally given notice that our office would close and we would have to commute an hour away if we wished to continue employment. We were given 3 business days to decide if we accept the offer or refuse it and be considered as voluntarily resigning our position. The change would take place in two weeks and they offered no severance due to it being under their 50 mile commute limit.   The problem is that I'm a single father of three young children as their mother passed away a few years ago. My currently work location is 15-18 minutes from my home and my children's school. The new location would be over an hour away and that's on a high traffic highway so possibly longer during usual business hours. We have no family and I have only been able to work due to before-school and after-school care which I pay for and occasionally my friends help with transporting them. It is not really possible both financially and logistically be able to commute to the new location due to my situation. Would this be considered ""good cause"" to attempt to collect unemployment if they consider me voluntarily resigning my position?   -My hours are the same and do not factor in the additional commute so I have to leave much earlier and return much later thus adding more financial strain to pay for more daycare.   -I've asked the HR Rep for assistance in finding another comparable position while staying local and I was told there was nothing available for me via email.   -If I do not sign the offer letter by the deadline, they will consider that also as voluntary resignation.   -I am getting the same rate of pay so there is nothing additional to compensate for the additional gas usage and daycare cost. Traveling there and back for one day of work is equivalent to traveling to my current location for four work days.  Any help is greatly appreciated! Thank you!"	Yes
My father claims they'll never pursue collection, and it'll only present an issue if I try to collect social security in another way. I'm worried that this is untrue.  They applied the overpayment note to my case in February of 2016. I was cut off in October. Nothing has happened as of yet, but I've found papers saying my mom, who was my representative payee, has been paying a little over $700 a month. My question is, does this mean it's on her to pay the debt since she was my payee? Or is it a coincidence? If it's just a coincidence that she's the one paying it, if she stops, will they come after me?	Yes
Hey everyone. I'm in a bit of a predicament and I'm not sure how to proceed. My mother is seriously mentally ill and has been refusing treatment for as long as I can remember. I beg her to get help because at this point she's extremely paranoid, terrified of touching things (germ situation), repeats herself 100x times, and has pulled out all her hair, and sadly, there's even more :( I've tried pretty much everything, but she's ALWAYS been this way. It even had a huge effect on my upbringing and due to that I have CPTSD. She once tried to burn me alive as an infant, and would regularly slam my head into concrete and the tub for things as simple as knocking over my juicebox. I'm afraid that at the rate she's going, she's just going to crash and burn... hard. I have a 16 year old sister too, and I fear that if my mom really gets out of hand, we'll be evicted. She honestly screams 24/7 so I'm not even sure how we haven't gotten kicked out. Due to my cptsd and a slew of other conditions, I'm disabled and can only work a job from home, but that's not enough for me to move my sister and myself out... I was wondering if there was any way the section 8 could be transferred to me or my sister, as my mother isn't stable or responsible enough for this kind of thing and always submits their paperwork MONTHS late. It's like she's trying to go out of her way to get us kicked out. Anyway, I'd like to keep my little sister safe, more importantly. Is there any way we could protect ourselves and our housing as my mother continues to self destruct ??  Thank you, and sorry for the essay... It's just been a LOT :/	Yes
"I'm 50 years old.  After a 24 year absence from physically demanding work I got back into an old career, in the intervening years I was a desk jockey and pretty weak &amp; out of shape due to sedentary lifestyle and no real exercise.  Also a type 2 diabetic for the last 13 years, with major numbness in my feet/legs, and have a little trouble balancing. I can get tripped up easily and take extra precautions when climbing.  My first three days on the job I was on a 15-foot ladder, going up and down a lot, and spent ten hour days on my feet with lots of climbing and walking. It was hell, but by the end of the first week I was stronger. But after the third day I was noticing a serious pain and swelling in my right ankle. I chalked this up to muscles getting used that hadn't been used in years and simply powered through it, hardly able to walk, but did it anyway, ten hours a day. Yesterday (end of second week of work) I just couldn't bear the pain anymore and it was not improving in any way - only getting worse. I'm limping badly all over the workplace, nobody even asks if I'm okay.  Left work a couple hours early and went to the ED yesterday at the local hospital, after an examination and x-ray doc calls me over and shows me the imaging, he literally says ""wtf"" as he points out a shard of bone broken off one of my ankle bones and is sitting in the lower part of my ankle in the spot where the swelling is. They give me an air cast and are supposed to be arranging an appointment with an orthopedic specialist this week. I didn't want this to wreck my work contract (I need the money) so he wrote me a note saying I cannot climb ladders or do any climbing whatsoever, and that the cast must stay on for six weeks. I can walk with the cast on, but it's not fun. Also on Indomethacin for inflammation.  I called off sick today, but my next workday is Wednesday and I plan to show up, cast and all, and ask if there are any duties I can be given that don't involve climbing or ladders. I have no idea if they'll go for it or if they'll just call off the contract and send me packing.  Have no idea what my rights are, or if being a contractor makes any difference. I suspect the injury happened in the first couple of days when I was hopping off the last rung or two of the ladder, but I never reported anything to anyone at the time. How will the fact that I have diabetes and leg/foot numbness play into this? My right leg/foot is weak due to a back injury in the early 90's as well. I ended up with a 30% permanent partial disability due to this, adjudicated by the Workers Comp Board of Texas.  Thanks very much for any advice you can give."	Yes
I am to receive zero paid or unpaid childcare leave from my employer. But I do have to get FMLA.  Would it be possible to work right after my child is born and take FMLA a few months later?  I cannot be out of work for a few months because my husband cannot support us alone. However, I can take the summer months off as I will have an off books position where I can earn money while not working.	Yes
"(suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.  At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.  I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was ""I'll talk to you when I get back"" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule.   Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there.   This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting.   But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying ""I'm too sick to work"" contradicts ""The way you run this place is inhospitable for me"".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there.   What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?"	Yes
If you are married and if the wife (not working) has higher income (passive) and the other has very low income (working very hard at a tough job) and a severe medical issue, can the husband claim SSI, or is he dependent on his wife's income and won't qualify because she makes too much money?	Yes
Hello,  I got denied my unemployment because I did not go in person and register for unemployment. I was unaware that I needed to do this step. However, I have followed everything else pretty much down to the letter. How can I file for protest and win?	Yes
Hey everyone. I'm not sure where to look for information, or what to search for. I've tried a bit, and found some information, but not complete.   So here's the situation.   I'm 8 months pregnant, my husband went to work for a company to go tree planting for a couple of months.   Turns out it's a shitty company and he wants to leave early. He told the boss that he needs to come back to help me, as I'm on sick leave currently.   His boss said two things that are making me scratch my head.   1. He needs me to provide a sick note detailing why I'm sick and what's wrong with me. I told my husband that in the note I provided my employer, it didn't say anything about why I am sick, just that I am sick and that I will be off work from this date until this date.   2. Then he said that if my husband leaves now, instead of paying per tree, my husband will get paid minimum wage for the hours worked. My husband also said that he can stay for one more week.   My husband doesn't have a copy of his contract, and will talk to his boss tomorrow to get a copy.   I'm just wondering about the legalities of leaving a contract early, and if the boss can change the rate of pay in this situation.   Also I tried looking into family sick leave in MB, and I found a phone number I can call to ask more. Unfortunately tomorrow is Sunday and I may have to wait until Monday to call.   Also if he is in a different province, what provinces labour laws should he be following, assuming this company is a MB company?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
My boyfriends parents, but my mom and dad enough in heart.  Dad (50) has been fighting for disability for over 7yrs, but the first 2 were spent in VA and somehow there is suddenly no record of the doctors appointment had back then. Bad genes and work injury and mental health issues. He's been unable to work. They have been in more than poverty since moving from VA to GA. Mom (51) has been working as best she can with existing fibromialga, diabetes, and having had 2 heart attacks to this point in life. She shouldn't be working, but someone has had to. Little more than a year ago, she got hurt on the job, and while in the midst of a high pay out court case, their house burnt down. Lightning in a midnight April storm. Everything gone but the car that was in a mostly disconnected garage. She wasn't home, but dad &amp; the pets were. They all survived, but the thing was that they could barely put food on the table and gas in the car with other bills to pay on what few hours mom could work in her pained state, so of course they had no home insurance. Mom had to accept a tiny payout and just give up on her case for lack of funds, mental ability, and physical ability to deal with everything.  They were homeless, living in and out of their garage til winter, couch sleeping with not so great family, until a few months ago. Finally got the acres sold that the house had been on. That was April. They got into a rental recently after going about trying to find a place to buy/rent. They ended up having to get a car, they paid off debts, she got a credit card to work on credit to get a loan for a house. They didn't get any substantial amount from the property. They are mostly out of money now, they were sure this disability situation would be sorted out by now, but it's not. It's the absolute opposite. They are facing homelessness again, losing their vehicle, losing their pets, and their minds at this point.  I've not seen the letter about the denial of back pay. I live 3hours away, but will see it in a week. I'm not in the position to help outside of moral support and helping her keep her head on track. She's called government entities, she's got a couple letters to right, I was told she could write a 'Letter of Need' and take it to the social security office... They are in their 50s. I was homeless at 18 and pregnant, to boot. I remember how that was... I can't begin to imagine how this is all impacting them beyond the face they try to keep up for the sake of looking strong.  Now... I have to apologize for going on and one. Here is where I ask for options? Suggestions? They are in Union County. For what that's worth. I couldn't even find a way to fight a divorce I just went through, I've been unable to find them any kind of legal support being so far away.   They need hope..	Yes
Hey everyone~ using a throwaway account for this. Please let me know if this is the right place to post or if there's a similar post I may reference.   So I became disabled recently (off the clock) and found out I'll need surgery which would leave me immobile for the next 2-3 months, and won't return to an active lifestyle for another 8 months. Because my job is high physical activity I am in the process of claiming disability and my employer has been extremely helpful. Since I also live in a walk-up in an urban area I can't access my apartment safely without supervision so I decided to stay with my mom in a different state until I can have the surgery.   The problem is I didn't have insurance at the time of the disability so I've been having to pay out of pocket for MRI/X ray and Doctors visits to make sure I would really need surgery, out of the state I live in. My insurance kicks in next month so I'll have to wait until then to get the surgery, unless I want to pay over 10k out of pocket. I can't yet make an appointment for the surgery because I'm not insured yet, even though I will be at the time of the appointment. I get it, it's a legal issue. There are a lot of 'should haves' in this scenario and I am to blame for why this is spiraling. I'm gaining back control of the situation but it's going to be a longer process now. However, this is not where my issue is.  I went to urgent care and paid out of pocket so I could get referred for an MRI and specialist. Okay. Did that. When I saw the specialist I asked specifically if I would be able to work and how long would it be. He said absolutely not and that it would take up to 8 months to recover, post-op, back to my high activity level. My employer then suggested I file for disability. When I spoke to the office again they said they wouldn't fill out my claim because I'm not getting the surgery with them and that it could be a legal issue, however when I pressed them on why they didn't really give me a lot of information. When I spoke with my employer's insurance company they said they just needed the word on whether I could work or not, and that the surgery dates could be figured out later.   Then, I tried going to the urgent care to see if that first Doctor could fill out my disability form (since he was the one who referred me and scheduled the MRI etc). His receptionist said that it would take up to 2-3 visits, possibly more to get the claim filled out ($150 per visit!). It's literally one sheet of paper asking if I can work. That's it. The MRI is proof enough I can't and I have my medical forms from the hospital. When I asked why she wouldn't give me an explanation, all she said was it would take time to fill out the paperwork (but doesn't know exactly how much time) and that we could see a specialist if I needed it that badly. I am at a loss. I'm in the process of finding my own specialist and surgeon in my state and that's become a wholly different issue otherwise I could've had that provider help (and will if none of this gets figured out but time is a factor with paperwork) ...  Can the hospital refuse to sign the disability papers because I'm not having the surgery with them even though they told me I will absolutely need surgery and won't be able to work?  Can the urgent care doctor ask for an unknown amount of medical visits just to fill out one piece of paper? I feel like I'm being price gouged.  I know this is my fault, yes I should've had insurance and yes I should've seen a doctor in my state immediately to start the process of finding a specialist. I really did not think my injury was  going to need surgery at the time and thought I could just heal my way out of it. I'm learning a hard lesson this month and paying out of pocket for it. Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you	Yes
I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.	Yes
My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	Yes
We are located in Alberta, Canada.   Over the course of the past year, my mother has suffered a debilitating illness that has kept her from working.  There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc).   My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.    We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we don’t know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage.   Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.	Yes
I left a large chain retail to work for a start up as a pharmaceutical rep on march 20th. Unfortunately on July 10th I was let go . The reasons were  1) a doctor in an office that I was in charge of but never met started prescribing less. Ironically it's not even a doctor of mine.  2) my prescription count wasn't going up fast enough. I was given a brand new area where a majority of insurances are not being covered with our particular product.  3) due to the fact I don't drive, I wasn't given a company car and had to be on foot. This resulted in me dragging a small suitcase on wheels around. A portion of the job required me to pick up hard copies before I bring it to the office. I generally kept hard copies at home because I was afraid of being a target and having someone steal the suitcase. This according to my boss was a HIPPA violation.   My question is if I file for unemployment, should I expect some sort of retaliation?  What can I do if I get some sort of legal document in the mail? My former boss is currently suing former employees for violating our contracts. So I'm very worried about getting anything from him.   Thank you for any and all advice.	Yes
"Back story: My company (A) was acquired 1.5 years ago (January 2016) by company (B). In the agreement they were required to keep all company A employees for one year. After that year was over they laid a few of us off for financial reasons.   I was sadly one of those and am now filing for unemployment. It asks me to ""Provide your employment history for the past 18 months, including your very last employer.""   Do I include company A and company B TOGETHER as one company where I have worked for the past 18 months? or list them separately? There is nowhere to include information about the acquisition.   Thanks for the help!"	Yes
I am 6 months pregnant. I applied for WIC to help with basics such as milk and eggs, since I consume a lot of those and we are currently functioning on one income (my husband's). We were married last October and although I plan to take his last name, we have not gotten around to doing that yet. All of my identification still says my original name.  The first time I went in, the woman who registered me with WIC assumed that my name was changed, even though all of my identification had my original name. When the vouchers printed wrong, we immediately told them and then they reprinted with my correct name.  When I went back for my follow up appointment today, it happened again. I called and somehow they said they have no record of my actual name. So they could not have corrected the error in their computer system, just reprinted the vouchers.   When my husband looked more closely, he noticed that the middle initial is also wrong. Looking up people in our area, we found that the name they have given me is an actual other person here.   We don't understand how this happened; I provided original social security card, photo state ID, birth certificate, and a host of other documents with my correct name, SSN, and birthdate on it. But it appears they have filed me as a completely different identity and have been dispensing my vouchers as such this whole time.   The situation is even stranger because they told me they are connected with Medicaid. But my medicaid card has the correct name and birth date on it.   I am wary of this situation because I have a separate legal issue (fraud case relating to a small business I formerly ran) currently going on that my lawyer is working on getting dropped. It is unconnected to WIC, but I really do not need anything that was not my doing looking fraud-y right now.   So I asked WIC on the phone if I could come in tomorrow to have it fixed and they said yes. But 1) I have no idea of how to make sure they actually fix it this time and don't just reprint it while keeping me linked to another person, and 2) I asked if I could get anything in writing documenting the error for my personal records and they seemed hesitant, said they'd have to ask a supervisor. I do not care whatsoever about trying to get anyone fired, I just need something that clearly indicates this was not my doing. I don't know what is and is not legal regarding government institutions such as medicaid and wic, but it doesn't seem right if any blame for this falls on me because I cannot obtain from them any proof that I gave them 100% original, correct information from the start.   I would prefer to just not have WIC at this point, but we do need it until I can go back to work.   In case I need it, how can I - 1) obtain some kind of proof that this was not my error, and 2) Ensure that they have my correct identity on file?	Yes
Thanks in advance. I am posting for my girlfriend who recently got put into this position. She has a chronic pain issue that makes her unable to work a few days a month. She applied for FMLA with her employer but was 30 days too early so she was ineligible by the date, otherwise she would have qualified and been approved.  Her employer's reaction to learning this was to force her to move positions and take a roughly 12% pay cut as well. It seems as if this was a direct reaction to learning that she would be able to protect her position and pay rate in 30 days when she will be eligible. Anything that can be done?	Yes
"To keep this short and not go into historical detail, my mother's income is only $400/month child support and about $450/month social security. She is permanently disabled due to a spinal fusion that did not go well at all. She is 52 and has been permanently disabled for ~15 years now. Government help has barely been help. I know she was receiving food stamps about 10-12 years ago until her social worker claimed she was lying on who was living with her, accusing my mother for lying about my sister not living with us when she really was. So my mom's paying back a minimum payment of about $30 for I don't even know how many years due to this ""incorrect"" information.  My main questions: 1. Can you work while on social security? 2. Is social security different from disability? Can you get both? 3. What type of lawyer is best to try and get my mom the most government help or let me know if there are options to work."	Yes
TL;DR- Got lost in the health insurance system due to a glitch; now have a wisdom tooth tearing up my mouth and want to know if it's okay to get medical help despite being in an appeal process   So! Back in December of 2016, I applied for health insurance via NY State of Health and uploaded my tax returns as proof of income (I'm freelance). I was then told I hadn't given enough information of proof of income despite uploading my tax return, so called the phone line to ask what more I needed to do. They told me tax documents were enough, it was a glitch in their system, and they would contact me when it was all settled. In February I hadn't heard from them yet, so called again to check in---was told once again that it was a glitch and they would contact me shortly.  Fast forward to now--I still hadn't heard from them, but apparently have a wisdom tooth that decided to show up in my mouth last week and wreck havoc (constant pain, hard to eat, hurts to swallow, all that fun stuff). I called the office again to check in, was told it was a massive error on their part and they got me set up to pick a plan (which I did), except it doesn't start until August--I cannot make it much longer like this, one week has already been hell. I then requested to file for backdating due to an urgent medical need, which was denied (not sure why entirely, more than willing to call and ask for specifics if that's helpful).   I can expand on all of this further if the wall of text hasn't already been a turn off, but the basic questions I have are:  -now that I'm filing an appeal, is it okay to still get my tooth removed or does that hurt my standing in the appeal process?  -if I win this appeal will I be reimbursed for whatever costs my dental would've covered (if it's kosher to remove the tooth)?  -is it terribly stupid to not have someone to represent me for this telephone hearing?  Thank you for any/all help and hope everyone is having a wonderful Sunday!	Yes
Hey, so I'm getting laid off in the state of Pennsylvania. I have a bit of advanced warning, and I know they are going to offer me a shitty contract employee position that pays by the job.  I'm not going to accept that job, and am actively looking for work. It won't pay nearly as well, and involves being out in the field 100%, while my current position only requires occasional field work.   Can I file for unemployment in my state? Or does my rejecting the shitty job disqualify me? I'm pretty surey boss offers everyone he fires a shitty job to avoid paying unemployment to anyone.   It won't affect my decision, but it will help me plan financially.   Thanks!	Yes
She has a pacemaker, and is a 3 time cancer survivor in her mid 20s. She has been in and out of the hospital every month for the past few years. First it was heart issues, and another was breathing problems. She got many heart surgeries, including heart valve and stents. She has had heart attacks too. She barely has any muscle on the back of her neck, so its hard on her to look up while at work.  I almost lost my mom many times. I'm 20, she is 52. All of these problems are from the radiation she endured in her twenties. Recently, she was hospitalized for over a month because she couldn't breath. She had fluid drained out of her lungs, which was a major surgery. She made it through it, and now has to use an oxygen machine at home and oxygen tanks every where she goes.   We struggle financially, and as a college student that works almost 40 hours a week, half of my paycheck goes to bills. She has applied for disability twice, and has been denied twice. I'm in shock, especially because of everything she has been through. And now that she relys on oxygen tanks, it makes me feel horrible she has to still work because she got denied. We did get a lawyer, but it could take up to 2 years now.   Is there any way to fast track this process? Or any place we can appeal this? There is absolutely no reason she should have been denied. Any advice is greatly appreciated. I'm a Florida resident if that helps.  Edit: we were also denied food stamps, even though we can barely afford food and barely get by with bills. She has lost too much weight since she has been on the oxygen machine.	Yes
Someone I know has worked under the table untaxed for over a decade. Is it possible to sign up for government healthcare without drawing attention from the IRS? Could she potentially say she just started working?	Yes
Throwaway for obvious reasons.   TLDR at end.   Was arrested late may 2017 in Santa Barbara County , CA for 2 misdemeanor drug possession charges. One read 'Possession of controlled substance' and the other 'Possession of controlled substance without prescription'.   Got Court tomorrow and wondering what I should expect for an outcome. Private lawyer.   The two substances were (1) SINGLE LSD TAB and ~15 KLONOPIN 2MG PILLS (prescription benzo).   The way I was arrested tells as follows -   Sitting in car looking up food store location with my buddy. Im in driver he is passenger. We have a single tall open beer can in the center front cup holder. I have my LSD, KLONOPIN and a bag of MAGIC MUSHROOMS in the side compartment of the front driver door. We are apparently illegally parked / pulled off to the side of the road in a residential area. Keys are in ignition, engine running. It is late, between 12-1am at this point.    A cop knocks on the window and asks what we are doing, we proceed to tell him we are looking for a directions. He then sees the open beer can in the car and tells us to step out of the car. Asks to search and I say yes. Finds all drugs and asks who they are. Tell him my buddy left them there. He arrests me on the spot for having them in the car on drivers side. Spend night in jail (~14 hours), and get out and move on.   What should I expect as a reasonable outcome w my private lawyer? This is my first time offense , I've never previously been arrested. Is there any specific way I should handle myself in court? Also, why didnt the officer charge me for the magic mushrooms/ open beer? I was being very nice and cooperative during the entire time, maybe that helped?  TL;DR  I got arrested in SB, CA for possession of controlled sub and possession of controlled sub no prescrip. First time offense with a private lawyer. What can I expect at my court date tomorrow?	No
So I was an idiot and signed a year's apartment lease without noticing that there was a notice that the building is being converted to condominiums at an unspecified date, and that we can be obligated to leave because of this. My roommate saw this and won't sign, and neither will her co-signer. Am I still held to this lease and responsible for covering all of the rent? The contract does not allow subletters. In the event that we can leave, are we entitled our security deposit back?  Los Angeles people, does this kind of notice to convert and remodel generally mean that demolition would occur during my lease?	No
My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	No
"My brother had given a ""friend"" power of attorney for real estate matters only. He revoked this last month and made me the new power of attorney in all matters (durable), including of course, real estate matters. The friend just submitted a Mortgage Balloon Payment document to the county where this friend is supposed to receive a large amount of money when my brother's house sells. The friend submitted it under my brother's name with the old power of attorney document. My brother was never informed and was incapacitated at the time. He already has a mortgage with another company, so obviously this is fraud, right? What charges can we bring against the friend, especially since he declared himself as the lender of this phoney mortgage and stands to get the house if it's not paid back by a certain date. This is in Florida. Thank you."	No
Last winter, my roommates and I were looking for an apartment, and came across a nice looking student housing complex. When we went to the office of the complex, we were told that we could not see the actual unit we would occupy yet because we had not yet been assigned one, and there were people living in all of them at the moment. A couple days ago, we finally were notified of our unit number (note that we move in Aug. 1st and today is July 28th). Anyways, I live two states over from my college, so I was not able to go see the apartment. My roommate, however, had the joy of seeing it today. The unit was on the out skirts of the complex, basically in the woods. Mt roommate noticed that the current tenants were home, and decided to knock on the door and ask to simply look around. Our town has a real sense of community, and everyone is super nice so this is not as odd as it sounds. The current tenant then proceeded to show my roommate the mold that was growing throughout the apartment, the roach and spider infestation, and the wet carpet from a leak coming from God knows where. The tenant also informed my roommate that there was a snake in the apartment one day... a fucking snake... and management did nothing about it. Their dryer was broken all semester, and once again, management and maintenance did nothing to fix it. I am wondering if there is any way for us to get out of this lease? Maybe because we were not able to see the property beforehand? I know basic contract law, which is why I am scared that we are royally fucked. Can we get out of it because of the unsafe living conditions?	No
Okay so I've lived at this house for 15+ years, can the co owner evict me in court if the owner and I have a lease agreement stating I can stay? Please help I have court next week. :-/	No
Hello Everyone,  I got a new contract for a job in UK, everything seems fine except one clause which I think is very vaguely defined.  &gt;During your employment you will not be employed, engaged, &gt;interested or concerned in any activity, office or outside business &gt;interests (whether paid or unpaid) without the written consent of &gt;the Executive Management team.   &gt;You will disclose in writing to the Executive Management team &gt;any such activities, offices or outside business interests you may &gt;currently have and in the event that the Executive Management &gt;team requires you to cease the same, you will do so forthwith.  &gt;For the avoidance of doubt consent will not be given in relation &gt;to any activities, offices or business interests which in the view of &gt;the Executive Management team, are similar to, or compete &gt;directly or indirectly with the business of the Company or which &gt;could in the view of the Executive Management team, give rise to &gt;a conflict of interest or interfere with the efficient performance of &gt;your duties.  However, such consent will not be unreasonably &gt;withheld.   As far as I understand if I haven't misunderstood it. They potentially can forbid me to do any sort of work, even volunteering for example for a local shelter.  Anyway, my main issue is that I already own a business which is in a completely unrelated field to the employment, hence I'm concerned.  I was wondering what do you gents/gals think about this clause, and would modifying the first sentence with something like this would help?  &gt;that may harm the interests of the Company, interfere with the &gt;Employee’s work time or to a not insubstantial extent occupy the &gt;Employee’s manpower.	No
So I recently moved into an apartment and I don't feel as though its clean enough. I've come across dead bugs, alive bugs, dust, and mildew in my AC. I've submitted maintenance requests for them and am waiting for the reply. Should I ask for professional cleaning to be done? Upon moving in, I was never shown the apartment, which is bad on my part because I should've asked. Instead, I was shown a beautiful model of what my place would look like and when move in Day came it looked totally different. I'm not sure what to do about this. [dirty apartment](https://imgur.com/gallery/OVzPT)  There are pee stains on the side of the kitchen table, cracks in the corners of the walls, dust everywhere, stains under the cabinets, the toilet bottom of the toilet looks hideous. I asked if maintenance could take care of the decaying floor board behind the toilet, and they just covered it up with a new one. I feel as though I've been cheated and locked into a lease. Thank you	No
I have a petty misdemeanor for shoplifting in New Mexico from 4 years ago. I left the state without dealing with it and now I'm living in Colorado. I finally have my shit together and I want to resolve this but have no idea what I'm doing. I looked into it and obviously I have a warrant for not appearing in court. I talked to a criminal lawyer in Albuquerque and he would charge 1000 to represent me and would first file a motion to quash the warrant.   So I'm wondering if this would be my best option or is there some way I can deal with this myself without having to get an attorney? Maybe a public defender? I'd like to not have this on my record but I'm mainly worried about this warrant. I'm currently trying to find an apartment in Colorado and I feel like this is definitely going to cause problems when I start applying. As it is I don't have very much money so paying an attorney 1000 on top of whatever other costs I'll have is going to be hard. Should I call the Albuquerque court house and try to deal with this myself or will that just make things worse? Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.	No
"This is my first time having to deal with renting, but my roommates have rented several times before. We are all going to grad school (my first year, their last year). We have assistantships that give us a paycheck each month. There is a mobile home park across the street from school, and they have great sized homes for what we need - three bedrooms, two full baths, a washer/dryer, dishwasher, central air, etc. It's a pretty great deal.  When we were originally looking, the price range (depending on size and age of the unit) was $879-$929. We put in an application and got accepted, and **at that point paid the $200 deposit**. We called to inquire about a moving date, got told mid-July or end of for moving in, and was alerted that the prices were being raised by corporate and it was now $959-$979. They told us the unit we have was $979 a month...but it wasn't a new unit.  Okay, kind of crappy, but we all estimated highly for rent just to be on the safe side. My other roommates have been heading talking to them, I was just ""added in"" to the contract. According to my roommates, they have been rude. After inquiring about why we are getting a higher price, they were snippy and explained it was corporate and not them.  Fast forward to yesterday, they told us rent is possibly being raised to $999 a month, which is completely absurd. The manager told us she would ""go to bat"" for us to keep the $979 rate after my roommates absolutely blew up her phone and e-mail. She then complained to my roommates that it was only $6 extra per person so she doesn't understand why it was such a big deal. We are paid pennies in grad school, we can't afford a lot in rent especially since we have to pay other utilities here as well as fees and that's not including food and gas. She then proceeded to say that we should be grateful we are getting a spot with such a good deal and so close to the school with so many utilities covered (we have to pay electricity, gas, and internet.) That's a lie, a few other places cover almost all utilities but they have no availability and if we bring it up they'll just drop the contract and tell us to go there instead.  Something about this seems very wrong, it doesn't sit right. I understand that corporate could be raising prices, but isn't it a thing that the price is locked in after paying the deposit? We are paying the rest right before we move in, **as well as signing the contract (we have not done that yet.)** We also have to determine a moving date, we don't know when that is either. We know complexes and parks near schools extort students, especially right across the street from the school, and that is a reason why the price is so high. But it's too late to find something else, I am also scared that if we keep fighting they will take away our contract and we will be homeless.  Since we have not signed the contract, is there anything we can do? I have this impending feeling they will raise the price and continue doing so until I literally will not have any extra money."	No
So here's the problem.. I have a subtenant living in my house renting a room (the landlord is my step-father). He went off the wall a few weeks ago for reasons I won't get into but he still owes the tenant he's leasing from about $12 of rent (not a big deal but important). We've also noticed our food from the kitchen has been going missing more frequently and my other roommate had a whole unopened box of granola bars stolen after he bought them to replace the first, half-finished box that was also stolen. Other food things have also gone missing, the granola bars were just really obvious.   We're also very uncomfortable around him because just a week or two ago he was screaming at my step-dad and mother about everything under the sun and seemed generally mentally-unstable. We are now locking our doors always and since I'm a 110lbs female and he's a 200lbs male I try to avoid being around him because of his lashing out a little while ago.   As a side note his boyfriend pretty much lives in his room with him.   So my question is, how can I get him out? I know the LTA doesn't apply to him because I'm the landlords immediate family, but this makes it hard to find info relevant to our situation. I'm considering setting up a security camera in the kitchen to see if I can catch him stealing but I'm afraid of the laws surrounding camera uses and his room is right off the kitchen so I would be capturing his door in the frame.   I appreciate your advice in advance!	No
I bought a truck on Craigslist I tried to do my research looked up the vin and wasn't stolen or damaged. When I made the deal took a picture of the guys license and the license plate of the car he drove, I payed cash. when I went to go register the truck they told me the trucks title was fake as well as the owners license but that since the truck wasn't stolen they could make me a bonded title but would need to contact the police. The police came and told me they needed to take a truck and open an investigation that if everything was fine it would be returned in a weeks top. It has been almost a month and I haven't heard anything back. What can I do ?	No
My dad was arrested last year in Fulton County, Georgia on a theft by taking misdemeanor. He found a phone and took it home to wait for someone to call to return it, but he forgot about for, left it in the car and the cops tracked it down. My dad gave the phone to the cops when they camped out in our neighborhood, but was arrested and taken to the Atlanta jail. My mom had to pay his $2970 bail to get him out the following morning and was told he will be receiving notice of a court date within three months. This happened two years ago and we are still waiting on a court date notification in the mail. Is this the normal process? Do we just have to wait? I read online about a 1 year statue of limitations on theft charges in Georgia to be charged, but I don't know if this applies to my dad. Since a year passed, can he still be charged or has he already been charged? We have a card that says to call the state court clerk after 3 months if we do not receive a court notification so we called three months after his arrest and they told us to continue to wait. Should we call back to get an update or will they tell us the same thing?	No
My business partner just signed us up to a vodaphone red plan, he told me we would get 10 GB each but after reading the plans terms it's only 10 GB for the first month and 5 for the rest, is this legal, is there a window or option to cancel it within the first month?	No
We're looking for housing in San Francisco, and a lot of houses say no pets. Our understanding is that since one of our roommates has an ESA, they can't discriminate against us having a pet and we don't need to disclose this to them. Is that true?	No

This is Australian but any help is welcome, happy to answer questionsShort term tenants have been drying their clothes on a line inside and not using proper ventilation causing mould, I've made many attempts to fix the problem, fix fans and create more ventilation through the house.

I plan on getting local legal Advice very soon, but please comment, any advice is welcome.	No
My lease expired on June 30. Gave more than the standard 30 days notice (as required by lease as well) that I would not be renewing.  Landlord resides out of state and dealt with his realtor in Houston for all transactions (though I paid him the rent directly). Last communication I had with either realtor or landlord was realtor saying to wait until first week of July for a walk-through. Heard nothing back for the entire month of July. August 1 I asked about the walk-through and security deposit, and provided a forwarding address (I know, I didn't provide it right away but the [statute](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PR/htm/PR.92.htm#92.107) seems to provide for that lapse still.   Still heard nothing back and followed up with another email on August 7, landlord wrote back saying the remainder of the deposit would be forthcoming after he got deductions and itemization from the realtor (separate dispute I'll have to fight).   Since it has now been 38 days since the lease expired, [has the landlord acted in bad faith and is this worth pursuing through an attorney?](http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/PR/htm/PR.92.htm#92.109)	No
Hello everyone,  I'm located in Pinellas County, FL (city of St. Petersburg). I'm looking to add to my middle name/hyphenate it.  i.e. first, middle-middle, last name.  Do I have to file a petition for change of name to legally add this additional name to my middle name only?  I'm debating whether it's worth filing the paperwork, paying the fees &amp; investing the time.  Thanks in advance!	No
As the title says I was pulled over for speeding and found that my license had been suspended due to an unpaid ticket, which I thought I had paid. It had been suspended for quite a while, over a year. I've paid my fines and gotten my license reinstate. Colorado laws says I have to have knowledge of the suspension but I'm not sure how I can prove I was unaware. I can't afford an attorney. I can bring bank records to show I used Uber to get to work from the time I was suspended until it was reinstated. I remember receiving notices in the mail about the ticket but got nothing saying I was suspended, when spoke with the credit agency holding the account for my unpaid ticket they had an incorrect address for me, should I mention this? Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know what to do or what to expect. My court date is Thursday. Thank you ahead of time for any advice or encouragement.	No
I'd prefer to leave my location out as it is quite a small place and I don't want people knowing about this for obvious reasons. It is in Asia if that helps any and I am willing to PM the country to anyone that asks.  Basically I overheard my brother on the phone mentioning that he had videos of him and his girlfriend in compromising situations and I told my parents as well... they needed to know. I was told that they knew and that my mother had accidentally seen the video when she went to turn off his computer.   Both him and his girlfriend are under 16 and my parents have confronted him telling him how illegal this is and stuff but he is just not listening and denying everything. There was no like actual sex but just other stuff in the video apparently.   Legally how fucked is he? 	No
My mother-in-law is about to visit my wife and I for 3 days (Thursday night, leaving Sunday evening.)  We have strong reasons to believe that MiL's spouse will attempt to have her served for divorce, while she's staying with us.  (His motivations would likely be: (1) doesn't have to deal with her in the immediate aftermath, since she'll be 200 miles away (2) snubbing my wife and I for perceived past transgressions, and (3) MiL might be inclined to ask to stay with us, rather than return to a tension-filled situation at her domicile  (a request that my wife and I would unanimously deny.)  While we don't want to interfere with the court, we also don't want to be used as pawns in MiL's current-husband's game.  Asking her not to come is not an option that I am allowed to consider.  So I want to know where the legal limits are on how I can delay service until after we have returned her home.  * Are we allowed to lie to a process server, and claim that she is not present at our house, when she is? * If we decide to just put her up in a hotel room &amp; visit her there-- taking other precautions to not be followed-- can the court's process server just hand the documents over to another adult at my residence, and consider her properly served?	No
Hi all, 18 year old from GA. I made a paypal when I was under 18, roughly in 2014 so about 15 years old when I made it. Lied about DOB, did NOT attach SSN to the paypal, and attached my debit card when I was maybe 17. My dad just sent me something saying that paypal can seize funds of accounts made by minors, but I have no money in my account, only on my debit card, and I never put my social into the paypal account. Could paypal take the money from my bank for being a minor at the time? Anyway my credit could be negatively affected? Should I make a new account? Not really wanting to make a new account, because then I would also have to make a new email and get a new debit card.	No
I have my court date coming up for getting pulled over with weed in my car. I was arrested and I got out on a PR bond. I'm not really sure what to expect or what I should plea. Any suggestions?	No
My financial situation changed due to me leaving an abusive relationship and at the time, the best decision for my son was to let him live with his grandparents while I got into a better financial and living situation. (GA, USA) The problem is ever since I started talking about being ready they started alienating me from my son (now 6 yrs old). So now that I'm fully ready and without doubt can give him the life he deserves, I have filed a petition for terminating guardianship, which was rejected and now has led us to court soon. I have a few questions about what is admissible in court specifically: Text messages, and call logs (where calls were not answered or returned), a notarized statement from a witness, can I have a (sibling) character witness?  It has been about 2.5 years since I signed over guardianship and I've continually requested and been shot down for visitation through the last 2 years. and have been trying to convince them to terminate for at least 6 months now.	No
So i was out the other night with a couple friends and not so wisely decided to bang out a couple doughnuts in an empty parking lot. Shortly after a cop rolled up and wrote me up for reckless driving. I am not sure weather or not i should hire a lawyer to fight this and court or what the cost would be to do so. Any help would be great, -Ryan	No
My daughter was refered by her dentist to another dentist to see if a very small cavity needed to be filled and to consult about possibly getting veneers. She is 17. She went back and was gone for 2 hours. The receptionist blew off my requests for information about what was going on multiple times. When they brought her out she looked like hell. They had done an unauthorized root canal on her. I am pissed off. My daughter now has a giant silver molar that was put into place without asking. What do i do here?	No
Background: I live in a house with several housemates, and the set of people typically changes some each year before we renew our lease. Our relationship with the landlord has always been relaxed. We all sign one lease, but there is no vetting of applicants, we don't ever sign on time, rent increases have always been small, and informally communicated at the end of the year.  Current: This year our landlord wants to add some professionalism to the mix (vetting new lease applications), and increase rent substantially more than in the past. We are completely fine with these changes.  Problem. The issue we face is that our new lease begins in approximately a week, and we have been told varying accounts of the changes to the rent price after having already found new people to that have tentatively agreed move in. At first our landlord said to expect a small increase (a couple weeks ago). This is normal and we didn't think anything of it. With a week left, we found out today that the price if much higher, and we risk losing people who had agreed to an original price.  Does anyone have any advice? We've read all of the information regarding required time for notice of rent increase, but it doesn't address at all the case that a new lease is being drawn up. It feels like we have no legal leverage, but it feels so underhanded that i'm wondering if I missed something in my research.  I guess the worst case is that we don't find anyone and we all just move out without signing.	No
Quick question for everyone here. I just got a speeding ticket via photo enforcement in Washington DC. I was going 16 over so it's a 150 dollar fine.   I have two questions for everyone here.    1) If I go to contest the penalty is there a judge that I speak with or is it a random person behind a desk? I ask this because it looks like the address is just a suite and not a court house.   2) What are the odds that the judge lowers the fine if I've never had a moving violation before? (Been driving for over 6 years) Is it even worth me going in? Or should I just pay it.    I am obviously guilty of speeding. I'm not contesting the ticket itself. I am wondering if the fine can be reduced though.	No
On 7/7 my landlord texted me saying she was selling the house we live in. I was a little shocked but ok it's her house and we just rent it. Her text stated we have 30 days to move out. I responded by politely stating that since we are currently month to month ( we had a one year lease but stated on as periodic tenants) and have been living there over a year we were required to receive 60 days notice. I also asked for us to be served properly as I believe an unclear text message was not proper notice.   Landlord sent a certified letter dated 7/7 stating our move out date is 9/1. By my count the date should be 9/6. Landlord scheduled a walk through with her realtor a few days later which was fine. At the time she said she would forgo giving us our deposit back in exchange for us not paying rent for August. She said the house was in great condition (true). The Realtor wanted to put a lock box on the door which I objected to. We have dogs and I don't want people in and out of our home when we aren't there. She agreed and I asked for 24 hours notice of showings so one of us can be home.   Then the realtor sent a super aggressive photographer to take pictures of the property. Fine it was super invasive but it's done. Now the realtor is texting me wanting showings with two hours notice. I said no and gave her a list of other times that would work when someone would be home.   My question is:   Should I address the 60 thing or just cut my losses and move on 9/1? I want my landlord to give us a good recommendation. We are actively looking for new places but haven't found one.   What can I do about the realtor scheduling  showings? What are my rights?   Thank you 	No
My father plans on getting re-married later in his life.  I always thought when he passes away my brother and I would gain his inheritance and estate, but will my new stepmother be the new heir?  My father is older than her, so he will most likely pass away first.  My soon-to-be stepmother also has two children of her own.  I'm afraid she will gain all my father's assets and use them to benefit her children.  Is it still possible for my brother and I to inherit all my fathers property and assets when the inevitable happens.  We all live in California.	No
My ex and I were married for 10 years and we got divorced 3.5 years ago. He is an attorney and black mailed me into waiving the spousal support or else he would ruin my life. I have been through therapy and am ready to go back to court to modify the child support because I have had a change in income. Can I also ask my lawyer to look into the spousal support? I am no longer afraid of him and even though I waived the support I was under duress. He took advantage of his knowledge as an attorney and held me under duresss. Is this all possible? 	No
I interned in another state this summer, and took over a lease for housing. I signed in early April, moved in May 6, and my lease ended July 31.    In the lease that I signed with the complex, it states my lease start date as May 6, and says that I am to pay a total of $1738, which is equal to two months of rent. I assumed that the girl whose lease I took over read this, and was ok with it. Now, three months later, she is demanding that I pay her back $600 for the month of May. She has said that she will be filing a claim in small claims court today if I do not pay her.     I am not familiar with how small claims court would work when I live in another state. We are currently in Georgia, but I will be moving back to Florida next week.     Since the lease I signed states that I am only responsible for two months of rent, I do not think I am obligated to pay her. We also never talked about me paying her back for May.     What are my options here?	No
"My boyfriend and I decided we were ready to start house hunting; we found a place we liked and put in an offer, after some negotiation it was accepted. Initially, I was involved in all the documents with our real estate agent (a friend of the family) when drafting offers, and I met with the mortgage broker, but other than that, my boyfriend has been the one handling everything with the agent/broker/lawyer.  About a week ago, my boyfriend said that the broker advised leaving me off the ""mortgage documents"" because I was unemployed and he was the primary bacon maker.  He works in emergency response, I'm a game designer about to start my own company, but am currently unemployed until after the house is settled - one big life change at a time. Anyway, that made sense to me; I will have no active income at the time of the move (already put in notice at my current job).  What he has come to explain to me more fully is that I will not be on any of the formal documents; we renegotiated the offer one last time (for some work to be completed before the closing date, as recommended by our home inspector) to be drafted by the end of today, but my boyfriend now tells me that I will not be a part of those documents and only he will be signing them; that it was the recommendation of the mortgage broker. He explained that, if I were to be included in the documents, any of my debts would add to his and he would no longer be approved for the mortgage at all.  It is true that I have a $400 balance on my credit card, but that is my only debt in the world (his credit card balance is somewhere around $3000).  My boyfriend also said that a lawyer could draft a document stating that I was an equal owner of the property, even if my name doesn't go on the documents he is signing and sending off today.  My question is, does all of this sound legit? Is my $400 debt enough to write me out of the whole deal? Could a document like that be prepared after-the-fact? In Canada, there is a bit of a boost for home buyers tax returns (the year they purchase) - would I still be eligible for this if my name is not technically on the offer, bank documents, or deed to the property?  Thanks all - sorry if this doesn't make sense or if I don't know what I'm talking about!"	No
Hi /r/legaladvice, I am a single child of two immigrants now living in Maricopa County. Since I understand the most English, they look to me for help regarding this stuff. A bit of background: My parents combined make &lt;40k/year (even now) but through bring frugal they managed to pay off their first home quite some time ago (&gt;5 years ago). Living on a new property, they started renting that home a few years back (3-4 years ago).  Though I was a minor, I tried to help them with lease agreements, etc since I understood the most English. Obviously in hindsight, it would've been best to look for a lawyer. However, they are the type to handle things under their own purview and due to their own ignorance and my own, we failed to notice that one must register the property as residential/rental. [See here for specific law](http://www.azleg.gov/viewdocument/?docName=http://www.azleg.gov/ars/33/01902.htm).  I found out about the law this morning and informed my parents who are willing to comply with the law. Now my parents are looking at some hefty fines (at least, for their income level) of $1000 + $100/mo of not having the house registered while renting. They plan to cease renting soon (current tenants are not under lease, so I believe it's at-will?) and we all want to make sure we're not missing anything that could bite us later.  Regarding registering the property w/ the County Assessor's office, their current plan is to come forward to the office and pay the fine in full, then register the house as a rental residential. Then proceed to ask tenants to leave (with a month's notice at least) before registering back to residential (which will remain empty and not rented). My parents want to avoid hiring a lawyer since they believe it will just tack on a lot of additional $$$, but I can see where using one can be worth it to avoid a lot of hassle.  [Link to County Assessor's Rental Registration FAQ Page](https://mcassessor.maricopa.gov/faq/faq-rental-registration.php)  Is the problem best handled with my parent's current plan, or should they look for a lawyer? What types of lawyer would be best for the job (looking for specific titles to google)? What sort of advice/services should we seek and the ballpark fees for such help?  Separately would the fact on how the house was improperly registered impact my parent's past taxes (well, the taxes of the breadwinner of my parents)? Should we also be looking into a tax-related lawyer?	No
So there is a company that called my work and asked for the maintenance guy's name. Then they sent us a huge $1,000 order of light bulbs and claimed that our maintenance guy ordered them.  We contacted the company and told them that we didn't order them and they needed to arrange to have them picked up or shipped back.  They were extremely rude, literally screaming that we ordered them and we had to pay for them. We of course refuse and tell them to stop contacting us.  A few months go by and then they send us a new invoice for only the freight to ship them back, $200. Again I contact them and tell them that we are not paying and they can have the product picked up or arrange to have it shipped back at their cost.  They refused and now I've received a letter from a collections agency for the $200.  They are complete scumbags, I looked them up on the Better Business Bureau and there are ~20 complaints about them running this exact same scam on other businesses.  I was content to ignore their requests for payment but now I don't want us to suffer any consequences for this being sent to collections.  What should I do?	No
I'm in Indiana. I was in the car with him (he's 18 I'm 20) and I'm 90% sure it was yellow. There was a guy in the other intersection that turned on red into our lane and i think the officer saw that and thought we ran a red light. However he still gave my brother a ticket for $300. Also it was his first time being pulled over. About a week later another officer gave him a ticket for not having his seatbelt on even though he had it on. The officer sped though almost 1/2 the town during construction to catch up to him and give him a $25 ticket. Would it be worth fighting the tickets in court or should he just pay the $325 worth of tickets and move on?  Also, how would he go about fighting it in court? Do we need a lawyer for that?	No
After a routine cleaning with a dentist they informed me that I need five fillings in my mouth. I come in a week or so later and get the fillings done.  PRIOR to the fillings I felt absolutely no discomfort or pain in my mouth. AFTER the fillings my mouth is in constant extreme pain and several Advils a day barely mitigate the pain.  I believe this dentist did something to mess up my mouth and I was wondering if there is anything I can do in the form of legal action against her. This is the state of Illinois.	No
