My aunt and her long-term boyfriend (father of her kids) received food stamps or EBT from August-January (the food stamp people also claim they gave them money for February but aunt says nothing showed up on the card) she would get about $150 a month until the food stamp use was discontinued. Her boyfriend failed to report the overtime her made in his job and now they had a letter sent to their home asking him to sign a letter and authorize for them to ask his work place for his pay stubs. Is there a possibility that they go to prison or will they just have to pay the money back? Its urgent. Thank you!	Yes
Thanks in advance. I am posting for my girlfriend who recently got put into this position. She has a chronic pain issue that makes her unable to work a few days a month. She applied for FMLA with her employer but was 30 days too early so she was ineligible by the date, otherwise she would have qualified and been approved.  Her employer's reaction to learning this was to force her to move positions and take a roughly 12% pay cut as well. It seems as if this was a direct reaction to learning that she would be able to protect her position and pay rate in 30 days when she will be eligible. Anything that can be done?	Yes
Hey so I was planning on buying my cousin's 2013 Honda Fit, KBB value around $7000 for getting to work and college. Me and my mom live in NJ and she receives SSI, food stamps, Medicare, and we're living on public property. So I've seen mixed messages online that if I buy the car the value might be treated as an asset and can reduce our benefits. These programs have a asset limit, but I've seen some stuff saying that cars don't count towards these assets. I don't want my mom to lose healthcare or any income benefits as she's disabled and money's tight. The only reason I could afford this Fit is my cousin letting me pay the money over time. Any help would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
Hello,  I got denied my unemployment because I did not go in person and register for unemployment. I was unaware that I needed to do this step. However, I have followed everything else pretty much down to the letter. How can I file for protest and win?	Yes
TLDR is, degree, terrible job, want to change my life in any way I can. It's incredibly depressing, and I want to know what are my options. I heard conflicting things:  * it's easy/hard to get tuition paid on unemployment  * you have to be a minority they recognize  * you actually have to be on unemployment for &gt;24wks before they even consider helping you, which seems incredibly counter-productive  * even if you get it, you're not getting essentials covered by UI, just tuition  Help me /r/legaladvice you're my only hope. As I'm too broke to do much else. Thanks for reading	Yes
My father claims they'll never pursue collection, and it'll only present an issue if I try to collect social security in another way. I'm worried that this is untrue.  They applied the overpayment note to my case in February of 2016. I was cut off in October. Nothing has happened as of yet, but I've found papers saying my mom, who was my representative payee, has been paying a little over $700 a month. My question is, does this mean it's on her to pay the debt since she was my payee? Or is it a coincidence? If it's just a coincidence that she's the one paying it, if she stops, will they come after me?	Yes
Someone I know has worked under the table untaxed for over a decade. Is it possible to sign up for government healthcare without drawing attention from the IRS? Could she potentially say she just started working?	Yes
We are located in Alberta, Canada.   Over the course of the past year, my mother has suffered a debilitating illness that has kept her from working.  There have been complications throughout that have significantly impeded recovery. With the prolonged recovery, the insurance company has become increasingly difficult (stopping payments, demanding more paperwork after requested paperwork was supplied, etc).   My mom really does want to go back to work, but she, her doctor, and her employer do not feel that she can fulfill her duties at this time. The job is very hands on and requires snap decisions. Her employer supplied a list of duties that are required and her doctor stated that she could not fulfill them.    We are at the point where a decision needs to be made. If we go through with the lawyers, they will ask for everything up to 65 (retirement age, which she is not too far from). However, that likely means the end of her employment. If we keep fighting with the insurance, we donâ€™t know how long recovery will take and they are constantly looking for ways to stop coverage.   Dealing with insurance and disability is not something we are familiar with, so any thoughts or warnings on which way to go would be helpful.  Thank you.	Yes
