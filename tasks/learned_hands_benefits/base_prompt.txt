Does the post discuss public benefits and social services that people can get from the government, like for food, disability, old age, housing, medical help, unemployment, child care, or other social needs?

Post: (suicide tw throughout this post) Background: I have struggled with depression/bipolar for a number of years, and just over a year ago it caused me to be unemployed for 3 months as I was doing outpatient and recovering.  Found a new job that I love in many ways and really care about, but it didn't stop the number of suicide attempts.  I had to take multiple leaves of absences and numerous sick days for my mental well-being.  At the same time I have struggled with mismanagement at my job.  One situation was due to higher ups not respecting my confidentiality and they dragged me through the mud, forcing me to get union involvement.  Coworkers have also been getting away with a lot of things to the detriment of my health.  I've been yelled at, I've been subjected to repeated oppressive statements, I've dealt with a coworker assuming more authority than they're given and giving everyone and attitude.  They also sexually harassed another coworker.  One person is plainly abusive and toxic, another dangerously incompetent. Despite my efforts to bring this to HR and to my bosses nothing has happened.  The main person in question triggered one suicide attempt.  I had gone to HR a couple months ago and when they once again yelled at me in front of everyone and gave me attitude I once again brought it to management.  I was told nothing was going to happen.  I ended up asking management to at least have remediation.  They got weird about it because I ended up calling out sick because a number of factors, including work, had triggered a mixed state episode.  The exchange wasn't great but the most I really said was "I'll talk to you when I get back" and unprofessionally disclosing over text that the person was continuing to sexually harass the other coworker.  I almost died that night due to suicide. 7th time since early 2016.  I felt so hopeless and that nothing would improve. Because of this incident I ended up having to move further away to be taken care of by friends.  This interferes with my schedule on Sundays because the bus nearby doesn't run and I can't get there until an hour later than my schedule.   Long story short, manager flipped his attitude 180 after talking to his boss (who doesn't like me) and won't budge on my schedule and was *rude* about it.  They have made these accommodations before for people and I very much believe that I'm facing my employer trying to edge me out because I don't keep quiet about BS that happens there.   This BS severely impacts me because I do care about this job and I can't handle the lack of care or the things they put everyone through.  Amazingly the news about my schedule didn't induce suicidal thinking again because I actually was already planning to kill myself but then got righteously angry about this situation and looked forward to quitting.   But anyways here's the problem:  I go back to work on Tuesday, I am losing my medicaid health insurance at the end of the month, and I only have this week to apply for employer provided health insurance. I have to wait until Monday to contact Union person and I have an HR person on my back asking to schedule a time to sign up for the insurance.  I also cannot have a lapse in insurance or I might die (no exaggeration).  If I quit as soon as possible I can probably keep it without coverage lapsing. It seems off to sign up for this insurance if I'm about to quit, but if I want to go on disability (which would take years apparently) I need my doctor or nurse practitioner to state that I am unable to work, which will take time.  I also am unsure if me saying "I'm too sick to work" contradicts "The way you run this place is inhospitable for me".  The latter implies that I can work elsewhere when I really can't, but the former makes it sound like it's my own problem that I'm too sensitive to work there.   What steps outside of contacting Union person asap is there? Do I put in my two weeks asap? Can I get unemployment if I quit before a doctor orders me to stop work? Do I apply for that insurance?  Can I delay ending my OHP with minimal trouble (I don't have the capacity to fight so many things at once). Do I bow out peacefully or do I point my finger at them?

Post: My husband and his then wife (now ex-wife) bought a home together in 2006.  They needed 2 mortgages, one of which has a variable interest rate, to buy the home.  She cheated on him, they divorced and tried to sell the house but she was too greedy with the offers that were coming in and it never sold.  My husband ended up walking away from the house in 2012 since there wasn’t any equity built up because of their crappy mortgage interest rates and per the terms of their divorce agreement, she was entitled to the first 10K of proceeds if and when they sold the house.  Their divorce was messy and they both shot their credit to hell with late or missed payments on these two mortgages.  He later met &amp; married me, I have great credit, a good paying job and we’ve been getting by with just me as the borrower for our mortgage and vehicle loans.  The ex-wife is living in the house they purchased and either hasn’t been making payments on the 2nd mortgage or is very behind on payments – we can’t tell which.  My husband got a debt verification notice from the mortgage company’s attorneys.  How should he respond?  Should he ask for more info?  Should he claim it’s not his debt because she assumed full responsibility for payments since 2012 (I know he's still technically responsible since he signed the paperwork...) Should he ignore it? We’ve tried to reach out to her but she's not responding.   My gut says to ignore the letter and let the chips fall as they may.  His credit is already ruined, his borrowing needs are being met with my credit and he’s self-employed so wage garnishment isn’t an imminent issue (I recognize that bank account levying is a possibility and we have a plan for that). She, on the other hand, has everything to lose including her home and wages since she’s not self-employed.  What should he do?  Located in VT.  TIA

Post: I have over 70hours at work. I work in a restaurant in florida. The owner hasnt paid multiple employees and has also had 2 illegals work for him recently before they got "married" to citizens. I am not sure where to go from here. I have a previous paystub and also have the other employees that are frustrated. I quit last night after he refused to pay and he got very confrontational. I called the police and made a little report but they said they cant help me and its a legal matter. Im frustrated and now jobless but thankful i dont have to work for such a low life. How should i approach this matter? I feel like going into the establishment tomorrow and recording conversations between the other employees who havent been paid aswell as me amd getting a lawyer. Good idea?

Post: Today I was pulled over.  When the vehicle came to a stop I cracked the window to about 1/2in, enough to hear the officer's commands and hand over my identification.  The officer approached my driver's window and stood there.  Said nothing, then opened my driver's door.  I was flabbergasted, I asked him what right he had to open my door.  He replied, "You didn't put the window down."   As I see it, if I had something illegal in the door of my car, he would not have known about it until he opened the door.  Which seems to me like an illegal search.  Could someone weigh in on this?
