## Task description

This is a binary classification task in which the model must determine if a contractual clause falls under the category of "Exclusivity".

## Task construction

This task was constructed from the [CUAD dataset](https://www.atticusprojectai.org/cuad), which annotated clauses in 500 contracts according to 41 types. Positive samples for this task correspond to clauses for which annotators answered the following question in the affirmative:

```text

```

Negative samples are randomly selected from other clauses.
