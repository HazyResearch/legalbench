Hello, I'm an out-of-state student attending a UC campus. My father makes upwards of 500k annually as an entrepreneur and lobbyist, while I work a minimum wage retail job over summers. Naturally, I did not qualify for any need-based aid, so we had to take out a Parent Direct PLUS loan each year to cover the majority of expenses. I was under the impression that, since my father makes so much money, that he'd pay off all these loans, even moreso because the loans are entirely in his name and the FAFSA website says that the debt of these loans cannot be traditionally transferred to the child.  I just recently learned that he has been telling everyone, except me, that he was only going to provide 15k annually while I would pay off the loans myself. All my family believe his side of the story because that is all they were told. Is it possible that he could sue to somehow transfer the debt? Does him telling everyone that I'm paying for it help such a case? In general, what should I do here?	Yes
Hello everyone! Recently, i have decided to take a trip to India to visit my friend and of course, i need a visa. That friend of mine sent me a link on phone but i got to the wrong site by mistake when i used my laptop; it is called etavisaonline.in Later, I had my friend paid the fee, which was €99 and waited for 3 days as it said. After the third day, i received no reply and the application id they gave me turned out to be invalid as i checked it on the site of the gov. I've realised my stupidity and applied on the right web this time, got my visa for nearly half of the price.  Now i'm scared that we have paid a fraudulent source and what frightens me more is the safety of my friend's information as he used a visa debit card. I'm sincerely asking for advice since i dont know what to do now. Pls help. Thank you guys so so much	Yes
There’s a t-shirt company we order from frequently, and back over a year ago they accidentally shipped us 2500 worth of merch in packages with our company name. Products we did not order. We called them to tell them we received some merch in error, and they said they would send someone to pick it up.   Fast forward a few months and long story short, no one ever came to get it, after some fussing back and forth with them about why we weren’t going to be able to drop the merch off at their nearest location (30 mins away), we received an email that said they would send a carrier to get it, and that the carrier would provide their own labels so there was no need to print one off. Stuck them on the porch, came home the next day, they were gone. (We never have problems with things being stolen at that location).   Now six months later, they are saying they never received them back. The carrier never left any kind of notice of pick up on the porch of any kind of info, but they don’t usually do that’s anyways.  They are asking for the tracking info, but we were never provided that. They are saying if we can’t provide it or proof of delivery, then we will be charged for the products.   Remember, we didn’t order these. They were shipped to the wrong place, with our name on the boxes. We were never given any tracking info. I told her that whoever initiated the pick up should have the tracking information, but she said it didn’t work like that. It’s all just a bunch of bullshit, I really want to just say f it.    Is there any kind of legal precedence for saying businesses cant just send you shit and say you owe for it unless you can prove you sent it back?	Yes
Dear r/legaladvice,  I recently was driving long distance when my tire blew out on the highway.  I put in the spare and drove to the nearest rural town but everything was closed since I got there on a Sunday.  I stayed overnight and in the morning went to one of the local tire shops.  They said my tires were old and all needed to be replaced (which turned out to be true), but that they only had two tires that were the right size.  So I got the two front tires replaced on my car and drove to the next nearest town to another tire shop that replaced the other two.  After my long long road trip I finally made it to my destination.  The next day one of the new front tires was flat.  I had to put the spare on again and drive it to Pepboys, and the folks there said the two front tires were the wrong size and poorly installed, and that the damage to the flat one was irreparable since it was probably poorly installed.  So basically I had to replace two brand new tires to get the correct size.  I will never go back to the rural town hundreds of miles away so I can't return the poorly sized and improperly installed tires, so I left them at Pepboys.  Anyway this has all been extremely frustrating and costly and I am totally unsure what to do.  Should I call the rural tire shop that screwed up and yell at them and demand a refund, even though I have no way of returning the tires they put on car?  Should I call my credit card company and dispute the charge from them?	Yes
"So it's a little more complicated that I felt I could put in the title. I'm posting on behalf of my mom who doesn't use Reddit. So she (stupidly) bought a used car all cash from a shady internet ad without consulting anyone. She's newly divorced and was very much a kept woman who was ZERO real world experience, so she meets the guys and arranges to buy the car. She pulls out all the cash and hands it over without receiving any paperwork! She drove away happy as a clam with only the key in her hands, and insured it that day no issues. She has some papers about the car ( I will have to ask and see what specifically ) but no title and the bill of sale is not signed properly. To add another headache the car is apparently a salvage.... one of the papers she does have is a receipt (with pictures) from when he bought it at an auction practically totaled, then fixed himself. She hid this from us in shame when she quickly realized she couldn't register it in the state we live (Nevada) and get plates as she bought it in California and it has California plates that are not in the system. I had a police officer run them and he says they do not exist in his system. It's been months and he has ceased contact, his phone is disconnected, and the ""business"" he worked at is the only address we have which returned our letter. So she bought this thing almost a year ago and only told us about it maybe three months ago while stashing it in a storage unit so we wouldn't scold her. We asked her wtf she was thinking and she admitted she didn't know cars had paperwork... What the hell steps do I take here? After trying to sort this out with him over these months the only thing he sent me was an incomplete title request that the dmv marked as invalid and.. duh.. incomplete. Our last phone call he said that was enough paperwork for us to sort it out and after that is radio silence. Is she out all that money? Please help.."	Yes
they removed the ltc i deposited frm deposit history and now it shows me negative balance. i can't withdraw the coins i bought using that ltc. i am from india and i dont know the location of the exchange.	Yes
"I should add that this isn't me, but there is debate about it in another subreddit.      Basically Nate and Smitty employees at a large company (company x) won a tournament in their company - sponsored by another company (company b). They got to play in the poker main event ($10,000 buy-in). The only contract that was between the two companies seems to be an e-mail which basically says, ""50 percent of the winnings go to company b, and 'they' get to keep the other 50 percent."" Apparently in the e-mail the 'they' is referred to as the people playing in the tournament for the duration of the e-mail.      The person playing the poker believes the 50 percent 'they' get to keep is his to personally keep, meanwhile company a believes they get to split the winnings amongst the company. Can anyone give any insight? Thanks!"	Yes
"We had a nasty hail storm come through in May 2016, I made a claim for a full roof replacement and non-roof related repairs such as deck, broken window, fencing, etc.  I went through the claim and broke out the roof-related repairs costs line-by-line to come up with the total cost for the job, since the roofing company would NOT be performing any non-roof related repairs. This is what we agreed on for the cost, and what is reflected in the proposal from the roofer, not including supplements. I even sent them a copy of the claim so they could see for themselves. So, Cost – $500 deductible credit + supplements.  Nearly 6 months later, the roofing company tells me the amount they've successfully negotiated for the supplements, and I receive an additional check from the insurance company to cover them.  The roofing company invoiced me for remaining balance, exactly what was in the proposal, base negotiated cost + supplements (which we now had a figure for). I paid it promptly and in full.  I must have been wrong in thinking that the transaction was over, because the roofing company came back AGAIN and says that ""After auditing the final amount we saw that contractor O&amp;P was not included in the first final invoice we sent. For that I do apologize on that."" and ""as soon as it was discovered we made sure to send it out. This has never happened on any of my jobs and again I do apologize for this oversight.""  First of all, it seems wrong to me that they can come back AFTER the invoice has been paid and ask for more money. If I buy a donut and walk out, you can't chase me down the street and say you messed up and undercharged me. However, I'm not trying to wriggle through get anything for free.  Secondly, the proposal mentions nothing of an additional cost TBD later in addition to base cost + supplements. I called my adjuster and he said that the supplements (that had already been paid) included overhead &amp; profit, and in fact makes up the bulk of the supplement amount.  Thirdly, the insurance company is failing to show me the math of HOW they arrived at this NEW total, and instead is only threatening to put a lien on my house. They say that I MUST give them ALL money that I've received from the insurance company or else they will be in violation of the law for helping me benefit from a claim. Surely they understand that they are not entitled to any money for repairs they did not make, but the bigger question is even IF I received more money for the roof than what we had agreed upon, why would they be entitled to that money? We agreed on a price, and that's what I've paid. If there IS extra money, shouldn't it go back to the insurance company if anything?  I'm trying to get my adjuster to answer one simple question: of the money I've received, how much of it is for roof-related repairs? My policy covers depreciation for the dwelling, but not the detached garage, so looking at these numbers for Replacement Cost, Actual Cash Value, Depreciation.. it's all a bit overwhelming and confusing. It's been difficult getting a straight answer from my adjuster since he's still slammed and is hard to get ahold of. After looking at the claim again, I/we used the Actual Cash Value of the roof-related items to come up with the original cost, now that I have more understanding of how this works, should we have used the Replacement Cost? If so, the cost WOULD be higher, but as I mentioned, I sent them the claim, they looked it over, and we agreed on the price.  This is the first time I've made a claim of this nature and this process has been different than any auto claim I've made. Is there Colorado law that states I must hand over any money I receive regardless of what was agreed upon? If so, why even bother with a proposal? Or are they trying to take advantage of me?  I can supply any real figures if that helps. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks."	Yes
Hi I live in GA and recently bought a car from a private seller. He hid the fact that the engine was bad by bumping up the RPMs. Is there anything i can do to get my money back or have him pay for the car? 	Yes
"I signed up for a subscription service where you get online courses for a fix monthly price. On the sales page, the website owner states that subscribers will only be charged X, and that he is ""not able to charge more, and will only charge X""  It turned out that the price of the monthly subscription is X + VAT, and he only mentioned the monthly price without the VAT included, which is upsetting because this is in a country with the highest VAT rate in the world.  Now, on the checkout the price with VAT included was shown, but I didn't give it any thought because the seller said he will only charge X, and is not able to charge any more than X. X=price of subscription without VAT  Does this count as misleading people? Do I have a chance to make a chargeback through my bank? Purchased it on june 15th."	Yes
"I bought a gun online via an auction. The auction's title, picture and description were for the ""middle model"" of this particular gun style. I was shipped the baseline model, and accepted it at my gun store (called an FFL, you must go to one of these to pick up a gun). This store charges $30 to do all the paperwork so that I could receive the gun (such as a background check). This is great, and completely fair.   When I got home i noticed the gun was not the advertised model. There are very minor differences on the outside of the gun, you would have to break in down and look at the internals to notice the differences. It was like I ordered a V8 mistang, but was shipped a V6, and I had to pay $30 to drive it off the lot.   The shipping store is willing to pay for the gun to be returned, but is not paying the $30 transfer fee I paid to my local gun store. I asked they do pay for it, because it was their mistake they listed the wrong item. The owner confirmed it was their fault that the advertisement was wrong.   Im considering canceling the charge, and telling them to come pick up the gun whenever they want (it is a 2 hour drive for them). Unless they decide to pay back that $30 in addition to the price of the gun.  Basically, I lost money because of their mistake. And they expect me to go out of my way to ship a gun back to them, which I have not done and is probably a little tough to do.   They have also tied up ~$450 of my money due to this. Should I just cancel the charge because I didnt get what I ordered, and make them come get it?"	Yes
I was coming home from a local bar about a mile from my house at around midnight, I got to my place but realized I had forgot my key and the door was locked. I decided to climb up to the roof of my house and in order to go down a ladder that was on the back side of my house, because the sliding door on the back porch is always unlocked. This was in San Francisco, where all the houses are connected to each other basically, which is why I had to climb over the house instead of just going around to the back. Someone apparently thought I was a burglar and called the police. A bunch of cop cars show up while I'm on top of the roof, so I decide to climb back down and talk to them. As soon as I got down from the roof I was tackled to the sidewalk by one of the cops and held down and cuffed. Being tackled onto the sidewalk scraped my forehead and it was bleeding a little.(tiny amount, not dripping blood, more like a scrape than a cut) They called an ambulance because of this. After explaining everything to the police and showing proof that it was indeed my address, they uncuffed me and apologized and told me to remember my keys next time. By this point the ambulance had arrived, and the EMTs insisted that I needed to be taken to the hospital. I told them I was perfectly fine and had a small scrape on my head that could be taken care of with some neosporin and a bandaid. I insisted that I was fine and that all I wanted to do was go into my house that was 20 feet away and that I was refusing an ambulance ride to the hospital. They told me they were legally required to take me and I was basically physically strapped to a gurney and put in the ambulance. The hospital was less than 5 minutes away, and as soon as I saw a doctor they told me I was perfectly fine and could go home, and didn't even charge me anything. I ended up getting a $3000 ambulance bill. The ambulance company is privately owned, and googling it shows tons of people with similar stories about being forced into taking ambulance rides against their will and then charged ridiculous amounts. Is there anything I can do to dispute this bill? How can I be forced into an ambulance for a minor scratch?	Yes
Situation: My mother and I hired a self-employed mechanic to replace the motor of my car '03 Impala back in May of this year ('17). He constantly delayed finishing the repair and then told us just last week that it was completed and we could come get it. When we arrived at the house we could  see visible damage to the front two fenders (dents in the middle over the tires). I also noticed that the driver side window no longer had window tint. I looked inside the cab of the vehicle to see that the radio plate ($299) was missing. I went to the other side of the car to see that the passenger side door appeared to be tampered with on the top of the frame. Then I checked the back seat and opened up the trunk (the car battery is dead) and see that the subwoofers and amplifier are both missing as well. We asked the mechanics son about it as he (the mechanic) is on his way home. Apparently the car was broken into before it got it the mechanics custody and they replaced the driver side window. They never notified us of it or let us know they filed a police report. We're waiting for updates on the issue from the mechanic but I'm wanting to know if there's anything we can do other than do a claim with our renters insurance.   Thanks for your time!	Yes
"Hi all,  I'll try to keep this simple. My health plan(New York Medicaid) covers 20 visits of Physical therapy a year. I might or might not have gone over 20 visits when I started going to my current Physical Therapy Office. I went to PT for 3 visits and got billed $50 for each of the visits. Now in this point of my life, $150 is a boatload of money and can't afford to pay it off. Apparently my plan can't help me out as I went over the 20 plan limit and the PT office didn't confirm whether I was at my limit or not as well.  So I'm basically stuck with this bill and it will possibly be sent to collections. Now I have a ""plan"" perhaps on getting this resolved which may be a bit un-kosher. You see this same office billed my insurance company (NY Medicaid), for an EMG of the Neck and Lower Back and they were paid $3.5k for each part.  However when I asked the office for the report they tell me they only did and have a report for the EMG of the Neck not the lower back even though they billed my insurance for it and got paid $3.5k.  So I want to try to ask them to waive my physical therapy balance of $150, so that I look the other way and don't report them for billing fraud to my medicaid health plan. I'm not sure this will work but I am all out of options, and would like any and all advice."	Yes
Bottom Line:  I bought a used diesel truck from a Volkswagen dealer, and my local mechanic told me that it is fully deleted (catalytic converter, diesel particulate filter, and EGR have all been removed/bypassed).   When I was originally talking to this dealership I made it clear that I need a diesel truck to tow my 5th wheel, but it needs to pass a smog test. I asked the salesman if the truck had stock exhaust, and he said yes. At the time, I hardly knew anything about emissions or tuning modifications so I believed what the dealer told me. I settled on a Ram 3500, and drove it home.  Now, I find out the truck can't pass emissions. The state in which I am registering the truck does not have smog tests, so there won't be an issue getting the vehicle registered. However, I think it is a federal offense to not have a DPF or Catayltic Converter on the truck. Getting a misdemeanor or a felony charge, if I were to get pulled over, could jeapordize my career.  The parts alone are going to cost me over $4k to get the truck within EPA guidelines.  Basically I have two questions:  1. What can I do about the dealer? They told me it was OEM exhaust, but it's not. Now I'm expected to pay several thousand dollars for something that shouldn't have been an issue if the dealer told me the truth (I wouldn't have purchased this truck)  2. When I look up federal EPA guidelines, it talks about being a federal offense to modify or tamper with a vehicle's emission system. I did not tamper or modify them, it came this way from the dealer. Am I still liable in this scenario?	Yes
-In buying a duplex, original agreement was to have tenant on one side out by June 16th. It was a month to month agreement so it was possible.  -Seller asked for extension to July 31st, granted by buyer. Meanwhile, buyer has been paying for appraisal, attorney, etc.  -If July 31st rolls around and they don't have that tenant out, buyer may want to walk, however, the closing costs remain. Can the buyer sue for those costs paid up to that point because seller is not able to comply with contract?	Yes
We are a business in Idaho and had a customer from Utah call to purchase a $2,000 computer system from us. We had to have the item shipped next day air via UPS to them and they made a payment via Visa credit card over the phone.   About 2 months later we received a call from a lady asking us why we  charged her card for $2,200 and we explained the situation. Today, about 2 weeks after the phone call from the lady, we noticed that Visa had pulled back the funds and when we called they explained that it was because the purchase was fraudulent.  Are we really on the hook, because either Visa, or that lady's secitlrity was bad? What do we do in this situation?	Yes
"Background: Was doing an annual EOY budget review when I checked my chase ""emergency fund account"" and saw way less money than expected. Approx. 40 ACH transactions over 7 months time frame(Yes, I know). I call Chase and explain situation. They advise the fraud area is closed and call when they open and to close account at Branch. I do so.  The next day when I speak with Paypal, they confirm that it looks like a scammer / ID thief used my bank info to link to his Paypal account. They explain they don't have a way to send me the funds directly and that the bank just needs to do a ACH reversal and I will get funds back.  Chase stands behind the 60 day Reg E ruling that they say the customer is liable for any unauthorized funds after 60 days. However, they never contacted Paypal, nor will they listen to the situation. Look, I get that I am fortunate enough to have a emergency fund and that I haphazardly didn't review the account for 'a while' but shit I don't go and count my piggy bank every month either, I never use this account it is only a storage of funds. I wouldn't think that someone (with a completely odd name) can willy nillly start a bunch of ACH transactions to Chinese websites out of an quiet account without someone noticing at Chase.   TLDR- Had lots of money missing from Paypal ACH transactions. Bank don't care, and Paypal says they can't do shit."	Yes
In May, I hired a moving company (Company A, located in FL) to move me from WI to NJ. Our contract stated that they would move me on the 19th or the 20th of May. I (stupidly) paid $520.00 as a partial payment.   On May 19th, I get a call from someone identifying himself as a dispatcher, saying they will be picking up my stuff on the 20th in the afternoon and will call me before they come. The 20th comes and goes with no call until 10:30pm at night saying they will be there in the morning of the 21st. At that point, I had already scrambled and hired other movers because 1) they never showed up and 2) I could only pay by cash or money order which was super sketchy to me.   I called Company A and told them what happened and that I wanted my $520 back. They told me they would call me back. Unsurprisingly, they never returned by call, my multiple messages, or my emails and even stoped answering my calls.    I disputed the charge with BOA a few days after the 20th of May. I was notified today that they are closing the claim and not returning my money. They said that Company A did not break our contract because they subcontracted the move to Company B, and it is Company B that did not pick up my stuff at the date range specified in the contract.    I feel like it's not a large enough amount of money to hire a lawyer, but it's not an insignificant amount and I'd like to get my money back from this shady moving company. I'm angry that Company A did not tell me they were subcontracting and that they refused to return any of my multiple communications. They've also never provided any contact information or even a name for Company B.    In terms of next steps, I'm planning on writing a letter to the claims department to get them to return the $520. Is there anything else I should do to get my money returned?	Yes
Hail damage earlier this year to my home and numerous others in my neighborhood. Company was doing estimate on my neighbor so wife and I let him inspect ours. I, unfortunately, signed a contract with him that says if the insurance company approves the claim, I am to hand the check to this roofer and they will do the work. No money out of my pocket.   Problem 1 - I signed the contract but the insurance check is in my wifes name and the house is in both of our names.   Problem 2 - contract is so vague with zero pricing. Everything is TBD with no description of the roofing system other than asphalt 3-tab shingles TBD and GAF.  Problem 3 - My deductible was nearly $7,000 which left me with only $5000 to do a $10,000 roof replacement - minus provided funds to fix some gutters, vents, and facia boards.   Problem 4 - When I did try to reach this guy for additional information, he is very elusive and provides very little information other than threatening me with a lawsuit if I cancel this contract and is trying to extort a cancellation fee of $1,000 or if he goes to his lawyer, he's going to sue me for 25% of the total cost my insurance company paid me for replacement. Ugh. And I've not done any work to the roof because I am poor with over $1M, yes, $1 MILLION DOLARS in medical debt. I requested quotes from 5 other vendors doing roofs in my neighborhood and this guy was last in price, professionalism, and just overall ability to make me feel like this $10,00 investment would be a sound installation I could live with.  I can go on and on about this guys professionalism and lack of customer experience but I'll be damned if I'm letting this company put a roof on my house at this point. It's only asking for trouble as I've had a previous home with roof issues after a replacement.   Anything I can do?	Yes
How do I get proper legal advice on this? do I approach a tax attorney or an accountant? I used TurboTax to file taxes for the past two years.  Is getting proper legal advice going to be more expensive (or close) to paying this debt directly?  If I can get advice on this directly that would be great, but I am almost more afraid and need advice on getting the proper legal advice itself.	Yes
"Throwaway here.  About five months ago, we moved into a house that has five bedrooms with one bigger master bedroom/bath, and four other roughly equally sized rooms. Five people moved into this house initially, with myself and my SO living in the master bedroom.   After we signed the lease (with only four of us on it, myself, SO, and two others) we tried to come to an agreement on who would pay what on how the rent was divided, all done through a group message. Because the top two incomes on the lease weren't enough, we needed a cosigner on the lease, which my family member stepped in to be. What we eventually decided on, was that SO and I would pay 460 for the master, and each upstairs bedroom would be 410. I would also subsidize the cost of the upstairs bedroom that was going unoccupied by paying an additional 410 a month, with the explicitly defined understanding that if we ever filled that fifth bedroom with a sixth person, that person would be paying the 410 instead and no one that is staying in an upstairs bedroom for 410 has their rent changed at all.  Everyone in the group message, in writing, agreed to this. I have screenshots.   Now we've picked up a sixth roommate, and the roommates have begun talking about renegotiating the spread of the rent. I brought up the screenshotted conversation and agreement we made months earlier that everyone agreed to, and two of the roommates said that this was now ""unfair"" and we should renegotiate. The other roommate flat out rejected all of our negotiations for various reasons, and ultimately said if we couldn't come to an agreeable resolution, he would be moving out at the end of the month. In writing, I asked if he was going to move his stuff out, stop residing at the residence, and stop paying rent, even though his name was the one on the lease, and he said yes, so now I have written confirmation.  The other roommates are also unhappy with the fact that we want to stick with the original agreement we all agreed to, but they have not threatened to move out.  If he does end up moving out, I'm afraid the cosigner and I will be held responsible for paying for this guy's rent while he gets off scot free to live wherever else he chooses. If we don't pay it, then we get evicted within 3 days of the rent being due.   Currently looking, but there so far don't seem to be any prospects that are taking over his room.  What options do I have? Am I shit out of luck? If he moves out, violating the terms of the lease, can I pay his portion for the rest of the lease and go after him for it in small claims? I legitimately don't know, and it doesn't look like a compromise will be reached any time soon. Any help would be appreciated."	Yes
"Reposting for clarity.  Nearly three years ago, we had two garage door openers installed by Bill. Over the next year or so, Bill came several times to work on not only the new openers, but also on an opener that he had installed for the previous owner of the property. The work on the two new openers was covered under warranty.   Over the last year, all three openers stopped working. Due to Bill's deteriorating health, we opted not to call him and instead to just open the doors manually.   Bill died this spring and his widow sold the company and the customer list to two guys with no previous experience- just general handyman experience. The new owners called my husband to introduce themselves, and my husband told them that they could come give us an estimate on fixing the three openers, and also to see if they were under any type of warranty.   The first day, one of the partners was met at our property with someone who seemed to know what he was doing. They spent time looking at the openers, but didn't actually do any work.   A couple of months later, the partner came out. He told me several times that he had no experience with openers and was learning as he went along. He spent a couple of hours here. He got one opener working, and told me I would have to replace the second new opener. I expressed to him that I had no interest in a new opener and would just open it manually. He ended up ""trying one more thing"" and had it working 15 minutes later. He also worked on the third opener and told me it was in working condition.   Before he left, he told me that they had 5.5 hours of work in. I nodded uncommittally, remembering that my husband had told him that we needed an estimate, and also that the new doors may have been covered under warranty.   Instead of receiving an estimate, they charged us $60 an hour so they could learn how to fix garage doors.   I am planning to call and dispute this ridiculous amount (can I charge him $200 an hour to listen to how horrible his ex wife was?), but wasn't sure what my legal options are. Thanks."	Yes
Hi r/legaladvice,  I was helping my grandparents organize their finances and 1 item that stuck out was that my grandmother has a credit card exclusively in her name with a balance of about $5K. She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.  I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).  Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail? I haven't had an issue like this before and want to do things the right way here.  Thanks!	Yes
We just finished our 5 hour drive to the beach, and our hotel says they never got our booking(through booking.com). We called two weeks ago to make sure that our reservation was in order and we were assured that we had the room that we requested. They owners were adamant that there was no booking, and the only other hotels in the area are more than twice what we were going to pay. Is there any way I can be compensated for the extra expenses?	Yes
Not sure my state matters,  I'm sorry if this is the wrong place but I need advice and feel stupid.   I received my first credit last week.  It's through Capital One. I activated it, set up my account, then used it at the grocery store for $7.  Today I went to pay my electric bill and it was declined.  When I check my online account I see they locked my card due to fraud.   I call Capital One and get directed to their fraud specialist.  Initially she tells me there is no fraud,  the card just isn't activated yet.  She puts me on hold to fix it.  Before this, she verified: My social Phone number Email address Credit card number and crv on the back  When she comes back she informs me she no longer thinks I am who I say am.  She tells me someone else called and asked for a new card to be sent out (somehow verified all the info down to my credit card number??)  So she tells me in order to prove I am who I say I am I need to email them a front and back photo of my drivers license, a front and back photo of my social security card and a photo of a utility bill in my name.   I understand they need to verify me,  but the whole explanation was very sketchy and I'm really nervous to email them all this info.   I could really use some advice please.   Thank you so much.	Yes
Hello,   I graduated High School this past summer, and bought my macbook from the school. The guarantee was that once the laptop was fully paid for, the school technology department would remove unnamed management software. I don't know if it is a keylogger, website monitoring software, or what additional restrictions exist. I know that I can not change my energy settings nor control my security and privacy options.  After I paid the school the full balance, the software was not removed. I emailed the technology department requesting removal and received a preliminary response days later stating the the lead for such matters had previously been on vacation, despite not having turned on any sort of automatic reply indicator.  I am currently overseas, and have limited wifi options. I requested that the technology department give me a timeslot that they needed me to connect to the internet within. I told them that I would make whatever time they gave work.  In response, I was told that they were unable to give me a time slot, but that it just had to be connected for a short period of time. I further emailed and explained that I was unable to just randomly have it on, as my time zone is multiple hours ahead and wifi is very limited in the city where I live, so I needed them to provide a time that worked for them, and I would cooperate with whatever time they set.  Since then, I have not received a single reply despite nearly 3 business days elapsing.  I understand that this issue may seem minor, but I bank off my computer, and am soon going to be hoping to use it for purposes of a more sensitive nature where I am legally unable to have outer management software installed on my device.   Thank you in advance for any information or advice.	Yes
Purchased a car from a dealership about 4 months ago.  Upon driving it home after parking it, it was leaking fluid (Oil and Windshield fluid). I took pictures and asked them about it, they said it was fine and that ''it heats up and causes it to overflow sometimes''  Today I brought the car to a different dealership to get an oil change, they said that its also leaking powersteering fluid is leaking. Also upon parking it home, the electrical system is cutting out. Headleads / foglights / dashboard / radio+speaker system no longer turn on.   Not sure what to do in this case.	Yes
I have purchased digital currency, called Town Points, from a game called 'Town of Salem', owned by BlankMediaGames, and have never received it.   They have never replied to my emails — their only communication.   It's been a long time so I want to take legal action. Now their terms of service are pretty tricky and it basically makes me have no way of winning against them.   Here are their terms:   https://www.blankmediagames.com/terms/   https://www.blankmediagames.com/merch-store-terms-of-use-agreement/   A friend sent me these from their terms:  &gt; A. Negotiations. Disputes can be expensive and time consuming for both parties. In an effort to accelerate resolution and reduce the cost of any dispute or claim related to this Agreement (“Claim”), you and BlankMediaGames agree to first attempt to informally negotiate any Claim for at least thirty (30) days.  They will not reply to the informal negotiations so I will wait until that is over — which is soon, then take legal action.  &gt;YOU HEREBY AGREE TO INDEMNIFY, DEFEND AND HOLD HARMLESS BlankMediaGames FROM AND AGAINST ANY AND ALL CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES AND COSTS (INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES)  &gt;BlankMediaGames RESERVES THE RIGHT TO SUSPEND, TERMINATE, MODIFY OR DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT AT ANY TIME FOR ANY REASON *OR NO REASON*, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE TO YOU, AND WITH NO LIABILITY OF ANY KIND TO YOU.  This means they can just destroy my account freely even after I win a legal battle and finally receive my digital currency. Correct?  &gt;IN NO EVENT SHALL BlankMediaGames BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF ANY AMOUNT YOU HAVE PAID TO BlankMediaGames FOR GAME-RELATED TRANSACTIONS  Does this mean they cannot be liable for more than what I've spent on them in the in-game store?  &gt;NO REFUNDS WILL BE MADE FOR THE PURCHASE OF Town Points  This includes purchasing — but says nothing about receiving.....  &gt;BlankMediaGames SHALL NOT BE LIABLE IN ANY MANNER FOR THE *DESTRUCTION*, *DELETION*, *MODIFICATION*, IMPAIRMENT, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGE OR LOSS OF ANY KIND CAUSED TO THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR *Town Points*  So they can say they added it — but then deleted it and not be liable? They can basically delete my Town Points at their will.  &gt;If there is a dispute regarding payment of fees to BlankMediaGames, your Account may be closed without warning or notice at the sole discretion of BlankMediaGames.  I can't refund nor dispute.  &gt;BlankMediaGames has the right, to delete, alter, move, remove, or transfer any and all Game Assets, in whole or in part, at any time and for any reason, with or without notice to you, and with no liability of any kind to you.   Does assets confine 'Town Points'?  &gt;As BlankMediaGames feels necessary, in its sole and absolute discretion BlankMediaGames may limit the total Town Points that may be held in your Account.  Can they say my limit is 0?  &gt;YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO CLAIM, RIGHT, TITLE, OWNERSHIP OR OTHER PROPRIETARY INTEREST IN THE GAME ASSETS, VIRTUAL ITEMS OR Town Points THAT YOU ACQUIRE, REGARDLESS OF THE CONSIDERATION OFFERED OR PAID IN EXCHANGE FOR Town Points OR VIRTUAL ITEMS.   &gt;You are solely responsible for verifying that the proper amount of Town Points has been added to or deducted from your Account during any given transaction, so please notify BlankMediaGames immediately should you believe that a mistake has been made with respect to your Town Points balance. BlankMediaGames will investigate your claim, and in doing so, may request some additional information and/or documentation to verify your claim. BlankMediaGames will let you know the results of the investigation, however, you acknowledge and agree that BlankMediaGames has sole and absolute discretion in determining whether or not your claim is valid, and if so, the appropriate remedy.  So... they can legally say my claim is invalid, even if valid, because of their sole and absolute discretion.   I must take legal action, but I don't know where to start or what the laws confined in digital goods are. I've emailed them and it's been a while without a reply, and I cannot wait for their 'sole and absolute discretion' to determine anything malicious as a resolution — I want the law. I don't have a lawyer or know of an arbitrator, but I do have $25,000 ready for all the fees that this will bring.   What's my best course of action?	Yes
Hello all,  A little back story, my grandfather purchased a car for me in his name... I made the payments, it was insured in my name ETC.  He died last November, and my mother never had took any of the paperwork down to the bank after he died.. Fast forward to last Wednesday i went and made my payment like normal, except later that evening there was a tow truck outside of my house towing my car...  The tow truck driver said that they had been looking for the car for months etc..   What should i do? I have been told that we are able to sue BB&amp;T because they shouldn't have been taking payment for the car once it was out for repo, I am only looking to be able to finish paying for the car as there is less than 2k owed on the car....   Thanks in advance!	Yes
Hi r/legaladvice,  I have a question regarding the enforcement of a judge's ruling, and provincial jurisdictions in Canadian courts for small claims.  So to give some short background info, I want to file a case in Small Claims Court against an ex-girlfriend who I lent a lump sum of money to for a week. It's been years and she refuses to pay me back, so I want to go the legal route to get my money back from her.  The issue is that I live in Ontario (whereas she now lives in Alberta) and would like to file the case here, in an Ontario court. The incident also happened in Ontario, so the courts here will accept the case. The problem is that if a judge rules in my favour and she must pay me back, they can't enforce the ruling in Alberta where she lives now, because it's out of their jurisdiction.  So the person I spoke to for information in the Ontario Small Claims Court said I should find out if Alberta courts will enforce rulings made by Ontario courts? I did a lot of online research and couldn't find an answer, so would anyone here know if they would?	Yes
Morning!  I know this would be more appropriate under a financial subreddit, but I'm worried there will be some legal implications so I thought to ask here first.  Last night I went to check my credit score for the first time (19, only have a joint student loan w/ my dad and a credit card in my name, which I got 6 months ago) so I went to CreditKarma.  Perfectly fine score, but it appeared there were two loans under my name.  One was a joint student loan from Sallie Mae, which I knew about and receive emails from etc.  The other was a student loan taken out individually before my 18th birthday.  My dad has never used this bank (Cornerstone) and never took out a loan in the amount listed.  After some research, it appears that loans can't be given to minors individually in the US anyway, so I'm not even entirely sure how a bank allowed this to happen.  I also know I never received a check for thousands of dollars I apparently took out.  I know I need to call someone and let them know what's going on.  Who is it exactly that I call?  I assume not CreditKarma- maybe the bank?  Or do I need to find a lawyer and contact the police for some stolen identity case?  Sorry for all the questions, this is my first financial issue as an adult and I want to make sure I handle it properly.  Thank you in advance!	Yes
Backpack and it's contents aren't what I'm worried about. More worried about the check since it was a good amount of money.  Could I contact the company that did the survey to issue me another check or have them stop the check from going through?  Assuming it hasn't been cashed yet.  Would they be able to find out if it got cashed yet?	Yes
"Original engine in my car died. I decided to replace the engine with a rebuild engine from a reputable company out of MD (I'm in KS) with great ratings. I also picked up their additional ""No Fault"" warranty because this engine is prone to troubles. Replacement went fine, but 2k miles into the rebuilt engine blows a rod out the bottom of the engine.  This time the rod does an additional ~6,000 worth of damage to other components. Company is willing to replace engine but says the rest of the damage is not on them. New engine is useless without the additional repairs. So basically I spent 4,700 dollars for a engine replacement plus 500 for the no fault warranty additional coverage, and now I need to spend 6,000 more to repair the damage their engine caused?  Seems illegal to me. Thanks in advance!"	Yes
Hello, I will attempt to condense this to the core of the issue, but I'm seeking advice as this information just came to my attention yesterday.   I live in California, and I purchased a new vehicle in Texas in April.  The dealership  said they would handle registering for me in California, that they had done this before.  Fast forward 2 months, a week before my temp tags were going to expire and I contact them asking what the status was, as my tags were about to expire. This prompted a flurry of emails which quickly became apparent, that they had dropped the ball with my paperwork and only just got started.  They issued me a new set of tags for another two months.*(which I question the legality of the new tags, since they have a purchase date displayed that doesn't match my paperwork, I assume because temp tags can only have a 2 month limit... But I digress, I hope I wont get pulled over by police and need to explain)* They also requested that I get my vehicle VIN inspected, and a smog check completed.  Upon getting those two things done, the VIN inspector told me I would need to get it weighed as well since it was a truck, so I got that done as well, and the dealership then told me that was needed afterall...  Good thing I was told by the VIN guy.  All additional paper work was sent a couple of weeks ago, which I followed up on multiple times.  All was quiet until yesterday when I receive an email from the finance director, who this particular individual I have had zero contact with up to this point.    &gt;We have been notified by our titling agency that the State of California is requiring  &gt;more in taxes to register your vehicle.  The amount that was used was calculated on  &gt;the Base MSRP **as requested**, but California has calculated it using the Sale Price. &gt;If you have any questions regarding this amount feel free to contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx &gt; and I will do my best to assist you.  The above **as requested** line is the one I have an issue with, this sounds like they are trying to cover their butt, and it makes it sound as if I requested that they calculate the sales tax differently than they should have.  I did not make any such request, nor did I even know that they did that until yesterday.  April is a long time ago, and I thought all the financials were squared away.  The amount that I owe all of a sudden is not trivial, it is $1670.24.  That is a large mistake, one that I feel the dealership should take some responsibility for.  Do I have any recourse?  Should I expect the dealership to cover some or all of this?  What would be the proper approach to take in your opinion.  Many thanks.	Yes
Seven year old credit card coming back to haunt me!  Ok, I've never posted here before and doing this on my phone, so bear with me please.  I'm in Ohio, today my brother in Oklahoma called me and said someone had called him about needing to send me some documents.  I called the number they gave him, and it's in regard to this credit card, last activity was 2010.  They say they are attempting to serve me with papers to take me court for 2,705.49 plus 1,500 in attorney fees, or I could set up pymt plan and pay them 1,664.39.  My question is, how do I keep them from calling family members?  (He said it was an outside company)  He also said statute of limitations was 12 years in 2010.  The reason this card defaulted is initially I lost my job, then became ill and am now on disability.  Any advice would be appreciated.	Yes
"Hi all,  I'm not sure if this is the proper subreddit for this, and also- throwaway because I'm paranoid.  I had an appointment with my regular podiatrist back in June. I've been a patient for years and have never missed an appointment. The doctor is very well-respected in our area and is booked out months in advance.   On Thursday, June 8th, I got an email at 4:45 PM stating I had an appointment on Monday, June 12th at 1:45 PM. There was not an option to cancel the appointment from the email, so I called the next day, June 9th to cancel my appointment. The time of my call was 1:52 PM. When I spoke with the woman on the phone, I told her I had to cancel my appointment for Monday. She went ahead and cancelled it.  A couple of weeks ago, I received a bill from the doctors office for $35 for a ""missed appointment fee"". I called the office to remind them that I did in fact call, and I would be happy to being in a copy of my phone records to show I spoke with someone. The lady said because I called at 1:52 and not 1:45, I was outside of the 24-hour business day window so I had to be assessed a fee.   There was absolutely nothing in writing saying that I had to cancel 24 hours in advance, Not only that, but the same woman who I've been speaking with on the phone didn't inform me on Friday (when I called to cancel) that I would have to pay a fee regardless because I was outside of that window. Why would by bill say missed appointment fee instead of late-cancellation fee? The only conclusion I could come up with is that she dropped the ball on her end and now I'm left   The office wont budge and I fear that this will end up in collections. It's a small amount, but it's twice what my copay would have been and I literally live paycheck to paycheck, on the penny. I don't know what else I can do from here. Is there a way to dispute it without going through the office?"	Yes
Hi so my mom has an interview with TD bank Wednesday regarding a $600 fee on her line of credit because it was increased without her knowing. I'm wondering what she should say for them to remove the fee from her account. I believe this happened a while ago and she has just noticed now. She states TD told her line of credit has been increased to $200000 and she has to pay $600 for having this. She said she never made the increase. Any help is obviously appreciated as we gave until Wednesday for clarification as TD isn't helping her worth shit. Hoping I can get something here :) thx	Yes
Hey guys!  I live in Oklahoma, I purchased a car off eBay from a classified ad in New Hampshire. I used PayPal for the deposit $500, and a check for the rest of the $12,000.   The company filed chapter 11, then converted to a chapter 7. I have filed a creditor claim with the NH Bankruptcy court.   Car insurance won't help, not a theft. eBay doesn't protect classified ads. Bank can't help, it isn't considered check fraud. Any advice on getting my money back?	Yes
"On June 20, I sold an item for $350 on the online marketplace Grailed. I shipped the item on June 21 and the buyer in New York state received it on June 23. Now, the buyer has submitted a claim that it was an ""unauthorized transaction"". I have already submitted proof of shipping and delivery. Paypal claim aside, what are the legal grounds for this? If the transaction is indeed verified as unauthorized, am I just losing the item I sold?"	Yes
http://imgur.com/llAQJvp  This is notice they received, completely unaware what to do. Have no idea how to file an answer, they have no money for an attorney. Any advice would be greatly needed.  Story: Mom co-signed for brother on a big purchase. Brother claims it was paid, company seems to have sold the debt to a collection agency. My parents are resigned to do nothing, and be sad about this. I tried browsing the wiki and was unsure, so I made this post anyways.	Yes
Hi,  My wife signed us up for Gerber Life Insurance a while back. We tried to cancel it because Life insurance for a one-year-old isn't a necessary expense.  But, Gerber Life insurance has saw fit to have their login server conveniently down(has been for a while), they tried to get her to stay by mentioning a bunch of dead children, and won't let her cancel the insurance unless we fill out a long form listing our complaints about the insurance and a set of signatures that are hers.  I'm starting to get more and more suspicious that Gerber is inefficient on purpose. Provided that I can prove it, is it legal for them to impede customers from canceling in this way?	Yes
"I ordered a product online about three weeks ago, with an estimated delivery date of 5 business days. That date came and went, but what was really weird is that the tracking information never updated past ""label created"". So I called the company and asked what was going on, and eventually had myself escalated. They tell me that an internal investigation, typically taking 2-3 business days, will be needed. Well, we're at 9 business days now, with no developments.  The specialist has been sending me an email every other day, but they've just been saying that there have been no updates or new developments. Since the product was never delivered, and I asked to cancel my order outright. They said that no cancellations or attempts at a second shipment can be made until this investigation is complete.  Now, I know that I'm not there yet, but I would like to know how long the company can continue to stall without delivering the product? I mean, there has to eventually be a line where it crosses into theft territory, as I have given them money for goods that have not been delivered.   If it's at all relevant, the product is a laptop, the value is $1600, and my biggest frustration is that I'm a student, without the funds to find a replacement for something that is beginning to impact my studies.   Any input is appreciated."	Yes
Basically we hired this lady 6 months ago to be our wedding caterer. We were given an outline on pricing and sent over a deposit and agreed in principle over the phone to a price for the food and labor. I don't even want to get into how we got so far along without everything being signed and settled.  Well two weeks before the wedding she sent a revised budget and basically doubled the price of everything. When we asked her to honor the original prices that she agreed to she refused. So we fired her from the wedding a week out. Only downside is that she has several thousand of our dollars.   What is the best course of action to get the money back from her? Obliviously we have asked her directly and have not been able to get a hold of her. What steps should we take to apply the most pressure on her to refund us?	Yes
Note: GeekChic may voluntarily refund or something, I don't know yet, but I'm trying to find out my worst-case-scenario options. I live in Oregon, GeekChic was located in Washington.  I placed an order for a custom coffee table through Geek Chic (a custom furniture manufacturer) in January. I paid for it in full ahead of time (as is required since they hand make every piece). They gave me an estimated delivery date of August-October, which is also typical.  However, they've now announced they're out of business and have stopped responding to calls, emails, etc. I don't believe my table is built (or finished), or in any way deliverable, and I've already paid for it in its entirety back in January ($4770).  GeekChic hasn't announced anything about customers money yet, but I'm trying to find out my options for what I could do if they don't (or can't) refund it. I paid for it with a Chase-branded Visa Signature card. Does anyone have any suggestions?

I am planning to donate to the Salvation Army and the items amount to less than 5000 dollars in valuation . I am relocating to Asia and selling my apartment unit in California. Am I able to use these donations (goig to made this year) towards tax write offs from the money I recieve from selling my apartment? Does the money I make from the sale count as income tax? Thank you in advance	Yes
I signed a contract with a gym at the beginning of the year for a year long service, with the ability to cancel my membership at any time as long as I paid half of the remaining cost of whatever months I had left. Recently my job cut my hours and I wasn't able to afford the gym anymore so I cancelled, and made a payment plan for 50 dollars a month until I pay off the remainder of half of what was left in my contract. After signing the cancellation document at the beginning of the month (before my payment for the month was due, and with the 50 dollar payments starting after the 14th of this month) I was still charged the full amount before cancellation and it overdrafted my account. I've been trying to talk to the owner but he's tried to do anything but give me a refund. Is this legal for him to do? I have it in writing and signed I would only pay 50 a month starting this month for cancellation.	Yes
Up until last year I was a graduate student with federal student loans (no private loans) at a public university in Virginia. I had to take a leave for medical reasons, but finished all my classes and only have my thesis defense left. My last class was in Spring 2016 and I have not been registered since, but due to lack of enrollment began paying on my student debts in December 2016 after a 6 month grace period.  A few days ago I received a letter from a debt collector saying a debt has been placed with their office for collections. It states the original creditor is the university for $148.94, and there are about $150 in additional fees listed from them. It's dated June 26, 2017 and says I have 30 days to dispute in writing and gives a PO box address and phone number.   I have no idea what the debt is from and there's been no attempt to collect before now. I did move 2 months ago but have a change of address filed. I logged on to my old university account to check if a fee was added later that I may have missed but it shows my history of payments and it's all balanced at $0. I'm totally willing to pay the $148.94 if it's a real debt I owe, but I have no idea what's it's for. I would rather not pay the extra $150 in collection fees and especially don't want a hit on my credit.   Is there a way to check if it's real, and if so, what it's charged for? My university financial aid office is notoriously terrible over the phone and I'm no longer in that city to stop by in person. I want to dispute it but I don't know how to prove I send a letter in to the debt collector by writing to their PO box. I'm assuming a phone call would not be enough proof of dispute in time.	Yes
I leased a car, and then moved states and registered my car in MD. I got a letter from Honda Financial that said by error I have received the original Certificate of Title for the vehicle and I should send it to Honda FInancial (they enclosed a pre-marked return envelope). Do I own the car now? If I don't send back the Title, and claim the car is mine now, will they just sue me for it or request an updated Certificate from the state?	Yes

"I have a plan with a telco company that is akin to mobile device insurance. I get to replace my defective set for a new/refurbished set with a small out-of-pocket charge ($130). The device that I would receive is covered under a 6 months warranty.  5 months in the warranty, said device started malfunctioning. I tried to exercise the warranty but it was out rightly denied on the basis that there is cosmetic damage on the device (small dent).  I disputed this on the basis that no where on the service terms and conditions did it explicitly state that cosmetic damage voids this 6-months warranty.   The warranty clause is as such:   Warranty – You are entitled to a 6 month warranty for each Like Mobile Device against manufacturer malfunctions and defects that starts from the date of delivery of Like Mobile Device. }  They claim that my cosmetic damage is ""against manufacturer malfunctions"" hence my warranty is void. So far I have spoken to two senior managers who have given me the same reasoning.  How should I reply them? Can what they mean be interpreted from that clause?"	Yes
I have a buddy (yes, I am really asking for a friend) who is both physically and mentally disabled and was the victim of vehicle burglary resulting in about $10k of loss.  The insurance company requires a recorded statement but he is concerned about this as his condition requires a number of meds and his thought process is not what it used to be, pain meds, anti-depressants among others have clouded his brain.  Will providing this information at the beginning of the recording assist him in any way if there are any discrepancies found later between his statement and the physical facts of the loss?   He has Nothing to hide but is having anxiety resulting from the ins co. trying to find any small discrepancy to deny his claim.	Yes
I got an e-mail from a website selling sneakers that I owe them a large amount of money because I had allegedly scam them out of that amount of money worth of merchandise. They don't have my IP address, and they don't have my name. All they have is a few drop locations in some area of my state. I will never go to those locations again. Is there truly anything they can do to me? They told me that they have hired a private investigator already and that they have records of me carding them and carding several other related websites (They correctly named a few of them) and that this will all go to the FBI if I don't send them some large amount of money.  Obviously, I don't want to send them that amount of money, but I don't want to get prosecuted for carding, so am I better off sending them that money to avoid lawyer fees if they report me to the feds?	Yes
First off we three each paid a deposit to this apartment of $100. The front desk woman we gave these money orders to was just terminated by management. The new management says since they have no evidence of us paying through money order we must prove it through receipts. If I can't find the original receipt what can I do from there? Old management lost the deposits and now I'm in a confused place on this.	Yes

My husband and I are a young couple barely starting to build a life. We bought a trailer home for $500 with the idea of repairing it slowly since it's a bit run down.   We needed somewhere to put it so we got a property which was $1000 of downpayment and would be $250 every month.   We paid someone close to $2000 to move the trailer home into the property. He did and its been there for about 2 weeks now.   Today my husband got a call from the lady who sold him the property saying that she wants to break contract and move our home elsewhere into another one of her available properties all because the man who lives right next to our property is complaining that our home is too ugly to be next to his or in his immediate vicinity. The lady is siding with him because this man turns out to be the city commissioner.   The other available properties are not the same as the one we have now. They are by a creek and they pretty much get flooded every time it rains. The lady did offer to pay for someone to move our home again and use the first downpayment for whichever other property we get so we wouldn't have to pay twice but we don't want to settle for less just because this man feels superior to us but we don't know what to do.   Please help us. Your advice will be greatly appreciated.   	Yes
"Hi,  Thank you guys for taking the time to read this and help us out, we messed up! My girlfriend and I run a small business in BC, Canada. We needed scheduling software and she ended up going with a web platform she used to use at an old job, however, we really dont like it at all and we havent used it, but its costing us 100$ a month! The web service company is based out of New Jersey. Is there anything we can do to get out of this contract or break it by paying less than what they are asking?   I know Canada has some consumer protection laws, but I dont know if they are applicable in this situation. I've provided more details below:  She signed a 24 month contract and when we asked the company how to cancel they transferred us on the phone several times before saying they couldnt help us and then it took a few days before they finally emailed us the cancellation information. **To cancel the contract we would have to buy out our remaining term and pay them for all 24 months anyway**.   The communcation with the company has been awful, they emailed us completely incorrect information about our contract and how long it is then in the same email attached the actual contract she signed with the correct information. **In the email they say we signed the contract in 2014 when it was actually 2016 and the actual contract shows 2016 too . Here is the email:**  * ""After a review of your account, your company signed and committed to a one year monthly payment subscription agreement with WorkWave effective 9/4/2014.  Your signed agreement is attached for your convenience. Per the terms &amp; conditions of the agreement, cancellation will require a buyout of the nineteen remaining months of your contract. The contract balance at this time is $1,425.00 plus any applicable sales tax.""    **Here is the wording of the actual contract:**  Prices include the use of the software, hosting your company’s information, automatic software updates and data file backup. The monthly payment plan pricing is based on a 24 month subscription (with automatic renewal) as further set forth in this Purchase Order Agreement and the General Terms and Conditions referenced herein. At any point during the License Term, additional users may be added. The pro-rated amount of the additional user(s) will apply and be billed at the time such users are added upon between the parties. Customer's credit card shall be charged, and Customer agrees to pay each month, the actual concurrent user pricing fee. The ServiceCEO Solution shall be provided to Customer based on a subscription term of twelve (12) months from the Service Commencement Date (“Initial Term”). At the completion of the Initial Term, the Subscription Term shall renew automatically for successive twelve (12) month periods (each period a “Renewal Term”) unless either party gives written notice to the other party of its intent not to renew at least fortyfive (45) days prior to the end of the Initial Term or then current Renewal term. In the event that the customer terminates this agreement during the contract term, an early termination fee will be charged to the credit card on file in the month that the customer terminates this agreement. As detailed in the General Terms and Conditions, early termination fees shall be computed based on the monthly fees due multiplied by the number of months remaining in the Initial Term, or in the then current Renewal Term, as applicable. Customer hereby agrees that the provision of the ServiceCEO Web Edition Business Management Software Subscription, training, implementation services and support related thereto shall be governed by WorkWave's standard Terms of Use which are available for review at http://www.workwave.com/general-terms-and-conditions.

This is post ended up having quite a few questions but they're all  in regards to money.  I'm 16 and receive a check once a month of I believe $700. The checks began to come in shortly after my mother died in 2010 and I've been told it's because my mom worked at Wal-Mart for a really long time but I've never actually seen this check because i guess my guardian set it so that goes to the bank instead of in the mail. Anyways, I would like to know how/what I'm getting this money for /  what it's called. My guardian has said that I'll keep getting this check as long as I stay in school and go to college, another time she said I would just get it until forever so i'm at a loss there.  Eventually I'm going to move out and I don't want to leave without my money because I have to live my own life. How old would I have to be to get this for myself, can I get it right after I turn 18 ?   My mother also had (life insurance money I suppose?) split up for me and my older brother who has already taken his share. My part is in a bank account which again I've been told I can access once I'm older ( no one has access at all at the moment) but does that mean once I'm 18 or 21 or?  This post has gotten a little to long for my liking and I don't want to add anymore questions because I think I've had enough.  Please help me, I want to live my life on my own as soon as I can, I don't live with physical abuse or anything too bad but there is some problems and it's just one of those homes where you don't want to stick around past your due.  The day I turn 18 is going to be a great day and I want to get an idea of what I have to do.  I appreciate anything you can help me with even if it's only one thing, thank you in advance to/if anyone that can help.	Yes
"So about half a year ago I noticed a $200 ish charge on my credit card that I had not made. Looked up the company in question and found many complaints about continued charges after cancelling the service this company provides (online dating). I then called my bank and got them to mark the charge as fraud and they sent me a new card. Yesterday I received a letter from a credit services company. The letter begins by saying this is a 72 hour demand. It goes on tell me it has been sent in accordance with provincial legislation and that the credit service has attempted to find a solution with me, though this is the first time I have heard anything from this company since a had to get a new credit card. Then it says the debt is past due and IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION may be the only way to resolve the matter. It tells me after obtaining a provincial court order they may garnish my wages, attach real estate or property I own, seize money in my accounts, seize and sell assets and have my finances examined in court. ""There is still time to deal with the matter"" it goes on to say but if no reply is received in 72 hours they will make a referral back to the client for IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION with no further notice to me. What should I do?"	Yes
Hello!  I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.  This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.  When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?  Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.  Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.  I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.  I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.  At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.  I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)  It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.  **tl:dr University won't accept payment via an AmeriCorps award, won't release transcript, how do I negotiate with them?**	Yes
(Indiana and California, for the bot, but I think it's all federal.)   My former cell phone provider thinks I owe them $300. I disagree, but that's not really the issue here.  I sent a general dispute letter the first time it was sent to collections, asking for verification. Instead of verification, I got a letter back from the collection agency that they were returning it to the cell provider. Today, I got a new letter in the mail from a different agency.  I plan on disputing that one as well, but if the same thing happens, is there a point where I'm done? Or can the provider just keep sending it to a new collection agency every time I dispute it, rather than having them actually send the verifications they're required to provide by law?   Sending certified letters will eventually rack up more than the debt, but I'd hate for the one I don't send certified to be the one I actually have a solid FDCPA violation with.	Yes
Hello. My fiancé (30F) and I (37M) have been together around 4 years. We live together and have a 2 year old daughter. We have joint accounts including checking and credit cards. For the past 3 years I have been supporting her and our daughter exclusively. My fiancé was a full time student and recently graduated from college. I'm currently only making $30k annually. In the 3 years my fiancé had been going to school, I payed nearly 100% of all living expenses including rent, utilities, food, etc. After she graduated she was offered, and took, a teaching position making around $44k a year. She talked me into buying her a new car last month. The car is in both of our names as I am a co-signer. Our current credit card debt is around $25k. All credit card debt is in my name with the exception of one credit card, which she is an authorized user.   So a few days ago things got weird with her. She started going out partying and yesterday tells me she wants to split up because she's not happy in our relationship. This has devastated me because now I'm loosing everything. She's sticking all of our accumulated debt directly onto me while she will be also taking our daughter. She said she hasn't been happy for around 6 months and was contemplating on leaving, meanwhile here I am digging myself deeper and deeper into debt, living almost off of credit cards. She basically used me to get through college and now that she's accepted a job, she's going to leave.   I'm not sure this is relevant, but she's currently on antidepressants and anti anxiety meds, of which lately she has been throwing away. She has become unstable.   So here I am. I'm asking for advice on what I can do legally to force her to pay for half our accumulated debt? Do I have any legal recourse? I know I should seek an attorney but I really really cannot afford it right now. Please, please don't berate me on my situation. I know I messed up. I made many mistakes financially. I can blame my fiancé for her continuous false promises of stability financially, but at the end of the day, it's all on me. You have to understand, I'm in a really really low end of my life right now. The bottom just suddenly fell out. In the past 72 hours we went from talking about buying a house next year and living comfortably financially to: my family being torn in half, my daughter being taken away and being on the hook for $25k in debt plus a new car loan on top. I'm asking for advice not asking to be belittle for being a dupe. I already feel like crap and cannot handle anything else. Thank you for what help you can provide.	Yes
I'm in Amarillo, TX. I paid my rent online an hour after midnight on the third. The deadline is the third, so I was technically late by an hour. The total fees are $100, and the letter I received on my door yesterday says I have to pay with a cashier's check or face further penalties, and my lock will be changed. My rent is $620. Is this fee excessive? I was given the notice Friday. Can they continue to charge penalties until I can pay the fee on Monday? Do I have any recourse? Thanks in advance for any help.	Yes
If a couple is married, can one person file bankruptcy on their own? I'm married but have past premarital debt. My spouse doesn't have debt or bad credit. Would it be possible for me to file bankruptcy on my debt that occurred before our marriage without him having to file with me or be effected in any way? He has a security clearance to think of and his job depends on having good credit to keep his clearance. I need to protect my husband from my debt. I have a disabled child whom l stay home and care for, so me working to pay off the massive amount of medical bills and hospital stays my childs disability racked up with me being a single mom before I got remarried and got health insurance is impossible. My credit is shot. I'd really like to start new if could. My ex-husband doesnt contribute a dime for our son and never has. I've had hell trying to get the court to enforce support beyond the order, so all the bills are on me and hurt my credit. I can't afford to take the ex back to court again, not that he'd get a job and contribute anyway. What can I do?	Yes
I'm going to summarize a long story to ask this question; Over a year ago now I prepaid a firm to declare bankruptcy. Things seemed fine until I gave them the full amount in advance for the service. Then they disappeared for a month and when I finally did get a hold of them, they strung me along for another several months and refused to give my money back. Eventually after I reported them to the better business bureau, they agreed to pay 1/3 of the money back, but that was a month and a half ago and they still haven't sent the check... What can I do next to recover this money? This is in Ohio. Thank you!	Yes
"So yesterday my father came home with a ""Brand new"" Samsung Galaxy Note 5 that he purchased at a local cellular and mobile phone service store.  While he was setting up his phone I noticed that the phone he had just bought did not come with the original Samsung box. Which seemed a bit strange to me since he claimed that the phone was brand new. I asked him if that was the box the phone came in with and why it was not the original samsung box. He was dumbfounded after I showed him that every brand new samsung phone comes in with a samsung box. (I showed him unboxing videos on youtube of the same phone) I then asked him how much he had paid for the phone and if he was given a receipt for his transaction.  He apparently paid $500 cash for the phone and was not even given a receipt.   At this point the entire thing seemed pretty shady to me. But my dad dismissed my concerns and gave the store owner benefit of doubt and went to work. I decided to visit the store where he had purchased this phone and asked them why my father was not given the receipt for the phone that he had just bought. After pressing the matter I was provided with the receipt which my father had apparently ""Left behind."" But upon asking them why a ""Brand new phone"" was missing its original box I was kindly met with ""Get the fuck out of my shop."" and all of my requests for a potential refund were denied except for in store credit. After looking at the receipt I found that it was missing any tax information and was showing an amount paid of $425 when my father paid $500 in cash.  When I got home I went through the contents of the box the phone came in with and found an amazon return slip. I believe that the store most likely bought a used phone on amazon and passed it off as brand new and sold it for $500 to my dad. I looked up  [Samsung Galaxy Note 5](https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-Galaxy-SM-N920A-Unlocked-Cellphone/dp/B013XB5L1A/ref=sr_1_1?s=wireless&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1500305135&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=samsung+galaxy+note+5+unlocked) on amazon and a brand new one costs about $359 which I assume comes with the original box and it has free shipping.   I really don't know how to proceed at this point. Any help will be greatly appreciated.   p.s We live in Queens, NY.  TLDR; My father bought a brand new samsung phone for $500 which did not come with the original samsung box and the receipt provided by the store does not reflect the correct amount paid."	Yes
Its a long, complex and boring story so I'll just stick to the key parts.   I'm going to Cancun next week so I decided to purchase a LifeProof Nuud model.   The lady working at Target installed my case, which I thought was normal at the time, come to find out later she wasn't supposed to do that.   Anyways, I get home and then realize that the case wasn't properly tested for bubbles, or any sort of breech in the case. Also, I realize she installed the case incorrectly so that my Silence/Ringer slider was being crushed by the case.   So of course, I get sketched out, I go to Target the next day, the woman who 'helped' me the day before wasn't there but a group of employees decided to try to take the faulty case off.   Some how, they use too much to the point that my screen was cracked &amp; phone bent. Pretty much destroying it. (Didn't even get the case off.)  Now Target refuses to reimburse me for my iPhone, and I'm not sure what to do.   I'm not very rich at all, the phone was probably the most expensive thing I've owned in the past five years, so buying a new one isn't that simple.   Tl;dr: Target lady installed my new case improperly, other target people try to take and off and destroy it in the process. Target won't pay me for the phone.   P.S, sorry for horrible formatting/spelling. It's about 1 in the morning, and I've pretty exhausted from trying to deal with this.	Yes
I bought a new car a couple of weeks ago and and finance guys says your scheduled maintenance will cost x amount if you pay out of pocket and this will save you money buy it now... turns out its not the great deal it was supposed to be and I went back to cancel, talked of a different person to cancel and she says oh we have a policy that we wont cancel in the first 3 months because we get charged back... now the paper work i have says i can cancel at anytime and in the first 30 days it is a 100% reimbursement and 30 to 60 days it is 100% less a 50 dollar fee. The lady kept says oh it our policy not to for 90 days and i said but i have a legal document that says i can right now. there was no mention of their policy when they were bought and i see no mention of their policy in the paperwork... I think they are just full of it and don't want me to cancel	Yes
"So yesterday my girlfriend called me all excited because she bought a new car from a used car salesman. She told me the contract and it is absolutely horrible. She's a young girl (21) and went in and told a salesman it was her first time buying a used car and he pulled the whole ""oh it's easy I'll walk you through it"" and took advantage of her.   Her contract is absolutely awful. They have her paying about $17.5k for a car worth maybe 7k. She has a 65 month contract with 9% APR. I told her that she got screwed over and to use californias 48hr used car cooldown period to void every contract she sign. Well she just sent me a picture of her signature on a contract opting out of purchasing a cancellation for her contract. She's got amazing credit score as well if  that helps anything.   Is there anything we can do to get her out of this contract and prevent her from buying this POs car for almost 3x it's worth?"	Yes
"I'm a US citizen who lives as an expat in the Czech Republic and have a huge medical bill in Colorado that I cannot afford to pay, and now debt collectors keep sending my brother notices (I have my US mail sent to him).  Some background: I was visiting family after spending a year in Vietnam and got very sick two days before flying to Europe. I thought it might be a parasite (I previously had one in Vietnam) and was informed by a nurse hotline that only an ER can check for parasites on this short of notice.   So I went to the ER and they gave me an IV drip, did blood work and stool sample, and gave me some meds. They would not give me any sort of figure for how much all of this would cost, not even ballpark. They just said ""it varies"". They were pushing to do a stomach ultrasound and I refused because it sounded expensive. They were very unsympathetic to the fact that I had no US health insurance and that I'd be paying out of pocket.  Now I have a bill for over $5000 that I can't pay. I don't even have any assets worth that much money.  I don't live in the US anymore, although I visit about every two years. What's my best option here? What sort of legal action are they able to take? Do debt collectors do payment plans? Are they able to go after my brother?"	Yes
I bought a 2015 Jeep and I don't think it's all I wanted. All I've done so far is just put down a deposit and signed a few papers and then they let me drive off with it to come back tomorrow for finalization. I don't think I want the car anymore though - I just feel it was too hasty. Can I return it? Im fine without getting the deposit back.	Yes
"Last year, myself and hundreds of others put our money down on a product called a ""Marble DCS"". The company is an established company with another successful product. The ""DCS"" was offered in two versions, the DCS-1 and DCS-2.   The promised ship date or the DCS-1 was October 2016. Units were finally being reported as received by backers in May 2017, 9 months after the promised ship date.   But everyone who paid for and backed the DCS-2, has yet to receive anything other than emails describing ""engineering challenges"", and offers to change their order to a DCS-1 instead. The DCS-1 has completely different ports and options.  I've been trading emails with their support asking for an ETA on when the DCS-2 will ship, or asking them to refund the money they've already collected a year ago from backers.   Their only responses are continued emails asking me to change my order to the DCS-1, instead of ""waiting for"" the DCS-2. The DCS-1 will not work for me, nor hundreds of other backers who paid for theirs.   After more stonewalling, I've asked them to pass on the details of their legal department, and haven't heard back in weeks. My bank claims that they cannot return the funds or file a claim because it's more than 75 days past the promised ship date.   What are my options here, or should I just write this off as being a victim of yet another vaporware fraud campaign?"	Yes
My AC was running terribly, and had a repair guy come out and do a diagnostic. He said that it needs to be replaced as it is going on 15+ years and it keeps overheating and shutting off and then starting back up again, which is why it is not cooling enough. I called my warranty people and they said they will send out a tech within 24-48 hours. I call the place they referred a few hours later as they said they would contact me but never did and they were closed for the weekend.  After this I called the warranty company again and they found a tech that was 24/7. I got in contact with that guy and he told me he would be out in 1-2 hours. 3 hours later I called again and he is not answering his phone. It is now the next day and he is still not answering his phone. After calling the warranty company again they said there is nothing they can do.  Is this a complete breach of contract and can I just get my own replacement and bill the warranty company at this point?	Yes
Hi. I am from Northern New Jersey. I am in need of some advice and was wondering if the helpful people of this subreddit can provide some. Throwaway being used for anonymity. A couple of days ago, I received a check from the Federal Trade Commission because they settled with DeVry in a 100 million dollar settlement. After doing hours of research and spending hours on the phone with government student loan help lines I am lost. I want to know a few things. Does cashing this check stop me from filing a lawsuit against DeVry? Also, I still owe around $60,000 in Student Loans, with this settlement anyone with Private Student loans are being refunded but people like me who took out Federal Student Loans are left to seek out other means of refund. One suggestion from the FTC was filing for the  Department of Education's Borrower Defense to Repayment program. Should I do this before seeing an attorney? I am afraid that if Betsy DeVos gets her way she will get rid of this program before it can help me out. Any advice? Please and thank you.	Yes
My business partner just signed us up to a vodaphone red plan, he told me we would get 10 GB each but after reading the plans terms it's only 10 GB for the first month and 5 for the rest, is this legal, is there a window or option to cancel it within the first month?	Yes
"Ok so I have been dealing with this for a week now, and things have gone nowhere. I took my car to get it air wrapped by a gentleman who had advertised on Facebook. I picked the color, dropped off the car, and waited to see how awesome my new look would be. Things started going wrong when he sent a picture and I noticed a slight discoloration. He didn't say anything about it, so I said something, and sure enough, he messed up. So thugs aren't great because we had agreed to pick up the car that Tuesday and now it is taking longer. So I pick out the new color (since he said the original was too hard) and he got to work. Well so I thought. He didn't change out the masking, and ended up ordering the wrong color without telling me (he later told me when I asked that he had tried it and it didn't work, then told me the truth that they just didn't have it in stock). So I didn't say anything other than asking why it was different. So I go to pick it up and I first see some errors. Nothing big, and stuff he said he could fix. He was in a rush, so I paid him contingent on him fixing it. Well when I get home and have a good hour to look at it, I start noticing how poorly it was done. He also had bent trim pieces, damaged the interior door handle, and got overspray all throughout the car. I approached him and asked him to explain. He said it was normal so I asked several installers who were out of state. I have over 4 people telling me it was not done right. He said he messed up on the phone, but couldn't give a refund. So I offered a payment plan. Well now he says he spoke with a lawyer and the lawyer said since the paper didn't say it was a contract it technically isn't one. I'll attach some pictures, but I'm curious if I have a case with this or if I should cut my losses.   Forgot to add, he also removed the first covering with a large ring on (posted a video after I got the car). And I'm worried I'll find scratches underneath. Would he be liable since it was negligent to have a ring so close to car paint? Thanks!'   Edit: added pictures with picture of ""paper"" I signed.   Edit two. Didn't post the cropped picture. Will reupload"	Yes
"Bought a used car in Harris county, Houston, Texas, from a small car dealer at his residence.  Before purchasing the car, I did have a call out mechanic inspect the vehicle. After I had thoroughly inspected and driven the car.  Hours after purchasing the car, the IMA (Honda Civic Hybrid battery) and the catalytic converter are showing errors.  We have already paid $3,700 for the car cash in hand and owe him $400 for the cost of registration which was in the paperwork we signed. Also stating we would not sue and buying the vehicle in ""As is"" condition.  The seller states he can transfer the vehicle registration and that he does not need the vehicle for the vehicle inspection report.  I need a car as there is little public transport. What options do I have either for the mechanic or the seller to fix the problems with the car? Or is it possible to get my money back?"	Yes
My dad was supposed to pick up the car from long term airport parking because I couldn't find a ride. He was just gonna snag it from the lot the next day or later that very day. Through one reason or another he didn't, and it had been there accumulating 13 a day for 8 days. I went to get it when I came back from my trip, livid that I now have to charge money on my card that I don't have at this very moment. So how do I get it out? Well I rode the ass of the guy in front of me and I drove out with him. I can pay tomorrow but like idk if I'm gonna have like some sort of warrant out for me or something. I know this is such a small thing but i am 19 years old and do not want to have to deal with this as some sort of ticket or anything. Do I call the airport? What should I do?	Yes
I'm a part of the alumni board of my old Fraternity.  Recently, we've had one of the kids break in a couple of interior doors after imbibing a little too much.  Regardless to say, he's being a little s*** about it, and we're having difficulty collecting money for the damages, even though we feel pretty good about the evidence we have against him.  We've gotten to the point where we've gave him one last opportunity to pay, and now the question is whether to take him to collections or to small claims court.  The first door he broke was when he was still a tenant at the house, and there are clauses in the lease regarding damaging property.  The second door was a couple months after he graduated, and after his lease was up.  One other issue is that the guy now lives out of state.  I forget the final cost of the repairs, but we're only asking for $600, which is less than the total.  While we still want the money, we're really at the point right now where we want to set a precedent, and we don't want him to get away with it.  With all this said, what's the best course of action: small claims court or collections?	Yes
"My husband was in a situation in 2011 where he helped an old girlfriend buy a car and she stopped making payments on it after they separated. He also never made more payments on it and it was repossessed and has been a ""Derogatory"" item on his report ever since. It's for ~$13,000 and we are in Canada (Alberta but the debt was acquired in BC).   I've been trying to do some research and getting mixed recommendations on how to deal with it. We are in a position to be able to pay it all off in one payment, but should we see if it falls off the report next year (after 7 years)? Do we try to contact the creditor and get it all paid off? Would it even actually be removed from his credit report at that point? Should we do it all by mail as opposed to on the phone to keep a paper trail?    Thanks for any help you can give, we want to get it dealt with but I've seen many articles that say paying off the full debt could be actually detrimental and useless at this point."	Yes
I live in Washington. I have bipolar disorder and I had a severe manic episode that started around the 20th of June. On June 28th, I bought a 2013 Subaru WRX STI. I love Subaru, but I'm in my early 20s and don't need or want a car of that value. They sold it to me for 31k, after taxes it was ~35k.    Two days after the car purchase I was admitted to a mental hospital to help me get back on track. While I was in the hospital, my uncle (an attorney in IN) helped draft a letter to send to the dealership. My Mom emailed the dealership the letter on 7/2 or 7/3 when I was in the hospital.  After coming out of the hospital on 7/4, I cleaned up the car and dropped it back to the dealership.   I was hoping they would take the mental health episode into account and have some sympathy, and maybe charge a restocking fee and make me pay for the miles I put on the car (I also was willing to wait until it sold again and pay them any difference in selling price). They took the other route and had their lawyer send an email basically just saying there's no 3 day grace period or anything like that in Washington.   I know I'm definitely knee-deep in shit for this, but does anyone have any suggestions? I'm debating just leaving it there and taking the credit hit from a default. I make pretty good money for my age but I don't want to be stuck with those ridiculous payments. Even just seeing the car gives me anxiety and reminds me of all the bad decisions I made during that manic episode.	Yes
My family owes state taxes to the tune of about $700. (We owe more than that, but I don't recall what year this is about)   Yesterday, July 14th, we received a letter stating that a lien had been placed. Today, we received a letter stating that we had ten days to do something before they would begin garnishing our wages and selling our personal property.   We can not afford this. My wife lost her job this same week and we have close to $5000 in debt from a bed hold at the nursing home my mother-in-law lived at before her death last month. We were barely making ends meet to begin with and are tapped out as far as any other way to get money. Is there anything we can do?	Yes
This is in Brooklyn, NY. Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage.   Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,  The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.  When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.  The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife.   The body damage is just cosmetic so it wouldn't be thousands (I don't think) to fix, but it would be at least a few hundred, maybe more. I'm also really anxious about what was done in my car without me knowing and how often this might have happened. I am due to move out of state this Thursday, 7/13, so I'll be severing my relationship with the garage anyway, but I'd appreciate any advice on how best to proceed. Thanks!	Yes
"I'm in another state, but he's in California.  We've been friends for decades, often doing business because I trade/sell memorabilia and he buys stuff for his collections.  So I've been getting stuff for him at his request, from various sources that I can't return it to: People on eBay, thrift stores, pawn shops.  Because he's always been honest, I never thought to get a written contract, so I guess you could say we had an oral contract.  (I know; normally I wouldn't be so naive, but as I said, he's been honest for decades.)  Last month, he says he won't be able to buy stuff ""for a while"", however long that would be.  He says he can't pay me because he had a large dental bill, but this is B.S.; his net worth is six figures, so this dental bill is like change he could find in his sofa.  All I was asking was $90 for the stuff he bought, and that included postage (one of the items was really heavy).  I called him to explain that this puts me in a heck of a bind, as I have bills to pay and my money is tied up in this stuff that I can't sell to anyone else.  He collects on these has-been celebrities, you see, so I'm stuck with this junk now.  He said he'd call me back the next day, but half an hour later I get a call from his crooked friend who helps him with his finances.    The friend says to me, ""He owes you nothing!""  I asked what business is it of his, and sarcastically asked if he has power of attorney over my friend; he lied and said yes, but my friend told me that nobody has power of attorney over him.  I hung up on this liar and tried to call my friend, but he won't take my calls anymore.  I do have a little evidence that we had an agreement for me to sell him stuff every month, such as emails and the USPS insurance/postage receipts.  I could kick myself for not getting this in writing, but I never dreamed this guy would do such a thing.  Do I have any legal recourse against him?  I'm unable to travel to California to take him to small-claims court, and thanks to his actions, I don't have cash to spare, as it's tied up in his junk that he won't pay me back for.  Any insights appreciated; if any of you have additional questions for me, I'll answer them as best I can.  Thanks."	Yes
I've run into a bit of an issue with my dishwasher and I would be interested in getting your opinions on how to resolve it.  The other night, I started my dishwasher before bed. I later woke up to thick, black smoke, the smell of burning electronics and noise coming from my dishwasher. I sprinted over to it and turned it off. The smoke and burning seemed to be coming from the top, control area of the dishwasher and it continued for a while after removing power from the unit.  After doing a little research online regarding dishwashers and electrical fires. I kept seeing images of my exact dishwasher associated with many of the issues. Many of the pictures showing fire damage were in the exact location that affected my unit. I found out that Bosch had placed a recall on my model. I've entered my model and serial number on their site and it has confirmed my unit is affected by the recall. I also called customer support and they too confirmed the recall of my unit.  After calling Bosch's customer support I have two options:  -Allow them to have someone repair my dishwasher  -40% off a new Bosch replacement.  I have to admit, I am not very interested in simply having my defective model repaired. Had I not woke up, my house very well could have burned down while my wife, two-year-old daughter, seven-month-old son, our dog, cat and I were sleeping. I'm not sure about repairing it and having a ticking time bomb of a fire hazard in the house. If the unit is repaired but breaks down afterward due to damage that was done to the unit when it started burning but was not caught and fixed by the repair person during the original visit. Then we would not be covered for an additional repair?  The 40% off a new Bosch dishwasher seems like the way to go. However, there are some drawbacks with their fine print. You have to order the replacement off of their website. Their website has an option to add to cart or online retailers. The 40% discount documentation states that I have to order through them on their site. If I purchase from Bosch directly, I am paying full MSRP on the replacement unit plus: an additional $50 for shipping, have to install the new unit and pay to have my old unit disposed of. This would end up costing $200 more than what these dishwashers are selling for in retail. That is nearly equivalent to subtracting 25% of the 40% discount and having to wait an additional 2-3 weeks for the forms to be submitted, claim to be processed, shipping and install the new unit.  What are your thoughts? How might you go about handling this?   A 40% discount would have seemed to be a fair, good faith resolution if it wasn't for the inflated pricing and all of the associated inconveniences.	Yes
I will spare you the lengthy story of how my friend came about owing me $2,000. (Please spare me your opinions of how I shouldn't share my Paypal or the quality of the friendship)   He agrees that he unintentionally took this money from a shared Paypal account and I have records to prove the money is mine and went into his personal bank account. He has agreed to pay me back the money, however he is doing it very slowly. In the last 6 months I have received $400 in payments from him. His reasoning for infrequent payments is that his dad is battling cancer and all his income is going towards hospital bills.  I have kindly asked him to increase the frequency to $200/month and since then I have not received any money in over 1 month.   Should I take legal matters to the small claims court? If so, how do I approach that without being aggressive (How do I tell   him this before filing)?  I have all of our conversations and agreements documented through text messages so having it ruled in my favor will be easy.  I am in Sacramento, CA  Thank you in advance!	Yes
I bought a 2014 Ford fusion used about 6 months ago. A few days after having it I found out it has some issue where it goes into the limp home mode if you accelerate too quickly. This means power train service light and airbag light come on and the car refuses to accelerate normally until turned off and back on again. It's sometimes accompanied by a check engine light but not always. I bought it with a third party extended service warranty that covers almost everything and it still has the manufacturers power train warranty.   It was bought used at a non Ford dealership who initially tried to repair it under their warranty for me, but they were unable to diagnose it and they had me take it to a Ford dealership and they would pay for it.   Over the course of about 4 months and 5 visits, they replaced a mass airflow sensor, the battery, and the throttle body. None of that fixed the issue.   I took it to a different Ford dealership but they were unable to fix it under warranty (the third party warranty required it be fixed at the selling dealer if I was within 40 miles of it) and they wouldn't honor the power train warranty. I took it back to the welling dealer who said they couldn't diagnose it and they told me to go to Ford. I took it back to the Ford they sent me to previously and they said it would take them several days to diagnose it and asked me to come back later.   At this point I was in the process of moving across the state, so I moved and found a Ford dealer near me and took it there. They kept it for a week and replaced the accelerator pedal. The check engine light came back on with the same code so I took it back the next day. They turned the code off and test drove it for a while and it didn't come back so they stated it was fixed.   I picked it up again and the original limp home mode issue happened again so in immediate dropped it off again. That was yesterday, and at this point its been at the third ford garage for 2 weeks now. I've been to garages for the same issue about 7 times or so over the last 6 months.   At this point it seems unlikely to me it'll get fixed and this has been an extreme hassle dealing with. Do lemon laws apply to used cars? What are my options here?	Yes
"We had several improvements done to our front yard about one year ago (new walkway, new sprinkler system, planting, etc).  The general contractor we hired subcontracted out the concrete work.  After all the work was completed, we paid the contractor the final installment (50% was due before the job started, 50% due after).  Total job was ~$8,500.  Now, a year later, the subcontractor drives by my house on a Saturday and lets me know he hasn't been paid.  This is certainly news to me!  He has been stiffed by the general contractor and says he will try to come after me.  He then showed me the invoice for concrete work that was supposedly unpaid by the contractor (nearly $2000). He said he sent me a notice in the mail ""a month ago"" that he was going to file a mechanics lien and wanted to know if I got that notice.  I never received that notice.  At this point, my Saturday morning chores are pretty much the last thing on my mind and I am very concerned.  After 20 minutes of reading articles (from a google search), it seems like contractors and subcontractors have 90 days to file a mechanics lien.  It also says that they must file a notice to the property owner before filing the mechanics lien.  What do I do?  I have no evidence that the contractor didn't pay the subcontractor.  The contractor could very well have paid the subcontractor and I would never know!  Seems fishy, it almost seems like the subcontractor is trying to collect twice.  Since we are way beyond 90 days here, is this even something I should worry about?  What happens if I never got the notice he said he sent and he still filed a lien somehow?  Thanks in advance for your help.  I really appreciate it!"	Yes
Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
I've been looking for a new apartment and got a look at one of my background checks by Global Verification Network.  In my report, there was a creditor, BANKAMERICA (I'm assuming Bank of America), that I never signed up for and it says that I have almost $5000 in balance.  What's more is that it says that I signed up for it in 2005, when I was like 16, which is impossible because I had no credit then and I distinctly remember only Discover Card accepting me when I was 18.  Should I look into what this is or could Global Verification Network be wrong?  If it is real, what do I do to close it without paying for this $5000 I never spent?  Currently, I have never heard anything about this from Bank of America.	Yes
Is there anything against selling an appliance or device that has roaches? A friend of mine bought a ps4 on Facebook group and it stopped working the next day and found out it was full of roaches. Previous Owner blocked us.	Yes
So last Thursday I was involved in a minor road incident in downtown Houston Tx. I was driving when a car turned left at an intersection and hit my tire. No body damage to my truck but the front of their car totally came off. Here's where it gets interesting: a woman was driving with her husband. Neither parties had a drivers license but the male had an ID and insurance. The cops got involved and only cited the male for driving without a license (again, he was passenger) and declared no one at fault. This now affords the couple of filing a claim against my insurance, which they have started.  Other funny details: the entire front end was exposed but the officers let them drive away. Shouldn't it have been towed? Aren't they able to incur more damage after the fact and claim it against me? How can they drive away without a drivers license? The cops never took my side of the story and only took theirs into account.  I was involved in a similar incident last year and the driver was awarded 30k causing my progressive insurance to skyrocket from $130 full coverage to $670. I had to cancel that policy for some cheap roadside insurance policy that still costs me $230 a month.   I'm petrified that it's about to happen again causing my insurance to soar making it unaffordable and possibly causing me to lose my truck. If that happens then I'd lose my job (I'm an independent contractor) and the snowball effect continues from there.   Any advice?	Yes
Here's what I know.   Back in March of 2017, I used my roommates phone and account for Lyft but used my card information to pay for ride. Afterward, we deleted the app and it was done.   In June, my roommate wrecked his car.   The charges were small because I didn't notice them until a week ago (end of June) and notices they were coming up more frequently.   I have probably cause that my roommate is using my card information without my permission to use Lyft.   Where do I go from here?   I called my bank and Lyft and have taken care of it on that end.	Yes
I inherited an older house and it needed a new roof. Searched for roofers, found a guy, and hired him.      Materials and dumpsters paid for directly by me. About $25,000. (It's a metal roof where the metal is stamped to look like slate and they interlock like a puzzle. That's why so expensive.)      His labor was agreed to be $10,000. Half up front, the rest upon completion.      This was February 21st. It's now almost halfway through July and the roof is only half finished. He comes sporadically and will go a week or more at a time without coming. He has left trash all over the yard. He is wasting materials. Basically, the guy is a mess and I want to hire someone else.      But we signed a contract before he started. I am worried that if I fire him and hire someone else he might be able to sue.      Can I fire him without being liable?      Would I be able to sue him for the wasted materials, months worth of dumpster rental, or anything else?      I can upload pictures of the contract if it helps.      Thanks!!	Yes
"Last year, I went in to a California urgent care center because I ended up having strep throat. I gave them my Aetna PPO insurance, paid the $75 copay, and then went on my merry way to the pharmacy. This was about a year ago.  I did a credit report check recently, and to my surprise a $200 bill had been placed into collections over 6 months ago, with the urgent care center listed as the original account holder. So I call this urgent care, which is located in a small shopping mall and is not attached to a hospital or any other medical offices. The receptionist pulls up my account and tells me that she sees that I paid the copay, but that they have nothing to do with further billing, as they send all their claims to a contracted medical billing office for insurance collection, which is apparently the standard in the industry. She kindly gives me their medical billing company's phone number, apologizes, and says she has ""not heard positive things"" about them. Great.  So I call the medical billing office explaining that their buddy, the urgent care center, sent me to them with my qualms about this phantom $200 medical bill. She looked me up by my name and birthday, and said that yes, they did send that amount to Stanislaus Credit Control Agency after four unsuccessful attempts to contact me. Interestingly enough, the main offices for both Stanislaus and this medical billing company are both located in Modesto, CA. Anyway, the lady says this is a result of me not reaching my insurance deductible, and that this $200 was the amount my insurance, Aetna, would not cover for the urgent care visit. I thought that sounded legitimate so I eased my tone and said thanks for clearing that up.  However, I now believe she was giving me a pre-scripted run-around. I call Aetna to ask what my deductible would be for an urgent care visit. **Aetna says there is no deductible for urgent care visits, only a copay.** I ask them to look up the claim for this urgent care visit, as the urgent care center has my Aetna insurance policy on file. **Aetna has no record of any claim for any urgent care center on my behalf.**   My Aetna customer service guy says hold on, he will personally call this medical billing office. I stay on the line listening to the provided elevator music, and he comes back reporting that the person who is in control of my account is apparently not in the office today, a Monday afternoon at 2pm. I ask my Aetna customer service guy if he thinks that sounds shady. He agrees, and says he personally will try again tomorrow and get back to me. I google the urgent care center on Google, and there are already four negative reviews mentioning surprise letters from collections agencies.  Are any/all of these companies in cahoots with each other to make money from collections, instead of correctly filing a claim with Aetna? I am still waiting to hear back, as this Nancy Drew stuff all went down today. Thanks in advance for any theories."	Yes
"So this goes all the way back to December 2016.  I went through a Delaware toll, like so many others on my multiple trips up north.  My EZ-Pass transponder supposedly never paid Delaware DOT and they sent out two notices for a $4 toll.  I never got either of them.  Fast forward to August 2017 and I get a text from my ex-wife with a picture of a collections notice, to her and her alone, with her parents address and my last name.  The car was originally in her name first (mine second), but I had switched it after we separated in early 2015.    The notice says that I have 30 days to pay or dispute by mail, already 2 weeks into the deadline.  I go to my EZ-Pass account and I see that the date, time, and lane match up with what was claimed to be unpaid.  $4 was taken out to go to Delaware DOT.  I send in the collections paperwork with the EZ-Pass statement, as instructed.  I even circled and highlighted the transaction, to no avail.  They ""never got"" the paperwork and now it is past the time to dispute.  $4 is now $66.50.    I called both Delaware DOT and the collections agency (Professional Account Management, LLC) but no luck there either.  I can easily pay the fine, but I am a man of principal and hate giving into shitty behavior, especially from predatory companies like this.    TL;DR: I didn't ""dispute"" a non-existent debt, which now has a 1562.5% increase over the original ""debt"".  Can they legally collect on this?  How do I fight it to get it off my ex's credit so we can go back to not talking to each other?"	Yes
dad uses a visa and we're not sure if we're allowed to cancel a credit card transaction.  Basically we bought tickets from expedia using a visa card.  I mispelled my dad's name and called them 8 hrs later.  They said they would fix it within 48 hours.  This was a month ago.  They still havent fixed the issue.  Would we be allowed to cancel a transaction in this case? 	Yes
Not long ago I purchased a vehicle from a local dealership.  I was lured in by the dealership's fancy lot and promises written on their website about inspecting every vehicle for safety and reliability.  When I drove off the lot every last airbag light illuminated, as well as the seat belt light.  Obviously, the lights were not on when I had test drove the vehicle earlier in the day.  To be clear, the SRS system in a my vehicle is a fairly simple machine.  It tests for any faults in the airbags and seat belts during those five-ten seconds where the airbag light is on when you first start up your car.  If it detects any faults it will store that fault in the SRS computer and the light will stay on and cannot be shut off without an SRS reset tool.  It is designed so that no amount of tomfoolery will shut off the light, including removing the battery and draining all of the power from the vehicle.  Basically, without actively shutting it off it will not shut off.  The dealership had closed as I was leaving so first thing in the morning I contacted the salesman and was basically told it was my problem now.  I proceeded to my local mechanic, had the codes run, and returned to the dealership to give them a chance to make it right and was told it would be “illegal for them to work on the car.”  When I spoke to the manager he said the same thing, except adding that my mechanic and I are both idiots.  I proceeded to do my own investigation at that point.  The local dealership that deals with my vehicle make ran a diagnostic and discovered a broken bypass installed that triggered the airbag light.  The service manager confirmed that it would have been impossible for the airbag light to have not been present when anyone had turned on the vehicle, as long as the SRS system was connected and that bypass was installed.  I traced the sale of the vehicle back to another dealership that took the vehicle in on trade-in and had confirmed the presence of the broken bypass in their own inspection.  That dealership sent it to auction with the light still on, which is where the dealership I purchased it from had obtained the vehicle.  When I spoke to the state investigators about the issue they seemed to disagree with me that it was fraud.  I had reported that I had been victim to criminal misrepresentation and possibly victim to the sale of nonfunctional airbags (§860.146) but they said that they would have to prove that the owner of the dealership was the one responsible for the act and it would be too difficult for them to do so.  It was my understanding that in a corporation criminal liability is aggregated among the employees of that corporation, not just the the owner.  Am I wrong in assuming that the corporation (or it's agents) should still be investigated even if the owner of the corporation had nothing to do with the misrepresentation?  I'm just baffled at the moment.	Yes
I'm a flight student that was referred to an airplane owner to purchase a 10-hour block of flight time.  I was sent an invoice from the owner's LLC.  I wrote a check made out in his name and sent it to him.  In a short amount of time a few life things happened and I decided to stop flying.  I let him know that I was no longer going to use the flight time and requested a refund.  No contract was signed, and no policies were announced at the time of sale.  He is saying he will not give me a refund.  Can he keep the money forever whether I use the flight time or not?  I realize I did send the money and enter what I assume is a sort of contract by the fact that I sent a check in response to an invoice.  I'm curious if I can sue for my money back or if I'm just hosed.  I'm in Virginia.  Thanks a lot for any advice.	Yes
"I am an Amazon Seller.  I sell various products, and I work hard to position them as high in the search results as possible.  I've been working on some products for months or years, and they slowly gain position in the search pages leading to more sales - but it takes time.  Lots of time.  Recently a competitor started selling a similar product.  (When I say ""similar"" I really mean ""exactly the same"", but with their label on it.  Which is fine, that happens all the time.)  The problem is that this seller generated dozens of completely fake five star reviews, getting his product in the top 10 search results within a week. That's right.  On exceptionally high-volume search results, he got to the top 10 in a week.   The reviews are obviously fake.  The people leaving the reviews have never reviewed any other product except for this guys.  They all left over-the-top, gushing reviews about how the freaking product ""changed their life.""  Each left pictures and videos.  Me and a friend traced back all of the accounts, and believe we mapped out a pretty decent network of sellers that work together creating fake accounts and leaving fake reviews.  The evidence is strong.  So we reported them to Amazon.  Two months ago.  Nothing has happened. Our sales have suffered.  This practice is in direct violation of Amazons terms, but they don't seem to have any interest in enforcing their own rules.  I've read that Amazon is going to bring a lawsuit against these types of buyers/sellers, but I'll believe it when I see it.  Is there any sort of legal action we legal sellers can take against the illegal sellers?  I believe that leaving fake reviews is in violation of some federal laws, is that correct?  Can we report them to a federal agency?  Can I have a lawyer write up some scary-sounding/threatening letter?  What are my options?  I am in the US.  Thanks you."	Yes
I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52). They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month. Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month. On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym). I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months. The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer. Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes. I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!	Yes
Hi all, 18 year old from GA. I made a paypal when I was under 18, roughly in 2014 so about 15 years old when I made it. Lied about DOB, did NOT attach SSN to the paypal, and attached my debit card when I was maybe 17. My dad just sent me something saying that paypal can seize funds of accounts made by minors, but I have no money in my account, only on my debit card, and I never put my social into the paypal account. Could paypal take the money from my bank for being a minor at the time? Anyway my credit could be negatively affected? Should I make a new account? Not really wanting to make a new account, because then I would also have to make a new email and get a new debit card.	Yes
"Link to the last thread: https://np.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6e7o4c/north_carolina_my_apartment_complex_burned_down/  Like you guys said in the last thread, our renters insurance eventually came through to help with claims. They hired ServPro to handle moving what was salvageable and cleaning various items (furniture, clothing, books, etc.). We have filed a claim with State Farm for the items that are not salvageable and they reimbursed us a couple weeks ago.  So here is where we are now:  - ServPro returned furniture that was ""cleaned"" that had dirt and soot all over it. It's obvious that no one ever touched it. - ServPro returned furniture and items that did not belong to us. When we told them about this, they seemed baffled by who it could belong to and took it back. - ServPro returned almost every piece of furniture damaged (including antiques). This isn't cheap Ikea furniture, this is high quality furniture that survived half a dozen moves across the country with no problems. One of the beds won't even assemble anymore. Parts to the bookcases are missing. Every dresser has at least one handle missing. - When we called them to let them know about the damage, they sent someone to take pictures of the dressers and take sample handles so they could have one of their people make matching pieces. It's been a month since they took those and haven't returned them.  - Two months after the fire, they finally delivered the suits and dry cleaning. There are at least two $500 jackets missing that were supposed to be included in the dry cleaning. - They still haven't delivered other missing items we have told them about, and don't seem to have an explanation of where they are.  We've tried being reasonable with ServPro, letting them know about all of the issues as they come up, but this level of incompetence isn't something that can be reasoned with apparently. I'm at the end of my rope in terms of dealing with them. They don't return phone calls, never have answers, and take weeks to get back to us. We called State Farm to see if we could claim the damaged/missing items, but they told us that was an issue we needed to take up with ServPro.  My questions are:  - What are my rights when dealing with this company? Is there any way to move this process along and make them take this issue seriously? - If renters insurance will not cover items missing/damaged via ServPro, and ServPro won't even return basic phone calls, who is responsible? They're both saying that the other has to pay for the items, not them. - It is time to hire a lawyer, and if so, what kind?"	Yes
Hi, I recently had to cancel a long term Airbnb reservation in Bay Area California, because of host breaking the agreement on which we agreed on before reserving midway through my reservation.   Airbnb's case manager handled the issue and it was agreed that I would be refunded for the nights not stayed in the reservation and would be refunded 50% for the nights since which host voided the agreement. The case manager changed my reservation dates accordingly, however, since it was listed as a new reservation, the nightly price was hiked by my host (something I was neither informed about nor agreed to). The case manager also started saying I did not pay for all the dates of the reservation according to the new dates, and hence they will not refund me for them. However, according to the previous receipt and my bank statements I paid for the whole month. I mentioned it to them, but they disregarded this. Every time I try calling them on their phone line, they say they will email me. But their email just repeats what the case manager said.   How do I go about solving the issue. The amount is quite high and as a student I cannot disregard the amount completely. I have all the necessary receipts and statements from the case manager. Thank you.	Yes
So my girlfriend is hosting a large caliber barrel race. The slot were sold for 1000 dollars each. We had to move the race because of a natural disaster in our area, and now some people are asking for refunds. The contract they signed at the beginning said no refunds. Do they have a legal Case because it changed dates? Were really worried as she is a sole proprietor and if anything comes of this, she would have to declare bankruptcy.	Yes
"Hey /r/LA!  About 7 years ago I was the victim of severe identity theft by my mother. The damages included deposits on apartments/houses, various utilities, cell phones, and forged checkbooks. Over the past few years, I have managed to get everything removed except for two instances of legal judgements in which I was named.   One of because my checkbook was used to pay for a rental deposit, and the other was for an electric bill opened in my name.   Everywhere I look, I'm told to get a lawyer. My fiance and I are looking into buying a home and I want to go in with clean credit instead of waiting for this to get removed.   So, my question is this: how can I get this removed myself? If it will be much easier with a lawyer, what kind of lawyer should I be looking for? I have tried searching for ""identity theft"" specialized lawyers, but it takes me no where. I know it sounds dumb, but I don't know what area of law this falls under.   Any help/advice is much appreciated!!"	Yes
"So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.  However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.  My question is, if Steve does not receive the TV (which is seeming incredibly likely) is there ANYTHING I can do legally? Is theft by deception even a crime in PA? I don't know if Jay and Sean are their real names even, but I have ""Sean""'s phone number and the text message where it was laid out that we were meeting up to exchange the money for the TV. And they can obviously check to see that Steve has not received the TV in the jail. It's just extra complicated bc everything between Jay and Steve and Steve and I was verbal obviously."	Yes
Hello,  The company I am having issues with are holding my account that I have them under certain restrictions (one of which is quite serious, money related) due to a claim of theirs to which I do not agree. They want to video interview me over the internet. Not sure why they wanted to do that but there is no such thing explicitly written in their ToS. I find this rather intrusive regarding my privacy, not to mention unprofessional and quite barbaric. And no, there have been no reports of any sort of fraudulent activity on my account that I know of, my track of record is excellent there, and they have already verified my account about 8 years ago. The company is based in California, USA, I am based in the EU, Romania.  Are there any USA / EU / international laws protecting my privacy over the internet that I could enforce upon them ? Do I stand a fair chance of winning such a lawsuit ?  Thank you	Yes
Hello, My mom had a bill from her dentist which was sent to collections. The dentist told her she would have to pay both the bill and the collections fee. So my mom pay the fee through the collections, but has not received a bill for the fee the dentist hired for collections. Will she receive a notice about this or is everything set? She no longer goes to this dentist.	Yes

"Hi, Not sure if this is the correct subreddit to post, but here's my story.  My mom hears some flipping noise when driving, so she takes her car to firestone tires.(where she bought her tires)  1. Firestone- recognized that 2 tires were recalled, so they replaced 2 tires for free. Problem still persisted.  2. Mobil- So then she takes the car to the gas station the next day and the guy says the problem is the AXLE BOOT and STRUTS. Left side on the front was leaking. They said they would have to replace all 4 axles for total of $780. She says nope too much.  3. Valero- next my mom takes the car to the Valero gas station down the street and repeated everything that just happened, and he said that he will order the front STRUTS(not the entire axle) and get the problem fixed, and he won't do the back ones.  So at the end, he replaced the entire left axle(leaking)(which never told her he was gonna do) and front struts, total $480.   THEN AT THE END, HE SAYS THAT THE PROBLEM WAS THE BACK TIRE WAS THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE. The other used tire in the back was ""feathering"", causing the noise. ($50 problem)  So he misdiagnosed, overcharged, and replaced parts that never needed replacing in the first place.  So tomorrow we are gonna get the original parts as evidence that they were not the problem nor they were damaged.  Also, the receipt invoice does not say anywhere the diagnosis of the problem. He never looked at the car, just did what he felt like basically.   So she wants a refund of her money. Any suggestions??"	Yes
So we sub leased a room and the landlord was only aware that one of us was living there (my gf and i so 2) everyone moved out over the weekend without notice. We were gonna take over the lease then we got kicked out too. And the landlord Said she was given $800 (what we were told our deposit was) from the sub leaser but not told it was for our room.    How should I go about taking it to small claims court when I don't know where he moved to? We signed papers when we first moved in (don't have copies, stupid I know) and the paper said it would be refunded. Also I have a picture of our rent+deposit (cash) in an envelope with our names and date. We have texts from him saying to sign the contracts when we first moved. We just don't have the Craigslist ad that said $800 deposit otherwise we have it all in our favor.   What should we do next?	Yes
Just like the title says, I paid to have a background check and such done and the application fee said non refundable whether we were approved or declined. The owner may not be leaving as planned and the house won't be availiable to rent. they used a service called rentscreener.com. Thanks in advance	Yes
TL;DR: There's an abandoned car in the parking lot at work and my coworkers and I are wondering if it's possible/legal for one of us to take it home.   Background:  I work in a retail store that is next to a body shop. Their parking lot is abysmally small and ours is huge, so we have an agreement that lets them temporarily park cars at the back of our lot when they need to for storage.   About two months ago a car showed up in our lot in the area that the shop usually parks their cars. We didn't think anything of it. A few days ago we asked  the shop owner to move the car, he said it wasn't one that had been given to them to be worked on and they had no information on it at all. It looks like it's been completely abandoned.   The question is, is there a way for one of us to legally take ownership of the car to fix it up and use it? How would we even go about that? We're in Texas in case I have to put it in the body of the post.	Yes
"Long story short, an old room mate broke his leg, couldn't pay rent so he lived for free for a long time, and also managed to break my flatscreen. We notarized a contract stating he will pay x amount of money + 10$ ""each day each payment is not made."" With a total of four scheduled payments this equals out to 40$ a day. We signed this contract back in 2011 and he still has not paid me. Do I really have legal means to take this guy for tens of thousands of dollars? I didn't intend for this to really happen but I'm sick of his shit and I'm pretty sure any lawyer is gonna go for the throat here and I'm just wondering what I can expect. It was stated he was to keep proof of payments and he was to pay me in cash. I have a feeling he might just forge this proof?"	Yes

I paid my roommate, let's call them Blake, the $173.96 owed for my share of our hotel room for a convention through Venmo.  I was told that they did not receive this payment and asked to pay them in cash.  I (accidentally mixing up the amount slightly) paid them $176.93 in cash in front of three of our four other roommates.  I ended up leaving the room after one out of four nights, due to another roommate's hygiene issues; this is unrelated.  After the night I left, I asked for part of the hotel fee I paid back, as I had not stayed the full duration; I received a long, angry text not only denying my request for a partial refund, but also claiming that I should be paying a cancellation fee to Blake and their partner because I had left without consulting them.  After the convention, I contacted Venmo trying to get my initial payment back; they responded telling me that Blake themselves would have to email Venmo, as the payment had gone through.  How do I go about getting back my initial $173.96?	Yes
"This is a long one:   My boyfriend (of 5 years) &amp; I went down to Miami to vacation with my sister and her husband. Our last weekend night there we decided to have a good time. We went to a few dance clubs and met up with 2 friends we had met in our hotel. My sister &amp; her SO decide to leave, but the other 4 of us stay back. After the club closed the one girl calls a Lyft to get us back to our hotel. The lyft driver some how convinced us we needed one more drink and that we should check out this 24/7 strip joint. We're all quite drunk and we're on vacation so we say hell lets do it.   We get there and drinks / entrance everything is so expensive, but non-the-less we decide to stay. I go to the bathroom and when I come out my boyfriend is no where to be found. He's a stand up guy, a hard worker, and never would have gone to this joint had it not been for me (oops). Anyways, I'm frantically looking for him, but this place is HUGE with multiple stories and various rooms, I cannot find him for a good half hour. Finally I see a stripper walking him somewhere while holding his hand. I run up to them and say what in the world is going on. Anyways, I bolt out, he tried to run after me, but I leave the club. Not thinking clearly, I'm drunk, hes totally wasted, &amp;  also it is 7am. He runs after me but I'm already in my own Lyft going to the hotel.   I finally crash, but wake up around 10 am realizing he never came in. My heart drops, he could be anywhere or dead! I call and text yet get no reply (only to find out that the club had seen all my calls and put his phone on do not disturb!!). I try to call the club (which like I said was 24/7) yet all I could get was automated message saying ""all circuits are busy please try your call again later"". I decide to go back and look for him because the alcohol has faded away and I genuinely was worried for his safety. I get there around 1030/11 am and see him completely passed out face down on a couch, hes not even remotely conscious. He should have never even been served anymore alcohol! The manager and a worker try to give him water but hes just slumped over and cannot even open his eyes. The manager told me he spent 2k on a private room and that he signed off  on it. The poor guy couldn't even spell his name, let alone sign off on anything. He has absolutely zero recollection of what happened and we're an honest couple so he would tell me the truth. I take him back to the hotel room and he passes out until 7pm that evening.  Once he wakes up we try to piece together what happened and decide to enjoy our last evening since its our last night. 2k is a lot of money, but it wasn't the end up the world.  This all happened between 7am-1030am on Sunday morning. Flash forward to Wednesday, and we find that multiple cards have been charged for a total of  over 7k!!! Plus cash was taken out from his bank account. There are no receipts proving anything, and the manager himself had said it was only 2k he spent. We called our credit cards and filled them in so they're going to do an investigation, but we have no idea where to go from here. I called the club and they won't do anything until we sign off on a form, which we don't feel comfortable doing because they obviously are scammers. We've since found this place has reviews online that similar things have happened to many other people. Some people claim they may have even been drugged, which honestly he very well could have been. I've never in 5 years have seem him in the state he was in when I went to pick him up that morning. It was pretty terrifying.  It seems to us after talking things over, that he was absolutely taken advantage of, and quite frankly robbed. This club is well known, so they must have video footage. With me being a witness picking him up I feel we may have some grounds to stand on to get at least SOME money back. We're just nervous to move anything forward, because from what it sounds this club has done some very shady things in the past.  We're just looking for any and all legal advice anyone can give.  What are our rights and how should we handle this? Do we contact the police? Should we fill out this affidavit from the strip club? We really have no idea what the protocol is, and no matter what there is no way he signed off on this many charges. They would have needed his signature over 8 times! The manager told me he had only signed once. So how are there this many charges?  The club will not give us any answers, and we're considering going to a lawyer, so we would appreciate any help we could get! Thanks!  TLDR; went to miami, drunkenly go to 24/7 strip club, lose boyfriend (who is 27 &amp; has never went to a strip club before), come back to said club frantically worried at 1030am, find boyfriend passed out on couch totally drugged/intoxicated, manager tells me he spent 2k, yet he was not even coherent enough to tell me his name, come back from vacation and multiple charges have been made on multiple cards for over 7k. We definitely got majorly scammed &amp; taken advantage of. We want to know what we can legally do.   Thanks everyone!   I don't want any negative or rude comments, we already feel bad enough as it is. We never go to strip clubs, and after doing much research I've found this is a common scam, and we're just looking for any guidance."	Yes
Hey Reddit,  I am a Canadian from Ontario who has had their amazon account stolen from them just minutes ago. They managed to also change the email and password before I could react. This individual has made a purchase from my credit card from London UK and I need to resolve this now. The genius who did this changed their shipping address that has a first name attached, their email and the address that their purchase is going to. So I know some decent information about this person (but could all be fake). I already called amazon.ca support and they took down my information about the incident including my name, email, the order code that had been sent to my email and my number.   What else do I need to do?   Thanks in advanced,  ET	Yes
In the fall of 2015 I found myself in a situation where I needed to get a new car. The car that I had been driving needed so much work done to it, that for me it wasn’t worth fixing. At the time I was also taking care of medical bills that had piled up while I was out of work the previous year, and my credit wasn’t in the place it is now, so I couldn’t get approved for a loan myself. My girlfriend at the time offered to take a car loan out in her name that I would make the payments on. At the time there was no signed agreement between her and I made regarding me making the payments, and my name wasn’t on the car loan whatsoever. I was only an insured driver on her policy, something she did to make her own insurance less expensive, while also making it easier on me. I drove the car and made the payments on time every month for a year, until September of 2016.   Long story short, she was unhappy in the relationship and suggested I move out, which lead to us ultimately breaking up very shortly after I moved out. Of course, this resulted in me returning the car to her. She decided to sell the car at a loss very quickly so she didn’t have to deal with it, while making me feel as though I had to reimburse her for the money she lost on the sale. She drafted up an agreement at the time, saying the amount that I owed her, with a payment plan. Having been completely blindsided by her request to me move out, I wasn’t in a clear headspace and very depressed. I was out of the apartment that I had lived in for two years, she kept both of our cats that we had (one of which was MY LIFE), and I had no car.   For reasons I can’t explain now, I felt obligated to agree to and sign her agreement. I have begrudgingly sent her a check for $200 every month for the past 14 months, all the while thinking the agreement that we have is unfair. I’ve done some research on signed agreements, and feel as though hers has holes in it, but am not sure. The agreement doesn’t detail what the money is for. The agreement provides an address that I am to send the payment to, but that has changed since the agreement began. (One of the bullet points on the agreement state “Any modifications to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.”) I don’t feel like I’m legally obligated to pay her back for a car she sold that didn’t have my name anywhere on it, especially since there was no signed agreement in the beginning, when I originally got the car.    I have a copy of the agreement, and can retype (changing names) and send as a PM.	Yes
Hi I I'm located in BC, Canada and my mom recently passed away, she was in charge of cash fund that was disbursed to members of a group, every two weeks each member would place x amount of dollars into the pot and every two week someone from the group would claim the pot. Each member could claim the pot once during the duration but would have to continue contributing to it till each member has collected.  Luckily I have all the details of the pot and what goes funds go where and to who, what I want to do is protect myself and her estate in the event someone claims that payment was not made to them after I disburse the funds. Is there a document that I can use that would be legally binding, I plan to have witnesses with me when payments are made.  I really do appreciate any help and thanks for taking the time to read this, have a great day.	Yes
"So this is a long story but I'll try to condense it. The realtor I want to sell the house with recommended this ""contractor"" she found on Home Advisor. I presumed that she had worked with him before but she just saw his ratings and contacted him. (I needed a contractor because the previous tenants damaged the house significantly.)   Anyway he comes over and gives us an estimate of costs and I sign a contract indicating costs and a timeline for completion. Everything is going fine (I check up on his progress weekly) and he is repairing minor problems like repainting the walls and clearing debris until he contacts me telling me there was a problem with a pipe in the bathroom and water flooded the surrounding area. He insists that he never actually went into the bathroom and the flooding is a problem I never notified him about. I insist that he has been to the bathroom and inspected it before and he denies (even though my realtor confirms that the contractor inspected the bathroom multiple times before with the realtor present). He then storms out without issuing a refund for work he has not completed (paid in advance) and he has not returned the key I gave him.   Furthermore, he did a terrible paint job (didn't use primer so the walls are chipping apart or a cover sheet for the wooden floors so now the wood is stained with paint).   We have contacted Home Advisor but they insist because he has at least a 3 star rating they cannot remove him from their website.   What is the best way to pursue legal action?   TLDR; Contractor ruined house, got paid for work he did not do, and HomeAdvisor won't do anything to help."	Yes
Hi all, first time posting here. I ordered a dress at an Alfred Angelo store a couple of weeks ago, which went bankrupt and the location I went to closed its doors yesterday with no warning. I ordered it with my debit card. Legally, can I get my money back? Will my bank refund it back to me? Let me know if other details are needed about the store etc and I'll try to find them. Thanks in advance!	Yes
We live in North Dakota. My mother has been married for about two years. Shortly after marriage he starting showing his true personality. In any event, they've decided to get a divorce.   My mother doesn't make much money and definitely not enough to consult with an attorney. Since they've been married they bought a house (down payment from his retirement money), which he took out a second mortgage out on to pay off his credit card debt. My mother has about 10k in medical bills which they didn't touch. He now says he has someone coming buy to look at the house and try to sell it. She'd ideally like to keep the house.   He also helped buy her a car but they never transferred it into her name and he's threatening to take it away from her.   His exact finances aren't known as he won't share them.  What is the best course of action going forward?	Yes
Bought a car with my ex about 6 years ago. Was on and off with payments most of the time. My Ex leaves me and leaves me with the car and no way to contact her. About 3 years ago they took it back. Then said we still owed over 6,000. I never responded or made any attempt to pay for that as I no longer had a way to get around. Costing me more money to live. If I could have afforded to I would gladly pay for my mistake. Still don't have a car and still too poor to do anything about it right now with a 2yr old to watch. Not to mention the 30 minute drive to his babysitter. I got issued some legal paperwork from the local official, was wondering what the chances of getting the bill split between the two parties is, and basically what to expect in a worst case best case format.	Yes
Backstory: My girlfriend and I just moved from CT to AZ for her work and my school. We agreed to use a moving company to transport our belongings to AZ. We contracted Radius Moving and Storage Corp for approximately $3200 based on assumed square footage of boxes. We agreed to the date of 6/25 at 0900-1100 arrival time for pick up of boxes that we packed. Radius did a no call no show. I attempted to reach out to them via a number on their website once they were late. Neither my girlfriend or I could reach someone until around 3 hours past their designated time slot. This individual informed us that they don't know what happened to the first truck so they were going to send another truck with an ETA of 1600-1800. 1800 comes and goes, once again we try to reach out to them and get the same no pick up or direct to voice mail treatment we were exposed to the first time around. Around 2000 we finally get ahold of someone. He said that the 2nd truck was involved in an accident. While unfortunate this still leaves us without a moving truck. After a lengthy back and forth conversation the individual said he would get us a truck for 0700-0900 time slot tomorrow (6/26). I get up around 0630 to ensure everything is lined up for their arrival. 0900 comes and goes no call no show. The next couple hours are filled with the same phone call avoidance and general neglect for our situation that we had become accustom to. Finally around 1300 a car and truck arrive to pack up our things. They left around 1630 with our things.   The overall treatment of company and the lack of professionalism in their response and customer service was deplorable. I was in the military for 9+ years and moved a bunch of times, i had never received this kind of treatment. Due to this and the fact that they were over 30 hrs late past our agreed time, my girlfriend and I believed we should get some money off of the final cost of the move (4300$). They said that 100$ should suffice, which is a slap in the face. Over the last couple weeks my girlfriend has been on the phone with them every day to try and track down our stuff which hasn't even left CT. Reading through their contract it says they can take up to 30 working days to deliver our things. Which is same time then it takes to get household good delivered from Hawaii to NY. After all this we asked for more money off. They told us that since we had written a negative review of them on the internet they would not give us any additional money off. We had not written anything yet which means we are not an isolated incident. As such they said they would give us 300$ off but we had to sign a contract prior to receiving the money.     The question: How is the below contract even legal? What can be done legally to this company? We are already planning on writing up a formal complaint with the BBB.    It feels like this is blackmail to ensure we don't write a scathing review of their practices.          RELEASE AND FINAL SETTLEMENT OF CLAIM  Date:    07/11/2017                                                                                         Job#:XXXXXXXXX    Upon receipt by the undersigned of a check for consideration of the undersigned or his agent heirs, administrators, executors, successors, and assigns here and completely release and further discharge Radius Moving and Storage, it’s past, present or future officers, directors, stock holders, agents, representatives, employees, affiliates, partner(s) and successors from any and all past, present or future claims, demands, obligations, actions, rights, damage costs, expenses and compensation of any nature whatsoever, whether based on tort, contract or other theory of recovery, which undersigned or anyone entitled to any recovery, now has or which may hereafter accrue or otherwise be required on account of, or in anyway going out of the contract for services rendered and entered into between the parties named here within.

"Hi! I love in Ontario, Canada and I have an uber problem.   I took an uber Friday night from a vet clinic where I was picking up the cat I am fostering. He was in a a carrier that was a solid plastic base. I've had it for a few years and my sister had it forever before that and its always been a sturdy carrier.   Everything in the ride went fine, and the driver was even asking me about the cat, who was asleep as he had just been neutered. Today, I went to check my bank balance and noticed it was way lower than expected. And bam, there it  is was, a 150$ charge from uber. Separate fom the 17$ charge for the ride. Turns out they are claiming the cat peed in the car??   Now, my actual cat has peed in the car in this carrier before (he hates car rides) and it's never leaked. And I'm talking, he SOAKED this carrier. Flooded it. But this cat, who was sleeping, has a white tummy, and had just been spayed, came out of the carrier dry. No smell, nothing IN the carrier. There is no way he peed in there. The pictures (https://m.imgur.com/kvtg61X) they sent absolutely look like the guy flicked water on his seat. Uber's response is just ""We believe him so too bad!"" And they haven't responded to requests for any kind of cleaning bill.  Am I just out 150$ ?"	Yes
So I recently purchased a mobile home. I confirmed with the owners of the park that it could stay there.  Well after paying the application fee (which is still pending) I was told I was denied and had two days to move the home or they'll tow it and charge me, unless I pay them $1500 (which so happens to be the previous owners past due amount)   They also went on to say I was denied due to the previous owner. I've never met the woman before buying the house.  Is this legal, what can I do?   I have a gut feeling they're going to tow the house away regardless if I pay them.   The lot manager even went on to say that I couldn't afford the $1500 and that even if I do pay it I'll most likely be evicted anyways	Yes
"The branch was closed. I called them while I was still at the ATM to try to get the solution going. She told me 10 business days and I'll just see the money posted. I went into the bank first thing next morning and they told me that they have nothing to do with the ATMs outside and if I did it inside, they could help me. (COOL BECAUSE EVERY TIME I DO, SOMEONE SAYS ""Hey, you know you can just do this at an ATM, right?"")   One week later, I called on Monday. There was no history of my situation AT ALL recorded. The problem has not been researched, so I was told it would be escalated and that the latest I'll see it posted if Friday. Hi. Tuesday. Turns out the escalation team needed the info on which ATM and the requested it from me VIA MAIL. I told EVERYONE I'VE TALKED TO (3 different teams of an associate&amp;manager) it. But the person putting it in my costumer notes FORGOT A FUCKING LETTER. I was even told at one point my check was shredded and I need to get a new one.  I guess what I'm looking for is.. there can't be ANY way that this is okay. How can they just take my check, shred it, and spit out a small receipt that says sorry with a costumer service number on it and tell me that I just have to get a new one a week later.  How is this okay? Do I have any options here because they've basically been forcing me to live without my food money for over two weeks and I can't believe that they have no re precautions"	Yes
I am looking for advice on how to proceed with my outstanding debts from the last decade or so, and have not found a good place to get advice so figured I would try here since Credit Counselors only want to run your credit report and clean that up for you...my questions go back further than that.  So, I have been on the run from my debts for about 10 years.  Most of my debt has fallen off of my credit report, but I have a lot of money (for me...I would guess about $15-20K) still owed on these accounts that are no longer on my credit report and sold to various collection agencies.  I have moved multiple times and avoided requesting credit unless absolutely necessary (utilities, etc) to try and fall off the collection radar.  I never intended on getting credit again or buying a house, was young, and needless to say lacking foresight.  Now, it's 10 years since I ran from my debt, I have been married a few years to a woman who had a mortgage already.  We applied for a credit card 3 years ago and got approved.  It makes me nervous to have credit, and we have already managed to get ourselves into 4k worth of debt in just a few years.  We collectively also owe about 3K to the IRS we are paying off in installments as a result of our witholding being wrong for a few years but not being able to afford to correct the error.  We are no longer being undertaxed so we should work out closer to 0 this year and not go further into debt to the IRS.  My wife would like to look at selling our house and moving closer to work, but we don't qualify for good interest rates unless my income is included, but I have dings on my credit report and I don't end up helping.  I am nervous because I feel once I get assets on paper, someone might get the idea to accumulate my debt and sue me for the full amount once I have something worth taking like a house.  As of now, the house is in my wife's name.  Bottom line, what is my recourse for these old debts?  How should I go about getting them taken care of?  Is bankruptcy an option, can I do it individually, or would I take my wife down with me?  Credit counseling only wants to talk about what's on my credit report and can't answer anything about these old debts, and I would like to find out how these old demons will affect my future.    Any advice anyone has for me would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
"I happened to stumble upon an interesting situation the other day. Of course, we all know that a Representative working for a said company while speaking understand that any call they are on whether outbound on inbound is recorded and they agree to the recording through employment. While the customer understands and agrees to the recording as calling the Call Center with a message stating the recording.   Say that the customer gets the Representative; which we will place both the Call Center and the Customer within The state of Maryland. The customer then before the conversations starts he allows the representative to know that the call is being recorded for their personal use (Most likely just in case any wrong information is given, info about the account, and for their safety). Yet, the call center Representative states they do not authorize the recording from the customer and disconnects or will disconnect the call if he plans to keep recording the call ""because in the state of Maryland each person(s) has to agree to the recording for it to be valid'.  How are they able to deny a recording of a call or conversation when their job is literally always recording them and both parties agreed to the original knowledge of the call being recorded."	Yes
Should I get a lawyer for this? Is it expensive?  Can I handle it on my own?  I have the letter they sent me with the offer, is that enough or do I need to ask them for a contract of some kind?  I heard the forgiven part of the debt counts as income for taxe purposes.  Is that true.  My debt is about 22k, they are offering a 10% settlement.  I looked at lawyers in the area but all the financial ones I found were bankruptcy  / credit card debt lawyers.  I didn't find anything about student loans.  Please help.  I have about a week to figure this out before I am out of town.	Yes
So I purchased a monitor in January and never opened it till this week since I was so busy with looking for a job, family members getting married and graduating. Online they advertised that the monitor is 60HZ but when i was calibrating my monitor it said that it was 50HZ.  Im not looking to sue. I just want a simple refund so i can buy another one.	Yes
"Ontario, Canada  My husband and I bought a new car in March. It was a showroom demo, so it was last year's model and had 10k on it. The manufacturer rebates let us upgrade to a nicer model because it had those kilometers on it.   At the beginning of May, we brought it in and told them it was leaking from the arm on the driver's side. They tried to say oh maybe the door wasn't shut right. I insisted they look anyways and once they pulled the interior plastic off and put the hose to it, it was like a sprinkler. They ended up pulling off the windshield and reseating it in new seals. At that point I paid nothing because of the warranty.  Now here we are over two months later. We've had a bad smell in the car for about a week. Took a few days to get into the dealer's shop. Asked them to do the free full inspection we got at 3 months owning the car and try to find the smell.  Turns out the back seat floor carpet (we are very very rarely in the backseat as it's just the two of us) is soaking wet and growing mold.   It's been raining a ton here lately, and we're both anal about closing windows since water in car = bad and nobody likes a wet butt. A couple weeks back it was raining so hard people were pulling over from low visibility, and we thought we heard water in the car but assumed it was splashing in the wheel well.   When the dealer service guy called back he told me this, said I had to have left a window open, and that I'd need to get the car detailed to ditch the smell.   I explained while it's not impossible that we left a window open, it's very unlikely, and our car had an established history of fucking leaking water inside. The guy repeated what he said and told us our car could be picked up. I hung up with him and called back to speak to the manager in service.   I told the manager I was beyond frustrated because we bought new specifically to avoid things like this. If we were gonna dump this much money into a car every year instead of it being a 13 year old junker trying to stay driving might as well buy new. I explained I didn't like being told it's my fault too bad, same as last time when I was told I must have ""shut the door wrong"" and it was a leak. That I suspect it's a leak again. That I don't want to come back for ""oop third time's the charm found all the leaks"". Service Manager laughed and said he doesn't want me in again unless it's routine service.   At this point the manager is sending it to a body shop owned by a good guy who my family sends all our business too, and I called him and he'll have his guys go through the car top to bottom to make sure everything is sealed right.   I'm very concerned about damage to the car. It's not even 4 months old.   1. At what point is the car a ""lemon"" and does that kind of thing even apply here?   2. What happens if the floor boards are rusted from the wet carpet for so many weeks (and who knows how long before that? Last summer when the sales guy drove it around?)  3. What happens if I keep finding leaks for all eternity?   4. What steps should I take to resolve this if things aren't being fixed? Like dealer/owner first, then corporate, then lawyer? My insurance? The warranty people?   This is our first time owning a brand new car that won't end up being sold to a scrapper for finally dying down. Please help. I'm lost and angry and not sure where to go next while I wait for the verdict from the body shop."	Yes
Hi Reddit Law,  My dad is a contractor and recently finished tile work on a new house. The owner did not want to pay the balance and my father threatened to break the tiles throughout the house with a hammer. My gut is that this isn't legal but I'm not really sure, it is his tiles and setting materials after all and this guy hasn't paid.	Yes
"Hey, r/legaladvice. First time posting here, thanks in advance for responses and sorry in advance if I'm breaking rules.   My problem is outlined below. My question really boils down to, what can I do about this?  Begin  *****  A couple of my friends have birthdays around the same time and decided that, to celebrate, we should get a group together and go on a sweet looking 90s booze cruise. Tickets were ~$65 and about 15 of us bought ticket, likely in addition to others. I will call the event company that was putting on the cruise EC for short and anonymity. EC sold the tickets through a separate company I will call TC for ticket company. The cruise was scheduled for the night of May 19th, and we bought tickets at least a week in advance. I personally bought 2 tickets.  The day of May 19th comes. It is hours before the planned starting time of the cruise, and I receive the following e-mail from TC on behalf of EC:  &gt; San Diego, &gt; &gt;We are having to postpone tonight's event due to a cancellation of the artist we had planned for you all tonight. we are sorry for the inconvenience. The new date will be on Saturday, July 29. Everyone's tickets for todays event will give you entry to July's event. If you have any questions or concerns or want to inquire about a refund then please contact us at [e-mail address for EC] &gt; &gt;Thank You  I immediately requested a refund, as did many of my friends. On May 21st, I received the following message (again from TC on behalf of 90s EC):  &gt;San Diego, &gt; &gt;People who requested refunds we have received your emails and please allow 5-7 business days to see it back in your account. &gt; &gt;Cheers!  I never got the refund, and most of my friends did not (though one did, strangely). On June 15th I contacted TC support saying:  &gt;Hello, &gt; &gt;I purchased tickets to the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for Friday, May 19th 2017. The day of the event of the cruise an e-mail was sent out informing me and the other customers the cruise was cancelled due to an artist cancellation and will be rescheduled. I requested a refund and was told via a mass e-mail that all refunds would be credited with 5-7 business days. It has been much longer than this time and a refund has not been credited. Friends of mine corroborate this. &gt; &gt;Promptly refund all tickets. Personally, I purchased two and should see a refund in the amount of $131.66 &gt; &gt;[My Name]  TC responded saying:  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;Thanks for reaching out. &gt; &gt;Funds from ticket sales are held for 48 hours after the end of an event to allow time for buyers to dispute the charges. After 48 hours, the funds are paid out to the organizer and any refund requests must be processed by them outside of Universe. Although the organizers seem to have promised refunds, they did not issue those refunds at that time, nor did they reach out to us to issue them on their behalf. &gt; &gt;We have reached out to the organizers of this event to attempt to come to a reasonable solution to issue refunds on the event that was re-scheduled, however, they have not cooperated. Unfortunately as Universe no longer holds the funds for this event, all refund requests must be directed to the organizers of the event who can issue refunds at their discretion. They can be reached at [EC email address] &gt; &gt;We sincerely apologize for this inconvenience. &gt; &gt;Cheers, &gt;[EC name] Support  I responded to Universe saying:  &gt;Thank you for the info. Can you please send more contact info for the event managers? Phone number, company name, persons involved, etc.?  I also forwarded my exchange with TC to the contact email for EC and said the following, which they did not respond to:  &gt;Hi [EC name], &gt; &gt;Please see the message below regarding the San Diego Booze Cruise which was scheduled for, and canceled, last May. (Insert exchange with TC here) &gt; &gt;I am wondering why refunds have not been credited as promised? Please refund the tickets. &gt; &gt;Thank you,  I then sent TC this email before receiving a reply from my previous e mail:  &gt;Additionally, your service rules make the following points that sellers cannot (taken verbatim from contract on TC website): &gt; &gt;(7) offer, as a Seller, any items that you do not yourself own or have permission to rent (without limiting the foregoing, you will not list items as a Seller if you are serving in the capacity of a broker, rental agent or listing agent for a third party); &gt; &gt;(10) impersonate any person or entity, or falsify or otherwise misrepresent yourself or your affiliation with any person or entity; &gt; &gt;(13) as a Seller, submit any Listing with a false or misleading price information, or submit any Listing with a price, service or activity that you do not intend to honor. &gt; &gt;These terms are in question of being violated based on the way 90s booze cruise handled the event. There is no evidence they had owned or had permission to rent the service they offered. The fact that they canceled the event hours before the time is highly suspicious and suggestive that they never intended to honor their service. If either of the above is true, it follows that they misrepresented themselves and their affiliation with artists and vendors. &gt; &gt;I trust there will be proper due diligence with regards to these potential breaches of contract and that appropriate legal action will be taken if necessary. &gt; &gt;Please inform me how you plan to proceed.  I received no reply to this as well.  I disputed my charge for the tickets through my credit card and was promptly refunded. While my desire for justice was left unserved, and some of my friends never got their money back, I got my mine back and decided to put the matter to rest. However, I was surprised to get the following e-mail from TC this morning (July 17):  &gt;Hi [My Name], &gt; &gt;We are writing regarding the dispute for $130.00 USD charge to your card ending in XXXX on Monday, July 17, 2017. &gt; &gt;The charge was for 2 tickets to the 90s Booze Cruise- San Diego event. &gt; &gt;The organizer of this event, EC, uses TC to sell their tickets. The event took place on Friday, May 19, 2017. We have attached your tickets and receipt here. &gt; &gt;Please call the number on the back of your card to let your bank know that you understand what this charge is for and reply to let us know when you have done so. &gt; &gt;Best Regards, &gt; &gt;TC Support  I responded with the following lengthy message. My response includes a consolidation of all the communication between myself and Universe, so I have not included that since it has already been posted above. My response:  &gt;Dear TC, &gt; &gt;You are mistaken. &gt; &gt;This event did **not** take place on May 19, 2017. This event was **planned** for that day, however, it was canceled only hours before it was **planned** to start. &gt; &gt;*(Here I copy and paste the messages from Universe regarding the event being cancelled and then the promise to refund tickets).* &gt; &gt;I never received the promised refund, so I followed up with TC support to obtain it as it was promised. This exchange between myself and Universe can be summarized as follows: &gt; &gt;*I asked TC for a refund due to the cancellation and unfulfilled promise for a refund; &gt;*I was told funds were released to 90sbooze cruise and I had to ask them directly; &gt;*I attempted to contact EC and received no reply; &gt;*I provided evidence to TC that EC breached their contract with Universe on multiple grounds and *requested legal action be taken to hold them accountable for what appears to be a scam. This final request received no response from Universe. &gt; &gt;**Here is the full exchange** *(copy/paste of full exchange between myself and TC here)* &gt; &gt;**(end exchange)** &gt; &gt;Now that I have cleared up the apparent lack of communication between departments in your company, I'm sure you understand why I disputed the charge and that I will not be calling my bank. I have already explained to them this situation and they readily agreed to reverse the charge, standard practice when a purchased service has been grossly misrepresented and not rendered.  &gt; &gt;So rather than *me* call *my* bank and explain what the charge is for (I know what the charge is for better than you do, apparently), I suggest *you* call 90s booze cruise and explain to them that the contract they signed with *you* has been violated and that they need to issue refunds to **everyone** who asked for one. If they don't, then *you* should contact your lawyer (or acquire one if you do not have one) since your contract has been broken.   As all evidence points to this ""event"" being a pre-conceived scam, taking the above actions will show that you are not a co-conspirator with 90s booze cruise in what amounts to false marketing and, quite frankly, stealing. Failing to take action (as you did on my last request) shows you are either woefully incompetent, unfortunately apathetic, or outright criminal.   Please take action as I've outlined above, **and reply to let us (us being myself and all other ticket purchases) when you have done so.**  **Best regards,** --  [My Name]  **P.S. Can you confirm that the event has been successfully rescheduled for Saturday, July 29th? If so, please send me all relevant event info.**  **P.P.S. To remedy the lack of communication between departments of your company, might I recommend slack messaging?**   *****  As of now I am awaiting a reply though I expect there will be none. Can anything be done about this? Part of the issue, I believe, is 90s booze cruise is shrouded in mystery. All I have is the e-mail address provided through Universe. I do not know where they are based (I think NY) or have any real contact information, nor, can I connect an actual human to the company. I suspect this is on purpose. It does appear they have advertised this event elsewhere. I am not sure if they followed through with it in these other locations or if it is a systematic scam in multiple locales.   *edit: concealed identifying information and formatting*"	Yes
The situation is my sister was enrolled in a dual enrollment high school program at a local university where she went and lived on campus to take classes. My parents were not involved in any of the application or enrollment process and neither saw nor signed any paperwork. For context, She is not on good terms with my parents and has a long history of behavioral issues. They weren't really told anything about this program.  My sister told my parents when asked about how she would pay that she had money saved from working at Starbucks and had taken a student loan.  My parents later found out that there was in fact no loan or money and that the huge tuition bill was due. My sister is 17 (18 in two months) and is still technically a minor.  The university is making lots of threats to my parents if they don't pay. However, they never knew about any of this or signed any paperwork to make them liable for a $10,000+ bill.   Legally, can the school come after my parents for this?	Yes
I bought a house. I was aware of small amounts of termite damage. Easily fixable. I start removing siding and find that almost half the house is eaten away.  There has been a bond on the house since 1998. The previous owners treated in 2013. They also did an extensive remodel. I pulled down sheet rock with manufacture dates right before they put the house on the market.  There is also damage where the house leaks every time it rains. The sheet rock covered up the termite damage and the leaking damage. It is very obvious that they new there were covering it up. Can I sue? I am up to 45k in repairs as of now.	Yes
"* Answered an ad on social media that offered paint correction on vehicles. The guy had ample pictures of his work(or so I thought lol) etc.  * Well he gets the car &amp; proceeds to paint it with what's looks to be a paint brush &amp; a roller. He lays the paint that looks to be house paint on so thick it never completely dried. Rendering all sorts of debris embedded, including I kid you not a butterfly stuck to the hood not unlike a hood ornament lol. There were gobs of paint on the glass, floor carpeting &amp; the chrome work.  * I contacted him several times afterwards only to get a run around &amp; he finally deleted all of his social media pages. He's also an active duty marine, so I don't know if they have a different/ faster venue other than small claims court.  * I had the car repaired &amp; the negligent work ended up costing me double what it would have prior to the botched work. I have an itemized invoice from the body shop detailing the flawed repair as well as ample pics.  * I'm seeking the money it cost me to rectify the damage caused by the improper repair. Should I file for ""Money Owed"" or ""Property Damage"".  * Thanks in advance"	Yes
Throw away account used as precautionary measure.  **Short version**  Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.  **Long version**  My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have.   Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.  When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.  There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.  The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.  The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.  This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.  I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.  Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.  Any thoughts are appreciated.	Yes
I need some help here. (All events/transactions occurred in CA where I am also living with a valid CA address.)  I purchased a new car on 5/27/17. My credit is poor but my income is high so I qualified for a loan with a high down payment and a trade in. After being approved, I worked a better deal with the dealership to simply put more money down and not use the trade in. We agreed, signed all the paperwork, I drove off the lot with a brand new car.  My first payment is due 7/11/17. I've been trying for the last few days to enroll online and pay my loan but had no luck. Kind of panicked, I emailed my dealership for some help and then called the financeer who tells me that I have two loan open - one that's expired and one that's declined.  I called the dealership immediately who tell me, 'We've been trying to get a hold of you, we need the car back immediately. The financeer sent back the contract when the trade-in was pulled from the table. Bring the car back today or tomorrow. By boss just told me about this this weekend and said we need to get the car back from you.'  I responded with, 'No one has attempted to contact me about this. I have emails from my salesperson asking me how my car is over the last few weeks but no emails, calls, texts, or postal mail regarding the contract or financing. I will not turn in the car until I speak with the Director of Finance.'  They told me the Director will be in in the morning and will call me first thing.  I'm not really sure what to do here. This happened to me last year when trying to purchase a new Mazda and that dealership had mailed certified letter rescinding the contract on the 10th day so I was obligated to return the car. Need some help.  tl;dr - Dealership could not find financing 30 days after signing the contract and is asking for the car to be returned. Do I have any rights?	Yes
I purchased season tickets for a local team prior to the season. I signed a form that stated that the deposit was non-refundable and that I would make monthly payments towards my season tickets.  Fallen on tough times and can no longer afford. The team is telling me I cannot refund my tickets, but there was no stated policy that included refunds or cancellations. The season doesn't start until October.  I looked online and found that merchants have to give a refund after 30 days with no mentioned policy after a transaction is made...but technically I haven't received the these tickets since the season hasn't started.  I started making payments back in April and they go to September 1. I have paid almost $1000 thus far.   Any other questions welcome.	Yes
"As the title says, my roommates and I are being sued by a former landlord to the tune of roughly $7500 after a tenancy that stretched from 2014 until April of 2017. The bulk of the charges come from painting ($3000) and carpeting ($3200). In addition to these charges there are $600 in damages that they are attempting to charge us for that appear on the initial commencement checklist as being previously damaged, signed in 2014 at the outset of the lease. They are also suing us for their attorney's fees; one of my biggest questions regarding the issue is if they are allowed to do this and if so is there a limit to the amount we can be held liable for?  There are some damages we do not contest, such as wall dings, scratches, and a broken kitchen drawer, however, we assert that the ""damage"" to the paint and carpet was normal wear and tear over the course of a 3 year lease. Some of the paint in the home at lease origination was noted as ""freshly painted"", while other rooms were not. The carpets were dirty at the time of lease inception and one of the tenant's parents rented a carpet cleaner and cleaned them before they moved in, it is our belief that the carpets in the home may be original to the home (built 1997), but we do not know for sure.  After we moved out of the home the landlords fully re-painted and re-carpeted the entire house and have since sold it. It is our belief that they are attempting to leverage our security deposit and other alleged damages to offset the costs of their renovation of the property.   Ultimately, the main questions I have regarding our case are whether or not the life expectancy of the paint and carpeting was exceeded by the term of the lease and whether or not we are liable for their attorney fees should we choose to go to court. Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated!"	Yes
"I have a fairly high end computer (custom built) that was a few years old.   Recently I started having lots of issues with it and upon further troubleshooting/inspection noticed some of the modular connections on my power supply were melted.  Oddly enough the machine continued to limp along until I made this discovery.  The power supply is a ""high end"" 1000W and had a 5 year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. Was a fairly painless transaction.  My issues persisted even with the new power supply (instability, etc)   I tried my ram sticks one at a time and the issue continued with all four and so I figured my motherboard had been damaged (in hindsight i should have bought all new ram at the same time)  Being a high end X99 platform it made sense to just replace the motherboard as any kind of an upgrade would be very expensive and not much gain to me as I just use it for office/IT tech work and gaming.  The replacement motherboard did not fix the issue so I started to suspect my ram/processor.  I am awaiting a replacement processor from Intel and new ram from amazon.  I have been in contact with a seemingly helpful/friendly person from the PSU company and had originally shipped them my motherboard for further inspection. I have not yet heard back their diagnosis on the motherboard but regardless I will not be using it again.  I emailed them today and explained everything ive done and money it has cost me and i've asked what they can do for me.   If they don't offer a reasonable settlement to this matter is it a good idea to sue them in small claims court? I have spent many hours troubleshooting and dealing with this system including loss of productivity at work from having to use my laptop which is not ideal for IT work.   In hind sight I should have just bought all new components right away after the PSU failure and then tried to work out compensation with them but I opted to try to fix it one part at a time."	Yes
So mom and I bought roundtrip tickets from Kansas City to Fuzhou, China on JustFly.com. Outgoing flights were KC to Seattle to Shanghai to Fuzhou. Return flights were Fuzhou to Beijing to Seattle to KC.    When we arrived in Shanghai, we had to hop on a different, domestic Chinese airline (Juneyao Air) to go to Fuzhou and get another boarding pass. The agent there did not give us any boarding pass since they said that whomever purchased the ticket (JustFly.com) had sent some kind of incorrect ticket/reservation confirmation number and it didn't match any of our passport or visa numbers. We were stuck in Shanghai and were told that the only way to get to Fuzhou was to buy our own separate ticket in China to go to Fuzhou. Which is what we did.   When we were coming back to the US, at the airport in Fuzhou they said that the rest of our reservation was cancelled since we did not take the last leg from Shanghai to Fuzhou. We had to then buy tickets that day to come back to the US...which cost us double what we paid for the entire roundtrip ticket.   Just called JustFly.com now to discuss any possibility of refund (we have receipts in China of flights we bought) and they flat out refused. They said that 1) any missed leg causes rest of the roundtrip to be cancelled....and 2) that if the confirmation # was wrong then we wouldn't have been able to even start our journey.    Any potential recourse? Dispute this with my CC company(Chase?) The roundtrip ticket itself was about $2600 and the way back out of China was over $3000 (about 20,000 Chinese RMB converting to USD currency). So total out 5-6k.  Not sure if it's even worthwhile to see if we can retain legal counsel to sort this out?   Any and all help would be greatly appreciated!	Yes
"I am located in New York.  Long story short, about 9 years ago I ended up damaging someone's property (twice!) as a result of two farming equipment accidents. As a result of it, I agreed to pay them $15K to settle their civil cases against me. We signed and notarized the repayment agreement, in which I was supposed to pay a certain amount per month.  A variety of family problems were present and I really didn't have the money, so the person specifically put into the contract that they could grant me reprieves from the agreed upon payment schedule if necessary, but that they had the right to rescind those reprieves at any time for any reason and have me continue upon the normal payment schedule. Basically, if I didn't have money to pay them in August, they could say don't worry about it pay me in September or something like that. After signing the agreement, I had a variety of unforeseen things happen to me, and the person told me don't worry about paying it back right now. I basically never brought it up to them again, moved and hadn't heard about it since. About two months ago, I received a certified letter in the mail from an attorney stating that ""any abeyance in payment is hereby revoked"" and that payment would be expected the following month at the law firm's address, as well as a copy of the signed contract. Having consulted online resources, I determined that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and that the contract was well over its effective time and ignored the letter. I just got a second letter from him stating that I was now in default of the agreement and they were prepared to ""file an action"" against me in county court and that according to the agreement and that I was responsible for attorney's fees, etc. unless I immediately corrected the default. I still have not responded. Am I right that the statute of limitations in New York is 6 years and thus their agreement is worthless?"	Yes
I moved into an apartment in Florida with a roommate and paid the entire deposit (chalking that one up to a life lesson). Now that we are moving out, I am moving to a separate state and she is simply moving to a smaller apartment in the same complex. Because she is staying, the complex is automatically moving our deposit from the current apartment into her new one, and not cutting any portion in a check.  Both of our names are on the current lease, only her name is on the new lease. Am I just out all this money or do I have any legal grounds to force her to send me half? Is there any way I can force the apartment to send a check instead of simply giving the entire deposit to her?	Yes
So here's the deal, I was dead set on going to an event in the UK at the end of July, now I can't go for several reasons, both economical as well as the fact that I'll be going to a marriage.   I haven't ordered a flight yet, but I did book and pay for a hotel months ago and it was non-refundable, I'm not sure whether or not I should reach out to the hotel and ask for a refund since it's still weeks left and last year, all hotels were pretty much booked full and they can probably still get it back, but in case of a policy against such things, am I doing anything legally wrong if I were to do a chargeback via the bank? The card I paid with isn't eligible any longer also.	Yes
Hello LA, My girlfriend has been really upset by this recent turn of events. Her sister has a criminal background and has been in prison before. Likely, to avoid showing up again for warrants, she used her sisters name (my GF) to avoid a Jay Walking Ticket. Afterwards, she has been placed back in prison for a burglery charge and is currently serving time.  The issue is my GF received the $551 ticket from the tax recovery service because penalties have been acruing since my GF hasn't been served notice of the ticket because the wrong address was used when the Jay Walking citation was issued. How can one get the charges and penalties be taken out of my GF's name and her credit ratings restored? Thank you for any help.	Yes
I recently bought a used Subaru with 118k miles, with the knowledge that a high mileage service need to be performed on it. Before I bought it, I called my local Subaru dealer to see if they had any service info on the specific vehicle. They looked up the VIN and confirmed that they had performed all the work on the car for the past 50k miles. They listed off the past couple years of services that they had done on the car, and nothing major came up, just typical stuff like spark plugs, oil changes, etc. I bought the car, and took it in yesterday to have the service performed, and I get a call from them saying it has a misfire requiring the replacement of the entire valve train, totaling $3,200, in addition to the other service. The mechanic told me that they pulled up the service history, and just a month ago it had been brought in for spark plugs when they diagnosed the misfire. The previous owner traded it in because of that, to an unrelated Ford dealer.  The misfire is in the service history that was not disclosed to me when I checked with them before I purchased it. I'm not sure if the $3,200 quote would be in the history, but I can find out. The call may have been recorded but I don't know where I'd check. Is there anything here that can help me?	Yes
"My family renovated our house using a contractor and his employees and like most do ended up not finishing and wasting a lot of our money. He has broken the contract multiple times, he also did not pay for our very shitty living arrangement we had to pay it ourselves while paying for the work that the contractor was also ""doing"", and did not follow blueprint instructions. Thus we took him to court and the judge was clearly not on our side, the contractor had missed court dates, even his lawyer missed a court date and the judge was completely fine with it he just rescheduled the dates every time. My family did not miss any dates and I'm pretty sure we did not screw anything up. On Friday the judge dismissed our case, that has been going on for more than 2 years. This of course costed us a lot of money with no compensation. Is there any thing else we can do?"	Yes
Hello everyone I'm in a bit of a bind. I called a doctor's office to set up an appointment in January. I made an appointment and they told me I needed a referral. I told them to cancel the appointment and call me when they received the referral. This was all in the same phone conversation.  Here it is 6 months later and after sending two referrals, they never called. I received this bill last week for $50 for a no show appointment. I cancelled that appointment and even if it was still an active appointment there was no reminder call/text/email which I opted for.  So, I call the office and get an answering service. She directs my call to the office manager who does not answer. Her answering machine clearly stated that of the call was for a no show bill to submit in writing. So these people send out these bills so often that she needed to put that on her message. I left her a message stating who I was, why I was calling, and asked for the address to send this letter to. No call back. I've called several more times and still nothing.  I've really had it with this office. I looked at their review on Google and it seems I'm not the only one with this issue. They have horrible reviews and some very similar to my experience.  So, what is your advice?   Thank you so much!	Yes
"I'll summarize what had happened:  I was driving up to an onramp, and traffic was moving up when the car in front of me slammed on their brakes and I slammed on mine but my car still hit their back bumper. The person behind me had a lot of distance from me, and his car was unaffected but I immediately notice him running to the car in front of me. They spoke a foreign language to one another for a while before I could get their information. When I asked the young driver what had happened, for their side of the incident and why they slammed on their brakes, they said I hit them and caused them to hit another car in front of them. Moments later, the ""witness"" turned out to be the front (car that my car hit)  drivers father. This was my first accident, and I drive on this street/onramp daily for work, it seemed extremely fishy to me that he waited until we parted to mention that was his daughter and he was following her. I sustained a neck injury, and leg injury from the accident, and the others said they're fine with no injuries. I was already on the phone with my insurance when I asked them if they had any injuries. Their insurance card stated it expired back in February.     Should I report this to my insurance or have them investigate?"	Yes
Tl;dr: booked hotel, they upped reservation price after the fact. called bank to reject the charge and now hotel is threatening legal action and am just wondering if they have the right to do that.  I was looking for a place to stay for a few days in NYC and had stumbled on this hotel. Thinking it was okay for the price I had booked a reservation to stay only to find out the price that I had booked it for was later raised and I was charged for it. When i called to try to cancel the reservation they had said there would be a cancellation fee equal to the booking cost, which had already been charged to my card months in advance of the reservation date. I called my bank claiming fraud, that was charged wrongly and today i receive a call from the hotel threatening me with legal action asking for triple damage charges. I don't know what to do and feel entirely wronged. I do see that I had told the bank fraud, where in fact that mag not be the correct way but I was so frustrated and flustered that I didn't know what to do. I really need help on this and need to know what to do to just get this out of my hair.	Yes
Hi all, I am not sure if this is the right forum, but I need some advice on how to resolve my situation. I apologize for the length here. I traded in my current 2014 Nissan Altima lease on January 28, 2017, two months before the lease was due for a 2017 Nissan Altima, which I was required to make a payment of $397 on the day of trade. I spent over 6 hours at the dealership, at which time they indicated they had the car I wanted, but it would have to be driven in from downtown Los Angeles, I live in South Bay California. The dealer indicated it would only take an hour and be done before I was done my finance paperwork. I met with the finance dealer, we signed all paperwork, I gave him copies of my registration and proof of car insurance for the 2014 Nissan Altima. After my meeting, I was told the car would be another hour or two, I asked since I signed the paperwork, could they come by my house since I live two miles away, the dealer nicely obliged. Around 7:00pm that night, the salesman showed up with my car, which we exchanged keys and gave me what appeared to be my paperwork. Fast forward a few weeks, I noticed I had two Nissan Finance accounts, one for my 2014 and one for my 2017. The 2014 had one payment remaining of $355 and I called Nissan Finance at which time I was told likely the “grounding paperwork” is still in process and not to worry. I immediately called the dealership and asked what is going on and was assured the paperwork is in process. Over the course of the next four months, I worked with the General Manager of the dealership and Nissan Finance (both refuse to work together) and the paperwork had not been filed to date. Last month I checked my credit, which had dropped from 815 to 750, then this month it dropped from 750 to 680 due to 150 day late payment on my 2014 Nissan Altima. Finally the dealership got paperwork together, backdated the contract and paperwork to January 28th (so they say) and paid off all fines, penalties, and payments related to the 2014 Nissan Altima. The kicker, Nissan Finance has refused to remove the late payments from my credit report as the Nissan dealership did not provide them any letter stating responsibility for the lateness of the payments as a fault of their own. The dealership refused to accept my calls or emails or my showing up on site. I have contacted an attorney and been told I should start arbitration, but I will need to figure out a monetary number for which my credit was impacted. I have also contacted the state of California Attorney General, Better Business Bureau and filed complaints on Yelp and Google. I have over 40 documented phone calls to the Nissan Dealer and multiple site visits. Nissan Consumer Affairs told me it is not their problem as well as Nissan Finance. I really do not know what to do here anymore, do I go ahead with arbitration? My friend was with me when I turned my car over to the salesman. Is there any help that I have emails with the dealership admitting fault for the incident and admitting it would be “taken care of”. Nissan Finance nor the dealership will give me proof payment was made except confirming on the phone I no longer owe anything on the 2014 Nissan Altima. I know this is unlikely to gain much traction, but worth a shot.	Yes
Backstory is my girlfriend and I recently moved in together (in Colorado) in June but her lease for her last place doesn't end until August. To be able to move in with me she couldn't afford July's portion of rent which was $425 for her. Her and her ex roommate agreed both verbally and over text that she would pay June and July utilities but my girlfriend would only have to pay for June's rent.  Now July has come along and the ex roommate is demanding she pays or she will take her to court. My girlfriend talked to her old landlord and he does remember the situation but both my girlfriend and ex roommate have two different stories and he just wants to be paid. He said he has not been paid by ex roommate  yet and is willing to give an extension to my girlfriend if she needs. He just is confused by the situation and now not really sure what was agreed upon.   Does the ex roommate have a case against my GF? Does she have one if my GF does pay rent to landlord (even though wasn't decided previously) and still try and take her to court. What are the scenarios here? My GF cant afford this and is feeling screwed over but knows nothing was signed just verbal and text agreements. It is in Fort Collins CO. Any help would be appreciated 	Yes
"I live in Arizona, but the university is in Virginia.  I was guided here from r/personalfinance   I graduated in 2015 from this university and now attend dental school in a completely different state. I was randomly checking my university email which I never do and I saw that apparently ""I"" had registered for two in-person classes for the summer and now have about $2700 to owe. These classes are still in session and I also have emails from the professors that I am failing these classes, etc. I am not sure where the mix up is but how can I prove that I never registered for these classes and that I have no motive to take these classes. I am not sure if someone logged into my account and registered for them or if there was some IT error. This is really worrisome as I definitely don't have the money to pay for it nor in my mind should I. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
Hi, I'm a person living in Washington state.  Yesterday, my friends and I went out to a club for my birthday, but the bouncer decided that the image on the I.D. did not look like me and confiscated it away from me (best birthday ever). They have refused to give it back until I call the cops, but I did not call the cops because I felt that this would be a larceny and that there would be more I could do about this situation.  Is it legal for clubs to confiscate a valid I.D.? and if not, what can I do about it?  Thank you so much for your help in advance.	Yes
"Please no judgement here, I really don't know what to do and I need some solid advice.  Before I start I want to say I realize this whole situation is mostly my fault and I am not skirting blame, I just need an idea of what to do next.  Okay, I'm 26 I have had a wellsfargo savings account since I was 14.  When I was in high school hey started pressuring me to get a checking account and a debit card and I didn't want to but they harassed me for six months until I got one.  They then told me my info was going to get stolen online so I had to get an ""online debit card"" (I was 18 at the time and I grew up poor so I didn't know this was not a good idea) hey also said that if I had this ""online debit card"" then I won't get charged for having a checking account (something they were charging me for unknown to me and unknown to me they were charging me monthly for the online card as well.  Flash forward a couple years and they start offering me a credit card, I turned it down multiple times but they had me go back and talk to a banker and he started trying to scare me into getting one saying things like ""what if you have an emergency? What if you get stranded? Etc"" and finally I have in because they said it was the lowest interest you could get because it was a student credit card but they still gave me a huge interest rate and I didn't realize because it was my first one and my family never had credit cards.  A couple years later I go in to get a very small car loan - $1,000 to cover the gap and they won't give me an auto loan and he only thing they will offer is a $7,000 limit line of credit that I did not want but it was either take it or don't have a car.  The guy told me one interest rate when I signed and when I looked at the paperwork later it was a different number but I had already signed.  Everything was going well until jobs started cutting everyone to part time in the last couple years, my job did it and even with two jobs I couldn't financially stay afloat while going to a University ($11,000 per year) so I started sinking into debt.  It got to a point recently where I had to decide if I wanted to pay my rent or my credit cards because I am struggling really badly so I stopped paying my credit cards.  It's been a few months and now wellsfargo is suing me for $7,000 and their attorney fees.    I don't have money to pay them unless I do $50 over 5 years with no interest, otherwise I have to declare bankruptcy because if they garnish my wages I won't be able to eat...  I don't know why to do guys, I'm so stressed and I recognize that my ignorance of finances got me here but I really need help getting back out.  Any advice or help you can offer would help me so much.  Thank you all, I didn't know where else to turn."	Yes
Just wanting to know what, if anything, I can do in this situation. I filed 0 exemptions on my W-4, yet 2 exemptions are reported for my W-2. We now owe about $3k in taxes to the IRS. I did not notice that not enough taxes were being taken out, and I do realize that that was a huge oversight on my part. Thank you in advance for any advice you may have.	Yes
I was in a car accident while i was working. I get paid under the table. The vehicle was uninsured and unregistered, unbeknownst to me. When the police came right after the crash my boss took responsibility for owning the vehicle said i did not work for him. The court case with the city has been dealt with. Now insurance companies are sending me letters saying that they are suing me for 30000. I have no idea how to approach these insurance companies. Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you!	Yes
I'll preface this by pointing out that I have not yet spoken to a bankruptcy lawyer or an accountant about this, and am just looking for some direction about my next step before I commit to spending anything more.  I'll post a TL;DR at the end.  I am a carpenter with 15 years experience who decided 2.5 years ago to start up my own small contracting company.  The way I saw it, business in my area was really picking up and I had a solid small group of skilled guys willing to work with me to build something new.  I also had my father, himself a contractor since before I was born, giving me advice and even providing startup cash.  It seemed like a great idea at the time and I did make some food money for a while.  Fast forward to about 8 months ago.  My wife was pregnant with our first and after a couple of bad rental homes (one infested with bedbugs) I had an opportunity to buy a foreclosure at a ridiculously low price that needed some work.  At the time the company was between jobs, but I had about 35k in the bank for starting cash on my next contract due to start in January.  Now, I should add that I never took any accounting courses in college and that for the first year I had my father's office manager doing my books part time until things got so busy she couldn't anymore and I had to switch to quickbooks and manage it myself.  After getting nailed on taxes the year before for having made about 40k in pure profit over the year I decided on December 31st to take out the down payment for my house in the form of a bonus, the gross of which equalled about 30k.  What i did not realize, since I had never before run into any issue with cashflow, was that my payroll tax was not withdrawn until the end of the quarter, so I had not included it when I figured how much to withdraw.    Anyways, I ended up very short when it came time to pay the tax and I now owe the IRS about 17k.  To make matters worse, that contract ended up being a huge loser, and I can't even be sure I will be able to pay my suppliers and subcontractors when it is all said and done.  I project coming up about 2k short after getting the retainage at closeout, and then I still owe the IRS 17k.  So at 19k in debt (at best, it's probably more) and no cash and no future contracts (I stopped bidding when my crew of guys fell apart because of iniuries and other issues and it came down to me alone working to finish the job) I am wondering if I should talk to a bankruptcy lawyer or if there are other options that I should pursue.    At this point I just want to shut down the company and go back to working as a carpenter, since there is serious demand for carpenters and basically none available and I could land a solid job in a day.  I also want to pay my debts and leave the opening to use the LLC for small side projects and such, but I just don't know if that's possible at this point.  I really fucked up and have learned a lot about accounting since but it is too little too late.  I really want to avoid any serious problems with the IRS and am trying to set up a payment plan that I can afford. What should I do?  TL;DR: one stupid accounting mistake and a bad contract have landed my LLC at about $19k in debt with no cash and no future revenue, 17k of that owed to the IRS.  Do I talk to a bankruptcy lawyer?	Yes
I was sold a car from an ad on Craigslist and I was completely mislead by the owner. The car has major issues that he didn't tell us about. I took the car to the mechanic today (a day after buying it) and he said it's completely unsafe to drive. The seller said it just needs a tune up but that wasn't the case. The muffler was on its last legs,there's a hole under the passengers side seat that you can put your hand through. The car wouldn't start for our mechanic and it had to be pushed out of the garage and left in the parking lot. I have pictures as well. My mechanic said I could have a lawsuit on my hands against the seller. How can I get my money back?	Yes
We have a month to month lease and our landlord decided he wanted to go to student housing. So he notified us that we have till Aug 1st to leave (This was on July 2). Now we are moving out the 14th and have notified him via text that we are leaving. I also asked since we already paid rent for the whole month could we get back the money for the days we wont be living here plus security deposit (The place is in great shape no damage or anything).  He has not contacted me since I notified him of us moving out and asking for the money. My question is are we entitled to the money covering days we won't be living here? From my understanding from the day we leave till 30 days after, he has to give us a written review of the property and security deposit.   He has done this all though text also nothing written.	Yes
So I received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/spDd1) in the mail today along with a settlement check in the mail today.  This is the very first I've heard of a law suit against DeVry for fraudulent advertising.  I attended DeVry from 2010-12 and incurred significant student loans but never graduated.  The loan in question is actually in default and it would be absolutely amazing for my life if I could get out of paying it back.  That probably makes me sound like a horrible human being but I'll live with it if I can get out from underneath that mountain of debt.  I went to [the mentioned website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) but I really don't understand if I qualify or not.  If anyone could advise I'd greatly appreciate it.	Yes
I am currently on a study abroad trip with a US based provider ( supplied through my school ).  I was suppost to on a week long trip to Thailand with this company but they canceled it with two weeks notice.  They are giving me a refund for the program fee but I am now stranded in Thailand all alone for a week as I already have my flights and can't afford a flight home.  Is there anything I can do to get them to pay for part of my flight?  Unfortunately I signed no paperwork for anything.  I simply paid the extra fee on top of my study abroad fee	Yes
"Hello,    We just received a certified letter from our rental company stating that our payment was ""dishonored by [my] financial institution."" They are now demanding an additional ~$150 in fees. When we called the number on the letter, we were prompted to leave a voicemail. I left my details along with the confirmation number we had received with the payment confirmation email. We then contacted the customer service for the rental company and the rep stated that it had been denied for ""insufficient funds"" while the website states it was denied for ""closed account.""     1) I have $800 in privilege pay, so if I hadn't had the funds (I did), my checking account would have gone negative to pay the rent.    2) The website deleted our saved account information so I cannot even verify the account number I used to make the transaction. All I have is the last 4 of my account number per the confirmation email, which I verified is correct.    3) The letter demands these fees be paid within 12 days or we will be taken to court. While we can pay these fees, this is not our error as we had the confirmation email stating the payment was made.     4) My checking account does NOT reflect that any attempt to retrieve the funds was made, however. I called to confirm this and the rental company didn't pull out any money. The funds are still sitting there.      5) No one called us to state there was an issue with the payment. We assumed all was well as we had the confirmation email and figured it would take the typical 3-4 business days. I reasoned that with the holiday last week, things would be delayed a bit.    6) We used my checking account for the first time instead of my fiancé's (his has never had any issue before). This is the only difference, but it still made us input the account number twice and routing number once when we entered the information initially.       Questions I have: Are we responsible for these fees? Does it seems suspicious to anyone else that both of our saved bank accounts were deleted from the system so we cannot even confirm the account number from which funds were supposed to be drawn out from? We have not been able to get in contact with the woman who issued the letter (from the collections department), and the customer service line was of no help."	Yes
"My Ford F250 flooded in the Louisiana flooding in August 2016.  I called and turned the claim into insurance company immediately.  An adjuster came out and gave a “basic” estimate and said the mechanic shop we chose to take it to would check it over more and see what else needed to be done.  The shop and the adjuster decided it could be “FIXED” instead of totaled out. Small things were done here and there to ""fix"" the truck but it never ran right again and when I would get it back it would break again days after leaving the shop. I decided that the Ford dealership was apparently not going to be able to resolve anything as this had been months of back and forth so it was then brought to a diesel mechanic shop, after finally finding one that would accept the job (most places would not even accept the truck because ""it should have been totaled""). The diesel mechanic said, as the others did, that this was a vehicle that needed to be totaled, he told me and he told the insurance company multiple times. They always denied totaling the vehicle because they ""Goggled it and it could be fixed"".  I submitted a claim to the Louisiana Dept of Insurance and after a month they decided it a closed case as there was ""no proof that water got into the engine"" and caused the truck to be damaged beyond repair.    Now this is where I am completely lost, I have a ""totaled' vehicle (even though the insurance company refuses to total it, it is still just a sitting hunk of truck). It now sits at the mechanic shop because it will need to be towed away and this man has been nice enough to let it stay there as we were in the middle of disputes with the insurance company. His next ""fix"" will cost 5k and may or may not fix this truck, his thinking is more likely NOT. I am completely tapped as I have bought a ""cheap"" car to get me by and it is constantly needing this or that done to it as it is a 1986. BUT my 250 is still financed through the bank and pay off is over 22k.  Is there anything that I could do to try to get out from under this truck? It's ruined so it is not worth anything at all but still has a 22k price tag on it. I have considered letting it be repossessed but that sounds like the worst idea possible for my credit. I just don't know if there is anyway at all to get out of this without ruining my credit, I am now in a huge financial bind with no vehicle and no where to turn. Any advice would be great"	Yes
Hey everyone so I was at staples baught a laptop opened up their credit card and put it on there financed it for 6 months a month later i check my statement on that credit card and the laptop didnt show up on it, about 2 weeks later rep from staples calls me and said an error happened in the transaction and that they need me to come in the store with the credit card to charge me. My question is are they allowed to do that? am I legally obliged to go in and have them charge or cause they missed the transaction at the point of sale means i get the laptop for free because i think that if they cant charge it to me automatically then that means they are basically just taking a shot to see if i am gullible enough to come into the store and have them charge me cause they dont have the right to charge me now. also this is in Canada Ontario.	Yes
So long story short, I was awarded this scholarship by a university to complete a Master's programme with them. However, I ended up not getting admitted to the course, and hence would have to forfeit my scholarship.   But the scholarship department transferred the money to my bank account (due to a lack of communication between departments) but is now asking for it back.  Aside from moral dubiousness, how legal would it be for me to just block the email and keep the money to pay for a Master's programme at another university? I never signed any legal document (I think) apart from the below acceptance form but I'm not sure if it's legally binding. I'm still wrestling with the moral dilemma but I'd still like to know whether or not it would be legal. Any help would be appreciated!   Picture of form: http://imgur.com/a/vOpo4	Yes
After filing two claims a month apart last fall for a tornado and then a fire, my parents' homeowners insurance threatened to drop them if they make another claim. This morning they awoke to two feet of standing water in the basement from a flash flood that affected half the neighborhood. They are distraught and believe they cannot file a claim for risk of being dropped. I know insurance companies pull this all the time, but is there any legal recourse here?   I'm encouraging them to at least speak to a lawyer. Right now they are so distraught over the thought of covering the expenses on their own or losing their coverage entirely that they're pretty much frozen. Hoping to get some information here to find out if it's even worth meeting with a lawyer or if the insurance company has them by the balls.	Yes
Hello, my girlfriend took out a payday loan about a year ago and now we get a call from a collection agency stating they will take her to court if we do not pay an agreed amount by the end of the month.  I do not know if they have been trying to get in contact with her in the meantime at this point.  Do they have any legal right to do this, what would become of going to court and could I be getting scammed?  They knew her full name, last four of social and some other information that could be a little hard to get.	Yes
"Long story short, I made out checks to my ex (who lives in Maine) in the amount of $12,799 and a wire transfer of $3,000 when a check bounced because I forgot to transfer money from my savings to my checking account. Every check is clearly marked as a ""loan,"" and we have a previously signed contract for $10,000 of the $15,799.  I have a new contract reflecting the current amount that I plan to get notarized and sent to him immediately. He has been refusing to work with me on this and gets angry whenever I bring it up, so I imagine I am going to have problems with him signing the contract, let alone paying me on time.  If he continues to refuse, should I hire a lawyer or file on my own in small claims court? I don't know much about the process, and I don't want to screw this up."	Yes
I needed some minor body work and paint done on my jeep. Took it a shop that is part of a large national chain and paid $700 down payment.  Since then there's been one issue after another and it's 2 weeks past when it was supposed to be done. After they stopped answering their phones I drove down and they went bankrupt with the jeep still inside, disassembled, and sanded.  I've called their corporate office who told me they will see about releasing the jeep to me so I can take it somewhere else.  Since the jeep isn't legal to drive as it is, I'll will probably have to pay for towing, putting it back together, ect.   What steps should i be taking now? Is there something I can do to get the 700 back if they refuse to refund It? I understand they already did some work, but towing the jeep in pieces 2 weeks later wasn't what I had in mind when I payed. What about compensation for a rental car? I'm in the middle of moving and I will have to rent a vehicle now.  TLDR dropped jeep off at shop and paid 700 down. Shop went under with the jeep disassembled and locked inside. What should I do?	Yes
I have two credit card debt default judgements against me from about 5 years ago.  Even though my credit is repaired now, I am concerned if those creditors can still use that default judgement to come after my brokerage account.  I have recently opened a brokerage account where I am attempting to do some stock trading and my concern is if those creditors from the past can use those judgements to try to seize and/or garnish my brokerage account and I end up losing all funds in it?  The judgements were issued in an NYC court.  Any input would be appreciated.	Yes
I purchased a website about 6 months ago, however the website was not as described, and does not have the capabilities that were promised (such as a fully functional shopping cart with integrated payment processing). I've tried to work with the original owner to get these items done, but she is very slow to respond and always has excuses about her health, her child's health, and how she is traveling.   I'm in Northern California. The woman that I bought the website from lives in San Diego, but the LLC that she does business through is in Pennsylvania.  Can I file small claims court in my local court, or would I have to go all the way to San Diego or Pennsylvania?  Thanks for your help.	Yes
So... When I was 17 I decided it was a good idea to begin taking out school loans (10,000-12,000 per year for 5 years) to go to a private Christian college. Dumbest decision of my life. This is my ONLY regret in life so far. I can't believe NO ONE told me it WASN'T a good idea to be taking out this much money in loans. I didn't even enjoy my time in college. It was terrible and the school was going through financial difficulties and it impacted the students negatively (so I feel that I didn't even get a quality education). Now it's been 3 years since graduation and I'm still regretting all of this. Almost every day I wish there was a way to retract my debt (even if it means retracting my BA). I'm sure I'm just screwed, but legally is there anything I could do to get out of this debt? Like suing the school or something? I'm sure there's not but it's on my mind pretty much all day everyday so I figured I'd at least ask. Thanks in advance!	Yes
I'm in Baltimore County, MD.  I just found out last night I am being sued by Amex for $14,959.50 - I had a CC with them with a limit of about 13,000 and at some point maxed out and was not able to make any more payments after December due to job loss and financial strain. My husband and I were also separated at the time.  I haven't been served yet but I know there is a filed suit against me because I got a letter from some credit company trying to get me to do debt consolidation.  I want to attempt to settle the debt but I don't know how to go about doing this with Amex. They're being represented by Zwicker Associates and I have read online they're a beast and don't like to settle. This isn't my only debt. I have others. One medical bill about $1500 and some other CC debt but I have been able to pay on all my other credit cards. What are the chances of them agreeing to a decreased amount on the principle over 5 years? I know I can't make a lump sum payment. How should I go about answering the summons when I am finally served?  I have 2 kids, my husband and I are barely scraping by as is. I am terrified. I own a home that we've had for 3 years and I don't want to lose it in a judgement or have a lien tacked onto it.	Yes
"Hi all,  supload.com is a site where you post images and get paid in bitcoin for every view. The guy has posted this site on /r/beermoney and other places a while ago and I ended up trying it out in March. Since then I have been contacting the owners via twitter/email etc and get absolutely no reply regarding why my ""earnings need to be finalised"". Now this happened in March and I completely forgot about it but my images are still earning money, I have 25$ worth of bitcoin to check out. Now I know this isn't much at all but this is more about the fact that me (and likely many others) were scammed by this site and I'd rather get to the bottom of this.   Hoping someone has some advice."	Yes
Assume the person is not employed and has no liquid assets, no permanant address and receives some minimal assistance from Ontario Works. What is the worst that can happen? Can they go to Jail? Let's say there are two credit accounts each with a liability of ~$5000	Yes
"I live in Ohio and last year used a vacation rental site to book a few days at a house in Mexico. A few days before my trip, the property owner called to say there may be some work happening at the home I rented and that he'd need to put me up at a much larger home nearby. The house was larger but most of the amenities were non-existent or non-functional - including locks on the exterior doors.  When I arrived back, I spoke with the vacation rental site and they said to file a dispute through my credit card as I had been subject to a ""bait and switch"". I did so and the credit card company quickly refunded my money.  Today I was served with a summons to appear in a small claims court in San Francisco - apparently where the owner of the property lives. I've never been to San Francisco and the rental was in Mexico. The claim says that I falsified receipts with the credit card company in order to win my dispute.  A little bit of sleuthing leads me to believe that I can write a letter to the court explaining that because I don't live in the county (or the state for that matter) that they'll be able to just drop the case. **Should I write a letter explaining why the venue is wrong?**   I didn't provide any receipts at all to the credit card company. I simply explained what I experienced and they said I was right to dispute and that the merchant didn't respond to their inquiry with him so they took the money back. **Is there anything else I should be doing?**  Thanks!"	Yes
I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit. But my parents are having issues with our builders. They paid £23,000 for 5ft kitchen extension (which sounds ridiculous) that's been going on for 3 months. This should've been completed within 1 month. There were delays because our builders are trying to 'toy' with us such as 'equipment/material not arriving', mistakes they made and sending in 1 worker instead or 3 or 4.   They're making us pay for problems that they caused. Mistakes that they've made! What's worse is that today, they abruptly came in today and demanded the 'extra' cost rudely.   I feel like this is so unfair. My parents have waited months and they feel like they got robbed badly. The thing is a mess &amp; they just things to just wrap up. The extension started in April. I feel like we should get our money back but I know for sure if we argue with them anymore, they'll stop working on our house. Our 'Building controller' has come in many occasions to inspect their work and even he says it's a disaster. Could anyone advice?	Yes
Last year while I was visiting Paris, I purchase a rather expensive pair of boots I had been saving up months for. I figured I'd buy them in Europe since it's cheaper there ($1036) instead of $1293 in USA. I was told by the salesperson that I would receive a VAT tax refund at the airport after filling out several forms at the shop that I would just have to see customs and get my tax (about $120)refunded to me there.  I got to the airport, waited in a long line, almost missing my flight and the agents told me that I didn't have the correct form.  When getting home, I emailed the boutique explaining that I was unable to receive my money.  The sales person offered to speak to me via WhatsApp and gave me instructions how I could go to my local French Consulate and pay a 35 Euro fee to file the VAT tax return form to EU Customs located in Ireland. I gathered all the documents and made multiple trips to the consulate since each time I kept forgetting the appropriate documents. I mailed everything out, waited about 3-4 weeks and received no update. It's been about 8 months since then and I still have not received my money, even after emailing them several times and having them tell me that they'd look into this.   I know it's only $120 but I paid $35 and the sales associate said that the company would refund me for the fee and I went through all that trouble and they promised I would get it. I am visiting paris next month so I thought I could speak to their sales manager, but what can I do at this point?   Thanks	Yes
"Hello,  I am absolutely infuriated by this situation and wanted to know if anyone had any advice on what to do. I personally live in Arizona, however this company is located in Southern California, Newport CA to be exact.   So I rented a home at the beginning of May for the fourth of July weekend for me and 4 of my friends. I am 22 years old and wanted a place for me and all of my friends who have recently graduated to rekindle and hangout for the 4th of july. My friends and I each paid an even amount for the rental and gave it to my friend Joe. I went ahead and made the reservation and paid for the reservation with Joe's card. The full amount (roughly $4,000) was charged to the card immediately after making the reservation. The company sent me a confirmation email stating that the reservation had been made and sent me a bunch of information, including and email stating that the realtor would send me the lock combination to get into the home closer to the date of our stay.  I want to make it clear that a lot of homes in newport require you to be roughly 30 or older to rent a home. That is why I searched for days and finally found a rental company that allowed you to make reservations as long as you were 21 years of age or older. Considering that I, along with everyone in my party, was over the age of 21, I found that home to be perfect for us.   Fast forward to the day that we are supposed to arrive. We had the place booked for July 2nd-6th. On July 1st, at 5pm in the afternoon, I recieved an email requesting a photo of myself, a photo of my driverse license and a picture of the card on file. Unfortunately since I was traveling, I did not see the email until the next morning. (July 1st was a sunday, I did not expect to recieve an email on a sunday from them) Anyways, the very next morning I was happy to send them all of my information, however I explained to the realtor that I did not have a copy of the card on file considering that it had been lost by my friend Joe a few weeks back and he had since replaced the card. The reservation had already been paid in full nearly two months prior. Immediately after stating this, she said she would have to speak with a supervisor and get back to me. This was on July 2nd around 10 am, when our entire friend group had already traveled to newport and we were essentially pulling up to the driveway of the home. She then calls me back and states that since we do not have the card, that she has to cancel the reservation. She proceeded to cancel the reservation and said she would refund the money. I kindly explained to the realtor that the card had been cancelled, and that we would HAPPILY give them another card to keep on file for security purposes. She told me that since it wasnt the card that we paid with, there was nothing she can do.   Since they sent me that email less than 24 hours prior to our check in time, I had no idea that they required that card from us. Or else I wouldve called and notified them prior. When I asked her ""how was I supposed to know"" she responded, ""its in the rental agreement"". I immediately read through the entire rental agreement from beginning to end and I found NOTHING that remotely mentions anything about us having to have the card. She then said that ""since the card doesnt match the name on file, that is a red flag, so we cancelled your reservation"". So at this point, I feel like I am being lied to because now shes changing stories as to why she cancelled the reservation. I called back and kindly spoke with a supervisor and asked them to show me where in the rental agreement it states that we need to provide a picture of the card on file, or where it states that the card used to make payment needs to match the reservation. She hostilly responded, ""Sir, this is not a negotiation. Your reservation has been cancelled. Goodbye."" and then hung up the phone.   We were left there, sitting in front of the house, after traveling several hours, essentially homeless. They said that the money was refunded, however, that takes on average 3-5 business days, so we couldnt even use the $4,000 to rent another home or hotel room. We ended up having to pay for a hotel room for the night and buy flights back the next morning/drive back home.   I am honestly at a loss for words about this situation. I could not believe that a company could do this to a client. I believe that when I sent her a picture of my driverse licsense, she saw that I was only 22 and figured that since it was the fourth of july, that they could rent the home to someone ""Better"" for more money. I eventually found out that they ended up renting the home to a husband and wife for the fourth of july.   I am very upset because I had paid for this reservation two months prior, and they held the money in their account for 2 months. They then proceed to send me check in instructions less than 24 hours prior to my check in, and then cancelled the reservation. I do not understand how they can get away with this. I wish they would atleast have contacted me with the check in instructions a few days prior to our reservation.  Does anyone know what kind of attorney I should speak with about this? Or does anyone have any advice who works in this industry? I would greatly appreciate all advice.  Sorry for the long post.  Thank you!"	Yes
I'm writing this on behalf of my mom. We live In Ontario, Canada.  A few years ago my dad created a supplementary credit card under my moms name. He kept both cards and my mom never used the card. Than, a few years bag my parents separated and my dad took the card with him.  Only a while back we received a notice from the bank the card was created under, apparently my dad has been using this card, but it's registered to my mom, so we received a letter requesting that we pay back the debt. My mom called the bank and told them she has nothing to do with the card, she requested her name be removed from the card. The bank says that they cannot remove the name before the full amount is paid back. We talked it out with my dad, and he told me it was settled, the problem would be fixed.  It seems that was not the case. On July 13th, 2017, we received a letter from a legal firm. Apparently the bank has taken legal action on my mom, an they are requesting that she pay back the full amount spent. The problem is, my mom never used the card, that is not money she spent.  The letter was sent on June 29th, 2017, it stated that we must pay back a balance of $3,945.98 CAD. The amount is to gain interest annually at a rate of 19.8%. It also stated that if arrangements are not made within 10 days of the letter being sent, than legal action will be taken. It has been 14 days, we just received this letter.  I checked out the reviews for the Law Firm, it's technically a debt collector, and apparently their service is horrible. They are known to refuse to pick up calls so that interest is gained overtime, they seem to be all about money.  So now we have a problem. My Mom owes a bank money that she never used, it's quite possible that legal action will be taken by a potentially scummy company, and I doubt my dad will do anything to help.  So I've turned to my friend Reddit, I need your help, what can me and my mom do in this situation? How do we proceed?  Thank you for taking the time to read through this, I know it's quite long, but it means a lot to me.	Yes
The police emergency detained me because they believed I was suicidal. I was in my car pulled over on the side of the road with the hazards on as I was crying and couldn't drive with blurred vision. They took it upon themselves to assume I was suicidal even though I made no indication of it, have no history of mental illness or even a police record.  I was forced into the back of a police cruiser, taken to the ER against my will, and they tried to charge me $2400. I negotiated it down to ~$650 and left. The doctor cleared me after talking to me for 5 minutes because he knew I should not have been detained for anything. I did not even have to see a psychiatrist as the police earlier said.  I'm not sure if there is anything I can do, but I was hoping to find some advice.     TLDR: Police detained me wrongfully, forced me to go to ER, and I am stuck with the bill now.	Yes
My partner co-owns a popular restaurant in our city, and I tend to deal with the general complaints and inquiries that we recieve.   Recently, a woman contacted us over Facebook complaining that she and her friends got food poisoning from our restaurant. [Here's an album of our conversation.](https://imgur.com/a/1OIvv)   In order to prove food poisoning, you must first provide evidence that the food you ate was contaminated, and that this contamination caused you to fall ill. Typically a customer would call their local health committee in order to have an inspection done, which she hasn't. We issued an inspection ourselves, regardless of always having an incredibly clean restaurant with quality produce and staff. We've always passed our inspections.  I actually used to work at the newspaper company she said she talked to, so I contacted the director of the newsroom to confirm that she was in touch with them. The director has yet to get back to me, but I find it odd that a customer would contact the media prior to contacting the restaurant itself. It feels threatening from our end.   I should note that neither of our servers from that afternoon remember ever seeing her, but we can't rely on their memory. I also eat at our restaurant often and have never felt sick afterwards.  Is there anything we can do about this lady?  **TL;DR: A woman contacted us over Facebook to say we gave her and her friends food poisoning. We've never received claims like this before, and our restaurant consistently passes health inspections.	Yes
I own a media circuit board company in Colorado. 3 weeks ago, I sent out a board that was broken to a testing and repair facility, hoping to have them repair it. It would have been worth around $7k. They determined they couldn't fix it, and would send it back. I sent them another one worth $5k to test a week ago, they said they'd respond to me the day they got it.   I've called the office many times, it goes straight to voicemail. They do not respond to my emails. Fedex Tracking stated that it was signed for. I had a buyer lined up which now I've lost due to them not responding. This is causing me significant damage to my business, given they are the highest end product I offer.   I have no idea what to do to get it back or more, I have no legal experience. Please help!	Yes
Before I start let me say I live in California.  What happened was I purchased a product (bike) for $1,000 and after the I received the product I learned that it was going for several thousand dollars over retail price, $3,000 $4,000 and some selling for $5,000.  After learning this knowledge I decided to take it to a local shop for appraisal, and I was given a quote at that the time that the bike would sell for $5,250. After the appraisal process I decided to sign a contract that would let the shop sell $5,250 on my behalf and give me 80% ($4200)  Everything went fine for the next 10 days, but on the 11th day I get an E-mail saying my item sold for $1,800 and to come into store to collect my check for $1,440 (80%).   I immediately call up the shopowner who verifies that this item did sell for $1,800 and asked him how that could happen when the item was listed for $5,500. The shopowner then explains that the price was lower because I called in over the course of the past week lowering the price by small amounts $300-400 each day because I needed rent money.  I go into the store to sort it out because I didn't make any calls to the store to lower the price. The shopowner shows me a series of E-mails made to an E-mail address I don't own in which the topic of discussion was to lower the price, and in the E-mails were a sob story about how I apparently needed the money to pay rent or I would be kicked out. After this he shows me call logs of the person calling in and with very little verification except my first name and  e-mail address (not mine) making him able to lower the price.  What do I do? The shop owner says he is enable to re-reimburse the cost because to the best of his knowledge the person calling was me. In the contract there is a theft clause saying the store would re-reimburse the entire cost of the product if it was stolen, does this apply?	Yes
I turned in my phone to Sprint for the buy back program. They have lost it with no record of where it is.  I tried to escalate through customer service.  They said the store has taken responsibility for losing it and are working towards a solution.  This has been going on for four weeks.  If the store has taken responsibility for losing it, what action can I take to get the money I am owed?	Yes
"Person A hit one of my cars, approx $3,000 in damages.  They claim no insurance, the ""log"" says ""insurance agency advised the policy was canceled 45 days prior"", they did not put who the insurer was.  Cops did not fill out an accident report, only got a ""CFS - Command Log"". ""A"" is claiming to be poor and unable to pay anything, I drove past the trailer they reported as their residence, I believe it.  *However*, they were driving an excellent condition (until the accident, probably the same $3,000 damage) automobile.  On the command log the Cops put down a 2016 Make Model, plate #, and listed A as the owner.  I feel like something is screwy here.  How does a broke ass person get a loan for a new (or near new) car?   I'm really wondering if the cops didn't confirm ownership of the vehicle and it may be owned by someone else and A just borrowed it.  Assuming A did borrow it, the real owner might have insurance.  How can I find out if A really owns it, or who the real owner is?   Sadly I don't have full coverage on this car so my insurance will not cover it.  Thanks for any assistance you can offer."	Yes
"Hi,   I attempted suicide last year (stemming from an abuse relationship) and had a lengthy hospital stay that was covered at around 90% by my insurance company (Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan). I have since gotten psychiatric help and I'm doing quite well.   I have been receiving ""subrogation"" forms in the mail from my insurance company and I haven't filled them out. Today I noticed they do say that they are mandatory. I'm wondering if I complete it honestly and say that my hospitalization was ""not due to an accident"" as the question asks, will I be responsible for any of the hospital bills that BCBS paid?  It would financially ruin me (even what I did pay affected me substantially) and so I'm very concerned about this. Any advice would be appreciated. I am located in Illinois (and all of this occurred in Illinois) but my insurance company is located in Michigan if that matters."	Yes
I got my financial aid letter and a scholarship i got last year for $2,000 is there this year but it's for $20,000... And since it's a scholarship they auto accepted it for me. What happens if I just let it ride and see if they catch it? Could I get in trouble? Is financial aid considered a transaction that is complete when I pay my bill? Is there a certain point that they wouldn't be able to have any recourse?	Yes
This is a lenghty read ... Spoiler, no TL;DR at the end  :(  Some context - the company that my husband works for is based in Ohio. They have offices in many different states as well as Canada. So my husband and I moved to Mississippi from Oklahoma in October due to this employer relocating him. He has worked for this same company since March of 2017. We both work in Tennessee, but we live in Mississippi. We have switched our licenses, car tags, we have a lease on our rental house, etc. We are permanent, legal residents of Mississippi, and no longer have any legal ties in Oklahoma.  So, the company - until November - was still taking out Oklahoma state witholding on the income tax on his paychecks. He called and asked them to change it to Mississippi- which I thought fixed it. No. From then until present they are taking out Tennessee State taxes. ??? We don't live in Tennessee so we will not file Tennessee State taxes - and Tennessee does not have state tax anyway.  Other than that, Mississippi has the stupid Employees Witholding Exemption Certificate that works as the state's W-4 (at least that's how my employer explained it). I had to fill one out for my job, and I told him to submit one for his when we first moved here. They refused it and said it is useless to them because they do not have an office in Mississippi.  So I did the only thing I could think of and submitted a new W-4 for his company where he withholds more on federal so we can make up the difference when tax time next year rolls around. However, when he submitted it, we noticed his paychecks are different but still more than they should be with the extra taxes taken out. They still are not taking out the extra witholding! He sent in an actual signed form that had our witholding amount on it, and the one they're showing on file is an electronically filled out one with no extra witholding form and it is e-signed. They also had him listed as a D.D.S. (yes, Doctor of Dental Surgery) on his paychecks. I can guarantee if he was a DDS, he wouldn't be working for this bass ackwards company!!  I'm beyond frustrated. I just don't know if I have any ground to stand on with getting an attorney/lawyer. If I do I'm more than willing to hire one. I know that this won't affect our taxes that we are about to file much, if at all, it's next year's that I'm worried about. With our extra witholding, do I even need to really be worried about it, or am I thinking way too much about this?? Thanks in advance for any and all advice!!	Yes
I recently attended a concert that was put on by a third-party entertainment company which used Eventbrite to sell tickets. The concert was advertised to run for four hours and included a T-shirt and poster as part of the ticket sales. Long story short, the artist showed up 3 hours late and only performed for 10 minutes, if that. T-Shirts were distributed, but posters were not.  The refund policy set by the entertainment company (and restated through Eventbrite) was no refunds. I submitted a refund request through Eventbrite anyway but it is stated that it is at the discretion of the entertainment company to respond to the request if they want to.  I'm considering disputing the transaction through Bank of America as I made the purchase through credit card. Do I have grounds for a chargeback or dispute for bad services rendered? I realize that the bank will ask if I tried to contact the merchant first, but with a no refunds policy it seems unlikely that either Eventbrite or the entertainment company would respond. What are my options in this scenario, from a legal standpoint?   If it is relevant, I have been using this credit card through Bank of America for over 3 years now, haven't missed a payment, have high credit, and have never requested a chargeback on anything.	Yes
I'm more curious than looking to aid in their dispute. The total of the reversed charges hits around $8,500. He's apparently claimed to two of them that his PayPal was hacked and someone stole over $100k from him, but went silent soon after that and has now deleted his Facebook account. PayPal seems to be working with my members, but they're claiming that even if they get their money back, they want to see charges filed. I can't say I disagree with them, someone like that should feel some kind of repercussions.	Yes
I'm trying to get out of a lease with our wireless carrier. I noticed today they have my name as the 'lessee' but my SO as the signature. Probably a long shot but is it possible this makes the contract void?	Yes
Ok, I will try to keep this as short as possible. I was in Afghanistan after college for about 3 years working for the DOD (contractor). I came back on medical leave and racked up a ton of debt over the course of 3 years (also couldn't find a job, had anxiety etc).  I finally got back on my feet and got a couple good jobs, the whole time ignoring the constant calls because I had no means to make them right.  Today, I received a bunch of solicited information about attorneys in the mail offering to represent me in my case and looked the information up online to find that a complaint was filed in PBC courts on 7/3. Summons for 7/7.... I am starting to sweat. I moved somewhat recently and was never properly notified....  My wife and I both have degrees from the best school in the state and currently make around 75K each in SFla. We have high expenses but could make room to negotiate some type of settlement.   Are there attorneys who can do debt consolidation and handle this judgement or pending judgement? I would like to take care of each of the issues I have in one fell swoop if possible.   Please help me out, I am no dummy, but I could obviously have handled this better from the start. I had no means to repay, no job, and a nonfunctional back.... excuses. Please help!	Yes
"Bought a car ""As is"" from dealer. Had a mechanic give it a quick inspection for $45. He did little more than give it a visual inspection. Paid cash $3,700. Agreed to pay another $400 for cost of registration and title transfer. Written in contract as ""Title Fee"". Seller still has title and spare key. Seller said it would be slightly cheaper if I took the car for a Vehicle Inspection. He said if he did it, it would be more expensive but he wouldn't need the car to acquire a Vehicle Inspection Report. A day after purchase: Car showed catalytic converter and hybrid battery problems. I am unsure of specific faults but I don't think it would pass an inspection: Specifically the emissions test. I am unsure of what to do, advice would be very welcome. The best course of action I think I have is to pay the dealer the remaining $400 for the registration. Either he would have to fix the car to pass the VIR, commit fraud by obtaining a fake VIR, or already have a VIR that is still valid (Within the last ninety days)."	Yes
Hi, I'm 17m working at a fast food chain in CT. My boss is taking hours from myself and the other workers. He's done this before, I had my hours written down and he told me that I changed them to give me more hours. Last time he did this, he shorted me by about 14 hours. Well now I have my printed receipts for the hours that I worked. He told one of my co workers that the hours I stayed late with her, because it was busy, I won't get paid for.(to clarify this is maybe an hour once or twice a week) I get paid on Tuesday.  My questions are, if my hours don't match up, what should I do to get them back? Can I sue him over this? What about my co workers, they don't have any evidence that they worked more than he has said, can they get any hours back?	Yes
"Hi, our business entered into a 3 year, $35/month bottleless water cooler contract with a local provider. Due to dissatisfaction with the service (the machine has needed service several times and not enough water is cooled at any given time), we would like to cancel.   The provider has offered to change the machine. Otherwise, the contract provides for a $150 removal fee in the event of cancellation. It also says, ""If provider terminates a rental term under this Agreement or any Add-on Schedule due to Customer’s default, including but not limited to, non-payment of any amount when due, improper care, usage or handling of the Equipment, or failure to perform any other obligation hereunder, Customer will be responsible for payment of all fees for the remaining term(s), as well as for all damages and removal and shipping charges incurred by provider.""  As a result, they are seeking $630 for the remaining 18 months of the contract (in addition to the removal fee). We understand a cancellation fee, but to what extent is it legal to charge the full duration of the contract? Thank you."	Yes
So I was working at my dad's perfume store yesterday so he can take a day off. And I don't have that much experience, I occasionally fill in whenever he needs to take a day off for something. So yesterday I thought it was my lucky day cause I had two groups of people come in and buy nearly 500$ worth of items each but with credit cards. Now once again I don't have that much experience with this type of work. I just sold them the stuff but the procedure was the same as with any other group of people buying multiple items. Show them multiple stuff, bargain, and eventually they buy the stuff. I entered the price on the machine, they put in the card, they put in the pin, they signed the receipt and it was the end of that. Turns out both groups used stolen cards. So I get a call from my brother today saying both cards were stolen and we might not get the money for the stuff. But I pretty much followed the procedure I was told to, its just I don't know why we wouldn't get the money back.	Yes
"**Backstory** My wife and I went to visit a friend in Roatan, Honduras in April.  I had to be taken to the emergency room for food poisoning.  While I was getting my stomach pumped, my wife was dealing with the paperwork.  They initially told her it would be $250.  After they saw that we had insurance it got bumped to a $500 ""deposit"",  and as we were ready to head out it turned into an $800 ""deposit"". At that point we were starting to get angry and told them to just charge us whatever the costs were.  We weren't just going to leave them money without seeing an invoice of the charges.  They refused to provide one.     The dude had copies on his desk of my Driver's License and Insurance card.  So I grabbed them while he went and talked to his ""manager"".  When he came back we told him that we didn't want to use insurance and just charge us whatever the costs were.  My wife, being the great fighter that she is, got the ""deposit"" down to $500, cuz they kept on saying that they didn't know how much.  So we paid the ""deposit"" and I left them a copy of my driver's license and my email address.    I don't want to scam these people, they might have saved my life, but I just wanted them to charge me for the services rendered.  **Now** Yesterday, almost 90 days out, I receive an email with the invoice of $5,000.  We spoke to our friend in Honduras and he says these charges are outrageous.  The invoice came from an American company.    My question for a lawyer would be, is there a ""statute of limitations"" on this sort of thing?  Is there anything they can do to me legally?  All they have is my driver's license with an out of date address.    Thanks in advance."	Yes
Im renting a house with someone I thought was a friend and the lease started in July. I'm not currently living there over summer because I'm a student with a job back home but am still paying rent for the month. My roommate was supposed to mail in our rent check and said he did, but our landlord has not received it. We've all (about 3 of us) have been calling/texting/messaging him for 7 days now asking him to void the check (if he ever even sent it) and to send a new one. Our rent is now almost a week and a half late and I literally cannot do anything unless I get ahold of him. What are my options? The house and my (ex) roommate are in Oregon, by the way.	Yes
A while back i had a leak in my slab floor that i had repaired by a plumber that went fairly well. submitted claims to my insurance and home warranty and everything was fine. soon after (2-3 weeks) the leak occurred again and i had the same plumber out to fix it. they never mentioned a bill and never gave me an estimate so i assumed it was part of the same repair. (the new leak was on the same pipe but further down , and within the area they drilled open in the slab) Unfortunately since i didn't know i was going to be charged for this like it was an entirely new problem i didnt let my home warranty company know so they claim it won't be covered.  I offered to pay the plumbers the bill minus what home warrenty would have covered but they didn't go for it. ($1500-$400 for $1100). they're threatening to sue for the bill plus legal fees. am i in the wrong here? Am i even required to pay whatever bill they give me if i'm never given an estimate or anything?  thanks for any advice you can give me.	Yes
I visited the E.R. in Louisiana and am being billed (around $1,000) by the hospital who refuses to bill Iowa medicaid.  I've spoken to the insurance company that I have a policy with through medicaid and they agree I was covered and they have been willing to pay the bill, but the hospital must send them the bill.  The hospital insists they have no mechanism to send a bill to Iowa medicaid.  My bill was sent to a collections agency who were actually much more helpful than the hospital.  They facilitated a 3 way call between myself, the insurance company and themselves (collections).  We all came to the mutual understanding that I had fulfilled my obligations and that the hospital needed to bill the insurance company. Collections has since stopped contacting me completely, yet I still receive bills from the hospital.  I've tried speaking to the billing supervisor, and the people in billing have refused to let me speak to a supervisor, and just today sent my phone call to a customer service rep after telling me they were transferring me to a supervisor.  The hospital at one point even sent me a form so that I could bill my insurance company.  I filled it out and sent it to my insurance company and was told by my insurance company that it wouldn't work, and that they needed a bill from the hospital and not me.  I don't want this to hurt my credit, and I'm not sure what to try next.  Should I try a lawyer in Louisiana or Iowa? Is there some easier way to go about this?  Thank you for any advice.	Yes
[CT] Hello, My mom had a bill from her dentist which was sent to collections. The dentist told her she would have to pay both the bill and the collections fee. So my mom pay the fee through the collections, but has not received a bill for the fee the dentist hired for collections. Will she receive a notice about this or is everything set? She no longer goes to this dentist.	Yes
"I'm in Switzerland and I know the laws might be a bit different here compared to the US; I'm just looking for some general advice and for someone to tell me that I'm not crazy for being angry about this...  On the 29th of May I bought 3 tickets online for a medium sized festival (it's pretty well known but it's not a huge festival). When I still had not received the tickets after a month, I sent proof of payment and asked what was up. I never recieved a reply but a week later I received a ""payment confirmation"" in an envelope with a small rip in the side. I thought nothing of it and hoped the tickets would arrive soon. Last week, when they still hadn't arrived, I sent another email to which I received no reply. I sent another email at the beginning of this week. (There's no phone number on the website, only email.) Still no response. So I sent a message to the festival's Facebook page, and finally received a reply. They said that they had already sent me the ""bracelets"" around the time they sent the payment confirmation. They don't send tickets, just the wrist bands to enter the festival, with no way to identify them (no number, bar code, name or anything...just wrist bands with the festival name on them). I'm pretty sure that they were in the envelope with the payment confirmation and someone at the post office ripped open the letter and stole them. I've explained what I think happened and sent photos of my payment confirmation and the envelope with a rip in the side and they aren't replying. I paid over 400 francs for those three wrist bands. It's insane that they have no proper tickets and no way to identify the wtist bands; they're just asking to be stolen. Whoever has them is going to be able to get into the festival for free no questions asked. I'm so angry right now and so afraid they won't believe me and will refuse to send me more wrist bands. The festival is from the 3rd to the 5th of August. What should I do? File a complaint with the post office? Wait for the festival people to reply (when they've been super shitty about replying)?   Thanks for any advice you can give me  Tl;dr: festival sent me wrist bands which were stolen out of an envelope in the post. They have been slow to reply and I'm very worried they won't believe me"	Yes
When i started, and was attending university, my father never let me see any of the paper work, i was there on grants, which covered my tuition (and according to my father, my housing as well) i was never given any information regarding my finances regarding my time there, all of it was sent to his email, this went on for four years, i asked pretty regularly to see the paper work (student emails saying forms were due when i asked generally FAFSA and what have you) during my last semester i received an email saying i needed to take an online loan repayment course (this came from the school to my student email) so i went to the studentloan.gov site only to find i had an account byt could not sign in, upon further investigation i found my father had made the account and the emails from the sites routed to his email. I asked him about this many times and he delflected the question and blame. Later that year my older sister who had graduated was informed she had students loans taken out during her time (mind younshe was on the same set of grants as i) so i decided to dig around in my student information from my school, low and behold over 35k in student loans i never knew about. Or signed for.    Is there legal action i can take to help this at all? I the only reason i went to college to begin with was because I was told my grants/scholarship paid for everything.  Important note, my father has also commited various amounts of identity theft on myself, my mother and my sisters. Going so far as to take all the equity out of the house i grew up in and lose the house.  Tldr version: My father signed papers with my name agreeing to accept government loans to pay for housing in college and kept me in the dark about it.  Please help, im not a savant on this kind of thing and need advice.	Yes
Back in March, T-Mobile had a promotion where you could add another line to your account completely for free. Naturally, I got on it along with my mom, to be added to my sister's account.   Before this, I had an iPhone 5S, and my mom had a flip phone from TracFone. When we switched to T-Mobile, I received an SE and gave my 5S to my mom. We also got new SIM cards. My mom's number changed back in almost minutes, but my number didn't change. It turned into days, weeks, and now months.   We've tried everything to get my original number back, but it seems that either TracFone or T-Mobile is just refusing. Is there any legal action I can take to demand they give me back my number?	Yes
This is slightly personal, hence the throwaway, and this situation is based in South East Asia. So, I know that there will be a certain degree of difference but I just want to know what I can expect. Also note that I am not the embezzler  If a person has been embezzling money from the company and the company goes to the cops, will the tax records of the company be under scrutiny?   Also, if the some of the money embezzled has been used to buy houses listed under that person's kids names, will that money be recouped? Alternatively, is there any way to force the person to return the money without going to the police?	Yes
"I hired professional, highly recommended photographers for my wedding in January 2017. They gave me a CD with 1,331 photos. There are 3 of the bride (me) and the editing on the rest of the pictures is terrible (they also gave me photos of them drinking, the sky, and selfies with the staff, there are more photos of the sky than me, the bride, alone in my dress). The best photo these professionals took was from their iPhone. When I received the photos I told them right away that I wasn't pleased. The editing is terrible, they just applied filters to most of the photos. I asked them to removed the filters, look for more photos of me, and to find more photos like the cell phone photo they took (the cell phone picture is a stunning full body shot of the bride and groom with the lake and sunset in the background). The professional camera shots of the same image are from the shoulders up and very washed out due to filters. They said they would. A month goes by I hear nothing so I reach out to them and ask how its going. They say we have all the pictures done. I'm thrilled and I go and get them. It's a CD with 7 photos, I told them there was more they said they would fix, they asked for a detailed list. I spent 3 weeks making a ""This is what a professional would do to make these photos great list."" I covered everything from ""Please crop this photo, photoshop food out of bridesmaids teeth in group shots, remove filter etc."" They said that was too much work and they don't use photoshop (not mentioned before booking or anywhere in the contract). I told them to just give me the photos unedited and I would have someone else fix them. Months go by again and they give me 50 photos, they went though the list I gave them and gave me unedited images of things I wanted cropped. They did not remove filters. Then when I brought up that they mentioned they found more photos, the denied that they said that because they gave me all they had (I have the text message from them where they said they found more images). My question is: Is it worth it to take them to small claims for all the photos unedited (raw). I'm not wanting money, though I do have to pay an editor now. Just give me the SD cards from the wedding and let me be on my way. They already gave me a copyright release form stating the photos can be edited by an outside party. It's been months and I really want photos I can show people."	Yes
LOCATION: WEST VIRGINIA  So this contractor builds me a deck with a simple shed roof over part of it. This was completed in February. Everything looked fine. I paid him and we were happy.  Then the first big rain of the season comes and the roof leaked horribly. Multiple spots, dripping, pouring in other places.  I contacted him and he came back out, looked at it, and applied a fix to the roof. This was done at no cost to me (as I expected it to be).  During the next rain, the roof still leaked albeit less than it did before, but still, I had drips on both sides of the door leading to the deck and soaking spots in a few places.  I contacted him about that and I was told I should contact a roofer to get it repaired.  This is where the problems started. I told him that his company built the roof and I expect his company to take care of it. He told me he would get someone he knew from a local roofing company to come out and assess it.  I have no proof that this ever occurred only his word.  Another month passes.  I contact him almost every week to ask where we are on this.  Finally, he tells me the roofer has come out and looked at the roof and knows what to do to fix it.  Great! Then nothing.  Another month passes.  I contact him and now they are waiting for a cost of materials, etc. He says he hasn't forgotten about me and he was waiting for responses from a 3rd party roofer.  Another month passes.  I sent him a message last week. It goes unanswered. I sent him a message this morning and so far nothing.  I am considering taking him to court over this, but I don't know if that's the correct thing to do. I have all my texts to him, I have all the pictures I've taken of the leaks.  I just want a roof that doesn't leak and I feel it's his responsibility to fix it. I also feel like I shouldn't be charged for anything in this matter. And as far as the contract goes, he brought it up a few times saying this is out of scope of the contract and I disagree. I feel that a working roof is very much in scope of the contract and since this roof doesn't work then does that constitute a breach?   Am I screwed because we paid him in full when the work was done? If it didn't rains as much as it did, we wouldn't have even known there was a problem.  What I am seeking by taking him to court is either money so I can find someone else to fix his faulty roof or a court order telling him he has x amount of time to fix it and fix it right or he will also have to pay me money to get it fixed.  What are my options?	Yes
I am with T-mobile. I live in Texas.  I signed up with a promo with them in Feb. that I would get 2 lines plus a free line for $110/mo flat. This saved me a lot of money from my original plan, so I thought I would add my roommate (also with t-mobile) to our plan to share the savings. They told me that the free line was usually for new lines, but made an exception for us. (Otherwise, we would have to pay $20/mo additional for line forwarding).  It is now July and since they have been charging me $180/mo for services. I have been double charged in here as well. I have gotten this refunded twice from them. Today I called to get my third refund and was told that I never qualified (because roommate's previous line was with them) and that they would not honor it (by a second-tier manager).  I cannot afford other service providers, so switching is out. I really feel like this is terrible business practice and that T-mobile lied to me about my prices. If I didn't qualify I should have been told that before they switched my lines over. I don't think there is anything I can do legally(?), but any advice on how to get them to honor my original pricing?	Yes
I run a computer repair business and sometime customers abandon their devices. We have them sign a form that says after 30 days it's forfeited. Sometime we've fixed them and they don't come back or call back for months. We have to recover or cost of parts and can't hold on to something forever. Is there anything we need to do to legal have ownership to sell it or get rid of it? We are in Kansas. 	Yes
Hello,  A large US based retailer is not honoring the sale price for 2 suits that was advertised on their website. Just an fyi I am located in Canada and they operate here as well (online store and brick &amp; mortar stores).  I’ve spoken to three different reps before hand who assured me the price would be honored. They said I would get refunded the difference in about 1-2 weeks. It was close to 2 weeks after my purchase and I didn’t receive any refunds so I called back and they said they wouldn’t be able to honor the price anymore. I’ve complained countless times and management finally said they can honor both suits (They were very reluctant and made it difficult for me, they even closed my case without notice).   Again about a month has passed and I still didn’t receive my full refund balance. Now after reaching out to management, they are saying they can only honor the one suit even after providing screenshots of the product listing with the sale price.   Is this against the law? In Canada we have a law should cover this (http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/00522.html#sale) and I believe this falls into this category. The sale price was still on the website 2 days after I made my purchase and they didn’t resolve the issue with me right away (I had to reach out to them to find out) and is still on going after more than 2 months.   Secondly, I was charged a large amount of taxes and duties on the original price I paid but since I’m paying the sale price, shouldn’t I get refunded the difference in the duties/taxes fees? Again they are refusing to reimburse me for those fees that were charged.  I’m not sure how much of a case I have but would love to hear your thoughts and if you have any suggestions. Much appreciated!	Yes
I broke a lease (I was never served a notice to vacate) with an apartment in Texas.  They charged me for the remaining months, and added all concessions from the previous months.  The balance is somewhere near $5,500 and is definitely on my credit report.  Next Summer, I'd like to buy/rent a house with my wife. By that time, it will be seven years after the first report of the debt.   Hunter Warfield owns the debt and I've never talked to anyone from the company.  They stopped calling me a long time ago.  I've considered calling and after specifying that I am not promising/making an offer to pay, nor acknowledging the validity of the debt, seeing what they'd want me to pay to satisfy the debt.    1. Does this debt act like other debt, in that it falls off after seven years, or will this be on there until I pay the collections company?  2. Am I correct that the statute of limitations for suing me for this debt has passed?  According to Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code § 16.001 et seq., Tex. Bus. &amp; Com. Code Ann. § 2.725, the limit is four years.    3. Would contacting HW be a smart or stupid move?   4. Would contacting HW reset the seven-year clock?   5. Any tips for dealing with HW and not getting completely screwed? Certain verbiage or terms to use?  What's a good offer on a six-year old debt of this size?  If the answer to question 1 is that it in fact falls off, I have no interest in offering to work with HW and I don't need answers for 3, 4, &amp; 5.	Yes
A buyer purchased a week of our time share via eBay back in July 2017 for travel this March 2018, and then couldn’t find cheap flights to get down there. She has been harassing us to get her money back since then when the posting had said no refunds.  She disputed through eBay, but their policy (rightfully so) doesn’t support “buyers remorse” or “inadequate research before making a purchase”. She then disputed through PayPal, saying that she didn’t receive her purchase at all - when we had all the confirmations as well as her emails and texts saying that she received the confirmation, but just couldn’t find flights and wanted her money back for that reason. PayPal ruled in our favor, but now she’s disputing with PayPal again through a chargeback with her credit card issuer.  What does this mean? What legal options do we have to ensure that she’s unable to receive her money back for the non-refundable purchase?	Yes
"Location: Netherlands  I recently decided to make the jump onto the Oculus Rift + Touch bundle for €450 from Oculus directly, tried it for a few days, and decided it's not for me.  I set out to get a refund from Oculus, and noticed that  &gt; As per Section 4.4 of our Terms of Service, located [here](https://www.oculus.com/legal/terms-of-service/), we do not provide refunds for opened or used hardware products, so the Rift cannot be returned.  I decided to email them for a refund regardless, because as far as I know I have the rights to get a complete refund. That's when I got sent the above message.  When I told them the Oculus Touch box is still unopened, they replied  &gt; we can look further into what can be done about them.  I asked some friends for advice and we think we found the right law to call upon, and formatted an email for Oculus.  This is the template:  &gt; ""Pursuant to Chapter 3, Article 9 of Directive 2011/83/EU, I (full name) of (address) exercise my right to withdraw from the Contract from the sale of an Oculus Rift and Touch Controllers by (legal title of the seller).  &gt; &gt; Under this Directive I am entitled to a full refund upon notification of withdrawal within 14 days of delivery. A receipt of the sale of goods and delivery confirmation are attached. &gt; &gt; Please provide a return shipping label by COB (insert date) for return of the goods.  &gt; &gt; Thank you.""  Could you please enlighten me if what we've come up with is the correct procedure?  The facts:  - I live in The Netherlands - I bought the Oculus Rift + Touch Bundle from Oculus VR Ireland Limited through Paypal - I received the product 6 days ago, on July 11th - The Oculus Rift was used for a few days to test it - Oculus Touch is still unopened in box - As far as I know, there were no seals I have broken  Thank you!  P.S.: If I've done anything incorrectly or if you need more information, please let me know. I'm completely new to this sub!"	Yes
"The company is called inspire3 and is British. On their website they claim they do refunds if you are not satisfied with the product. We have emailed each other. They claim they've paid me back, that i should contact my bank and sent me a ""receipt"". The receipt doesnt have my account or card number on it so my bank doesnt accept this. The company claims this is their official receipt and for ""security seasons"" the account number and so on wont be displayed.   I suspect i have some leverage here because else they wouldn't bother with emailing me back."	Yes
Hi. I went to Miami with a girl, and had her sign an electronic contract that we were splitting all costs. Total came to $507 for the trip. This included festival tickets, rental car, gasoline, lodging, and parking fees. I paid for all pre-trip because I get good deals on things if I do. I have texts also backing up that we agreed to split them all.   She gave me $55 before we left for Miami. When we got back, she said she was moving to Tennessee (lie, found out where she works in our local mall) and would pay me gradually as she was settled. She's sent me $65 over the course of two months, and an $50 Amazon gift card.   She blocked my number and all my social media accounts, so I contacted her boyfriend. He said he would pay me back the $, but he wants to see my messages with her from Feb - July. I have all of the messages, I never deleted them. But we were actually friends and some of them are about her selling nudes online for $ and him cheating on her. I would rather do this a legal route through small claims court, but how much is it just to file a claim? How much stress is it?	Yes
"Posted this in a thread over on r/finance, and several people suggested I ask the question here.   My gym has a habit of randomly increasing our monthly payment with a $20 ""Club Fee"" a couple times a year. This charge was not initiated until after I signed up, and had signed authorization for a set monthly rate. The agreement I signed included no wording of this fee, so I have not given them permission to charge me this extra amount. I also have received no type of notification of this fee prior to it being charged to my credit card on file.  This seems very illegal to me. Am I right? What course of action might I have to get this stopped?  Already planning on talking with the gym manager when I go in tomorrow morning."	Yes
My fiancé and I live in California and after shopping around for a while, we decided on an engagement ring that was from an Etsy shop in WA.   We were led to believe that the ring would be 18k gold and after having it on my finger for less than 24 hours, it turned my finger green.   We are a young couple, he is still in grad school, so between student loans and living expenses, (although we were budget conscious when looking at rings)  $500 + is a lot to us right now.   I know that this seems like a stupid thing to post/be upset about, however, I don't want any other couples to be duped like we were.   If any of you have suggestions as to how to deal with the seller or how to proceed going forward, please let me know.   Thank you.	Yes
"Hey guys, as part of a settlement, my former doctor has provided me with a contract which includes an indemnity clause that would indemnify both parties of ""any and all claims and/or demands of any kind"" made by insurers or other third parties. Is there any benefit to me as the patient in having this clause in the contract?"	Yes
"Alberta, Canada.  Back in September 2014, my mom got a call from this company that wanted to introduce an online tutoring service. My mom was interested so she invited them to our home. My parents spoke to the sales lady for about four hours and signed contracts with them that same day.  One month after using it, my siblings and I found the program really generic and unhelpful so we asked our parents to cancel it. A sales person came to our home again to ask us about our problems with their services. They only called back to say that there is no possible way to cancel it.  In the contract that my parents signed for the buyers right to cancel, it specifically says: ""If you do not receive the goods or services within 30 days of the date stated in the contract, you may cancel this contract within one year of the contract date. You lose that right if you accept the delivery after 30 days. There are other grounds for extended cancellation.""  The issue:  This part is important!!! In the contract to pay each monthly Loan payment of $183 for a term of 60 months it says: *""We are aware that other than the cancellation rights contained in the Notice of Buyers Right to Cancel, which are outlined on the Purchase Order, we cannot cancel the purchase and/or the Loan.* I also acknowledge and agree that no representative of __company name___ has promised or represented to us that we may cancel the Purchase and/or the Loan."" (they signed this the same day as the buyers right to cancel contract).   To be sure, does that mean my parents signed a contract making them unable to terminate the contract? It sounds like my parents are surely bound to this for two more years, but still, I want to ask because I want to be hopeful, is there any way to cancel this? In the end, it's going to be a financial loss of almost 11 thousand dollars...  According to BBB the company ceased operations but say customers are still receiving customer service from another company based in a different province. The customer service is a joke. That same company has received over a hundred bad reviews on google experiencing the same problem as us. I notice that the company seems to target low-income or immigrant families which make them easier to fool. It's really unfortunate.    Do my parents have ANY recourse in this situation? Thanks in advance for any guidance. Sorry if the format is really bad."	Yes
Who is responsible for paying for a lost title if it was lost in the mail? My brother in-law feels stuck because his registration is now expired due to the delay of the title (We're talking over 4 months since he bought the car). Dealer says it's not his fault it was lost in the mail, so BIL has to pay it.    My thought is that if mail is important you go ahead and pay for tracking etc. So yes, in my mind, it is the dealer's fault BIL doesn't have a title yet. Plus, when BIL bought the car outright, he bought the title. It wasn't part of the deal to  have to pay a lost-in-mail fee. Am I right?  BIL is driving there tomorrow morning to pay the fee, so any advice tonight would be useful. I was hoping the law might be on our side in this situation, but it might not be that simple.	Yes
"They keep referring to it as ""policy change"", but they have, in reality, altered the essence of the service provided: I have signed a contract for unlimited data for a certain price, and now they're charging me the same price for a limited amount of data.   They have issued a notice around New Year's saying that they intend to do so; I have immediately called their customer service and said that I do not accept that type of service to which they have told me that the """"new policy"" is not being rolled out yet"""" so basically to chill since is not impacting me any time soon. I have just logged into my account to discover that the data cap has been imposed for some time now without anyone contacting me after my declining of the altered service.  Does this qualify as a breach of contract given that I have specifically declined any alteration to my contract?   Again, they keep saying that it's a ""change in policy"" which, based on their standard contract terms they have the right to update, but I see it as a change in service provided since I'm now getting less for the money I'm paying and I specifically disagreed to take that cut. Thanks guys!"	Yes
The old owner of the electric company were on a legal battle(takeover stuff) between the new owner of the electric company but while they were on a legal battle, we were told to not pay/hold the payment for the time being but now that the new ownership won, they are now trying to collect that money when we were told to hold the payment. My question is, are we still obliged to pay the new ownership of that electric company?	Yes
"I signed up for a gym in October 2015. It was a 1 year contract, that switched to month to month once the year was up. I paid throughout the whole year, and continued to pay until February of 2017. I had to suddenly move (long story) and in that same month got a new bank account, with new debit card.   In the hurry of the move, I forgot to cancel the gym membership or give them new card information. I didn't worry about it, because I wasn't under contract. Any other monthly service not under contract would cancel automatically once they stopped being paid.  This gym apparently is different. They made several attempts to call and inform me, but they were just random 1-800 numbers that I would never answer.   Just now, I got an email from them saying that if I didn't pay my entire balance within 5 days, they would be sending me to collections.  What can I do? It's several hundred dollars, because they've added some bullshit ""late fees"", so it isn't an insignificant amount of money. And in principle it frustrates me. Why should I pay for the membership when I wasn't under contract and I haven't been to that gym in over 6 months?"	Yes
We arranged a payment play with David's Bridal owing ~$850 payments were supposed to come out of our account @ $50 /mo until October of this year and we would be done with the debt. This month we received a letter stating that our account was transferred to a collection agency and that we now owe $967 and they are demanding full payment. When we made the original payment arrangement we were trying to call to pay the balance in full but were talked into this arrangement which sounded good to us at the time because I had just been let go from a job we were just trying to get rid of the high monthly payment, but it sounded like a good plan to have the lower payment option and still only own the lesser amount.  Today is when I saw the letter and called David's Bridal and the lady said they couldn't really tell me much since they transferred the account to Midland credit. I called Midland after getting off the phone with David's Bridal and they said they are demanding payment in full of $967 and gave no reason why our account was transferred or further details.   Can they really do this? What can we do? I will fight not to pay more than we agreed to since we set our payment option.	Yes
I'm a college student in Florida and hit a parked car in my neighborhood while I myself was parking. I've only been driving for around a year now but have always been a safe driver. I immediately parked, went up close to asses the damage and then left a note on the dented backseat passenger door telling the driver to call me. So later in the day she texts me and is very understanding and even asks if I rather not get insurance involved. We both call our parents and I'm ready to go get a quote on the damage but she doesn't text me for 2 and half months so I'm thinking she's forgotten about the whole thing or gotten it fixed herself or something.  Now she's texted me back asking if we can get her car fixed by the weekend. Just looking at the price estimates for fixing dented doors + chipped paint looks like it'll be at least a grand, I really only have a 300$ limit right now so i'm kind of screwed. What would be the consequences if we got insurance involved? (It's my dad's insurance as the car is still under my father's ownership)  Thanks in advanced for helping the nervous college kid out	Yes
Someone owe me 32000 USD and now He refuses to pay me back. He lives in Ontario and I do not know about his address. I live in Alberta now. Is there any chance for me to sue him? Please advise! Thnanks	Yes
The contract is signed under California law. I've billed them on this card previously, but they sent me an email saying I'm not allowed to use that card any more. However, they haven't paid me and see to not want to pay me. Is it legal for me to charge them on that card, considering the previous authorization and how past due the invoice is?	Yes
Hi all,  Hoping someone with knowledge of Taiwanese finance can chime in.  I was born in Taiwan and when I was young my mother bought me some sort of fund - she told me recently that it has grown massively.  However, I moved here when I was very young and have since become a US citizen. I'll be returning to Taiwan next year for an internship and while I was there I wanted to move the money to the US so I could more easily access the funds.   The thing is, since I've turned 18, the my mother could no longer access the money, only I can. Since I've moved, I've changed my last name (technical adoption) and am not sure how to prove to them that I am in fact me.  How do I go about doing that? Will there be any taxes involved in liquidating about 200 K in assets? How do I transfer that money to the US? Should I have a lawyer assist me while I am there? I don't speak mandarin very well and cannot write even my name.  Thank you, Reddit!	Yes
I just got a call today from my storage unit stating I have used their on site dumpster when I shouldnt have. I threw away some empty packing boxes. They told me the dumpster is not for customers. I apologized and said it wont happen again and that I was unaware I was not allowed to use the dumpster on the property where I rent a unit.  Then they told me that there is a $200 penalty for using it. I said I dont remember that listed in the lease contract I signed that I wouldnt use their dumpster or any mention of a fee/penalty for doing so.  I checked the contract and there is no mention of use of the dumpster or a fee for using it.  They called again in the afternoon which I let go to voice mail. They said they have me on their surveillance cameras using the dumpster and to call back.  Do they have grounds to charge me for use of the on property dumpster where I rent a unit?	Yes
"I live in Turkey, I have ordered around 1860$(with taxes and shipment) worth of computer parts from newegg.com/global/tr.  **TLDR;** At https://www.newegg.com/global/ page they say ""During the order checkout process, Newegg will calculate and display the order total amount along with cost of customs duties and applicable import and sales tax (VAT/GST). Should you elect to proceed with completing the purchase, all orders will be delivered with duty and tax fully paid for and included in your final checkout price."" and at https://kb.newegg.com/Article/Index/12/3?id=1400 page ""When Newegg products are shipped to eligible countries, an estimate of the estimated VAT/GST &amp; Duty will be levied on the items in your order for shipment to countries outside of the U.S. With your authorization, these funds are used by the carrier or another agent to pay the Import Fees on your behalf (or the recipient's behalf) to the appropriate authorities of the destination country. The payment of import fees is the responsibility of the importer and is levied based on the laws of the country into which the products are being shipped."" on the same page it also says ""You won't be charged additional fees if the actual Import Fees exceed the VAT/GST &amp; Duty we estimated."" and Turkey is listed as one of the eligible countries, yet, they are refusing to cover the fee on my behalf.   I know some of my options here:  * I can pay the customs fee again get the items then keep chasing after the money I paid for tax &amp;/or duty using chat with us or charge back through bank; i can consider doing this because I have ordered some other parts from other places which I have received already, If I can't receive my order from newegg, I'm gonna have to return them too. But If I do this and the items I receive require some RMA than I will get screwed.  * I can forget about the items,  go for a full charge back through bank since newegg failed to deliver my items as they have promised me; the catch here is items are stuck at customs and they may claim they have done their part, and I can't even send the items back to them because FedEx Turkiye asking me more than 200$ to return the shipper. At that point paying the customs fee makes more sense.  Do I have any other options beside these and how should I proceed?   Back story;   At 07/03/2017 my package arrived at Turkey and delayed at customs and i have been reaching out to them through ""Chat With Us"" since. At my first contact with 2278378 chat session number, I have been told that I don't have to pay any fees by rep Cassie L. Later I got an e-mail from a customs broker regarding the necessary paperwork for customs and the amount of fees levied on my items. I have provided the paperwork and contacted newegg about the fees in chat session 2284660. Rep Joanne Z. asked me to forward the e-mail I got from the broker, which I did, and told me their shipping team will check it out.  After 24 hours from my last contact with them, my package was still delayed at customs so I contacted them to ask why is this taking this long, this was suppose to be an express shipping after all, I knew customs delays are not their fault but they were doing nothing to speed things up and I didn't wanna wait weekend out.   At chat session 2287615 things got a complete turn and I have been told by rep Nick W. that they will not cover my custom fees. I refused to pay that I have already paid and told him I will file a charge back through my bank because they have failed to deliver my items as they promised. Nick W. said a charge back will only cause more issues which I felt like a threat.   I ended that chat session but shortly after decided to give it another try by asking them to charge me back the amount as I paid to them to cover the customs duties, import and sales taxes on my behalf in chat session 2287646. Rep Olivia F. asked me to contact with FedEx(since they are the carrier company), I refused to do that by saying newegg is the one who has a deal with FedEx, they are the FedEx's customer not me but tried it anyway, fedex.com told me to contact FedEx Turkey, but FedEx Turkey never answered my e-mails.   In that chat session (2287646) Olivia F. also said that ""The tax amount shown during checkout is an estimate. If it is not enough, you need to pay for the left"" which is the exact opposite of what their webpage says. When I reminded her what it says on their website she also said ""It(custom fee) will not be charged by us, but we cannot guarantee the shipping carrier will charge the tax or not."" Again i'm not the customer of FedEx, they cannot charge me and I haven't been inform about this.  *reason for including chat session numbers and dates is I'm gonna cross post this to /r/newegg*"	Yes
I am recently divorced, I have to take him to court over the stupidest things to get him to do. I couldn't get my old tax returns without a long process from the IRS because he denied me access to the info I needed, so we went to court and judge ordered him to give it to me. We had agreed that since we were married all of last year and only separated in August, that we would still file jointly, and then do it separate after that. I am 99% sure he has already filed for last year, but I never saw it and I never signed it. He also hasn't given me my portion of the tax return. Is it fair that I am only supposed to get a third of that tax return? And what can i do to find out if he has already filed? The IRS is a NIGHTMARE to deal with. I can't talk to a person to save my life.	Yes
"I've been eating at a particular Carl's Jr restaurant. I am always greeted in the drive-thru with an immediate promotion, which I have to decline politely, before I get a chance to speak and order what I actually want. After my order is taken, the employee will always prompt me with an upsell, ""add a cookie for just a dollar?"" or something similar. However recently I noticed one employee was automatically increasing my combo to a medium, which costs more than the regular small size. At first I let it go. But today I decided to order inside at the counter. I recognized the employee as the same one that took my drive-thru order last time. As soon as I stated which combo I wanted, she automatically reached for the medium-sized soda cup and that's when I had enough. I pushed it back and told her that I didn't ask for medium, to please give me regular size.  I was very annoyed by this type of slimmy sales tactic--I wish I caught it on video (next time I visit, I will record with my mobile). Is this illegal? Can fast-food employees try to slip a fast one on me without first asking if I want the bigger size combo? I can only imagine how many people didn't notice and paid more without knowing, or guys like me who noticed it right away and now have to deal with this pushy sales trick all the time.  Is it worth writing an email to Carl's Jr. complaint department? Should I catch this on camera?"	Yes
Hello,  I recently moved about 30 minutes to be closer to my office. I noticed that my 2010 Audi A4 had a rough idle and then a check engine light came on. Since my old shop was about an hour away, I decided to simply bring it to the autoshop right behind my apartment building to get the issue diagnosed. I want to note that this shop had almost all positive reviews online and belonged to a company with multiple locations although I dont think it is a national chain or anything.  I dropped the car off overnight, and they called me the next day saying my spark plugs needed to be replaced along with 4 coilpacks. They quoted me a price over double what my old shop would do it for so I told them to simply put everything back together so I could drive it over to that shop when I had time. I will also note that I just had the sparkplugs replaced by the previous shop only 3 months earlier as part of a general tune up, and have not had anything but an oil change done since.  When I get to my main shop, an Audi specific shop thats been in business for quite some time run by someone who is pretty well known in the local car scene, he pulls off the engine cover and the Volkswagen Auto Group electrical connectors leading to the coilpacks are completely damaged. As if whoever was removing them last didnt know the trick to opening VAG connectors.  I ended up needing more than just the recommended service, turns out after smoking the engine I had a failing rear main seal which I had a third shop fix under warranty.  I told my main shop to order new electrical connectors, and they say its going to be about 200 dollars out the door to replace. Im sure I could do it myself for almost nothing but I dont want to be wasting my time working on my car for someone elses mistake especially since its winter and I dont have a garage. Im in the process of writing a letter to their central office but Im not entirely sure what to say. Does anyone know what it takes to file a small claim in MN if they say no? Im very upset they would cause this damage and not tell me.  I have all recipients.	Yes
"Asking for a good friend.  Had some custom work done to his truck: application of a ""ceramic nano coat"" to protect it while off-roading.  Was supposed to be the whole truck.    After a pretty intense weekend wheeling thru brush and what not, friend came back and washed truck and found the ceramic coating was only applied to hood, bumper, and sides up to wheel well.  Sides and bed of truck didn't get the treatment and are scratched to hell.  Cost of treatment was originally ~$6k.  Normally I know one should sue in small claims if the business fails to make it right.  However, while my friend was out wheeling the guy sold the business and permanently moved overseas.  Apparently he screwed a lot of people in the process, not just my friend, with incomplete or shoddy work on some pretty high-end vehicles.  Up until this the guy had a stellar reputation.  The new business bought the lease, name, and assets, but does that mean they also bought the past accounts, responsibility for the work done by previous owner, etc?    The new shop owner is upset at the previous owner but isn't cutting my friend any sort of deal on making him whole - is charging him to fix the paint and cost of the ceramic coating again.      On the one hand, my friend scratched the hell out his own truck by hitting the brush, but on the other hand he thought he had a complete ceramic coating.  Where the coating was installed it performed as expected - no damage.    Cost to repair the paint and finish applying the ceramic coat will be under $10k, the max small claims here in California, but from whom should my friend try and recoup?  Realistically, what are my friend's options here?"	Yes
Some months back I witnessed a bad motorcycle accident that happened at the intersection entrance to the local hospital. I honestly thought the motorcycle driver was going to die because I saw the impact and his body fly through the air and land head first on the pavement (he didn't die, just in case you wonder). I was very freaked out and got out of my car and ran over to him. Another person had just gotten to him and yelled for me to go get help, so I did - I just blindly ran without thinking beyond I needed to get someone at the hospital to come help him. The direction I ran in had a decorative metal picket fence that surrounded some bushes (this was on the hospital grounds). In my panic I went over the fence instead of taking the extra time to run back and go around it.  When I went over the fence one of the metal pickets caught on my hand and sliced open the skin between two of my fingers. I got help, went back, met with the police and gave a witness statement, and then a doctor who had come out to see what was happening noticed my hand was pouring out blood and said to go to the emergency room and they'd 'take care of me.' So I went to ER and told them my story, and then told the doctor who gave me stitches and a tetanus shot, and then told the guy who came out afterwards from billing. He asked at some point if 'this is a liability thing,' and I said I didn't know and just told him what happened. He changed the subject and then took my card to charge my co-pay. Some weeks after I received a bill for another $149 that my insurance didn't pay.   My question is - is this 'a liability thing'? Should the hospital waive this bill or not? I tried looking up the relevant laws and didn't understand enough to know what to think. I tried calling the hospital's risk management department but they didn't return my 2 calls. I don't want any money from them, I just don't want to pay this $149. Also, if it is 'a liability thing' what would happen with the payment my insurance made? Thank you!	Yes
I am from Canada so I am not terribly familiar with this situation under state laws. My friend has a sister who has been in the ICU for a couple weeks now and requires heart surgery. Without the surgery she will die, and even with it, it is highly likely she will die. They are a very poor family and already struggle to make ends meet. If the sister dies, are the parents responsible for outstanding debt?   I thought a hospital bill can only be charged to the patient, an insurance company or if someone had signed something. Just looking for some advice on how this sort of stuff works and where to go from here.	Yes
I purchased a computer and it cost over $1500. The computer was slow, incredible heavy, and very large. This was a computer that was stated as mandatory by the university but when you get there you quickly realize that is not the case. I emailed the support email stating that this computer does not seem adequate to what needs to be done, and compared to the other options. They asked me to meet with them and offered to replace the computer with another model. I accepted the offer but now they want me to meet with a guy from the company that made the computer. I waited for the email from this corporate guy and it took about a month. He has been slow to reply ever since then. I'm talking a week or days. He set up a meeting for a few weeks out, then emailed me a few days later saying he was in town, give him a call, and we can meet if I'm available. I called, no answer, left a voice mail, no call back, emailed mentioning the call and that he could call back at any time that suits him, no email back for 3 days so far.   At this point I am just tired of the process. I don't really want to deal with this any more and the weak computer seems to be less of a hassle than this process. What can I do? do I have to keep going through this process?       ---      **tl;dr**: Customer service of university offered to replace computer and the process is just incredibly tiring. They are slow to reply and it seems to be more work than its worth	Yes
I am currently battling with my insurance company about my claims. This is not for an car accident claims. Just strictly medical treatment and I am in the State of Washington.   I started receiving medical treatment back in April 2016. and inquired about starting my claims in September 2016. I made all the inquiries through emails and never actually submitted my claims. They told told me is that, in order for them to reimburse me, I have to make the payment out of pocket. I did not have the money to pay for the expenses at the time so delayed my claims. They NEVER told me that I have to submit my claims within 180 days of my services.  I finally was able to make payments on the medical services in July 2017. Subsequently, I my claims and the Company deny reimbursement for treatment received from April 2016 through December 2016 since it was outside of the 180 days window.   I was doing some research and it mentioned something about Washington State is a notice prejudice state but I am not sure if it has been extended to health insurance claims.   Am I out of luck? Is there anything that can help me?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
On last months wireless bill AT&amp;T did not include the amount for my installment plan, and it wasn't even mentioned on the bill. One this months bill, which I'm calling this months bill because the amount due for the billing period is due this month, they included both last months and this months installment payment. The amount per installment is $61.50. Times two, $122 on this months bill.  Now, these also are the final two payments of the the installment agreement. The device is payed off after this periods bill is payed.  I contacted AT&amp;T via chat, phone, and visiting a retail store(who politely informed me everything is done over phone and they don't know why I was sent there), and I asked them if I could have one of the two installments moved to next month.  They refused, and insisted that I pay the entire bill amount. I said I was open to other arrangements to lower this months bill and pay the rest later, and reminded them that it was AT&amp;T who made the mistake by not including it in my bill the previous month. One of the 7 or 8 people I spoke with said that it was a known issue that happened to several of their customers last month, and was resolved.  I don't think I should have to pay the $61.50 that AT&amp;T neglected to include in my bill and then added the next month without notice. However I am willing to pay it if they spread the 2 payments over 2 months as they should be. I did not ask AT&amp;T to forgive the installment, but I did tell them many times that I was willing to do it over two months, inline with what I originally agreed when I bought the device.  First, what organization(s) should I report AT&amp;T to, and how should I do it?  Second, how can I best get out of paying the $61.50 they did not charge me one month? What legal grounds do I have there?  Thank you for your help. I realize the dollar amount here is not that much, but AT&amp;T's absolute refusal to work with me on payment options makes me want to pursue legal options.	Yes
Great Grandpa recently passed and at the settling of his estate me and my brother were presented with envolopes that had our names on them that were full of bonds our great grandparents had purchased in our names when we were born and while we were young. We have not cashed any of them in yet, but now members of our family are telling us to not cash them in due to the fact that none of the family outside of my Grandpa was present for the reading of the will. They are claiming it'd be illegal in some way or another. The bonds are in our names and all. Is this just a load of bull shit or do they have something here? Thanks in advance for any advice I get here.	Yes
I inherited an apartment from my grandfather in Hong Kong, and I receive $5000hkd from it monthly. I give this entire amount to my mother who lives in China. Do I have to pay taxes on this amount?	Yes
My brother got into some trouble with the law in Dec. 2015 and he got arrested. My cousin and I went to bail him out everything went well, we paid them as agreed. I thought it was all over then but now they're saying that my brother skipped court one day in Apr. 2016 &amp; which forfeited the bond and cost them $450.  They want $668.99. $450 demand amount, $55 filing fee, $14 service fee &amp; $149.99 attorney fee.  Is there anything I can do? I have until 7/31 to respond.	Yes
I signed up for the UFC gym in South Florida back in September. I had purchased a groupon for 30$ for a one month trial. I wanted to get a full membership when I went in to sign up, so they told me that they would waive the enrollment fee and I would have to pay first month ($59), last month($63), and the processing fee($52).  They had a tentative opening date which kept getting pushed back. There are loads of disgruntled people that left angry facebook comments expressing their frustration. So I spoke with the manager and asked if they could push back the activation of my membership until I officially started using the gym. My thought process was why get stuck paying two memberships if the date is pushed back again and I am forced to get another month at my current gym and they then open up midway through my last month.  Sure enough the date was pushed back from end of October until the end of November. So I continued using my current gym until mid December when I first started going to the UFC gym. I was told that I wouldn't have to pay until my third month because my first month was already paid for and the groupon was taking care of the second month.  On December 23rd I check in to the gym and the lady at the counter says that my balance is past due. I was confused, but then spoke to the guy who signed me up who still remembered who I was and said to comeback when the manager was here and we'd get it taken care of. After a couple weeks of being given the run around, I speak with the guy who signed me and the manager and explain the situation. Apparently I never got credit for the groupon, and my first month that was paid for went into effect as soon as they opened (as opposed to it taking effect once I had actually started using the gym).   I explain the whole situation to the manager and he agrees that my membership should have started once I started using the gym not when they opened, and he also agreed that I should be given credit for the groupon. He tells the guy who signed me up to leave a note on his desk and he'll take care of it by not charging me anything for the following two months.  The next month comes around, and I am charged again. I explain the situation again to the guy who signed me and he said to speak to the manager. This guy is elusive as fuck. Never at the gym. I asked one of the workers who I happened to know if he was in one day, and she said no and asked what she could help with. I get the guy who signed me up and explained the whole situation to her, and was like I just want my money refunded. We go to the computer and  says she all she could was waive the bill for the following to months. I agree to this and actually see her make the changes on the computer.  Next month comes around, and I am charged yet again. By this point I'm honestly over it and say I will take care of it later. I am in the process of writing an email to UFC gym in hopes that they once and for all refund me for the two months I should have never paid for. I have the necessary proof, the date I officially started going to that gym, the groupon, my bank statements with proof that I paid, the contract, the guy who signed me up remembers, and if he is feeling forgetful I also have my friend that made the changes.   I am hoping that'll be enough to get them to give me my refund, however if they don't, what are my options? Thanks in advance!	Yes
Hello,  First time on this thread so please bear with me! First of all, thank you to everyone for taking the time to read my post.  I owe someone money (less than 9K) and signed a promissory note that I will pay the person $400 a month until the debt is paid. Recently, he told me that he was updating the addresses on the note and would like me to sign the note again with the updated addresses. This is fine, and I would read over it carefully to make sure nothing is amiss. What kind of irks me was that he wanted a photo copy of my ID, a billing statement/utility bill showing my address.  Am I legally obligated to hand over this information to this person? Thank you again for reading through this post!  **TL;DR: Person I owe money to wants a photocopy of my ID and billing statement/utility bill. Unsure if I'm obligated to give this information to him.**	Yes
A few weeks ago I bought something online.  The seller hasn't shipped and refuses to refund.  It it extortion if I tell the seller I will call my bank and do a chargeback if they don't ship or refund by a specific date and time?	Yes
"I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.  He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.  The day of my flight to California I texted him to confirm that he could still host me, still wanted me to come, and could still afford everything. I even told him if money was an issue for him we could reschedule and I could meet him another time.  I got on my flight, and when I landed and called him he told me his check didn't go through, and that I was on my own. I have his address, his full name, as well as some of his family members added on Facebook.  I have incurred costs from a hotel, as well as a very expensive flight back home 2 days later. I had planned to stay 2 weeks, but since he would not even agree to meet out of embarrassment I decided to leave ASAP.  Could I legally take him to court because he agreed over text and email? I had asked him multiple times, as late as before I even boarded the plane to make sure he still wanted me to come and was able to host me during my stay.   I wouldn't have got on the plane if he had just told me he didn't have the money. I'm incredibly upset by the whole situation and at this point I just want the money back for the 2 nights at the hotel and the flight back home.   Would suing him in small claims be realistic or do verbal or text agreements not hold up in small claims court?   I have him plenty of oppurtunities to speak up and potentially mitigate and costs I would incur but he literally waited until he knew I was on my way. The last text I got before landing was ""are you ok the plane?"" To which I told him I was boarding. I honestly think the guy did it purposefully. Do I have a chance at winning a suit against him if I file? The total cost for the 2 nights and the flight was $976.40."	Yes
"I apologize in advance for totally butchering this but I really don't know the lingo.  February 2016 I was in a car accident (we were rear-ended). I opted to get checked out when EMS came by, they drove me to a nearby hospital, no big deal just some prescribed painkillers for the neck/back pain and headache.  Turns out the car that hit us was a professional driving service, currently on the job driving a couple to some event. It also turned out that the father of the driver of the car I was in was a lawyer. He drove to meet us at the hospital.  He offers to represent us and sue the company. I say that sounds alright, so I signed something saying he would be representing me in that civil suit, and he would only charge a percent of whatever the outcome is. He starts badgering me over the next 2-3 months or so to get physical therapy and send him the bills. I know he's just looking to blow up the damages he's seeking in the suit, but I'm feeling okay enough and I really didn't have insurance or the money to drop on the therapy when I didn't know what would happen with the suit.  So debt collecting agencies start calling me from both the EMS that drove me to the hospital and the hospital charging me for the check up. This goes on for a few months before I say ""I have a lawyer working on this case seeking damages from the company that rear-ended us"" and they just ask for his info and that's it. Haven't heard from the agencies since January 2017.  So back to my lawyer, he's totally MIA. I have not heard a word from him about the case. Is it normal for this to take almost a year and a half? I signed a contract with the guy, but I don't have a copy. Is there any way I can demand something out of this? I really need some updates especially since I don't know what's up with the debt collectors and when they'll be back. Also, is it possible that it's just too late now to pursue a civil suit? The accident was in February 2016.  For more context, the accident happened in the Bethesda, Maryland area. I'm a college student in DC, but my permanent residence is in Florida. I gave the hospital and EMS my DC address, so that's where I've been receiving the letters from them but I'm moving next month. Also, I haven't checked my credit reports, but I use CapitalOne's CreditWise credit tracker and the debts haven't been reported, is this normal too?  TL;DR I signed a contract with a lawyer to pursue a case against a professional driving services company for rear-ending me. I haven't heard from the lawyer in months. Debt collectors hounded me until I told them I had a lawyer working on pursuing damages from the company. I want this case to move forward. What should I do?"	Yes
I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	Yes
I'm 21 years old and I'm in the process of starting up a online retail company.  After searching online I found a website design and hosting company. Requested a call and the sales person I spoke to gave a good sales pitch and I was eager to go ahead.  I described the website I wanted at length and he said that this would not be an issue and stated that £4,500 would be sufficient and this is their 'silver design package'. After some deliberating and further discussion with him I went ahead and paid for the first of three installments. They sent me a design brief to fill in for them to be able to start designing the website. NOTE: I did not fill in this design brief, so no designs will have been carried out and nothing has been done by them apart from set up an account for me on their site.  I was struggling with the terminology of the form as relatively new to website design so called their support desk, and at first had to wait 7 days to talk to some. When they got around to phoning me there were several language barriers as English was not their first language. So I went away from, losing some confidence in the overall process.  I was then contacted by the salesman saying that after a further review of my website functionalities the design cost would actually be around £10,000.  Basically to summarise, I dealt with their technical team a few more times and each time left me feeling less and less confident in their abilities so I sent an email to the original salesman asking for a refund, but hinting that I would be back, but that I need the money for another venture and that the website would have to take a back seat, but when I did come back I would upgrade the package. Hoping that this would act as an incentive for them to refund me.  I received a reply stating that after speaking to the managers they would like me to comply with the terms and conditions and pay the additional £3,000. So initially this completely took me off guard, as I did tick the terms and conditions and I thought I would have to pay. After rereading the t&amp;cs, nowhere does it state that the full sum must be paid, only that if it is not paid, they are allowed to freeze the service. Also that no refund of the initial installment for the service will be given. They are also under french jurisdiction as I later found out. So after some research this is what I replied with:  Hi Zak,  I understand where you are coming from, but I would argue that the terms and conditions are void, based on the fact that in our correspondence prior to payment we discussed the entire website including the affiliate section and you proposed the silver design package, stating it would be sufficient. If there were concerns regarding the complexity of the website, these could have been expanded on before the finalised quote.  Regarding the actual design of the website and use of £1,500, no actual work has carried out as I have not submit the design brief. I appreciate that you may deduct some expenses from the £1,500 to cover your time, but aside from that very little has happened.  It would not be unreasonable for me to state that the item I purchased is not up to the ‘expected standard’ and therefore a refund within a 2-year period is required from French Consumer Legal Guarantees. From what I've stated above and based on the following:  The technical support team took 10 working days to transfer my domain to GODADDY. I raised 5 separate tickets asking them for an update on the process, with only 1 receiving a response. The ticket was eventually closed when they gave me the login to GANDI. Stating that I would have to carry out the domain transfer myself, but on your website it states that a domain transfer should take 72 hours.  The original support ticket did not request a domain transfer as I asked how it's possible to get a refund on a domain name. This was not answered and they instead sent me a link for a domain transfer. I know that for a ‘.co.uk’ site all that is required is the IPS tag change, so for it to take 10 working days for them to respond is completely unreasonable and leaves me with little faith in their response time.  I also experienced great difficulty in conveying my website idea to the designer I spoke with, albeit partly down to language barriers. It was my understanding that the website design had been fully understood before making payment, but your designer had very little knowledge of it.  I hope we can resolve this mater in a way that leaves us both satisfied.    I'm still waiting a response, but if anyone has any advice on how I should proceed with this and if I have any legal ground to stand on in court that would be much appreciated. Just as a young man looking to start up a business, I feel like they were almost trying a scare tactic just to get me to pay straight away and as they havent actually provided me a service, and there has only been 6 emails back and forth between us, it just feels like sharp practice.	Yes
Hey y'all,   So my S/O and I have been trying to buy a home for some time now, and have our hearts set on a property listed for ~150k. We have had some financial ups and downs in the last five years and can't qualify for a loan. A member of my S/O's family has offered to start transferring a small amount money every week into an account in S/O's name. We don't know where this money is coming from, and they don't want to claim it on their taxes. Is their a legal way to accept and claim this kind of money or does this just stink to high hell as I am inclined to believe?  Thanks in advance for you rational responses.	Yes
I wanted to get my watch fixed, the repairman said they would get it fixed for $1,000. It took them 3 months to get back to me and in the end, it still did not work. He refused to give back a refund, what legal action should I take to get the $1,000 back?	Yes
I joined a gym, which oddly didn't make me sign a contract. It has been month to month, with credit card on file getting charged automatically every 1st day of the month. I decided not to go to this gym anymore and cancelled the credit card they had on file. Now, two months after I stopped going to this gym, they are trying to get me to pay for the two missed months. They say that the rules are laid out on their website that you must cancel in writing by the 15th of the month for changes to the next month. Can they actually charge me based on something their website says even though I didn't sign anything?	Yes
"So pretty much I've been soliciting spells and rituals on apps like whisper. I have them pay me over paypal, and send them instructions for the ritual. I never promise health benefits or weight loss. I've sold two so far. A love spell and ""spiritual cleansing"". Both at 20 a spell. Can I be sued for selling a phony spell?  Is there anything I can add like a disclaimer or something to prevent someone from trying to sue me?"	Yes
"I listed an item for sale on the app LetGo for $300. I received a full price offer and provided my PO Box for payment. Since then I've had several red flags.   * The buyer asked for my phone number for the check, and since we've been communicating via text. The buyer has used two different phone numbers.  * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment.   * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.  * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.  * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.  * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.  Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.  Aside from not cashing the check what is my legal obligation at this point?  I've googled the credit union in GA and am considering calling them tomorrow to alert them.  In addition should I take the check to the police? Right now all i have is the check, the LetGo user information, and the two phone numbers the scammer used."	Yes
"I own an SEO company and we do legit work.  We have been in this space since 2007 and have had 0 complaints and no chargebacks.  A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results.   2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.    After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.  Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.  He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..    My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.    We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.  We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.  Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.   TL;DR client hired us and did a chargeback which we won, now is threatening legal action in the form of criminal complaints if we do not refund him."	Yes
I’m currently in settlement negotiations with a creditor for approximately $3k.  It’s not a whole lot of money, so I am trying to negotiate that the creditor remove all information in my credit report before paying them.  The attorney representing the creditor said ‘no,’ but I can’t imagine the creditor willing to pay more for a lawsuit than what it actually owed.  Do I have any leverage here at all? Does the creditor even own the account anymore or did they account to the law firm? The creditor is a nationwide company.  Any info or advice about negotiations would be appreciated.  Please hold any holier-than-thou speeches of paying bills on time.  Thank you.	Yes

Just recently sold a car in California (where the law states a vehicle has to be sold smogged by the seller) that was not smogged. The purchaser signed a bill of sale noting the vehicle was not smogged and was sold as is (may make no difference).  The buyer did not know how to drive a stick and burnt up the clutch in the first 12 hours of driving the vehicle. He's aware that legally I was supposed to smog it. Not he's trying to sue me for the cost of the car plus tow bills and repairs. How far can get in small claims court past me just refunding him the money and me getting the broken car back. Do I have any leg to stand on? I was upfront with all issues the car had in the ad. 	Yes
"I've been homeless on and off again (since 17, I'm 20 now), and have really been working on getting my life together this year. Since I got a little bit of a savings together, and the job market around me has been awful lately, I decided to spent most of it ($800) on a scooter because a local shop that does deliveries that I used to work at (Jimmy John's) was hiring again. I figured I could make the pay the driver's do, just without having to pay for insurance, as the scooter is a 50cc.    I looked around and found a dealership selling them unused at low prices. I was ensured a 30-day warranty, and recieved a sheet along with my title after purchase saying as much. However, after using my scooter for a few weeks, it began to have issues starting up, and stalled often. I was still within the warranty, which the owner of the shop said in the case of that sort of thing happening would cover issues.   My boyfriend and I brought the scooter in and the guy who ran the place was extremely short tempered. My boyfriend had also sat up with me and tried Youtube videos that instructed on ways to start it with a kickstart and whatnot (nothing that would void the warranty) and he refused to believe we were having the problems that we were. He even started getting very short and argumentative with me despite me simply asking questions. It got to a point that he refused to answer me when I spoke to him and instead talked to my boyfriend. I am legitimately afraid of what would have happened had he not been there because he was so upset that he had his hands in a shaking fist, as if to stop him from doing something to me. He claimed that he would keep it until the following Tuesday (maybe 5 days from then -- not within the warranty, but his mechanic wasn't in town until then, he said) to ""make me happy"" but that he assured his scooters didn't have issues starting up even though the two of us saw with our own eyes after an hour of attempting to start it that it wouldn't work.   So we get the scooter back on Tuesday and of course after a day of use it's back to the exact same problems. I saw that the company I bought it from had 4 of 5 stars but I hadn't checked what the reviews really said because it seemed legit since there were 33 of them, so I assumed there were more good than bad. One of the reviews mentioned a bout of suspected racism. It's important to note that I am black, and my boyfriend is white. Besides me being a woman and this guy  maybe having some traditional ""talk to the man during a sale, not the woman"" (He'd made crude remarks about my intelligence when we spoke to him before dropping the bike off), some of his rage could be from the fact that I'm black. With all that I know about this situation, I've come up with a plan of sorts, but I'm not 100% sure of the legalities involved.    I want to start all this by going outside and trying to start it again, but getting it on video and mentioning today's date, what's been wrong with it, etc. I want a few minutes of me starting it up. After that doesn't work, I want to call them and ask for a receipt from them ""fixing"" my bike so it's on record that that happened (They did it for free so they just had us take it back without any proof --  I know, I didn't think about it until we left). From there, I'll call him (the owner) myself and talk to him about the issues I'm STILL having with the scooter -- I've had my boyfriend call up until this point because I've legitimately been kind of scared of this guy blowing up at me (I have PTSD and a history of abuse) -- but this time, record him mentioning the dates of fixing it, and the fact that we brought it to him, that we were within warranty, etc. What I predict is him to actually speak his mind and blow up at me as well to make my point seem even more valid. From there, two options:   1.) My SO's mom is a paralegal who has contact with a host of lawyers willing to do immediate pro-bono work. I want to sue in small claims and get my money back. Until then, I'll get my scooter repaired at a local shop and keep the receipts from that. If all of this works out, I'd still like to go through with option two as well, but I'm not sure if the legalities of it:  2.) If she's unable to get someone to help us, then (and I know this seems kind of petty, but I honestly want other people to not buy from these monsters) I would like to have both my boyfriend and I leave a one-star review on their site along with a link to a YouTube video of the footage that I have edited in with an on-screen transcript of our call and the audio from the call. I know that Georgia has a one-party consent law, so I wouldn't need their permission to use the audio, but could I be sued at that point for posting that sort of thing? I'm assuming I'd have to use rhetoric that doesn't necessarily say ""Don't shop here"" but simply state the facts about the situation, facts being that I am having tons of trouble with them and that they are not fixing my bike."	Yes
I live in WA state for reference.  Suppose that I vacate my apartment, and the landlord sends me an itemized list of charges from my security deposit within the 21 days, along with a small refund check.  Is there a deadline to dispute the charges? Also, does cashing the check imply that I accept the charges?	Yes
"However yesterday they called me and asked me for my account and transit number because ""They are not in the check that you gave us""   Now I assure you I gave a legit check in fact it was from the same stack that I gave to them the last new car I bought.  I think they lost my void check. What do I do in my situation? Is it safe to have a lost check out there? Does the dealership have any standing to make me replace void check?   What if I catch them in a lie and they verbally admit they lost my check and lied about the no account number stuff. (Canada is 1 party consent I double checked)   Should I just send in another check?"	Yes
I'm just wondering if I'm opening myself up to anything here. I bought a car last year and was told that it had a clean title. When I asked if it had been in any accidents they avoided the question. I Carfaxed the car a couple months ago and found out it was a total loss rebuilt that is somehow not marked on the title.   I submitted a BBB complaint and the owner has done nothing but make up lies, saying I was told about the damage and repair before purchase, and even lying by saying I hadn't driven the car prior to purchase.  It's ridiculous, and at this point if I'm not going to be compensated I will make sure others know about their practices.	Yes
"Hello. I have never used reddit before so I'm sorry if I do anything wrong or I am in the wrong place, just let me know.    I am a current customer of Sprint. I set up my account with them on May 14,2017. This would make my billing due date the 14th of each month. I enrolled in the auto-pay to receive a discount on my bill as well, and was told that my bill would be $175.81 a month.   However, I noticed that this date would not work for me, it didn't coincidence with my pay dates from my employer. So I called to see about having my billing due date changed to make sure that each month I would have the funds in my checking account to accommodate the bill, at which point the person I talked to said ""Sure no problem"", never having mention that by doing this it would cause me to be doubled billed the next month.     When I looked at my account and found out about being double billed, I called to inquire about the double charges and was told that was policy whenever you request a change in the billing due date. They credited my account $20.00 for my inconvenience, whatever. I was pissed but ok, I accepted that.   Today, on July 15th, I received a text message from Sprint saying that they tried two times to retrieve my payment!  What the Hell! Its only the 15th why are they attempting to take the payment now? I didn't have the $231.36 in my account, so I called to tell them that each time they try to collect the payment (that isn't even due for four more days), they caused my account to be charged $25.00 in NSF fees, making it a total of $50.00 worth of NSF fees (so far).   I called to have them explain to me why they have done this and to request that they put back the $50.00, because my account is now overdrawn, only to be transferred to 10 different people, and was treated like I was dumb and told that there isn't anything they can do to help me. Two different people said that they would stay on top of this, that it would be back into my account by the end of the day today was told to hang on while they put in the final notes to assure me that it would be resolved, only to be transferred to another person who doesn't know what is going on. At this point I just want my money back, but all I got was ""Take a deep breath"" and ""calm down"" and ""we can not assist you"". What am I supposed to do now? I have bills that come out tomorrow and no money to pay them.   Were they even allowed to charge me before my bill was due?? Is there anything at all that I can do?"	Yes
"Hello! So here is what happened:    Back in April I paid $250 to have a self-employed stylist (she goes to people houses to do hair) to give me a ""brazilian blow-out"". For those of you who dont know what that is, here is the definition:    Brazilian hair straightening (also called Breezilian straightening, Brazilian Keratin Treatment, BKT, Brazilian Blowout, Escova Progressiva, Keratin Cure) are a semi-permanent hair straightening method done by temporarily sealing a liquid keratin and a preservative solution into the hair with a hair iron.   Typically this is supposed to last 10-12 weeks.   Well I paid her for this service, and awoke the next morning to discover my hair was a giant frizzy poofy mess (my baseline). I have had these done before in the past at salon's so I knew what to expect (not this); this was the first time I had used this individual.   I contacted her via facebook, as that was how we were communicating, informing her that her treatment did not work whatsoever and that I either want a refund or a treatment that actually works.   She blocked me.   I attempted to contact her via telephone and got no response.   Seeing as I didn't want to pay $250 for someone to shampoo and straighten my hair for an evening and given that I attempted to get a refund from her, I contacted my bank to dispute the charge on the basis of not receiving services I should have. (Of note, there was no 'no refund' agreement with this individual)  The bank decided in my favor and returned the amount to my account.   She has now charged me $250 again, without my permission and without contacting me.   Where do I go from here? Thank you in advance!"	Yes
I took out a student loan in 2013 to attend trade school with a company called TFG and we paid those off in full. Now - 4 years later - NELNET is calling me saying that I have a student loan that is delinquent and will need to pay or it will start affecting my credit.   I know for a fact that we never took out federal student loans. What do I do?	Yes
He is my coworker. I have known him over five years and we have been close the entire time. I have always helped him out with money, food, rides, and everything. He says he does not have a bank account and I know he has been struggling. He said he would give me $30,000 of the money in return for all the years I helped him and for taking the money in my bank account. Am I going to be scammed? Can I be taxed for taking the money into my account? Does this seem legal?	Yes
"I live in Omaha, Nebraska. My old apartment charged me rent for the month of July, but my last day of residency was June 30th 2017. Due to another semi-unexpected expense, this overdrafted my account by a fair amount and I have so far been charged 2 overdraft fees and will likely have an ""extended overdraft"" fee added on before I am paid and can be back in the black. Rent was set up to be paid automatically through their web portal, and I had not cancelled it, thinking it was unnecessary as I had signed all the paperwork to move out.   The property manager had called me July 3rd, telling me the automatic system had charged me, I went to my bank to try and stop payment, but it appears it was too late. I contacted my bank Friday to file a dispute, and then contacted the property owned Monday. They agreed to pay back the amount, but denied responsibility and so would not pay the overdraft fee, claiming it was my responsibility to cancel the payment. I wasn't happy with that, but $35 didn't seem worth the hassle and cancelled the dispute with my bank. Now that it is 2 fees, as a second bill came due before I was paid, and potentially a 3rd fee, I'm less inclined to accept that and considering my options, if I have any. I was wondering if I am indeed liable for not cancelling the autopay set up through their portal, and if I am not, if this would be worth pursuing in small claims or through my bank."	Yes
This might be stupid but I'm just covering my bases.  A telemarketer called me on behalf of the Association of State Troopers of America or something like that asking for a donation. He was nice, and I figured why not help the police and said I would send 20 bucks. He got my mailing address to send the form.   I hang up and google the number, apparently they're a huge telemarketer known for scams, fake collections, selling insurance, etc. I'd rather just not donate now but since I agreed to, can I be held liable?	Yes
So back in 2007 I moved out of the apartment I shared with my boyfriend at the time. He had thrashed a bunch of my belongings during a rough breakup and I had filed a police report, but eventually dropped the charges the police were planning on filing (domestic violence). He continued to live there, and I moved on. I NEVER signed the lease, but had agreed to be listed as an occupant - I don't recall if that involved giving them my social security number but they must have had it because when my ex left the apartment he did so a month early and didn't pay that rent. When I got the call from collections (now living in CA) I was super confused and asked if his name was also on the debt. They said no, it was just me.  Yes, I've waited a LONG ASS time to do anything, mostly because I have moved states a couple of times and have not been financially in a position to pursue him legally. I've asked him a couple of times to do the ethical thing and pay me the $700 but he is cheap and mean and will not.  At this point I get I may not have legal recourse, but just curious if this was even legal to do to a non-lease holder and would there be any way to remove the debt?	Yes
Short story: I was hired to fix several issues with a small company website. This included copywriting, minor code fixes via  Wix and fixing a major fubar with their domain. A predecessor had registered the domain in their personal name. Not the company. After lots of conversations with GoDaddy support, I was finally able to access the account, pay for the registration for the next two years and transfer the account to my name. I did it this way because the company would literally not give me any info on whom I should set it up under and I was under a deadline to get the domain transfered.   Question: Can I hold on to the domain as registered owner until if and when they pay me the low four figures they owe me? It's mostly to prove a point to them, not really profit. I ran a url valuation on the .com and it's worth less than $200, so I am almost tempted to just ask for that. Any NAL advice appreciated.  Location: California	Yes
I need to file a small claims proceedings against a large national chain. The location I dealt with is now closed permanently (part of why I am suing). How do I determine who exactly I file the action against? The main corporate office (national)? A state or regional office if i can find that? How does that work?	Yes
"I paid off one of my credit cards completely and then tried to charge about $7 on it at a hardware store and it declined. Concerned, I checked my recent transactions and discovered 3 charges that were around $50 made to Uber. The charges were not made on my Uber account, but by someone that Uber support identified as ""Josh"". They refuse to tell me where the charges were made. Do I have the right to know this because it was my credit card? The last place I used it was at a local craft store and there is a guy there who goes by that name. I'm not trying to get revenge or anything, I just want to know if I should stop shopping at that store or if it was an unrelated incident."	Yes
I attended their PhD visiting week for which they said they would pay me back travel expenses up to a certain amount ($500), and they would pay for the hotel.  I get to the hotel, and I have to put my card on file.  After visiting week, I call and find out that the hotel charged me for one night (~150$). I email NYU's department and they said it was a mistake and they would pay me back for that.  This was in March. I've been in a back and forth up until a week ago (early July) trying to get my payment done. They claimed they had problems with the vendor system. I am owed ~435$ for travel (within $500 limit) + ~150$ for that night in the hotel room they didnt cover. They only paid me 500$.  They no longer answer their emails about the remaining $85 and have been pretty slow at answering email about the last $500 since March.  Is there any way I can get my $85 back?	Yes
I was riding down a street in the bike lane. There were cars to my left and one turned right into a driveway cutting me off. They were close enough to me that I had to slam on my breaks or else I would slam into the car. I went over the handle bars and landed on the asphalt right next to their car. I sustained no major injuries but cuts and contusions and I'm going to have a hard time walking for a little while. My bike kept going and it got run over by their car being completely destroyed. The driver was immediately apologetic and claimed responsibility. They provided me with their contact and insurance information.   So my problem here is I'm not exactly sure how to proceed. I'd prefer not to get lawyers involved because she was extremely nice and wanted to work with me on this. I do want her to pay for my hospital visit and a replacement to my bike. My bike I bought new and got it in a rare situation of the bike needing to be sold because it was a year old model and got it for about half the msrp with also haggling. I'm pretty sure I can't get a bike like that again for the price I paid for it.  My main questions: 1. I have not been in a situation like this before. Do I call her insurance right away and report the situation? 2. What do I tell them? (Might sound silly but I don't to say anything wrong that will prevent me from getting covered) 3. Can I provide them with the make and model of my bike to get the msrp value for it instead of receipt value?  Thanks in advance for any advice.	Yes
Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	Yes
"Hi there, my friend recently purchased ""African Black Soap"" from Shea Butter. She followed the directions for using the soap and it caused her to have chemical burns. She has been treated by a doctor who indeed said they are chemical burns. The ingredients seem to be a lie as well. Is there a lawsuit here? If so what is it?"	Yes
"I know I shouldn't have bought this car in the first place, first car I bought on my own, didn't know any better then, etc...  tl;dr: private seller misrepresented title, it was actually not in his name, I was able to contact the legal owner of the car and explain the situation to him, he understood and agreed to help resolve it, and failed to do so/lied about doing so on multiple occasions.  Full story: I bought a used car for 2 grand off a private seller (no dealership involved). Essentially the title was misrepresented at the time of sale, it wasn't in his name, but in the name of the previous owner. The seller had bought the car from the owner, who he knew as a cousin or something like that, and never titled it in his (the seller's) name. He did have the title document and gave it to me. The sale section on the back of the title was filled out in such a way that neither I nor the seller could transfer the title to one of our names. I also got a bill of sale to verify that cash had exchanged hands (at least some paper trail).   The locations of everything play a big part in the rest of the story: I live in MD. The seller lives in VA. The owner of the car lives in TX.  I worked with the seller to try and solve this in various ways, through trying the VA abandoned vehicle process, contacting the legal owner of the car in TX, and none of that worked out. The owner of the car said he would get a title copy and write it out in my name, but never did. The seller then paid a small dealership in VA to process the car through the abandoned vehicle process. They said that they had experience resolving title issues like this, and they could at least give me temporary plates to drive the car in the meantime. Fast forward several months (yes) of delays and ""it'll be ready in a couple weeks"", the dealership suddenly closes up without a warning, due to zoning rights issues or something.  A week or two after that, I call around a few lawyers to try and figure out what my rights are, or if anyone can help me out. Even the lawyers who work with auto titles don't have much of an answer for me. Lawyers in MD tell me it's in VA jurisdiction since that is where the sale occurred. VA lawyers tell me that I need to pressure the legal owner of the car. One unofficially told me that what the owner of the car is doing is considered fraud, since he is aware of the situation, and is allowing someone else (seller) to sell a car that is under his (owner) name and not resolving it.  I reach the owner and tell him this and he says he is unable to travel to the DMV, but will send a form in to have a title copy mailed. The limit for how long that should take, with processing and shipping times, is about 3 weeks later. That passed a couple days ago. I also was just able to reach the TX DMV and ask about the status of the title request. They never received a form. They also informed me that if the owner goes into the DMV, he will get a title copy on the spot, no waiting period.  So now I'm past giving either the seller or owner any more time or patience, and am trying to find a lawyer to at the very least send an official letter, probably to the owner. I haven't had luck getting a lawyer with a solid answer or consultation in VA. I am planning to call both the VA Bar and the TX Bar referral services, and explain this to them, and hopefully get a bit more direction, and at most a consultation with a lawyer experienced enough in this area. I don't even know where to start cold-calling lawyers in TX aside from that. Not to mention almost no free time during business hours to call either of those, between school and work.  So aside from calling the Bar referral services... what the hell do I do now? From what some lawyers have told me, the legal fees would exceed the money spent on the car, and that's money I don't have. It would almost be cheaper to just fly down to TX and drag the owner to the DMV, but there's many reasons why that couldn't really happen easily."	Yes
"I received a certified letter yesterday concerning credit card debt from 2 years ago.  A suit has been filed against me and I'm required to respond within 28 days.  I guess the big question then is, what now?  How do I handle this going forward?  Through some googling and digging, I've figured out that the debt is from a credit card 2 years ago, which was sold to this Cavalry SPV, LLC, which was then sold (or they're just representing) to the law firm that the claim is coming from.  Creating and logging into an account on the Cavalry website simply directs me to call said lawyer, so, I start researching said law firm.  Well, their website looks more like a collection agency than a law firm, with an option make payments, and warnings about ""any communications from this site is an attempt to collect, blah blah.""  Even though BBB is usually a scam too, the reviews and complaints make this place sound like an even worse scam.  So what should I do?  There's an option to e-mail them to discuss things, even with an option to receive responses by mail (which reading threads here is recommended!)  Should I try to call them and negotiate?  How do I respond to the summons from my local court?"	Yes
I have had many interactions with Home Depot's customer service over the 4th of July weekend. They tried to overcharge me two a half times over a $500 order. In the end I had to beg a friend's family member to make 6+ trips to the store that is serveral miles  away using  a 4 seater car, instead of the company's delivery truck that should have arrived 48 after the order was placed.   I contacted the home depot's customer  support after 96 hours of not hearing from them and I was told by them I had to come into the store, which was the only way for me to pick up even just half of the merchandise that I was overcharged for because they did not have enough in stock. They gave me a small discount in the store and I returned home less then 1/3 of my total order due to my noticing of  a large discrepancy on the pricing of the item in question when I was checking on it on my tablet on the website whilst in store.  The next morning I  re opened neutral negotiations with my growing antagonist and calmly asked for why there was such a discrepancy and why I was overcharged, not informed of a delay in shipping or even contacted at all. After 3 hours of contacting their support rep and getting nowhere I ended up ordering the same exact gardening supplies on my friends Amazon prime and informed Home Depot that I wanted a full refund on all the merchandise that I had not received. Although my original payment method at home depot's website was a credit card instead of refunding the money to my card, I just received a call this morning asking me to come into the store in person to receive the refund. Why would they do this rather then just refund my card?  All I am doing is a little legal (as of this year) gardening and I am not white and they were all Caucasian, so to me it seems a little bit sketchy. Any opinions ?	Yes
I don't know if this would be better suited for a different /r/ but this was the first place I thought of.  In western Virginia (VA) We are building a house in a neighborhood that has been established for over a decade.  Cox cable is the only provider of internet in the neighborhood as far as I can tell.  After over 3 months of trying to get an answer over the phone I go in person to the store and they tell me it will be $6,700 to run a cable to my house.  They say the neighborhood is at capacity, and they will need to build a new node.  They *might* subsidize some of the cost, but would probably still be $3,000-$4,000 my cost, and I won't know the exact amount until they install.  Does anyone know if cable providers have an obligation to provide service in areas, or are they actually allowed to charge people these high fees to install infrastructure.  The house is 400 feet from a pole that has RG6 cable on it.  Any suggestions of courses of action to take?  A place I could write, or contact?	Yes
I am in the middle of FAFSA, and was about to sign the Master Promissory Note. I filed my FAFSA with my own permanent address. However, when about to sign the Master Promissory Note, I noticed that the pre-filled address is not mine. I have never seen this address in my life. I am assuming that fafsa.ed.gov and studentloans.gov would only have an address if it was given to them before, possibly for a loan? Am I being unnecessarily paranoid?  The Driver's License number is genuinely my own.  I am currently studying postgraduate in the UK and I am not at home in America.  And although this is not concrete, I guess it's worth mentioning that I have been having that intuitive gut feeling that my identity could be stolen. Random intrusive-like thoughts based on nothing.  What the fuck do I do? I don't even know where to begin.  http://imgur.com/VZWT61v	Yes
I had a monthly parking service with Impark and I no longer needed to use their parking lot after April. I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.   I didn't deal with it right away because I had to go on vacation 1.5 months. Now that I'm back, I see that they have added on even more additional charges. On top of the $93.25, they also added on $50 (rejected payment charge) + $30 (late admin fee)+ $1.5 (tax) for the months of June and July. Now they say that I owe them $174.75 or my debt will be collected by a collection agency and will affect my credit.    I find it absurd that I have to pay $174.75 when I haven't parked in their parking lot since I cancelled at the end of April. Is there any way I can dispute this or will I have to pay them the money?	Yes
In 2000 I took out a student loan through my state, for $8500.  I have been going to school off and on since then, and have had periods of deferral or and payment.  To this date I have paid over 9000 dollars, and owe over 9000 dollars due to interest.  Do I have any options to not be continually ass raped by this aside from taking out a different loan with lower interest?	Yes
So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them.   For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.  I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?  My business is in Pennsylvania and they are located in New York.   Thanks for your assistance.	Yes
The second woman that hit me made it clear she would rather pay out of pocket than have a claim on her insurance.  I realize it may not be the most ethical thing to do, but would I be breaking any laws to accept a cash payment from her, and make a claim with the other rear-enders insurance?  I realize it's a bit shady, I just need to be clear on whether or not I would be breaking any laws.	Yes
Brought a perfectly fine Mazda CX-9 to Pep Boys for new tires. Now it constantly stalls out and they say it's because of a cracked intake manifold. I've called my insurance company and filed a claim, but does anyone else have any ideas how to best handle this situation?	Yes
About two months ago, my Facebook account got disabled without any reason and I still haven't received a single response after hundreds of appeals and requests.  I can't just give up on my account and start a new one. I used to manage many business pages over it which I had been working since many many years.   I don't want the time and efforts I've spent all these years go wasted. I've also literally tried every possible way to communicate with a human working at Facebook but haven't been successful. Their support is non existent.  So should I take them to court? Is it possible? How should I proceed?	Yes
My kids (9 and 8) are doing a dermatology study on a cream of some sort. When the dr approached us we were told they would each receive $650 for about 16 weeks of study, using meds and getting blood drawn. We discussed this with them and they wanted to do it. Upon signing the paperwork we noticed that it said the payment would be $500 for each. My wife talked to the Drs tech about it and she was assured that the payment was $650 and that it would be changed. Fast forward until now and we are being told it is actually only $500 and that we signed for that amount. Drs office isn't willing to do anything about it. Do I have any legal action I can take or are my kids just screwed for trusting them the staff in the beginning?	Yes
"So, our contractor completely abandoned us on Saturday, and we don't know what to do. We hired these three guys who gave us an incredibly low price to remodel a condo that we purchased in May. They started work on our place on June 1 and were supposed to be done on June 30. He told us that he would remodel our place for a certain amount: $13,500. These same guys did renovation work for our neighbor in the same condo community, so we made a huge mistake and simply made everything verbal instead of writing it down. I asked him to write it down, but he never actually did even though he promised to do so.  So, the first week, the lead contractor bailed on us and went on vacation while the other two guys started sound demolition work. Everything was fine, until he came back a week later and started asking for more money to do other things. We thought, ""okay, we are asking him to move some walls around and some things are more expensive,"" so we just allowed it and paid extra. This became a common occurrence as things progressed; he started telling us that we had to pay for faucets, for light fixtures, for shower doors, etc., and we had no recourse because we didn't write anything down  Two weeks later, after there was not a ton of work done, the lead guy tells us that his wife's grandmother was in an accident in Mexico. He left the country for two weeks, and his other guys did work. He came back last Friday, and we didn't even know what to say to him because we are paying for rent in our old place while waiting for our new place to become livable. He didn't say too much to us either, and they left and took all of their tools on Friday.  They were supposed to come back on Saturday, but never showed up. I blew up this guy's phone, and he finally answered and said that he wasn't going to work for us anymore because we ""disrespected him by ignoring him.""  In total, we paid them around $12k, and there isn't a single room completely finished. If anyone has had a similar experience or knows some options, we are all ears. We have called our homeowner's insurance, and my wife thinks we may have some luck there, but otherwise we are nearly broke and can't afford to pay for another contractor on top of it.   Hoping there is someone out there who can help! Thanks in advance!"	Yes
We've had DSL through a single T1 line through a local ISP that just recently went out of business.. The new company is a seemingly small mom and pop shop that bought the ISP promising to offer to run fiber cables in my area. They really got our hopes up when we seen them digging, but in the process they damaged a T1 cable and now our internet has been really bad ever since. I can no longer do the things I used to be able to do online, and they refuse to fix it, and it's been a year since they dug the ditches. I think that they're just collecting money rather than put any back into the company for maintenance..   Location; Arkansas, USA.     Thanks in advance!	Yes
Greetings /r/Legaladvice  Im located in Australia, and im chasing up some legal advice..well further legal advice.  a now former friend is demanding i pay back a small debt of 1400 AUD it used to be 1900 AUD, but its gotten to the point where i was sick of the abuse and stuff that ive blocked her from all comms between us.  Do i need to still pay the person back despite the debt being over 10+ years?  Heres what i know according to legal id Queensland &amp; Victoria (A me being in Queensland and her in Victoria)  Both Legal Aid QLD and Victoria both have stated that since its been 10+ years since the debt has been and that she never asked for it back originaly back in 04 sometime when she got me back home out of her own pocket for a flight via Qantas Australia, Both have stated that she really doesnt have a case in the courts as its over the time period and realisticly no judge or lawyer would want to touch the case as it would cost more in laywer fees then the case or money itself.  However, wanting to double check and recheck or basises and asses, Ive come to you guys asking.  Appreacte the time :)	Yes
"My mom is looking at declaring bankruptcy.   However, 7 years ago she helped me with a car. I paid for everything but it was in her name. It has been paid off for 2 years and we did a ""gifting"" at the DPS and the car is in my name now on the title.   She started having financial troubles about 3 years ago so I paid off her truck so it wouldn't get repossessed. Again did the ""gifting"" and it's in my name. This has been for 1.5 years now.  So if she declares bankruptcy could I lose these vehicles? I paid the entire car loan and about half the truck loan."	Yes
"Hi Reddit, i hope this is the correct subreddit i have posted it on but i need some advice. My dad purchased a used car from a Ford Dealership. He was ""approved"" at a certain interest rate. He had told me that the financial department had said a couple things would be free in the agreement. A couple days later they call my dad saying he did not get approved for that contract and that they are working on other one to get it through. I had found out about multiple lies they had told my dad and at that point i told him to return the car because they were not being completely honest with us. I live in CALIFORNIA and i understand that the dealership has 10 days to get another deal for us. But we do not want the car at this point because of how dishonest they were. I went there twice with my dad and they pretty much denied us to return the car. What are my options? They said they have a couple more days to get the right deal. If anyone wants any more information please feel free to ask i hope i gave enough information to get some answers so we can steer in the right direction. I just want to return the vehicle at this point and i believe it is at the 6 day mark."	Yes
They are not answering their phones.  I have the title so it's still technically my car and if they won't pay for it, then would I be able to report to the police that they have stolen it?    Or would I get in trouble for that? I mean technically if you are supposed to pay for something but then u don't it is stealing.	Yes
So I'm looking into buying a new dirt bike that I'm going to convert into a street legal bike, it's in great shape and the guys selling it for really cheap. Everything is fine until I ask him about the legal documents included. He says he has the title for the motorcycle, but that it's not in his name, it's still in the previous owner's name and that guy is dead. I don't think it's a stolen bike because this guy is a medical technician, and rolled up with a nice truck... He's just a redneck kind of dude that cuts corners whenever possible to not give the man any of his money.  **So my question is:** If I'm somehow able to get that title transferred into my name (any help here is appreciated,) will I possibly face any problems in the future with this bike when trying to get it registered when its street legal or maybe that man's family might come and try to collect it from me since it was in his name or anything else?  Thanks in advance!	Yes
Hi, I'm here seeking for legal advice.   On 19/4 I was asked by my supplier via email to pay for a certain invoice amounting to $2500.  On 22/4 the supplier emailed me again, saying his bank is 'auditing' his bank account, and the bank advised him not to accept any payment from his customers. He asked me to bank in the money to another bank account.   Of course, up to this point, I believed everything he said.  Then on 29/6, my boss received a call from the supplier, saying they did not receive our payment.   I then sent them the email correspondence between us and the payment details to them. Their accounts guy then told me his email got hacked, and he did not ask me to pay to a second bank account.   Now, they're demanding that we pay them the amount we owe, even though we did what was instructed by their emails. They're threatening to go to court if we do not pay.	Yes
I'm in Oklahoma and I had stuff at a storage facility that a friend owned. He sold the facility and then the new owners sold my stuff. I never had a contract or signed anything the agreement I had originally was verbal. I found out they sold the stuff this past January. Do I have any kind of recourse here?	Yes
Hi. I run an ecommerce account. I sold someone an item to which I have a said return policy on it. Unfortunately they wanted to return the item. When they did, the item was defective and was not in the same shape or form it was in when I sent it to them which went against my return policy. I denied them a return and now they're threatening to sue. Is that possible?	Yes
I moved into an apartment in CT back in May 2016 which turned out to be horrible due to no wall insulation and an unstable downstairs neighbor who moaned when I had females over for fun then smoked cigarettes and denied it and made me ill from second hand smoke. I later found out from a next door neighbor that the prior tenant living in my apartment abruptly left after a few months due to similar reasons to mine. Calls to management made no difference and they denied any smoking or problems with neighbor. They even went as far as threatening eviction for stating I was causing him a disturbance, refusing my calls about the eviction threat then stating it was sent by mistake by their Jewish lawyer during their holiday. Despite all of this, I received a lease renewal request in March 2017 and was too busy with work (I work in a hospital) to look for apartments or sign the renewal. Finally got to a point where my neighbor continued to smoke and then harass me with total denial by him and management and I decided to get the hell out. I found a nice but more expensive place and signed the lease renewal letter on June 1 as intent to vacate by July 1 which was received by them on June 8, 2017. I also left the apartment spotless and in better condition then when I moved in by leaving expensive blinds and newly painted walls. I have all letters, payments and the apartment condition documented with pictures.   Now the management company is refusing to return any security because they are saying I did not supply 30 days notice. The apartment is spotless and they only commented on the timing of receiving the lease renewal notice. Does the timing of the renewal signing and 30 days notice have anything to do with receiving back my security? Can I take them to small claims court?	Yes
relevant to australian law.  Long, exhausting series of events kept as short as possible.  My car was incorrectly repossessed. During the repossession the car was damaged (as per the marks in the road), I was belittled and insulted by the repo agent as well as the tow truck operator.  I was provided no documentation and no identification.  Upon calling the leasing company, they've said it was incorrectly repossessed. I've requested documentation regarding how and why this happened and they send me an email saying the vehicle can be picked up. 3 hours away in a different state.  I've called them again today and asked for a follow up - they've acknowledged they've received my email and I asked him to get me a response by the end of the day as it's now been a week i've been without transport.  He said hes not going to guarantee something he cant follow through on, as he's busy with other work.  I also asked for an update on the time taken to get the car back to me, they said i have to keep waiting or organise a truck myself.  So i call the company thats currently holding the vehicle, and they tell me they will call me back.   In between all of this, i've been in touch with varying states of legal aid, and compensation aid and i've had no help - i get told to call someone else, who tells me to call someone else, who loops me back to the first person.  I'm frustrated, defeated and still carless.   This has made a terrible impression at my new workplace and I'm fear of losing my job if im unable to keep asking friends and family for help getting to and from work.   I'm backed into a corner and dont know what to do next.   someone please help me.	Yes
First off, thank you for taking the time to read over my ordeal. Basically, I have a loose gravel driveway, and my wife and I are sick of tracking in dirt in the house. It’s seriously like a sandy beach in here. So I call around to a bunch of businesses, but I couldn’t find a concrete company to give me the time of day because everyone is slammed with business. Some companies were even sending me off with “I know a guy who knows a guy, his name is Jimmy, he might be able to help”. So I’m doing some more in depth Googling (Ha!), and I come across a website called Thumbtack. You type what it is that you need, and they send contractors your way. Too easy. I get a guy and he’s out at my house immediately that afternoon. He’s eager for the job, and quotes me $3975 for a new driveway. It’s 70 feet long, and 15 feet wide, with an additional slab on the side of our carport that is 20 feet long, and 4 feet wide. I couldn’t find a consistent number online that could give me a ball park price, so when Rudy comes out and gives me that price, I was pretty happy about it.    Rudy said he was brand new to Thumbtack, so that’s why he didn’t have any ratings, but that he was licensed, bonded, and insured (he insisted that he wouldn’t be able to operate without it). I was hesitant because Rudy comes off as a fast talker, but decided to give him my business because he is a fellow veteran, and he needs the work. No biggie, I’m happy to help someone in a tight spot. Rudy explained that the job would be easy as there is no tear up (of existing concrete), and he would “take care of [me]” by pouring it 6 inches thick, and giving me wire mesh which came with a 2 year warranty. He says he’ll get his Bobcat out here, and it’ll go by real quick. I agree, so he sends me a contract, and asks for $2050 up front for materials, along with some photos of work that he’s done. I know you know where this is going, hang tight.    I signed the contract and sent the money. Let’s go over the contract. What I linked is exactly what he sent. An MS Word, piece of hot garbage. They spelled my name wrong, spelled his name wrong, so I kicked it back and they fixed it, no biggie. Shortly after, he emailed me my receipt. He then calls me back and says that he needs $25 more to cover the credit card charges, fuck it, I’m excited to get a new driveway, so I agree (I know, just hush).     The next day (13JUL2017), Rudy and his crew are out at my house at 9 am sharp. There’s a cranky old guy who’s got something like 50 years in the business, and two Mexicans who speak like 3 words of English. Everyone was cool, the Mexican guys were like a slapstick duo, talking shit to one another, and the old guy constantly bitching about them under his breath. I eventually brought out coffee, ice water, and oranges because when I used to do construction (pool enclosures), it was nice to do work for a homeowner who cared. I quickly noticed there was a lack of aforementioned Bobcat, so no dirt was getting dug, and Hose A and Hose B (that’s how cranky old man introduced them) were filling up a cracked and warped Rubbermaid tub full of dirt and sliding it back and forth between the side of the house and filling in the driveway. Again, me being an understanding person, I assumed that Rudy had his Bobcat out at another project (which I was correct), so I allowed his crew to use all my tools and wheelbarrow to make things go faster. I didn’t mind because I knew forming wasn’t going to take all day, and they’d be done in a few hours.    About that time I notice cranky old guy laying down 2x4s. I walked up to him and asked him how thick the concrete was going to be. He said 4 inches. I said no, I signed a contract for 6 inches, and showed him. He said I’d have to talk to Rudy, because he wasn’t sure. So Rudy pulls up about 15 minutes later, and I ask him again about the thickness. He reassured me that the concrete would indeed be 6 inches thick, to not worry, because when it’s poured, it’ll “SINK DOWN”, and it’ll be 6 inches when he’s done. So I kept it in the back of my head, because it sounded like some cock and balls bullshit. Around 2 pm, the crew finishes forming up and Rudy walks up to me. He explains that, since the side of the house didn’t have any gravel like the front, it’s going to cost a little extra because he’s going to need more concrete, because it’s going to sink deeper into the soft ground back there. Ok, that one really threw up some red flags. That’s twice he’s asked for more money. I told him I would talk it over with the wife. What I really did was call around to about 5 different concrete companies. Each and every single one of them confirmed what I knew deep down inside: the guy is a scam artist, he’s taking me for my money, concrete sets at the thickness in which you pour it (i.e. it doesn’t sink), and that a contract is a contract, and I am not obligated to pay more than what I signed for.    So embarrassed and downright ashamed of myself, I go online to see what can be done legally with people like him. I click on an Angie’s List article dealing with concrete repair scams, and LOW AND FUCKING BEHOLD, there is the exact same picture headlining the article that he sent to me, which he claimed was a previous project of his. Now I’m really pissed. I look back over the photos and my receipts, and wouldn’t you know it, at the bottom of the receipt is where he forged my signature. It’s so blatantly obvious that it was forged, it’s down right insulting.    Here’s my conundrum: I’m no attorney, but I believe technically he hasn’t broken the contract yet because the concrete isn’t poured. It’s just 2x4s outlining the driveway. So I don’t think I have any ground to stand on by demanding my money back, do I? Either I want a complete refund, or I (reluctantly) want him to do the job that I paid him to do. I’m planning on calling him first thing tomorrow morning and recording the conversation. I called the bank, and they said they can open a dispute and refund me my money, but the ultimate decision would be left to the case manager as to whether or not I’m in the right (seeing as how I willingly agreed to give this person my money).  Before he left, Rudy asked if he could finish the job on Monday because he had to go to Miami for the weekend, and couldn’t coordinate the cement trucks until late Friday night. So I said yes, that’s not a problem. He also asked me to call him later that night to let him know about the extra charges, and what I wanted to do. So I called twice and no answer.   What are my options?    [The Contract] (http://imgur.com/a/FPP5O)	Yes
Basically what happened was that my sister called to get internet for our new apt, and we were rejected by CenturyLink because the person who had lived there before had an outstanding bill of $200+. The representative even had the gall to ask my sister if she wanted to make the payment on behalf of the former resident, (why on earth would we do that for a complete stranger...? Honestly...) which obviously has ticked me a bit.    No, I don't know who the resident is, there are absolutely 0 ties between me, my family, and whoever used to live here. They rejected literally on the basis of the past resident having an outstanding balance, (my sister has a call recorder on her phone so she emailed me the audio,) yet, they require your SSN in order to make an account with them...    A friend of mine told me it's total BS and I could actually report them to the BBB for taking unnecessary sensitive information and rejecting us based on someone else's records. I've never heard of such a preposterous way to be rejected, and honestly I just want some decent internet for my home.     Also sorry in advance if this is the wrong subreddit. Idk where to post it...	Yes
"One of the stones of an expensive necklace I purchased fell out and broke.  This stone is unique to the manufacturer (because of its cut, I don't think I'll find it anywhere else).  I found the necklace still for sale on the brand's company website.   Ideally, I would purchase a replacement stone from them at a fair price.  In communication with their customer service team, they said ""normally we offer a one year warranty, however since the purchase was made over a year ago, we can't replace it. Also, we are not able to make repairs.""  Also they claim not to have any replacement stones.  I'm just looking to purchase a replacement stone so I don't have to purchase a whole new necklace.  Are there any consumer protection laws applicable?  Company HQ is in TX, I am in GA."	Yes
Basically as title says. Got my son a contract with sprint, hes 16 so I pay for everything, got him a brand new LG V20 with a lease style contract under the condition that he worked for his uncle on the weekends.   Well 16 year olds will be 16 year olds and he skipped out on more than 7 days worth of work. So punishment was I returned the phone to sprint and got him a basic flip phone with no data.   I returned the phone to a corporate sprint store and paid a 35 restocking fee. I have a digital receipt from the store that shows the model and serial number of the phone returned.   Somehow sprint lost the phone between the time I was given a receipt and now.   They sent me a bill for 423.72.   100 of that is my monthly payment and the other part is the cost of the phone I returned.   I called last month when this happened and filed a dispute. Heard nothing back from them.   This month I receive a pay or disconnect notice for the outstanding balance of 320 for the price of the phone. So I called very mad  but kept my cool. Talked with a supervisor and she seemed very helpful until the end. She said she would start another claim and it would be a week for the resolution.   I asked her what happened with the first dispute and she said there was no resolution. I asked her what that means and she said she was unsure. She said she would place a hold on my account for the 320 to make sure it does not disconnect my service, but that hold would expire at the end of the claim.   Well that happened today. I called again and made sure to speak to the same lady. I even waited on hold for 45 minutes to make this happen. She tells me that the claim was denied. No reason for the claim being denied was given.  I asked her if she had the receipt. She said no. I sent her my digital copy of the receipt. She agreed that his was an official receipt and was able to verify it in the system. But that I still owe for the phone.   She has a receipt that she agrees is legit showing I returned the phone. So I did my part here. How can she claim I owe her money for a phone I followed procedure with? IS there any legal ground for her to say I owe for an expensive phone they lost?  Texas if that matters.	Yes
Hi /r/legaladvice, throwaway here.  I worked for a startup for two years and I was let go after I had vested half my stock options. On my separation agreement, they extended my exercise period from 90 days to 2 years, which made me not buy the shares and wait for an exit or something like that. Hindsight is 20/20 and buying would grant me a lot more rights.  Around 10 months after the separation agreement, my options were cancelled, and the CEO said this was because the extension wasn't allowed under the stock option agreement. A few lawyers went through the agreements and said this was BS. Despite this, she (the CEO) tried to make a monetary agreement for a fraction of what the shares are worth for me to give them up.  I'm under the suspicion this move is by her personally, and the company's directors aren't fully aware of the story. I thought about writing an email to the directors with a roundup, attatching the separation agreement, in which the extension is clearly stated, but I'm afraid this will give them more time to lawyer up and I'm naive to think this will change anything.  Should I try emailing the directors explaining my story, or go straight to a lawyer and send a letter of demand?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
I was working contract for an oilfield company and resigned from the position. My boss has since been bitter and threatened not to pay me. I quit because he was inconsistent and unreliable with paying me. The time limit for acquiring my checks are 21-28 days after the invoice is created. It's day 28 and he has yet to contact me. What is my next step?	Yes
I wasn't present when this occurred, so I can only tell what I was told. My father purchased plane tickets and a rental car package on Hotwire...he said it came out to around $1,600 and when he went to purchase, the moment after he hit the button, it came out to $2,800...so basically they swindled him out of $1,200. He called Hotwire and they couldn't do anything...he canceled his credit card, but later found out that he couldn't get out of the payment. So now he chose to pay just for the plane tickets and rental car and he says he refuses to pay the $1,200 difference that they added on at the end after he pressed that he was ready to make the payment. He is very emotional and angry about this situation. What recourse does he have at this point? What happens if he just doesn't pay the $1200. Any help is appreciated.	Yes
So my fiancée went to Alfred Angelo for her dress, paid in full for dress and alterations. Receipts are all documented paper copies. The seamstress (outside contractor)  just called to tell us about that and now she is wanting payment for the alterations because Alfred Angelo never paid her. Called Alfred Angelo local store and they said they could do nothing. Customer service line is already shut off. It's only a matter of $279.00 USD but the point remains. What can we do?   Location: Pittsburgh PA  Edit: Cleared up who the seamstress works for	Yes
Myself and a partner just invested into a home(Rental Property). We have renters coming in next month. We need to start an LLC to assure both of us are covered. We asked our lawyer and his price was $1500. We are thinking that is too high. After buying a home we still are financially stable, but we want to be financially smart. Is there any other options here? should we ask other lawyers? Any suggestions could help!	No
A few months back, I had to quickly leave my apartment due to unsafe living conditions, and asked a friend of mine if I could stay with her for a bit. She agreed, and after a few days we had talked and come up with the idea that she would probably just sign the lease over to us and find another place to stay since her sister had moved out. After a week of me staying with her, she accused us of hiding dog shit under her covers and kicked us out with a night's notice. So, we had to pack up and leave in a rush. After that we were homeless for a few weeks until we were able to find an apartment, and have been living quite happily since. A month ago, our former friend texted me saying that she wanted me to pay for subletting fees that she was charged and damages to the room and carpetting of the apartment saying that she had been charged by her landlord for subletting fees and having 4 cats and a dog in her apartment.  Now, it has been a few months since we lived there, but on our way out I don't remember anything being stained or damaged. I don't even know if she has a case against us since we didn't pay her any money or anything like that and I'm unfamiliar with how civil court works in regards to this? Any info on what I could do or if she even has a case against us would be greatly appreciated	No
I cut my finger good enough with a workplace appliance to have to go to an urgent Care facility. Got a tetanus shot and some stitches. Workers comp seems to be the way to go, but I am fairly confident I will test positive for marijuana if drug tested. Does this have potential to impact my workers comp? Seems completely unrelated...	No
Is it legal for a landlord to require you to have rental history in the city that you're trying to rent in?  I am moving to another city and the landlord for a place I'm looking at says I need to have rental history in that City or else I will need to have a cosigner. Is this legal or a gray area?	No
Let’s say a person witnesses an occurrence at work, reported it, and subsequently someone lost their job.  The fired employee tried to sue for wrongful dismissal (saying the investigation was botched/incident never happened) and it ended in a settlement.  The license of said fired employee is now going to be revoked under gross misconduct, so there is another hearing.  The incident happened off camera, so it was largely down to sworn witness testimony.   If the fired employee wins, is the witness liable for a lawsuit?  Also, if the witness spoke to other employees to ask for advice on reporting to management, is there any liability there?	No
I just signed a lease that I was very hesitant to sign, even after speaking to the property manager.  This complex, in San Antonio, tx, is going to charge me $41/ month for cable.  I have to sign the addendum in order to move in.  I spoke to her (prop. Manager) about how I don't want cable and don't own a tv and she said since they do bulk cable deals with the local provider, every apartment in the complex got discountes cable even if we didn't want it. As much as I want to ask is this legal, or how do I work around this, I'd prefer some links so I can research on my own. Thank you.	No
Title pretty much says it all.  I was born in Florida.  My mother placed her husband at the time as my father.  After 40 years I found out my father was not my bio father.  I have since located my bio father, completed the DNA testing and I'd like have my birth record reflect him.    Can this be done?    Thanks in advance for your help.	No
Hi I cross posted this with /advice I hope I'm doing this right because I've never really posted on Reddit...also sorry for formatting I'm on mobile and also incredibly stressed out.   So basically there were issues with our carpets when we moved out of our apartment. There was a bleach stain in the hallway caused by my roommate that we all witnessed her make (myself and other two housemates). She said before we moved out that she knew she would have to take responsibility for it. Turns out when it came time she tried to lie her way out of it by blaming me (because she hates me, she told the others girls exactly that). In the end she ended up taking responsibility.  We thought we moved on but fast forward to this week. My landlord send my security deposit to the girl I subletted from and I haven't been able to contact that girl to get my security deposit back (that's a whole thing in and of itself). The landlord said the carpet cleaning for the living room went well except one or two small stains that wouldn't come out but it wasn't a big deal. We all made stains on that carpet that we tried to clean. I personally had two tiny coffee stains because my dog stole an empty k-cup when I first moved in. However I spent a long time trying to get it out and it was almost unnoticeable by the time I moved out. Unlike tar my roommate has tracked into the living room after the beach one day.   Anyway today the landlord tells me that my roommate is upset about the living room floor and decided she wants it to be replaced which would cost all 4 of us $1000-1500. She also sent my housemate a picture of said stains and guess what, they're HUGE. They look FRESH. They were not there before. But now the others have turned on me saying now it's my turn to take responsibility. I feel like my roommate is being vindictive and wants revenge.   I'm also concerned on whether my landlord is allowed to try and charge us after the fact she already send my deposit with my itemized list of damages/deductions and it's been 21 days (this is the max limited allotted under CA law to send a security deposit back with deductions).   I am so stressed and confused and really need any help I can get, especially in terms of my legal rights. Thank you.   P.S. I am a sub letter so I know that technically any charges would actually go toward the master tenant but I am so confused on the legality of all this as we never filed paperwork with the landlord regarding my sublet (I filled it out but the master tenant never signed or sent it in)	No
Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I am having issues with my ex-landlord. I live in WA state. This is posted in TFBL too.  I moved out of my old apartment on June 12th. No issues. Lease was up June 28th. I got my move out statement from my ex-landlord, and he is demanding I pay to replace the carpets. I have asked for documentation, like receipts and pictures, and the likes of that, for the past almost 2 months and the documentation he has supplied has either been incorrect, or not what I have asked for (i.e. pictures of the carpets, and he sends me pictures of behind the fridge) He is charging over $2,000 to replace carpets for about 550 sqft. He gave me the original receipt for the carpets which would make them about 9 years old, and then went on to state the carpets were 17 years old, and had 20 years of life, and then said the carpets were actually 9 years old.   My biggest problem, is that he broke the lease, and allowed a new tenant to move in on the 16th of June, and did not include that in the move out receipt as well had no intention of prorating the rent. He says the new tenant moved in on the 20th, and he had quote for the new carpets done on the 20th as well. He sent me a new statement and explanation this week, and stated he has not yet replaced the carpets, and hasn't even treated the carpets or done anything besides a basic cleaning between tenants. He stated he is replacing the carpets while the new tenant is in the unit in August. He can't provide proof that I damaged the carpets (I have pictures of the carpets, they were fine, free from stains and other damage) and now the new tenant has had the opportunity to damage the carpets. Basically what it comes down to is that I don't think he can charge me for any maintenance, or repairs, etc. that happen after a new lease is effect? Should I take this to small claims court instead of continuing to try and settle this?  Any help or advice is appreciated. I am at my wits end with this guy.	No
I live in an NYC apartment. My roommate/Subtenant is supposed to be moving on 7/31. However he has not packed any of his things and it is 7/30 at night right now. I asked him on 7/29 when he was moving out he confirmed 7/31. However I’m skeptical since nothing is packed and he is supposed to be moving out tomorrow....  So here is a bit of a backstory, I gave him 30 day notice to move out. He is not on the main lease. We have a sublease agreement between us that expired two years ago. But have been continuing based on a verbal agreement. I have his 1 month security deposit currently.  In our agreement it states “The lessee will also pay a deposit of (), which will be fully refunded to the Lessee upon the end of the sublease, conditional on the premises being returned in its original condition as stated in lines 5 and 6.”   Line 6 says “Lessee shall leave said premises in the same good and clean condition as he received it. Any permanent spills, stains, or similar incidents must be cleaned up.”   However in the past he has the tendency to think some things are “clean” when they are not as so. I took photos of the room before he moved in so I’ll be able to show the original condition.   I’m worried because we are supposed to be having a tenant move in on August 1st.    That being said, I’m concerned that: A. The room will not be clean, and that I will have to hire someone to come in and clean the place and may delay move in dates by 2-3 days? B. I will also have to repaint the room. C. I’m afraid that if the room is not ready to move in then my prospective tenant may back out of the agreement because the room is not ready by August 1st (when it was promised that it would be ready by then).  My questions: If he does not move out on 7/31st what can I do legally? Can I hire movers to move his things out on the the streets on August 1st?   Along with that if he leaves the room unclean and hinders my move in date and costing my prospective tenant, can I charge him for a month's rent (keep his deposit) since no one will want to move in on August 4th or 5th? The next possible time to find someone to move in might be Sept 1st or possibly August 15th…?  Hoping some experts can shed some light to this situation. I can provide more information if needed about the agreement etc..	No
"I currently live in a nice 3br/2ba home. I am subleasing my room from ""Liz"" who is the sole tenant on the lease. Every month, I pay her my share of the rent and she pays our landlady. Our lease is up August 1st, at which point we all agreed to be out. I had arranged to move in somewhere else for August 1st. ""Liz"" and my other roommate (also subleasing) haven't lived in the house since June, because they felt the area was unsafe/ too busy. ""Liz"" has been paying her share of the rent, whereas my other roommate found a summer subletter. We all planned to be out August 1st and have been in regular communication about this fact. Four days ago, Liz tells me that I need to be out on July 29th, because she wants to leave town early (moving to another state for August 1st) and the landlady won't let me do the walk through by myself, because I am just subleasing. This has been a major inconvenience. I had scheduled to move the morning of August 1st and spend the weekend preparing my move. Additionally, my new landlord had to shift some things around to let me in three days early. I will be paying him prorated for those extra three days. Because, this was such a major inconvenience and because I already paid for a full month, should I request that Liz reimburses me for those last three days? This would only be about $60, but it would help with moving costs, etc. Additionally, this is not the first time Liz has pulled a stunt like this (a few months ago she listed our house to try and find new tenants for May 1st without speaking to me first because she wanted to move). We resolved our issues on that front, but now she blindsides me again. I'm generally easygoing, but think it's only fair she reimburses me for bending over backwards for her! Thoughts?"	No
"Happened in Utah, USA.  To begin, yes I learned my lesson. Won't be happening again.   Basically what happened is, at night my SO and I decided to drive out to a seemingly secluded place. We found a parking lot for a hiking trail that was empty. We did the deed, and then as we were putting clothes back on an officer approached the car.   We decided the best plan of action was to come clean. And so we did.   He asked us both basic questions (""Are you here on your own free will, did you consent to the activities taken place"") and looked at both of our IDs.  Then he just came back and said ""yeah, just find a better place to do this next time, go home tonight."" He didn't say ""you're under arrest"" either.   No alcohol was involved. We are both adults.   Am I off the hook? Was I unknowingly charged with anything? He didn't mention anything like an arrest or a citation or anything like that. Did he jus need our IDs to confirm our birthdays or are we going to get citations?  I feel like I'm kinda off the hook but I can never be too sure.   Thanks in advance."	No
Greetings everyone.  I am having a hellish time trying to move on / away from my abusive ex fiance of 4 years. It's a complicated situation and it invovles a lot of manipulation, lies, defamation and abuse on her part that I would like to put a stop to, but need help doing so since my own efforts to disuade her have not worked out. I'm in colorado. If you know of any good lawyers that care about mens rights please help me find them because I am afraid being the male and her acting like a victim all the time when I never do anything but raise my voice and demand her to take responsibility for her actions!	No
"I posted here awhile back about my new roommate acting sketchy. Long story short I'm moving out because it's confirmed she's trying to make me pay more in bills. She wants me to be out by August 5th which we agreed on, I prorated the August 1-5th rent which will be $169.   Now the hard part that comes in are the bills. She wanted me to pay her TV bill essentially, also it was last months bill for the previous roommate but she said people have always paid the previous tenants bill when they moved in. Smells like BS, and it definitely is. So she wants me to pay this huge portion of the bill that isn't internet, it's TV and I do not own a TV or cable box in my room. She argued with me that I could've put one in there and that it's my fault but I brought up her OWN contract that she is blatantly going against. On top of that the contract states 50% gas, electric and ""internet time Warner"". Now that's a play on words, she said that the internet is included in the time Warner bill but it has its own price. I'm simply not going to pay her TV, and the contract is specifically saying Internet, but that is one of those either or scenarios due to the wording. I just feel since the contract literally says internet time Warner, and not just ""time Warner"" that I should be paying for...the internet. I included the pics for you guys to see for yourself.   She keeps bringing up that she has an attorney she's speaking with about her rights, and how we have texts that are saying I want a TV (I checked our texts, nothing is along the lines of that except her saying the previous roommate is taking his TV back) when I really don't watch TV since I'm never home anyway. Her entire contract is going against what she's saying except that small play on words with the internet.  How do I go about doing the math for July 1- August 5th utility bills? I am not including the $95 and anything TV related. Just gas, internet and electricity. Prorating rent is one thing, but this is different. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated.   http://imgur.com/a/0LVbv http://imgur.com/a/6R5fP http://imgur.com/a/09XGB"	No
(This is in Indiana)     So, my dad passed last April, and he was in talks for disability. After he passed I received mail from the Social Security office that I was able to receive his back benefits because he had been accepted prior to his death.     Now, I've filled out all manner of legal documentation, medical records, release forms, you name it, all addressed to me, courtesy of or on behalf of my father. Court is next week and the SSA is saying they need proof of kinship. I do not have the slightest idea where to look, as he's not on my birth certificate, and my (his) lawyer isn't exactly giving me great ideas. He had no will, nor any paperwork bequeathing anything to me, but after he passed I signed his estate over to my uncle because he's way smarter than I am and didn't, and still don't, have any idea how to deal with that.    What would work as proof of kinship?	No
Me and my wife bought a house in a neighborhood last summer. This neighborhood had a home owners association. However, the seller of the home said that the HOA had practically dissolved when the former president and treasurer moved, and no one had been paying their dues for the past few years.      We were provided with a copy of the original covenants for the association and they state it was originally created in 1998. I believe I read somewhere that a HOA is only good for a certain amount of years until it needs to be re-registered with the county or something. I want to say it was 15 years? Which would mean this one has expired. I need clarification on this part.      A few months after we moved in last year, someone comes to our door claiming to be the newly elected president of the HOA that they reformed in a community meeting to get it back running. And that we owed 50 dollars for the years dues. They handed me a piece of paper that looks like it was typed up in 5 minutes in Microsoft word, complete with cheesy looking word art, and at least 5 spelling errors throughout. It basically said the HOA was back up and running, this was the name of the new president, and I owed 50 dollars.      I ask them what the dues would be used for. They said just to cut the community area between the homes that isn't owned by anyone. Its a flat field that the homes circle around. I told them that sounded fine, but I would like to have a copy of the new covenents and a breakdown of the expenditures.      These were never provided to me, and I never paid. Nothing was said again about it until last week I get a letter on my door saying the 50 dollar dues are due again for this year, and also had written at the bottom that I owed 100 total for last year as well.      Over the course of the past year, the area they said they would cut has grown out of control, over 4 feet tall in some spots overgrown grass and bushes. Completely unkept. The only thing they said they would do, they did not do.      There are 46 homes in the neighboorood total. At 50 dollars each, that's 2300 a year they should be getting, just to cut about an acre of grass, and they couldn't do that even.      On this new letter though, they put a note at the bottom that says they can put a lien on my home if I do not pay.      After talking with a few neighbors, during the few years that the HOA dissolved and no one was paying dues, a few people with riding mowers in the neighborhood chipped in together to cut the common area. So it was getting cut when we didn't have a HOA.      So now, a new, seemingly unofficial HOA has formed, asking for more money than I feel is necessary for a small area to be maintained, and even then, cant maintain it. I feel like there shouldn't be a HOA and we can just continue cutting the area like before. I have a riding mower and would be happy to help cut the area if I didn't have to pay. And I also wouldn't mind paying, if they actually did the 1 small thing they said they would do.      So with all that said, my main question is how much pull do these people have? If the old HOA dissolved, can they just start one up like this? Can I opt out? Do I have to pay if I do not receive any covenants or budget report?	No
   Back in March 2017 I got a note on my door from the apartment complex asking that I vacate the premises no later than June 30th. I was a bit let down but this was expected as they were going from apartment to apartment renovating. I was on a month to month lease so I thought it was pretty nice they gave me about 100 days notice.     I move out of that apartment and into a new apartment on June 24th. Over the next few days I clean clean clean my old apartment. On a June 29th I have it inspected by the apartment manager who approves it and says I'm good. The next day June 30th I drop by and give them all the keys and ask about my security deposit ($300). They assure me the security deposit should arrive within 45-60 days and I should be fine.    Fast forward to yesterday (July 22) I get a letter in the mail from my old apartment, thinking this was my security deposit I eagerly open it to discover they're taking away my security deposit and say I owe the rest of rent for July because it has me being moved out on July 7th for some reason. This infuriates me so I go to the apartment and ask questions, unfortunately the 2 apartment managers are out until tomorrow (July 24).    Hopefully this was just a mistake but if I was given a note on my door by my apartment complex that I had to move by June 30th, I don't have to give a 30 day notice that I'm moving am I? I live in Kentucky.  TL;DR My old apartment told me to vacate by June 30th which I did. Now they're holding my security deposit and saying I owe them more for July rent likely because I didn't give a 30 day notice. Is this legal? I've never missed a payment and the apartment was spotless when I left it.	No
"Hi,   I currently study at a college in Georgia. It used to be a unspoken rule that you couldn't/shouldn't back in to a parking spot. But no one ever actually got a ticket for it. Until today when I pulled in from a run to the store when I noticed a car next to me got a ticket. I read it out of curiosity and it said ""Unauthorized back-in"".   I back in to a parking spot because I consider it safer than trying to back up to pull out since I can see around other cars earlier and some asshole can't get the drop on me if he decides to burn out of the lot like I've seen some of the motorcycles here do.   I understand that there's very few things private property holders can't do when you're on their grounds in the US.   I wanted to bring it up to the administration as a safety issue. I guess I was just wondering if there's any sort of legal ground I could try to stand on to keep from getting laughed out of the room. Could bringing it up even put a target on my back?"	No
I am a resident of Virginia and am being harassed by my abusive ex who lives in Indiana. When our relationship ended four years ago, I was granted a no contact order and a temporary restraining order; I left the state shortly after and thought that was the end of it. He has recently begun harassing me again via phone calls and texts from various numbers. I have changed my number twice and he managed to get the new number both times. Is there any legal recourse from a different state?	No
"I live in Virginia and my lease has just ended, but the landlord will not return the security deposit because they do not want to split it up when some of the previous tenants are staying. I guess for convenience they are having one of the new tenants (taking my room) pay me the portion of the security deposit that I paid. This new tenant is only willing to pay half of the security deposit due to the bedroom not being fully clean (just needs to be sweeped/wiped down, nothing extraordinary).  This feels sketchy to me for a number of reasons. I have no agreement with this new tenant, he shouldn't even be responsible for paying me and my lease specifically says that I may be responsible for ""reasonable"" cleaning fees on move out. A few hundred dollars for one bedroom needing maybe an hour of cleaning is not reasonable. My lease ended and they should have started a new one, are they able to pull me into this? Can I get the security deposit back from the landlord?"	No
Lived in a furnished house. Upon leaving everything was up to spec.  2 months later I see he has done a lot of work to the outside like putting up a new fence and driveway and all of a sudden I am served with a small claims of 2400.  The damages he's seeking is replacing every dish ware, cleaning, new blankets, new couch, new pillows, pretty much he needs to everything new again. I'm assuming it's part of his remodel budget.   Assumptions aside, I have video of a final walk though on my end that shows clearly all the furnishings in good condition besides normal wear. He's asking brand new price and all the items intiallly were second hand.  How do I counter?	No
I'm 16, was adopted from fostercare about 3 years ago. It was one of the worst decisions I've ever made and I'm now looking for a way out. Anyway, absolutely any way that can sever ties between my adopted parent and make it so I can live else where. I have multiple places I could live if I wasn't legally obligated to live here. I've looked into emancipation and it doesn't look easy and/or possible. I've tried CPS (trust me it was justified) and they left I shit you not. And now I'm just looking for a way out, does anyone have advice?	No
Recently a neighbor selling his place got dinged by the prospective buyer's Home Inspector who demanded a further inspection by a structural engineer of a dormer that was done 3 owners/20 years ago. It got me thinking about improvements that previous owners have and have not done to my house when I sell. Are there up and down sides to putting a house on the market and boldly saying 'This is it. Take it or leave it.'	No
This is a complicated situation but I will try to keep this brief and clear.  We have a mixed relationship with our landlords who are selling the unit we live in.  Our lease is up on August 31st and the sale closes on August 2nd.  The landlords are both lawyers, and we have been dealing with their real estate broker who is an idiot.  She claims they want us to pay them the entire month's rent for August, after which they will transfer the prorated amount to the new owner along with the security deposit.  We plan to negotiate an early ending to the lease with the buyer, as they have indicated they'd like to get into the unit to do work and rent it out before the end of the month, and we have a new lease beginning August 1st.  It seems strange that the landlords want us to pay them the full month's rent when the apartment will only be under their ownership for one day of August.  We are slightly afraid that they will simply keep the money.    What's the best course of action?  The penalty for not paying rent on time in our lease is very minimal.	No
I don't think she has a case but now that's she's of more sound mind she's annoyed she was fired because of a hospital visit related to her PTSD.  Basically she was a contract employee for a company when she had an issue that ended up with her in the hospital.  They held her for 4 days but couldn't find a bed for her in a ward better suited for her so eventually released her to my care.  (Ultimately a mistake because she ended up in the hospital again for worse symptoms for a whole two weeks but I digress).    I never contacted her work during those 4 days, I honestly didn't even think of it, I was spending those 4 days sitting in a chair in her hospital room. Upon her release I do contact them and let them know what happened, she still wasn't really in the shape to talk to them but since her job was basically ticket assigning and chat moderation she agreed to go back to work right away since it was simple and done from home at that time anyway. They ask for a picture of her release paper work showing the days spent in the hospital and leave it at that.  I let her know she said she'd handle it, sent them a picture and that was the end of it for a few hours.  A few hours later they contact us saying she sent a picture of the wrong thing, I look and curse myself for not double checking her because in her addled state she did send the wrong thing.  She sent the picture of the paperwork that basically just said they set her up with an appointment with her normal doctor to follow up about the issues with her PTSD and the hospital stay.  I grab her normal paperwork and see that since she transferred hospitals at some point they only had the 2 days at the second hospital listed not the first two.  So we head out to the original hospital and get the paperwork showing all the days she spent.  I'm sitting at the gas station outside our house when we get a call from the contracting company and are told that they have ended her contract and she doesn't have a job anymore.  They do kind of have a history of this.  Two or three months prior to this another coworker of hers who was actually employee there for over 4 years had their contract ended the day after it was revealed she was hospitalized for a suicide attempt.  I don't think she has much of a case because I don't think contract employees have much at all in the way of rights.  Also they didn't actually know she had PTSD the only thing that told them was the paperwork she accidentally sent them, she never told them herself at any point.  Either way I said I would ask.	No
"First off, I realise I most likely will not find any lawyers from my country here, but I wanted to hear some advice from people with more legal experience than me.  My fiancée and I have rented an apartment from our landlord since September 2016. Recently we signed a lease on a new apartment, but the same landlord. We are supposed to move into the new apartment tomorrow (Monday). I am 26 years old and my fiancée is 23, if that's at all relevant.  Today, we returned home to find a new TV, in its box, in our living room. We didn't buy the TV, and it's obvious he entered the apartment and put it in here while we were away for the weekend.  He did not notify us beforehand (apparently it's for the next tenants). After talking to him on the phone, he claims that he's done this (entered without notification) many times before and that he will continue to do so, because it's written in the lease agreement that he can. After the conversation, I went over the contract again.  The lease reads, roughly translated, ""The landlord will be authorised to visit the apartment during the week, at reasonable hours, in order to check on the status of the unit. This must be done with the renter's agreement beforehand. In addition, each year starting from July 1, the landlord will be authorised to enter the apartment with potential new tenants (to show them around). This can be done with no alert beforehand.""  So from what I understand from the contract, by entering and leaving the TV without notifying us first, he broke the contract. I know he wasn't showing the apartment to new tenants because he already signed a lease with new tenants about a month ago.  Am I reading the situation correctly? The dude is kind of a scumbag, but the apartments are nice so we kept on for another year with him, and the new contract is the same as the old, just a different address. This all happened less than an hour ago, and I wanted to get some advice before I do anything. I think in the next apartment I will set up a security camera. Also, our contract has no clause concerning a TV, and suddenly we have a TV in our apartment, can we keep it? (I wouldn't imagine so, but still...)  Anyways, I would appreciate any advice you guys have to give. The next lease we sign will be read through more thoroughly than this one was."	No
I've been working in a French international NGO dealing with an emergency crisis in my country (Lebanon) for 2.5 years. I am currently at a program manager level (head of a department) and thus I'm involved in medium level decision making and I'm involved in proposal writing and strategy design. In the meantime, I have been volunteering with a local charity for more than 6 years. This charity, of which I consider myself one of the founders, has been growing and has merged with a local NGO. I now have the opportunity to take part of that local NGO as one of its youth club's board members. (Non-paying, volunteer position). And thus will definitely have a say in the strategy and program design. I might also be involved in submitting proposals for funding. Would be a conflict of interest if take up that opportunity? Note that our current area of intervention (geographical), scope of work (what we do), and target demographics, are mutually exclusive. But obviously this could change with time.  I am worried that it would be considered unaccountable towards either of my beneficiaries. I am also worried about my employability and to negatively affect either one of the NGOs.   From a Humanitarian Standards/Principles point of view as well as French Law, am I considered in conflict of interest?	No
I'm not sure if I have flat out proof of her premeditated planning to fabricate an altercation in order to get a restraining order, but it seems that way.   This is a no fault state, I understand that, so I'm not asking for sympathy about this sad situation, just advice.   I'm a Navy veteran, we were married for nearly all of my Navy career. I got out in 2009 because I couldn't stand her infidelity when I was out to sea. (pathetic, I know.) We now have a 9 year old son with his own story this has effected.  We purchased a boat inside a boathouse in the Seattle area a few years ago. I was in school on the GI Bill at the time but have never made as much money as my wife since the Navy.   We were renters before the boat and boathouse. Here's the kicker. I've always had the VA loan program available, but her grandmother died and left her plenty of money.   It was then that she quit her job, we bought this boat home with plans to renovate it, sell it down the road. It wasn't much, but COULD BE CONSIDERED PART IF HER INHERITANCE, even though we're both equal legal owners.    Since then, I've spent the last year working tirelessly to build equity in the investment we went on. She got another job and likes it. The place is worth much more now than when we bought it, because of my labor.   During this time, I've worked on the home or been a stay at home parent, doing side jobs here and there to support our dream.  She got a boyfriend though. She has insisted on a separation to retroactively excuse her cheating, but that's emotional crap.   Her and my son now spend three nights a week at this boyfriend's house and I'm here on the boat paying moorage.   Questions:  1) How will custody look if we don't already have a parenting plan in place?   2) Can she just uproot me from our family home at a whim because it was purchased in part with an inheritance from her side of the family?  3) Is it unethical to find her new secret address where my son has gone for months, or in my best interest?   Realistically, there is no way she can maintain a boat and boathouse alone. It's not in her wheelhouse. Clearly she plans to move him here to help.   Am I about to be homeless?	No
"My landlord for my commercial business sent me an invoice regarding unpaid CAM balances for 2013-2016.  They claim that the total unpaid amount for those three years sums up to a very big amount (5 digit number). This is the first I've heard of these charges and my lease agreement says they would provide a statement of actual CAM costs for the year within 60 days ""(or as soon thereafter as possible)"" following the end of each calendar year.  I have been paying my agreed upon CAM charges every month already so this letter regarding such a large balance came as a shock to me. I have sent my landlord a request for itemized lists of all charges and if they have proof of any CAM invoices sent to me in those years.   Can I argue for the balance to be dropped since they didn't fulfil their end of the lease agreement?  Thank you in advance for your help"	No
A few months ago my boyfriend bought an apartment. When seeing it for the first time it looked okay apart from some minor finishing touches that had to be done, so my BF bought it. We were especially happy about the bathroom, since it was installed just two years ago and we wouldn't have to do anything about it in regard to (re)installing anything. When we moved in we noticed that there was a lot of water on the threshold of the bathroom, but at first we wrote it off as condensation. A few months later we wanted to put the finishing touches on the bathroom (before we mainly focused on new outlets, wallpaper and wooden panels which we had installed on the floor against the wall), which included putting on some silicone stuff on the edges of the tiles. The silicone stuff wouldn't stick and we noticed that the water wasn't condensation as we thought, but it seemed to come from underneath the tiles of the bathroom. We immediately called a plumber company and they came by to check for leaks. He had to remove some floor tiles and the tiles that are placed against the built-in bathtub. Long story short: the plumbers discovered that the bathtub was improperly installed; the construction on which the bathtub should be resting was not installed properly. Large parts of of the wooden beams were rotten due to water slipping through the silicone. This was only possible because the tub had no proper construction to rest on, causing the silicon between the tub and the wall tiles to slowly detach over time. Also the drainage pipes weren't properly installed, one of them was even broken, presumably from installing the bathtub. So, the leakage and water damage which came from that were caused by the work of the previous owners, who installed the bathroom incorrectly. We had to replace the tiles, the whole bath plus installation and drainage and the drainage of the sink. You can imagine that this was quite costly (±3000eu,-). We already sent a registered letter to inform the previous owner we hold them accountable for the sustained damages, but they haven't responded. What can we do now? I've heard it's very hard to prove that the previous owner had to know about the leakage, and that a legal case depends on proving this since this is one of the exceptions of the 'we bought the apartment with all its visible and hidden defects' thing in the contract (because the leakage wouldn't classify the apartment as 'unlivable'). I hope someone can give us advice on how to proceed. We both just finished school so we don't have a lot of money saved, and €3000,- is a lot of money for us. Especially since we didn't expect to have to redo parts of the bathroom.   We live in the Netherlands by the way. I know this sub consists mainly of US-based legal advice, but when searching I came across other countries too, so I hope this is okay. Any advice is welcome, in any case.  Thanks in advance :-)	No
About a year ago I lost an apartment because my ex-roommate at the time refused to pay rent. It's been a nightmare trying to find a place to live since then, and it ruined my credit. He hasn't paid a cent back, even though he promised he would. Since then I've paid off his share of the rent and all the fees so it would clear off my record. Then I filled with the court system and won a judgment against him. He ignored any attempt to work things out so I filed for a wage garnishment against him. When he realized it, he quit his then job and moved. I called a collection agency and when they contacted him, he quit his current job and moved again. So my questions are what are my options? Even if I only get a portion of it back I would be fine. Some nice people helped me out through this mess and I want to pay them back.	No
Can a screenshotted snapchat of a little bit of weed (like maybe an 8th) be enough for police to come do a search? I have been threatened by an ex and I would really like to know if this is possible. He says he will report the photo to the police.	No
"I can't seem to find an attorney to speak to in my area until after they would be needed (which I get,no argument about that). I've been evicted. Tried to fight it myself but was unsuccessful. I was reading up on some things, and I wasn't sure how accurate they are.  Here's my issue(s): 1)Landlord took rent after the 3 day notice.  He only accepted money order and checks, so that's easy to prove because I paid with check. 2)I was never ""red tagged"" or served a notice for the bailiffs that are (I'm being told) going to show up today to ""throw my shit out onto the lawn"" (his words, not mine).  Is there anything I can do? Any help would be appreciated."	No
I received and email from my schools financial aid office notifying me that my low GPA from last semester could possibly put my financial aid in jeopardy. This email was sent with a open mailing list of every other student who received poor enough grades to have their financial aid threatened. From my understanding my grades are supposed to be private from other students and this may be a violation of something called FERPA. Should I or can I pursue legal action?	No
Have a small service business (similar to plumbing, electrical) and am starting it with another person that has decades of experience forming and running companies (i have none).    We are equal partners at this time.    He told me he was going to have his lawyer draw up the paperwork, and that he would be listed as President, and I would be Secretary.  Is it unusual to list the second person as Secretary?  I told him i thought it would be more appropriate for me to be listed as Vice President, and he said okay... but when i received a draft of the paperwork, i was still listed as Secretary in it.  So should i be concerned about this, or are the titles more or less arbitrary?  I assume that two people cant be President, so I am fine conceding that to him due to his experience, but should i insist on having the title of Vice President for legal reasons?  As a side note, i dont believe anything malicious was intended by not changing it in the paperwork, it's more likely that he just forgot to do it.  He had a multi-million dollar company with nearly 100 employees in the past, and is extremely knowledgeable about tax codes and legal partnerships, and such, so i pretty much trust his judgement... but i am still curious.	No
I know in most states, a landlord has to give 24 hours before entering a rental property unless there is an emergency.  I am renting a room in a house.  I changed the lock to my room when I moved in and offered a copy of the key to my landlady.  She said she did not want it.  I am counting down the days until I leave this place and my landlady is starting to show rooms to potential victims.  Does Utah have a law where she has to give 24 hour notice before showing my room?	No
"My mother has a specific dilemma regarding her father's bank account she is the POD for.  The will states that all assets aside from a few specified things (house and property lots) are to be equally divided among siblings.  I'm aware that the POD is separate from the will, and that my mother should have a legitimate claim to all of the money.  However, her intent is still to split it equally as my grandfather wished.  The problem is that she currently has Medicaid healthcare benefits.  It's a given that she will become ineligible for Medicaid for a time, and have to prove that she as ""spent down"" the funds to reapply.  The question is whether or not the state (Ohio, in this case) will honor the fact that the deceased wished the money to be split, or count the entire sum as belonging to my mother even if she splits it.  If the state does not recognize the will in this case, and counts the money as all hers, she will be ineligible for Medicaid for a much longer time without being able to spend down any more than her own share.  Is she going to be forced to keep the money herself, so she can afford private healthcare for however long it takes her to spend the full amount?"	No
I’ve had this phone number for nearly 2 years now. And when I first got the phone number i would receive unwanted calls but that’s normal. I Would inform them this is no longer “so and so’s” phone number and then would block them. Over the course of time I’ve learned the previous phone number holders name and nicknames but that’s about it. Since the beginning of December I’ve been getting calls from this woman who would call looking for “so and so” and i would tell her “this isn’t ‘so and so’s’ number anymore and then would block it.” But she managed to keep getting new phone numbers and continuing to call. It turned into this degrading competition to her to see how many nasty things she could call me. I told her the whole story. How i have had the phone number for a while and that that’s how i knew who the previous owner was but that i didn’t know him in real life and she wouldn’t believe me. She would call and say awful things. Calling me a “scary ass bitch.” “That I’m just a little side hoe” that i was nothing but a “little piece of ass” for this man. So i put her phone number into Facebook and sure enough i found her and where she lives and all about her. Mind you any time she would call from a new number i would continue to block it. Then she decided to start calling from No Caller ID which i couldn’t block. I would get 40 phone calls in 5 minutes from this woman. Continuing to leave voicemails and call me horrible things. Now she’s threatening to show up to the previous phone number owners home and “beat the fuck out of me” i told her I’m filing a police report. But I’m not sure how to go about that. I’ve never had to do this before. I seriously want her to learn a lesson. She’s nearly 40 years old. It’s not like she’s a 16 year old little girl who’s got her britches up her butt. This is a grown woman calling and harassing and threatening me and I’m only barely turning 20.   Suggestions? And how should i go about filing a report?   Thank you so much in advance. 	No
Hi /r/legaladvice Partner and I are looking at settling for a brand new place tomorrow. Unfortunately it is not ready to live in with a number of issues that still require a clean up. The vendors (also the builders) have stated they will fix it up when they return from their holiday on the 22/7. I have this in writing via email. Would it still be advisable to withhold an amount of settlement? Is there any legal obligation for them to make sure everything is fixed up? My solicitor had informed me that if I trust the vendor I can let it be sorted out. I was also informed that I may request for them to pay the necessary costs for me to fix up the property, if this has not been completed within the defect rectification period.	No
My dad abused me to the point where I had so much adrenaline pumped I could barely even feel the physical pain with household items used as weapons against me. I don't think I need to go into the details, but this was in a country with basically non existent child protection laws and I decided not to go to the embassy on the basis that it would be better to request aid in Canada.(and I was too scared to)  The abuse hasn't happened after a bit more than a week of being in Canada, but is there anything I can/should legally do? I don't want to mess up anyone's life, but since he's betrayed my trust so many times and significantly affected me, I don't want him to go unpunished.  Yes, I am under his(and my mother's) custody and I am living with them.	No
All of the following events took place within the last week. I live in a gated student living apartment complex for university kids. From the end of July to August is move out and in. I was moving out of one house to another in the same gated complex. I got permission to move into my new house one day early (Thursday) from one of the ladies who works in our front office (I'm not quite sure her official position but she basically deals with the kids and obviously has some authority, I will call her Sam just to help keep track. Sam gave me permission but said I'd be working around cleaners, I was fine with that. So I move some of my stuff in early, approximately one fourth, not seeing anybody at all. I left a note saying this was my stuff and I had permission to move in early. The next day, Friday, I return and all of my things have been moved into the bathroom and new carpets put in. I didn't end up moving much more stuff Friday because I thought they might've wanted the stuff left there to finish cleaning. Early Saturday, I drove by and saw Mexican cleaning ladies going in and out, I decided to wait to move my stuff so I wouldn't be in their way. When I finally returned Saturday, all of my things had been moved downstairs by the door and several valuables were missing (unopened basketball shoes, gear vr, old phone, my girlfriend's dog bet etc.. basically just things that were obvious you would take to make money on or keep for yourself). I contacted Sam immediately and she came over, apologized and promised to get a hold of the cleaning company. Sunday morning I emailed Sam and told her I was going to file a police report. She showed up at my old house with one of the people that would be moving in (there are several per house, I was the only one in my new house so far though). She told me that basically she had been trying to get a hold of the cleaning company all that time (Saturday-Approximately Noon Sunday) and that they didn't want me to file a report because the cleaning ladies were illegals. I was understanding and she said the guy who they worked for would move some money around and have it to me by Wednesday (today). Come today I email and ask about my money, instead of Sam replying, it is another lady in the office and she tells me to come in to talk to her. I go in and they basically blind side, me tell me to file a report, tell me they won't give me names of employees who were in my apartment that day (I'll have to get them from the company, who they hired independantly), and take me on a legal roundabout basically just trying to cover their butt. I got a bit upset and obviously when I brought up the fact that they knowing hired illegals she ignored it. I'm not sure if I can make an insurance claim because I hadn't switched the address yet, but frankly I don't want to. What is my legal recourse against the apartment complex. I have a friend who was in the room when Sam said they were illegals and he is willing to testify. Getting my money back for my things would be nice, but I would much prefer revenge for how they handled the whole situation and lied to me.	No
So basically, I will be moving in Sept, I signed a lease probably 2 months ago with a landlord and one of my roommates. We completed the paperwork but when she asked for the deposit, we had cash. She said they wouldn't accept cash and only check, since I work a Monday-Fri all day, I wasn't able to get the check to her that day and we would have to schedule for another day. She said that would be fine and to call her in regards to scheduling an appointment to give her the deposit. It's been about a month now and she has not responded to my calls, voicemails, or emails as well as my roommates. The website still gives the same contact info, and we can't reach anybody at management. I'm starting to get worried since again I have to move out in less than a month and I'm not sure where that puts me. We didn't get any of the copy paperwork since she said we would get it once we gave her the deposit. Is there anything I can do or should I start looking for a new place? Thank you!	No
I've got a large oak tree along my rear fence and the people on the other side are complaining to me that it's pushing into their pool cage, I'm inclined to tell them to stop bothering me about it but won't until I know whether it's my responsibility or not (I'm curious so I know how to respond, they're probably unable to legally pursue this since their pool cage comes right up to the fence so if they brought the county in to force me to cut that limb off it's likely they'd be told their new pool cage isn't to code!  That said, if it'd be my responsibility legally, I'd still go and deal with it, so want to find out for sure!)  Oak tree is ~30' tall, branch in question is ~15' up and growing directly at the top of their pool cage.  Tree's trunk is right against my side of the rear/shared fence!  Thanks for any help!	No
My Girlfriend's ex who hasn't lived with her in almost a year is currently making her life hell Bc we got together. We went to the beach for the weekend with me and her and her son, and he went to the landlord and told him that she moved out and got the locks changed. She is still on the lease and pays all the bills. After getting this sorted is there any legal action we can take to remove him from the property entitlements.	No
"I have a friend who I wish to help, and I have no idea how to go about it. She's a woman in her forties who lost vision in her right eye due to an accident with a burning ember. Her eye socket was badly burned and she became *mostly* blind in that eye. Her first physician treated her with some type of steroid eye drops. She was prescribed the drops and told explicitly to only use them *only* with her damaged eye, and never under any circumstances with her good eye. Fast forward approximately two months, and my friend was given a new doctor. I'm unsure about the details and reasons for the switch; all I know is it had something to do with her insurance. So, she meets with her new doctor and the doctor examines her and studies the details of her case. The woman doctor then decides that my friend should continue with the same medicine which she was originally prescribed by the first physician, with one difference: she was told to use the steroid eye drops in *both* eyes. My friend objected, and did so in a very adamant and serious and confident manner. ""But Doctor So And So very specifically and very plainly told me in no uncertain terms that I was to never, never, *never* put those drops in my good eye. He told me over and over, he really drove the point home and underlined emphatically to not let the steroid drops get anywhere near the other eye."" And so on. Somehow though, this new physician who had been assigned to her managed to eventually convince my friend to entirely disregard what the other doctor had told her. And this was a BIG and LOUD sort of conversation these two had, almost verging on a heated argument. And so, in the end, my friend submitted to the new physician's orders. She was a doctor and she knew best. And so my friend returns home, puts the medicine in both eyes, and goes to bed. When she awakens the next morning the world is blackness. She is 100% blind. I won't go into the aftermath, the bottomless depression, the sense that her life had become the worst, most terrifying nightmare, the *endless* crying, etcetera. Suffice it to say she suffers *enormously*, and the fact that she caved in and ignored her instincts only adds a whole other Hell-Factor to it all. And to make matters even worse, she's living with an abusive and horrible man who she had a kid with, and she's scared to death of him. Always has been, really. He's completely drained her bank account since the blindness, he's hit her on at least one occasion that I know of, and once, when she meekly stood up to him and refused to do something for him involving her bank, he kicked her out of his car and left her alone and stranded in the middle of downtown Seattle. ""Get out and find your own way back."" I could go on but I won't, suffice it to say her life is an unbelievably bleak and abysmal mess. No one has helped her with this, and she lives in fear. So, I'm wondering how to proceed. I'm going to anything and everything I can to assist her, but I don't know where to begin. Would a contingency lawyer be prone to rip her off to the fullest possible degree? My working hypothesis is a strong YES, and I'd be grateful if any honest and knowledgable person could explain how that scenario might play out. And lastly I should mention that proving all of this is a piece of cake. Numerous witnesses saw and heard and were present when this second doctor gave these harmful directions to my friend. So there won't be any problem with that. She has written proof as well in the form of a prescription and in the form of this doctor's hand-written note.   And I apologize for the breathless and unorganized text; I just let it all pour out as plainly as I could. And again, I would be grateful if any knowledgable person were kind enough to help with advice or information or honest help in any other form."	No
So, Here is the story  I live in an apartment for two years, and I set up a direct deposit to pay my rent. When I set it up, I made the payments come out every 30 days rather than every month. So as time went on they started walking forward (as some months had less than 30 days) my landlord called me and told me it was late, I checked and turned out it was two weeks early because of this. I fixed it but was still a month early. She said that I could skip my next payment to get back on track. Before I could do this my first lease ended and I signed a new lease around the middle of September, backdating it to August 1st (the start of the first lease) so that I could leave the residence then as I would not be renewing the lease again. She requested that I pay increased rent and pay her additionally for August and September as the increase in rent would apply at the start of the new lease. I agreed to this and started an electronic transfer of the money before it was deposited she called me very angry stating that she needed to be paid immediately, I called my girlfriend and she took a check to her that day (I got a receipt for this). I ended up leaving the residence a month early (June 31 instead of Aug 1) I had already paid her for July when I started the lease. I don't expect any return of my money for July as the lease went until August. Although I would like a return of my deposit and return of the overpayment that I made, As of today 7/25 I have not heard from her. She has my new address as I gave it to her when she did a final walkthrough. As a side note, I have bank statements and receipts showing all the payments that were made to her and when. Although I do not have a copy of the second lease as she did not provide it to me when I signed it, she intended to make copies but never did.   What are my options? Small claims court? What is the stipulations on return of deposit and when should I pursue this legally	No
So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
"Hi r/legaladvice.  Important background info: I am a minor who will be applying to colleges starting in November. I have 5 months left until I turn 18. My mom is disabled and her sole income is from SSI.  Two years ago, my dad told us that him and my mom have been divorced since 2003; however, she did not recall ever signing dissolution papers. He had also been living with us this whole time and taking almost all of my mom's money. He gave us a big binder full of unorganized papers and left us with almost no money. Upon rehashing the papers, I showed my mom her signature and she said that is was not hers. So at this point, she had been unknowingly divorced for 12 years.  My dad had paid for my brother's college education, but he told me last week that he would not be contributing anything to my education. I do not expect my mom to contribute much, however, because she has a small income. So, growing frustrated with this whole mess, I drove to my local courthouse and asked to open the file in case there were some papers we didn't have.   As I went through the file, I discovered that a judge had ordered all of the petitions and papers ""void ab initio"" only a month after them being filed. The reasoning was because they were all prepared by a lawyer who was not licensed to practice in Illinois.  I went to a lawyer to ask him to just decipher the language for me and he told me what it all meant. He was also concerned why I was doing most of this alone, and it is because my mom is deathly afraid of my dad. When he left, he threatened us to not file anything in court, or else he will kick us out of our own house.  I told her today what is going on. She is speechless but has agreed that, with my support, she will go to the court to file the petition for dissolution, as well as a petition for college expenses.   We are both wondering now if we should get an attorney before we file the petitions? Should we go file them first? What happens if this case is not resolved once I turn 18--does it all go to dust? Can we call 911 if he comes to our house to threaten us again?  Thank you in advance for any advice. I am a little overwhelmed as I am the supporter for both my mom and myself, but I would really like this to be solved and done with before next autumn."	No
"Hello all,  We are a new clothing company based out of Phoenix AZ. We are in a very early stages of creating this business so I wanted to cover everything to make sure what I am printing is legal. Our shirts have sayings such as ""Kill ____ ____"". The blank spaces are the names of certain people such as politicians and celebrities. I wanted to see if I can legally print and sell shirts with this type of wording on them. ""Kill"" Murder"" and other violent terms. I know it sounds weird but I have made a couple and have people tell me how much they love them all the time. If you could help me out, that would be great."	No
This is my first time posting to Reddit at all, so bear with me. I took a number of topless photos when I was younger. They were for my own personal use only, and although I shared them in limited capacity, I didn't think much of it (I was in my early 20s and stupid.) The first incident happened in early 2014, and my photos for put on a revenge porn site (if you don't know what those are, you can research them, they're pretty horrible.) I paid money to have them taken down by a DOA site that specializes in that sort of thing, and for 3 years I heard and saw nothing. Now whoever is posting them is back, they used my name and information and pictures on the site fetlife. I had them removed there by the site immediately. Now today I have been informed that someone posted my stuff on Craigslist. No contact info was apparently given (I'm hearing of this one thru a friend) but it was deleted soon after without my intervention.   My question is this. What would be the best action for me? This is a huge invasion of my privacy, and I'm scared. Whoever posts these things makes it seem like I'm into hardcore rape fantasy and noncon, and I feel like my life is in danger from this, considering they put my real name, city in which I live, and updated pictures of me that they gleaned from Facebook (I have it set to completely private but they just grabbed my profile pic I assume.) I would like to take some sort of legal action but I also know that it's incredibly hard to do so.   Tl;dr I'm being repeatedly doxxed with my own pictures and I'm terrified and I want to figure out what to do. I don't know who is doing this, it's not an ex as I have good relationships with all of them. It's someone who just doesn't like me because it's always the same info they use and the same nasty descriptions. Help?!	No
"**Apologies for the lengthy post.**   Myself and 3 roommates rented a 4 bedroom house near San Diego, CA for three years. Deposit was $4000 ($3200 base deposit + $800 pet deposit for 2 small dogs and a cat).   I personally busted my butt cleaning the house before we moved out - vacuuming, mopping, cleaning the appliances (fridge, stove), etc. Short of shampooing the carpets, the place was as clean as it was when we moved in. When we did our final walkthrough, we pointed out the damages we knew we were going to be responsible for:  * There was a leak underneath the sink that we were not aware of until the day we packed the kitchen that had done damage to the bottom beneath the sink (this was where our plastic bags were stored, so we did not see this leak or the damage) * Roommate's cat:   * Clawed the edge of his carpet near the door, so that room would need to be recarpeted  * Clawed about 18 of the window screens throughout the house (we bought screening from Home Depot and were able to replace about 9-10 of them ourselves, but ran out of time to do the rest - we left the screen and tools for the landlord to get someone to finish the rest of the screens)  * Clawed two horizontal wooden blinds * Misc wear and tear on 2 sliding screen doors  All of this was pointed out the day of our final walkthrough, which was 2 days after we had all moved out. She seemed ok with the state of the house and that we were aware of these damages.  Some other notes:   * We made 3 trips to the dump, but the trash bin outside was still full to the brim. Throughout the week, I returned to the house and took whatever overflow trash could fit in my car to the nearest dumpster. * There was a darkened area of carpet in the master bedroom (not the carpet that was torn up) from where a computer chair had been  California requires that the landlord send either an itemized list of damages (with documentation/receipts) or estimates within 21 days. **Our landlord sent us only an itemized list on the 23rd day, without a single receipt.** It's been a full month since this initial list, and we still have not received a single receipt from her. On top of this, she claims our damages exceed $5200, which includes:  * $150 for a water bill that was already paid * $1000 for paint  * $420 for air duct cleaning * $400 for window screens + $338 for sliding door screens (again, we provided several rolls of screen) * $205 for leak damage we were not aware of * $370 for ""deep cleaning"" * $120 for trash removal ????  * It cost us $84 to make 3 trips to the dump ourselves, and I took the trash overflow to dumpsters myself * $1370 for carpet replacement + $220 for carpet cleaning  * NOTE: Claims the darkened spot and ""pet stains"" render the master bedroom carpet uncleanable (the dog did not pee on the carpet once, these were normal marks that occurred the week of moving out)   Overall, the total exceeds **$5200** (w/ estimates).   After being completely shell shocked by this list (in 10+ years of renting, I've always received 80-100% of my deposit back without issue), I did some research on what a landlord can use the deposit for in California. Basically, it comes down to determining what is reasonable wear and tear. For example, a paint's indoor life is considered to be about 2-3 years. So, a landlord cannot charge for paint if the tenants stay exceeds that amount. Additionally, the tenant should only be responsible for the ""remaining life"" for a carpet replacement. For example, if a carpet's life is determined to be about 8 years, the carpet is 3 years old, and needs to be replaced, the tenant is only responsible for the remaining life of that carpet - 5/8ths of the cost of replacement.   Anyway, after doing this research, I put together a document that provides a response to each item on the list she sent us, with links to footnotes with more detail. I used the [California Department of Consumer Affairs website](http://www.dca.ca.gov/publications/landlordbook/sec-deposit.shtml) as a main reference, and linked to specific areas within the document. **Based on this information, our item-by-item estimation was that we were responsible for about $2000 worth of damages.**  A few days after I sent this letter, she responded with a short e-mail that read:  &gt; ""I read your letter and the cited references. My previous letter remains unchanged. When you proceed with small claims courts, **I would then have to counter claim for all the costs including those above your deposit amount.**""  That's the last that we've heard from her. I responded to her e-mail with another letter that outlined the fact that she violated our lease by not sending the itemized list within 21 days, and the fact that we have not received any receipts, despite reminding her that we are owed them in our last letter. I also attached a list of third-party mediators -   &gt;We would very much prefer to settle this matter outside of small claims court, and would like to present an option: seeking the help of a mediation service to help facilitate a mutual agreement outside of court.  It's been almost 4 weeks and she has not responded.  I'm 90% ready to move forward to small-claims court, as well as 2 of my 3 roommates. However, we wanted to make sure that we are not completely off-base here. From telling this story to others that have gone through similar situations in California, I keep getting told that there is almost no way for her to win in Small Claims. I've tried getting in touch with the Legal Tenant Center and the County Bar Association for information about getting a consultation, but I keep getting the runaround (unreturned voicemails, ""try calling this number instead"", etc).   We've been very courteous with her and have not contacted her by text or phone, only by e-mail and letter (I sent paper copies of our 2 responses along with the e-mails). What should my next step be? Should we go ahead and file? Or should I try to get a consultation? What do I do? This is a lot of money to just let slide, which is what one of my roommates wants to do (since it was his cat that did most of the actual damage).  Thanks!"	No
We just moved out of our apartment in FL after doing a walk through and being charged a $75 cleaning fee. They said everything seemed good and we would get our last water bill later on.  Today we got a bill for ($70) for the water. We moved out mid month and usually the water bill was ($40) for the whole month.  They also charged us ($295) for replacing the living room carpet, which they had seen during the walk through.  After doing some research online I found that normal wear and tear does not allow them to ask the tenant to pay for it. I guess it had some stains where the furniture had been sitting. But the carpet was old when we moved in.  We did not take pictures because of the walk through, we assumed everything was fine.  What do we do/say from here?	No

Was recently attacked by two dogs who broke through a door while walking in my subdivision; total of 12 stitches to my upper right arm.  Report was filled with the police and animal control and the owner is being investigated. Dogs are still in the home.   I contacted my HOA president and suggested she notify the neighborhood residents of two dogs and the attack; especially since they broke down the front door to get after me. She stated that she will not notify the residents, for fear of being sued if she mentions his address. Rather send an email out reminding people of our HOA rules. Everyday since the attack, I watch families and children walk in front of the same house and cringe thinking it will happen again. Should my HOA notify the residents? Can they be sued for mentioning his address even though the police report will be public knowledge? Unfortunately I have a feeling that the HOA president knows this dog owner and that is playing a part in her decision.	No
Hello, I had an apartment in Richmond, VA, with 3 other people.  We were all on the lease.  One decided to leave the state with no forewarning and another got pregnant and moved out.  after the two left, the other decided to not pay rent anymore.  I was the only one paying my quarter.  It has been 3 months now of just me paying and we have officially been evicted.  I know this will hurt my credit greatly.  I was wondering if there was anything I could do to change my credit.  Can I sue them and have my credit changed, or am I just screwed?  I have kept all my receipts from my payments, but I am not sure how to proceed.   Thank you	No
I signed a lease and paid the security deposit for an apartment in a building that was under construction which they assured me would be ready by July 1st. It's now the 12th and it's still not ready. The landlord says it's the electric company that keeps delaying their end of things but when I visit the property it's obvious there have been significant delays from his end also. He says he will pro-rate the rent based on whatever date we end up moving in and the lease basically says that is all he is liable for. Is that legal? Shouldn't he be liable for more or am I screwed either way because I signed the lease?	No
Nebraska's hiring agency appears to not be applying my veteran's preference correctly. I am appealing the decisions with the state and I see I am required to specify the relief I seek. This is an administrative proceeding.  I can't prove my preference was ignored in hiring, but there are process requirements for applicants with preference that were unmet.   Given that the positions are filled, what relief can/should I ask for?	No
When in reality the dog got loose and I was chasing the dog.  It is infuriating that they charged me for something that I did not have any control over. My small dog(rat terrier mix) is not dangerous but not smart either.  And I would not let her off leash on purpose because she will surely get hit by a car. I tried to reason with them but they would not listen.  How can I fight this?	No
Seller agreed to do certain repairs.  Now I will check myself if they are done and final walk through, but what do I know?  If I have it inspected after close, and am told it was not done properly can I still go after the seller for the cost to do the repair properly?  Or is closing accepting the house as it is?	No
"Hey Reddit,  I purchased a new construction home 1.5 years ago and ever since I've had a horrible time with the builder.  You can see in my previous posts, I've had issues with my house smelling like crap, and they just ended up trying to find workarounds (this also excludes the 20 or so other major issues that were wrong at closing as well), I've had shingles rip off, I've had siding rip off, I've had issues with the house not being square.... I've just hit my patience with these guys... end rant.  So my question is, my 1 year warranty just expired a year ago, but I just found out what they didn't frame the house using the right materials.  The blueprints clearly show they should have used 6"" studs vs 4"".  Am I allowed to legally take action since they didn't frame a large portion of the house out correctly, or am I stuck since the warranty window just expired?  I live in North Dakota, so most builders say to use 6"" studs on exterior walls due to the harsh cold from the winter.  Appreciate any help in advance."	No
My new husband and his ex-wife have joint legal custody of their two children, 10 and 11. He is the parent with primary physical custody, however, and they reside with us the majority of the time, with her receiving standard 1st, 3rd, 5th weekend visitation, as well as other holidays, etc., as noted in their agreement.   She is, however, a very high-conflict individual. My husband receives many texts blowups, sometimes almost daily, which usually escalate to her calling him over and over, or emailing him long diatribes if both of those avenues fail. Sometimes this will slow for about a week until the inevitable flair blindsides us again.   These communications can range from demands for him to provide her my social security information to run a background check on me since I reside with her children, to detailed questions about things in our home; do we have parental locks on all electronic devices? Do we have a gun safe? What is the “safety plan” for her children now that my son (13) also resides in the home? We need to provide her with the children’s cell carrier and plan information so she can monitor those accounts (in our name, which we pay for). Where are their shot records, right now? Why aren’t we making sure those phones aren’t on every minute, every day, as they should be reachable to her at any time?   These are just some of many examples of demands, all given in command form, “You need to do this, RIGHT NOW.” They’re interwoven with name calling, verbal attacks, bullying, and total emotional meltdowns in which she has once even insinuated she will take her life, tell her children she loves them!, or a time when she had the children and refused to commit to returning them at the end of visitation, saying she’d be in another state, or maybe another city (although she DID return them, after we both were insane with worry and stress). The emotional breakdowns when calls aren’t answered or texts aren’t replied to, or information she wants isn’t given, can also come with threats to show up on our door at 3am to take the kids because we are unfit, to call the police, or just standard legal threats of all of these refusals to her demands or communications being “documented” for her records.   Emotionally demanded or not, she has the rights she has as ordered by the state to her kids and information about them. Having joint custody means, (I believe?) she is supposed to have a say in their day-to-day life, but I’m not sure what our responsibility is on that front, or what the actual actions are to carry out abidance to that looks like. We do know WE have the right to have a life that isn’t plagued with these demands and emotional attacks under the guise of it being about the sake and safety of the children. We are planning on communicating our intent our ground rules and guidelines about communications with her, including we will not communicate on anything but things which are about the kids, and further than that, that we will only communicate with her about things about the kids which we are LEGALLY bound to do.   With all of this said, even generally, what are we legally bound to do? I know most of this rests in what’s in the custody agreement, but it’s pretty standard for the terms listed, no special previsions or demands made and signed to. Is there a place to start before we make is serious by heading to the lawyer for legal counsel? We’re willing to do so eventually, but dang… we just want to know if we’re overreacting when we should have been saying, “LOL yeah right!” from the get go before we get official.   Thank you in advance if anyone out there is with me this long. I appreciate any pointers or guidance on this issue for my family.	No
Hello - over the last few years, I noticed my skin had been getting progressive worse like I'm really allergic to something.  I've documented the deterioration of my skin the whole time at my doctor's behest.  Over the last two years, I've worked with my doctors to try everything possible - from steroids to light therapy to daily injections.  Nothing worked.  My doctor began to wonder if it was an environmental issue and encouraged me to stay away from my old, musty office for two weeks and see what happens - lo and behold, my skin turned almost back to normal for the first time in years.    I came back to my boss and talked to her about options for me to continue working - I offered telecommuting, working in another office across the street and coming in for meetings, etc.  She refused to work with me on anything.  I'm now taking medical leave.  What options do I have?	No
During a tag type game in gym, my son (age 12) suffered two breaks in his wrist when he ran into the unpadded wall while being pursued.  The school has been making accommodations for his injury (a  buddy to write, etc.), but they wouldn't show the gym to my wife. She found a picture online (linked below). Most of the wall is uncovered.  I have never brought legal action in my life. However, there will be medical bills from this, and other kids could be hurt in the future if the school does not add more padding. Wondering if I should contact an attorney, or if I should just go to the school with the medical bills and request they pay and also add more padding. Thanks.  http://imgur.com/a/QGSyO   Edit - NC is location. I don't need or appreciate snarky replies.

I was billed for damages to a filling cabinet by my University in Pennsylvania. Those damages already existed not only when I moved in to the room this school year (16-17), but also before I moved in to the same room for the last school year (15-16). I found a photo showing the damage to the cabinet already existed at the end of the last school year and filed an appeal (decision pending). Unfortunately I don't have any photos from move-in last school year.  My questions are:  1) Given that we sign a new dorm agreement each school year and move out of the dorms for the summer, could the school still charge me and claim I caused the damage last school year (which I didn't)?    2) What rights do I have? E.g. do normal PA tenant-landlord laws apply if the residence was a dorm administered by a University?  Thanks in advance for any help!	No
"I am a renter in Pasadena, CA. I am currently on a month-to-month lease. On July 18 I gave notice that I was vacating on August 20 [my lease asks that I give 30 days notice], but I accidentally paid for my full August rent. When I asked my landlord to return the last 11 days of rent he said that he is ""not going to be able to offer a prorate for an early move out.""  Am I entitled to the return of my last 11 days rent? If so, what California statute can I point out to him?"	No
Late Saturday night my downstairs neighbors called the police on my husband and I for arguing (the walls are thin here), we did not answer the door because the neighbors call the cops constantly over the most minor things like doing dishes, watching tv, walking around at night and so on, every time we HAVE answered the door in the past the officers simply tell us they got an anonymous complaint for noise, and that they couldn't hear anything, then they leave.  We stopped answering the door quite a while ago, because it's just an annoyance.  However when the police officers arrived Saturday night they MIGHT have heard my husband raising his voice, but we weren't in need of any sort of police assistance, it was just an argument, so we did not answer the door.  Anyway, today (Monday) I got a knock on my door in the morning while I was still in bed, then again at 6:00 PM, both times an officer not in uniform, but with a badge, had a clipboard with paperwork. The 2nd time I did try to answer the door but the officer was already leaving.  My question is this, what could they possibly want?  Could this be related to blatantly not answering the door on Saturday night over a noise complaint?  Or is this possibly a subpoena they are trying to serve on an unrelated case (last year someone attacked me and destroyed some of my property and he's still going through pre-trials)  Either way, I haven't gotten anything in the mail.  I'm just wondering what could be going on.  It's too late for me to call the district attorney's office to ask if this is about the court case I'm a victim in, and I'm scared it might not be about that and might be about that stupid argument my husband and I got into Saturday night....  Anxiety is eating me up about this.	No
This is the third time in a week we've had some kind of power shutoff. We've had exactly one advance warning, and we've lost food that we had in the fridge. Can we withhold rent in the amount it would take to replace our groceries, or are we out of luck?	No
Hey /r/legaladvice. This is probably an easier question to answer. I bought a duplex a few years ago and the tenant whose living in the other side has lived there since 2000. I've had zero issues with him  since buying the place. He pays on time, he's clean, he does minor repairs himself, and he's a great guy in general. I got pretty lucky.  He told me he wants to update his renters insurance and they are asking for an updated lease since his lease was made 17 years ago. I haven't hired a property manager because it's really low effort with him and I haven't felt I would need any legal help with him as a tenant.   I don't want to just copy his old lease as it's one page and there's not a whole lot on it that protects me or him for that matter. I googled leases and there's just so much out there, it was overwhelming. My main concern is going with an online tool that ends up not covering me legally if a problem were ever to arise so I'm just unsure if it's smart to even use the online tools.   My question is, is there an online tool you'd recommend using for creating a lease or should I hire a property manager to write up a new lease? It'll be month to month and the rent is staying the same, he just needs this for his renters insurance.	No
I am a naturalized citizen and have been planning to change my first and last name for quite a long time. Unfortunately, I am currently going through a divorce in the state of Illinois.   Will the court reject my request for a name change if I am going through a divorce?	No
(KS) I have moved out to an apartment. We have been fairly amicable to this point. She has decided that she wants to go ahead and file for divorce now. She lives with her parents. She pays no rent. I have a fairly new job after going to school for two years and I am still getting my financial stability under me. Her answer to the budget stated in the DRA is a hypothetical budget of what she'd spend IF/WHEN she moves into a new situation. The state of Kansas utilizes third party child support and the sooner we file, the sooner I get a massive payment that will be tough to handle as of now. Any suggestions to what I can do to postpone filing or payments? I can try and clarify with any questions. We have been married eight years and have one child. Thank you for your time.	No

I pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia and reckless driving in 2015 in North Dakota. Misdemeanor A and C respectively.   Today i received  mail from the court judge saying I got deferred imposition of the  sentences and my case has been dismissed, and records sealed.    If an employer asks if I've ever had a conviction should I say no? Do i  need to explain all this in my future interviews?	No
Allow me to explain the situation: I met and became friends with a trans woman online. She's caring, kind and is very motherly, a bit overweight and in her mid 30's. As I talked with her and got to know her, I began to learn more about her personal life and came to discover she's had quite a sad lot in life. She's married to trans man who is at best neglectful and unloving, at worst physically and mentally abusive, mentioning to me having to cover up bruises from pinches and slaps. Apparently about 5 years ago, they had an agreement to have an open relationship, but only with members of the same sex (this was pre transition for both of them). He(she at the time) broke this agreement and had an affair with someone of the opposite sex and when confronted about it, they blamed her(him at the time) for it. Apparently ever since he's made her the scapegoat for all their personal and relationship problems. This has had a considerable tole on her, becoming extremely depressed and attempting suicide by over overdose at least once. She's mentioned multiple times that she see herself making it through the next few years. She's also in a very bad place financially, unable to afford a divorce or even the $700 fee to change her name and gender on her driver's license. Despite my urges to seek help with a therapist or psychiatrist or even just staying with her parents for a bit while she sorts things out, she always brushes them aside, apparently viewing herself as a lost cause or saying the didn't help in the past. Here's where my end of the problems come in. I'm a 19 y/o male who is currently unemployed and I live on the east coast of America, while she lives somewhere in Northern California (she told me the exact name of her town once, but I forgot it now. Something like Sherryville or Cherryville if anyone is more familiar with the California area). I'm also not sure she'll even take any advice or contact anyone or anything that I ask her too. I want desperately to help her somehow and it breaks my heart to even have to write this and recall some of the things she's been through. Please, please, I just need some advice.	No
Currently my roommate and I are renting an apartment for 1010 a month and have a year long lease. Since fall semester is coming up apartment companies are marketing like crazy and we found out that our management is now offering our same exact style of two bedroom apartments for only 700 a month. We contacted them and inquired about the price decline and they said that we are locked into the above 1010 price. Anything we can do? 	No
"I was walking with my friends in a casino when out of nowhere some random guy intentionally strong armed me right in my pregnant belly, knocked all the water I had in my hand over. Security was literally 2 feet away from me and fid notthing. As I approached security and told them if they were going to do something about it they told me "" sorry were kinda busy right now escorting someone out"" and just left.  I started to feel short of breath and in pain literally 2 mins later. I went up to another security and told them of what happened and it wasn't until I told them I was pregnant and in pain that they started to take down a report. Do I have any legal recourse?  Went to hospital to check on baby and they said baby looks fine but to check up with my dr"	No
"My sister M is currently 13. Earlier this year, she started self harming and one of her friends reported it to the school. M talked to a school counselor and confessed that she had been molested as a child by one of my cousins. The counselor then shared this information with my family (and the police I assume? Aren't school counselors mandated reporters?). None of us had even suspected a thing and it was horrible for pretty much everyone in my immediate family (no one outside my parents and siblings knew or even suspected). Now here's the part where I want legal advice:  My sister M was 7 when my 16 year old cousin molested her on 3 different occasions. She is now 13, like I said. Even if M does decide she wants to press charges (and I don't think she is currently in a place to feel comfortable doing so), is there like any chance in hell that something will come of it? The cousin who molested her was a minor at the time, no one witnessed it, and while I and my family of course believe M, it happened 6 years ago so I'm afraid there's not any ""proof."" Note: this cousin joined the military out of high school and we have not seen him in years. Does being in the military affect this at all, if charges were to be brought against him? I'm mostly terrified that he will be able to hurt (or has already hurt) other children and, of course, I also want him to rot in hell/jail for what he did to my sister. Pressing charges is ultimately going to be M's decision (with support from her therapist and all of us), but what are the odds that it's even worth our time (ie, will actually go somewhere legally) and her possibly having to see him again in court to press charges?"	No
"CA/Alameda county/Bay Area So long story short, I am posting for my brother. He is getting a divorce and she won't leave until he signs a paper saying he kicked her out with is untrue. A little backstory: they got together when she was in high school and then had a baby so never finished high school until some time later. fast forwarding, they got married and had kid number 2. They have been living together for quite some time but obviously unhappy. I mean I'm not rude or anything but she's a 2 and he's like a 7 at least right so how they got together is still a big question.....anyways the point is she's stuck in her high school mentality or something, never grew up. When they got together she became a ""housewife"" because she has no job and doesn't do anything with her life. She sits at her house watching netflix all day/facebooking all day. Her kids are usually dirty, her house is always a mess. Literally her dishes would be piled in her sink and she would leave them there for weeks! The house would smell like sewer because if the rotten food on the stove! Half of her food in the fridge was always decomposing!The kids clothes are small and not to mention the kids clothes smell rotten because she washes them and then dries them days later. Im pretty sure they shower every other week too! Now my brother works graveyard shifts all the time. He comes home and wants a hot meal and a clean home and clean kids! but no. So of course he would be unhappy! mind you she can go to the store anytime she wants she has a joint debit card with him. Theres so much to this story but i guess thats the basics. Now. I wanna know what can he do incase she tries him in court. I mean he brings in all the money, he provides for them and she's a stay at home mom. never had a job before and doesn't even clean or do anything at home. She wants to get full custody of the children. She wants him to sign a paper saying my brother kicked her out so she can pull it up in court. He told her if she wants to leave the door is open, but he will not continue to pay her phone, bills, buy her stuff , etc. I think she's crazy and honestly i don't know how they have lasted years of marriage, its been around 10 years. OH! and they have a new house together and of course the house is not paid off yet so its legally not theirs yet but i also am curious about the home. Someone please tell me what could happen and whats the best way to go and etc. Thanks!!"	No

I'm currently trying to get a divorce in Hawaii. My ex moved back to the mainland back in 2015, so this has been a wild ride. I've pushed for her to sign all the papers since early 2016, and she finally has sent all the documents *except* the appearance and waiver. Now she's gone no contact despite saying she would send the last document. She hasn't replied to any of my emails since June 1st. I'm kind of in a hurry now because I'm gone until September and then leaving to go overseas with the military in October for over 6 months. I'm not able to use the military legal services because she can't, which is a whole other story.  My question is, can a judge grant the divorce without this *one* paper? Do I have to get a lawyer involved? If I do have to get a lawyer and we can't get this figured out before I leave, will I not be able to finish it until I get back?	No
"Need a little bit of legal advice. The company I was working for has been in the process of paying me back freelancer invoices back when I was under a 1099 a while ago. During that time period I had gone full-time with them and I was receiving a weekly paycheck.  Back in January/December, the company moved from one state to another and the owner was trying to make that change reflect in our taxes that are taken out as New Hampshire's is lower. There were a few pay periods that were missed, but then I resumed getting new ones again and was told that I would be reimbursed for those that I had not received during the transition, along with the original freelance checks. (At this point some of you may be wondering, why didn't you leave or take action at that point or earlier? Well, this industry is notorious for not paying people, but it is also difficult to find a position like the one that I was in, so I felt like it was the best opportunity and the reputation and experience to me at the time was worth it. I was also fresh out of school at the time.)  During my final 2 weeks which was a few months ago, 2 of the checks that they had written to pay me back for the original missed pay periods had bounced. Also, during those 2 weeks I didn't receive an automatic deposit, so I approached my employer about it. They basically said that they had a lot less money to pay me than they thought and that it wasn't fair for me to continue to work there while I wasn't getting paid.  I'm not really privy to the behind the scenes accounting, but I can't imagine they're particularly good at it. My employer wrote up a document to basically say that they were suspending payment for a while and verbally said that they would look to get me paid back within 4 weeks. Verbally, they said that want to bring me back on full-time again once the work picks up. Its been about 2 months, and I have received a replacement check for one of those missed pay periods, but I haven't received word on when I will be expecting more.  Basically, I'm trying to figure out what sort of legal power/ability I have under my control between the freelancer checks, the full-time missed pay periods, the bounced checks, and the sudden suspension of employment even though I was under contract. I'm definitely tired of waiting around and even though I would hate to break off the relationship with this company, money is more important to me at this point. If they are legitimately ""out of money"" I understand that they can only do so much to pay me back, but they lacked the foresight to deal with that preemptively and allowed me to work without receiving payments. I also feel like they are doing what they can to pay me back, as I have received one of the replacement checks, so I'm not sure if that changes anything from a legal perspective."	No
Basically what the title says. I just got hired in California by a restaurant chain. I'm sitting in the employee orientation and the HR lady says employees aren't eligible for health insurance until 1 year. I was under the impression that the ACA chAnged this to a 90 day minimum waiting period, and my cursory googling confirms that. There are some exceptions but none that should extend it to a full year. I haven't even started yet and don't want to jeopardize this employment opportunity, because I need a job, but I want to make sure I am getting what's rightfully mine. I plan on asking Hr once I've completed training, but is there any other course of action I should take? With the current political situation my confidence in government actually helping me is at an all time low, but what should I do?	No

Briefly...  I make a HIPAA Violation report about my employer.  When you do this, there is a box that you can check that says that you do not want your information revealed to the company you are reporting.  Today I get a call from my employer... basically saying... about that HIPAA report you made about us...  Awkward.  I contact HHS.gov.  They confirmed that they erroneously revealed my information to my employer.  I do understand that my employer cannot legally retaliate against me.  (At least not overtly.  But who knows what my performance reviews are going to look like over the years).  I also understand that at least as of right now... I have no damages.  So I suspect that I answered my own question...  Except that it seems like a pretty big deal that the agency that you are reporting privacy violations to are violating your privacy.  Do you think this is something I should consider pursuing?  Or do I need to just sit back and wait for enumerable damages?	No
So there's an apartment complex that's trying to keep my administration fee. There's an application fee to have my credit checked, then an administration fee to hold the apartment. If I change my mind in x amount of time or I am declined I get the fee back. They said they were going to refund me, but never did. I called back and they still didn't refund me.  Can I take them small claims court? What are my legal options?	No
Hello,   I have a 15 yr old sister in Arizona who is being neglected. She spent the summer staying at my 21 yr old sisters boyfriends parents house and they were okay with that. Now that school has started they are not okay with housing a 15 year old. My mother is never home, she has a bad hoarding issue and the house is a terrible place for anyone to be living. She has said that she does not want my sister living with her and is not helping to try to get her situated. I am 26, work full time, engaged and living in Nevada. I would like to bring my sister here and enroll her into a new HS but I don't know where to begin.   Any advice?	No
"Hi Reddit,   I live in Ontario Canada and am moving into the hosue that my BF and his ex wife own. They cannot sell due to market conditions so he has taken on all expenses.

Hello Everyone!  So my girlfriend is currently a DACA recipient from Honduras and has been here in the United States for 13 years. She always talks about wishing her and her family the ability to become legal residents but she says the only way she can is either for her to marry a citizen  (were not in a rush to get married) or to wait for her sister who was born here to turn 21.   Is there another way? She went through k-12 here in the US and is going to start college soon. And she works as well.  Thank You!	No
"I have been looking at places to move to ASAP for a couple weeks. I just started a new job so will be paid Friday.  I haven't had to pay rent for the whole time I lived here until this month. 200 was the new verbal agreement. Landlord had agreed to accept late payment due to my circumstances.  The roommates (one landlord's daughter ""C"" and the other guy ""M"") have been very aggressive, blaming things on me and such. I have been trying to keep to myself and focus on leaving.   M threatened me last night when I refused to abandon my room before I move. He wanted me to move my stuff out and live on the couch. I refused respectfully, he proceeded to cuss me out and threaten me.   I left for work early and came back to find my bedding on the couch, my books hastily stacked in a box and my bed flipped on its side. I want to go buy a lock but an waiting on Metro PD to respond and hopefully tell me my options.  I decided to call Metro PD when I couldn't reach the landlord. My roommates aren't home that I can tell.  I think legally I am still allowed to be here. I have received no notice from my landlord of any changes since past telling her I would be paying for July late."	No
 Throwaway for obvious reasons.  So, I've been living with my boyfriend for about 3 months. I have a room here, my stuff is here, everyone knows I live here. I receive some mail too.   I am not on the lease. He rents from a couple. I also do not pay rent. I have not changed my address on my ID just yet because we've been having trouble lately and I pretty much assumed it would end in a breakup, which it basically has.  I'm wondering what he can do if we breakup. Can he force me to leave his home tonight? If he calls the police on me and I have done nothing violent, can they arrest me?  Can he legally lock me out of the house and refuse to give me my things back?  What if he destroys my things?   I'm so paranoid. I'm waiting for him to go to work so I can move my things out without him here, but until then I would like to know my rights.  Thank you in advance.	No
"I moved into a 2-person apartment by taking over someone's lease (with the landlords approval) and I bought that person out of his security deposit. Now the lease is expiring this month, and I am moving out, but my roommate is staying and is going to find a new roommate.  I talked to my landlord about how the security deposit would be returned and he told me the security deposit stays with apartment until it is vacant, not with the people in it. I told him I don't know anything about whoever is going to be moving in and questioned how he expected me to get money from someone I likely will never meet. He told me that is just how the law works. I asked him to show me this law and am awaiting his reply.  I looked at the lease and it does say the security deposit must be returned within 21 days after the ""RESIDENT"" has vacated the premise. Earlier in the lease it states the term ""RESIDENT"" applies to ""tenant(s)/lessee(s).""  So if either my soon-to-be former roommate and whoever moves in next refuse to buy me out of the security deposit am I just stuck holding the bag until there is a complete move out of BOTH tenants at some point in the future? At that point, my lease would have been expired for at least a year and I don't understand how any of the money would find its way back to me.  Of course I can make sure nobody moves into my room until I leave, but on the 31st I'm legally required to leave and my security deposit will be used for whatever potential damages the new tenant or future tenants incur.  Am I missing something here? This seems like a huge legal protection oversight.  Thanks for any advice."	No
I am writing a memoir and doing my best to prevent any sort of defamation of character accusations before I send a chapter of my book to an online publisher. The people I am writing about include the two multimillionaire business owners (one had since passed away, one is the head of a largely recognizable brand) and a person in academia involved in highly unethical practices.   I have already read about the legal topic and done things like change names, stick to facts, not opinions, and stay in my own point of view, not jump to what another person felt or was thinking.  I have emails and articles to backup that what I am saying is true. However, for my own peace of mind, I would like a lawyer to read my chapter and suggest to me if any edits need to be made to further protect myself.   I do not have a lot of money, (less than $1000 in the bank). Is this something that I might be able to get a pro bono consultation for? Where would be the best place to look for a lawyer that would review my chapter? Does it make a difference if I look for someone who specializes in whistleblower law, literary/creative arts law, or first amendment law?  I am 60 minutes from Chicago, if it makes a difference. Thank you in advance for your help.	No
"Throwaway because if the people involved read this they will immediately know who I am, and I don't want this linked to my regular user name.  Also, I apologize in advance if there are too many details. I don't know what is relevant.  I live in supportive housing for people with mental illness. They are a registered housing with services provider in the state of Minnesota. I'll call them SH. They provide independent living skills services in my private apartment, provide 24 hour on call services and they also have an office on site. My lease is with the property management company; I'll call them PM.   I paid all of my rent ($700) for the first 11 months that I lived here, then I was approved for Section 8. Now I still pay over half, and Section 8 pays the rest. The rent check is made out to an LLC. PM was the one who did all the paperwork for Section 8.  SH is paid for their services through a CADI waiver through Medical Assistance.  Our building is next to a building that is constantly making being too loud. There is one apartment specifically that the people seem to only be able to communicate by yelling and cursing. I can hear them in my apartment, with all of my windows closed. This happens at least twice a week, often more, during any time it is warm enough for their windows to be open. Sometimes it is obvious they are fighting, when they are screaming that they are going to kill each other. Other times, I am not sure if they just like to communicate by yelling and swearing for all the neighbors to hear. And when they have a party, it really gets loud.  I tolerated it for the first summer because I was told by the staff here when I moved in that I wasn't allowed to call the police without calling them (SH) and that it was annoying but everyone just had to put up with it.  This year I realized that even though I agreed to call SH, that doesn't mean I have to ask for permission to call the police. I just need to tell them I am going to do it. And in a booklet I got with all of my paperwork from Section 8, it talks about MN Statute 504B.205 that says ""A landlord cannot evict, penalize, or limit a tenant's right to call the police or call for emergency assistance in response to a domestic incident or any other situation.""  I could call with a legitimate noise complaint at least twice a week, but I try to drown it out with a white noise machine and headphones. Sometimes it just doesn't work, though. And SH staff have told me that other clients here complain about the noise all the time. There is one staff who has even yelled across towards the building for people to be quiet, but to no avail.  I have ended up calling the police either 4 or 5 times since April (depending on how you count - twice was in one night and they hadn't responded in 4 four hours, because it was an anonymous call, so I called back and left my information.) I always call the non-emergency number, and with the exception of the time they didn't respond, I have always given my information.  Only once has an officer come to talk to me, and that was because I was standing outside. He actually told me to keep calling, that he has dealt with these people before.  Today, one of the managers from the SH came to tell me the calls to the police need to stop. I know they can stop providing me services if I keep calling the police, but I also think I have the right to live in my apartment without hearing the neighbors in a completely different building screaming and cursing.   And since I have a one year lease because Section 8 requires it, I asked SH what would happen if they decide to discontinue services. That's when she told me that she would have to find out, but that PM was going to be having a similar conversation with me. I'm pretty sure that law means he can't evict though, despite SH discontinuing my services???  The other problem I am facing, is if he does evict me, or even doesn't renew my lease. I don't know where I am going to live. My city and the one next to it both very recently passed laws restricting housing with services. In my city, anyone who receives both government rental assistance and supportive housing services can't move into an apartment unless it was previously occupied by someone already meeting both those criteria. I've only lived in supportive housing for about a year and a half, but I've lived in this city for almost 10 years, and my family is here. It is the most convenient and affordable suburb for me for many reasons. And the next closest is the other one that passed a law. The legality of the laws has been questioned, but nobody has challenged it in court yet, so I would either have to move farther away from family, give up my Section 8, or stop receiving services.  I know the obvious answer is to stop calling the police, but when one has PTSD, one can only take so much of certain noises (like death threats.) And it isn't fair to me or the rest of the clients in my building to have to listen to that just because we are afraid of losing our housing! I feel like the appropriate ones to lose their housing are the ones with legitimate noise complaints against them, not the ones complaining about the noise.  Any advice at all would be welcome."	No
"I live in Oregon in the US btw  I have been receiving phone calls from a ""company"" called Bahama Island Cruises based in what they call the ""Orlando promotion center"" for a few months now. I have received over 20 calls over the past few months most of them wake me up during the day because I work graveyard.  The past six times I have talked to an ""agent"" and told them to put me on the do not call list, stop calling me, and have also told them that its illegal to keep calling me when I have said this (I'm pretty sure it is right?) The last time the ""agent"" said that they weren't a telemarketer (lol) I told him that he is calling ME trying to sell ME a stupid trip that makes him a telemarketer he replied with ""have a great day...""  What can I do to report this ""company"" I would love to see charges brought or their business shut down. I am already on the national do not call registry. I really need the help it is making me insane I don't know what to do."	No
I'm currently under contract for my first house, a nice but modest suburban single home, nothing crazy. I understand this is legally binding and the house already passed inspections, but for reasons I'll describe below, I'm wondering if the option still exists to get out of it: the seller requested a 4-5 month settlement, and since mortgage pre-approval/approval is only valid for 90 days, the lender made a note that I would need to re-submit new paystubs and bank statements after the 90 day period. If I quit my job (my only source if income) now, will I be declined and legally walk away from the agreement? Or would I still be approved based on above-adequate savings?  Not familiar with this subreddit but in case morality factors in: I made an offer on this house to start a family with my boyfriend of ten years (from age 20-30). He was the one pushing us to get out of the city and move forward for years, but when I finally made this huge commitment he got cold feet and left. While I am able to afford the mortgage on my own, the idea of living alone (or with a random roommate) in a suburban house is horrifying. So also if my above idea is legal but morally reprehensible based on the reason given, I'd like to know that as well.	No
"State: CA / City: Los Angeles   Hi, I am a tenant of this apartment in LA area which was recently purchased by a new owner/management. For the past 7 years living in this apartment, I've had some great experience with the management and never had any issues with them. But this time, I am frustrated with this new apartment manager who is not willing to give us what we've initially deserved when we first moved into this apartment.   For the past few months, I've asked the manager on duty to provide us an additional parking space to park our newly purchased car. But, before I go ahead and proceed with anything, here is a little bit of a background story. As a tenant who lives in a 2 bed/bathroom unit, we were initially given 2 parking spaces when we first moved into this apartment. However, since we only had one car, the apartment manager, at the time, has asked us if they can spare one of our parking spaces to our neighbors who were in need of an additional space which we gladly let them use it without any compensation. (My parents and the manager, at the time, got along pretty well.) The manager has promised us (verbally) that we would get the space back whenever we would purchase an additional car and now with this new owner/management, they are not willing to give us another space which was something that we've originally had been granted.   I've spoken with the current apartment manager numerous times in regards to this matter and all I get from her is ""That was something that you have dealt with the previous management. There are no more spaces available and I can't give you additional parking lot for whatever reason."" I have friends and neighbors who live in a unit with 2 bed/bathrooms with 2 parking spaces (same apartment) and when I inquired about them having 2 spaces, the current manager said ""It all depends on how many cars you have."" The manager did not even care to say they would try or would get us a space when something becomes available and our family is very frustrated with this parking situation now. My little brother has been finding parking spaces on the street late at night after his work, walking great deal of a distance, after finding a space blocks away.   From the contract of ours with the apartment, the only section that mentions parking states: ***""Subject to the provisions of this Lease, the Tenant is entitled to the use of parking (the 'Parking') on or about the Premises. Only properly insured motor vehicles may be parked in the Tenant's space.""*** (As it doesn't specify how many parking spaces can be used, I don't know if I can use this statement to back up our request.)   I am about to write a formal request letter to the HQ of the management and try to explain the frustration of the current situation.   Are there anything that I can do to get our initially given space back?   Add: The previous manager who we dealt with has fled back to his country and is no longer available."	No
I thought it would be funny to poke a little at one of the biggest businesses in my city, so I made some stupid page that literally only got 2 likes. The article was obviously a joke, talking about how they were going to purchase a graveyard and charge entry as a new “attraction” in town. It’s kind of an inside joke I new all of the locals would get and find humor in. Apparently one of the owners of said business saw the article and didn’t like it, and said he’s going to send me a cease and desist (like I care, it’s a stupid page I just made yesterday that’s not even popular), and he threatened me with legal action.   So can they do anything? I took the post down out of respect, but was just curious  Thanks!!	No
We recently sold some of my personal property and are working to get our debt under control and credit score up. My husband had $13k in debt from his previous marriage, which ended about 5 years ago, and was split evenly between them. It is affecting my credit (yay marriage) and I want it gone and I know she has no plans to pay for it because she has no intention of needing or getting credit, so it doesn't matter to her, and it's been 5 years. I'm pretty sure even suing her for the $7500 will come to nothing (she spends money like it's on fire), but I want a record at least that it was paid and she owes me. Petty, yes, but it's a lot of money to me and I want a record of it. How should I handle this, legally? What steps should I take?	No
"So I currently live with two other people, one of them, ""Abby"", is pregnant and recently revealed to my other roommate, ""Brianna"", and I that she has decided to stay living there and doesn't want to move out. Obviously Brianna and I do not want to live with a screaming, crying newborn so we decided to get our own two bedroom.  We were able to find something very quickly and want to move asap since Abby is due early September and we are worried about it coming sooner. We are on a month to month lease and both gave our 30 day notice. Ideally we would have liked to move out mid August and get half the last months rent back but landlord said no so we decided to just eat it.  Yesterday the landlord (who is also a lawyer) emailed us the following: ""Please be advised that you both have given your notice but this does not remove you from your obligation to pay rent should the monthly amount not be paid.  You will remain jointly and severally liable for any rent owed until a new lease is signed.""  So he's saying that if Abby doesn't find someone to move in by September first we still owe the rent??? How is that legal? Abby should be the one that has to pay our rent since she couldn't find anyone to move in, right? Please someone help me make sense of this...  We are in Massachusetts btw if that changes anything"	No
I am going on vaction in a few weeks and want to rent my apartment out for 3 days for some extra cash.  I read over my lease and there is a statement saying we can't have guests stay with us for more than 3 days. Am I obligated to even tell the landlord that I want to do this?   I read on here some posts defending landlords not to let tenants do an AirBnB type of thing because of liability and other things.  Also if I do this, what is a good way to protect myself in case something happens?  I don't have renters insurance but plan on getting it.	No
I sublet my room under the table without the consent of my apt complex. I know that's where I went wrong so let's move past that. The original lease is up now so we are all moved out. Anyways the rent of $500 was to be paid to me in cash in the first week of the month. He bailed without paying the last month and I want to know if I have any options. We have a verbal contract for this agreement month to month and since it was $500 I'm of the understanding that's a valid verbal contract.    Can I take this guy to small claims? Any help would be appreciated.	No
"I run a small social network that lets users register usernames as their handle.

But when I search for ""illusionalsunrise"" (again, not the real name) on http://tmsearch.uspto.gov, I see that the word mark is for ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" and not ""Illusionalsunrise"" by itself.

"My father, my mother, and I (their daughter) were all in the vehicle on a stormy day in January. He was driving in the left most lane when the car hydroplaned and he lost control. We collided with an incoming car from the lane right of us. We were deemed at fault. We have recently received emails from our former car insurance provider (we had switched in April) that the other party's claim had the potential to exceed my father's property damage of $10k, and sure enough, on July 10th, we received a letter from the other party's insurance that it is $5k over. They gave us 15 days to respond from, presumably, the mailing date, July 6th. Our own insurance provider for the accident told us to that we can hire a lawyer at our own expense, as anything more than our coverage is our own ""potential personal financial exposure"". We don't know what to do. The adjuster communicating with us for our former insurance provider seems to be implying that there is nothing we can do. My parents are freaked out because my dad is the only one with a job and this would make a major dent in our savings. We're conflicted as to whether we should just pay up or hire a lawyer, my parents are confused as to why it took half a year for this to arise, and I'm not sure whether $15k is a fair claim for a car that is a total loss."

Hello! I am a landlord in NJ.   We have a rental property and our renter wants to kick out her ex-boyfriend. He is not on the lease, but she did get our permission to have him live there. He has been paying us the rent for the two of them - she has been paying him cash and he cuts us the check. My questions:  -- Can she remove him from the property?  -- Do we need to officially evict him, even though he not on the lease, or is this an agreement between the two of them with him subletting from her?   Essentially, they've broken up and she wants our help getting him out of the home she is renting from us.   Thanks for your help!	No
I'm looking to start a online head shop (bongs, glass pipes, etc) based in Canada, shipping all of North America. Now from what I have read it is better for me to start a Canadian Corp instead of an American LLC, because I would be double taxed, is that Correct? If it is, besides filing for to start a corporation online, what would I be looking for locally to go in and be able to talk to about the legalities about selling such items online? Would an accountant or lawyer be better, because I seem to find different answers for that online.  Basically, who do I find locally to start a corporation, and be able to answer questions about the type of business I am looking to start. Thanks in advance for any help.	No
"I'm currently in a 1 year lease for an apartment. It's a multi dwelling apartment, meaning that we have separate entrances, and separate driveways.  However we have an upstairs neighbor, and she has been very nasty to us.  We started to get weird vibes from her from the beginning, like she is nice to us, but only when other people are around. (Like the landlord, her neighbors, or sometimes her friends.) But when see her and no one else is around, she is cold and curt. Sometimes she would just ignore us.  For example, when we moved in the landlord said to work out parking spots with her. There is our driveway (which is insanely steep), and then a little 2 car lot at street level which is her driveway (she only has 1 car). you can also fit a car parallel to the road next to a power line pole. She said ""yeah it's really whatever, first come first serve. We just kind of figure it out. It's not assigned parking spots"" seemed pretty chill.  Actually on the night before we toured the unit before we knew that we had it, someone had ran into her car which damaged her parking so only 1 car fits there until they fix it, so she got the OK from the neighbor across the street (super kind and generous man.) to park in his dirt lot which can hold like 6-8 cars.  an example of weird vibes is that, before we had finished moving in, my father in law and I were bringing a couch I had bought, we didn't cover it and it started raining right as we got into town. We parked in one of the spots that was supposedly cool to park in, but she got home shortly after and was very impatient with us and was really demanding, asking us how long we are gonna be there cause she has a friend coming over (meanwhile it's raining and the couch I bought is getting wet). so I asked if we should park in the dirt lot, and she loudly said ""NO"".  she had the unit to herself for a few months before we signed our lease, so we are thinking she got used to how things were?  She sent us texts at 4:30pm when we were moving in saying that we were being too loud, and we apologized and explained why the sound was happening to which she replied ""great""  She send us another text, at about 9:40pm on a Saturday night, asking ""do you have carpets yet? maybe that would help..."" this was during my 'bachelor party' (I just had some friends over to play video games before I got married)  Since then she has had many parties (outside on her deck) that go late (11:00pm, 12:00am, 1:00am) on a weeknight, at one point she had a party go until 2:45am on a Friday night, with loud music, stomping (not walking, stomping), and when my wife and I woke up we noticed there were cigarette butts on our deck.. our deck that's covered in dry leaves.  Anyways.. a week or 2 after that, we were almost done unpacking. We had been given a piece of furniture by my sister and we decided to get rid of it by putting it in our driveway (not in the street) with a free sign on it.  we had seen the other neighbors leave stuff out with free signs, like a couch, an aquarium, and a cat jungle gym. There is no HOA here either.  She texted us about it, at which point we texted the landlord asking if what we did was ok, he said it was fine. So we replied, and explained that we saw the other neighbors do it, and that the landlord said it was ok. but we apologized that it was bothering her and that we would move it when we got home (we were out at dinner).  She replies with a lot of condescension and sarcasm, and claims that she has never seen anyone put furniture out on our street, and that she would never do that ""that's what the dump is for"" and that we need to remember that she lives here too, and that her associates come over.  we decided not to respond to that because it was obviously a lost cause (we suspect she had been drinking because there were a lot of typos). When we got home, the Futon was gone. we thought someone had taken it (it was dark), but when we walked down our driveway we saw that she (presumably) had dragged/pushed it down the driveway. We can't prove it was her. but it would make sense.  there was a huge scrape mark going down the length of the driveway, and the leg of the furniture was bent from being dragged.  we felt like that was an invasion, we didn't feel safe. It was a totally aggressive and dramatic move. not to mention completely unnecessary because we said we would move it. At that point we contacted our landlord to let him know what happened. he said he was unsure of what to do, if he should call her, or wait until his next time coming down (some contractors had done repairs) which he said would be ""in the coming weeks""  we said we would prefer it if he came down so the 4 of us could talk. we didn't want him to call her, because she could just make stuff up. also because she isn't nasty when he's around, we felt like it would help us all reach a amicable solution if he was there as an arbiter.  he said he would come down, but that was more than a month ago.  One night when we were showering, we heard really loud and startling stomping above our heads. We finished our shower and when we got out of the shower we saw that our neighbor had texted my wife using all caps, asking if we just started a load of laundry at 12:00am. - when we do something she doesn't like, she ramps up to 60mph at the drop of a hat, and does something physical.  Based on earlier events, we didn't reply to this text at all. But I emailed my landlord about it.  I didn't feel like we owed it to her to respond to her abusive texts if she's going to be rude and aggressive. and as the days went by we kept showering whenever we wanted to.  She stomped a few more times (at one point even doing like 'marching band' stomping.. it's hard to explain, but doing it with both feet very fast and very loud)   and at one point she texted my wife again and said that ""she had a meeting early the next morning and our late laundry is disturbing her sleep""  So I (hesitantly) replied on my phone that ""Hello &lt;neighbor&gt;. We actually haven't ever done laundry past 9:00pm, what you're hearing is our shower""  She was sarcastic in her response.. ""so? whatever it is is keeping me up at a very late hour""  This was kind of annoying to us, because she has people over stomping right above our heads several times a month late into the night, and after they leave she is cleaning up moving furniture around slamming it down on her deck.  I've been emailing all of this as it develops to my landlord, he was surprised at her response and expected her to be more laid back (don't really know why.. considering the furniture incident). My landlord said, if she complains again, just tell her that we hear her when her friends are over and lived with it.  A few days later we had to contact him again because our dryer had gone out and we were working on replacing it. He actually said our neighbors dryer went out too (and she left it on the hill outside of our bathroom window...) which angered me because she was harassing us about our furniture but she leaves her dryer outside of our window? I moved it a few feet over because I didn't want to see it, and I didn't want to contact her about it. (then the next day she left a cardboard box to a new samsung phone in the same exact spot...)  He said he has been busy with work and unable to come down, but in the meantime, if we see her, if we bump in to her, then should try to talk to her for a few minutes and just say ""look , we want to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers, but when you have friends over late we hear that too and lived with it."". He has been sympathetic to us, but hasn't actually done anything yet. He said that if she is disrespectful again, then he will call her himself, he also said if it was him, he wouldn't want to live here either.  Since her text we had tried to get our showers done earlier (before 11:00pm). Some of the times she has stomped it was when she was clearly awake. We will drive up to our house and see her flipping channels on her TV, we can hear her walking around, calling her cat inside, and on the phone etc... But as soon as we get in the shower she starts stomping. and complains that we are 'waking her up'  So just last week my wife and I shower at 10:30pm, and we hear her start stomping around above us.. I didn't know what to do, so my wife and I wrote a text on my phone but didn't send it, we wanted to sit on it.  We decided, if we saw her the next day, we would try talking to her. But if we didn't we would text her. I felt like I should text her soon because my family was coming over for the long 4th of July weekend, and I didn't want her to be stomping if they needed to shower. (we had a beach day + dinner planned, so I knew we were gonna get back late)  Well we didn't see her, so I texted her Monday July 3rd while we were at dinner saying:  ""Good evening neighbour.  I was wondering if you were stomping again during our shower last night? I guess even if you weren't, I wanted to say some things and try to clear the air.  We want to be able to work with you. We don't want to be upsetting you with our showers. But here's the thing.... when you have your friends over with music playing late at night during the week, we hear that. and we've lived with it. In May you had people over until almost 3am with really loud stomping and music right above our heads as we were trying to sleep. I've even heard you take a hammer to your floor at 11:00pm You woke us up this morning at ~7:40am. with your banging furniture around on your deck right above our bedroom.  Because we live under you, we hear a lot more than you might realize, but we've lived with it.  Live and let live, that's what we've been trying to do.  We've been accommodating and respectful to you. That's all we are asking in return.""  to which she replied:  ""I think u need to learn how to live with neighbors.. have you ever lived in a multiple dwelling place before?  There is etiquette involved...and waking people up late (10pm-6am)cause thats when u decided to take a shower is not cool.    Having friends over...talking...listening to music at a reasonable hour is cool.    Leaving your trash / used furniture out on the side of the road with a Free sign on it like you just moved into the ghetto is not cool.  Having friends over ONCE in 3 months late on a Friday night is cool.    Not communicating concerns you have to your neighbor and instead hitting them with an Uber long text on a monday night....not cool  Having 3 gorgeous decks and wanting to sit outside at 8am is absolutely ok.  It is not my fault you choose to keep non-business hours. Stop taking showers late (after 10pm) and everything will be okay on my end.    If my friends stay past 10pm on a weeknight and we are loud...absolutely let me know and we will move it inside.  But if I have friends over 2-3 times a year...late on a Friday or Saturday night....suck it  buttercup.     You may want to have people over too...and you know what...i won't say anything 2-3 times a year And no....you haven't been accommodating and respectful....you have been disdainful and rude.  You didn't even acknowledge me outside one day.. walked right past me.....i smiled said hi....u were completely disrespectful and rude. I think I have addressed all your concerns.  Have a good night""  After she sent that, I emailed my landlord again.  He replied July 4th in the morning and he said he was frustrated and didn't know what to do. In the 12 years he's owned the place he's never had this problem. He said if we wanted him to, he could call her.  We spent 2 nights at my in laws because being home was too stressful at this point. We were sacred of how she would react when he called her, and we were scared to go home. Even taking a shower at my in laws was stressful. My wife has severe anxiety, and to be honest this situation is giving me a lot of anxiety too.  I emailed my landlord on the 5th, asking if he had called her yet. and he said he hasn't called her because he wanted to enjoy the holiday without any drama.  I haven't heard anything from him since then.  However since then I've looking into taking legal action (trying to get a free consultation from a lawyer here). I don't know what the landlord is going to do, if anything. or if talking to her is going to help anything at all (or make it worse).  When she dragged our futon around, was that vandalism? Should we have called the police? is it too late to call now?  Is what she's doing defined as harassment? Is that enough for us to get out of a lease? Is there any other legal action we can take?  We are scared to bump into her.. and she is always on her wrap around deck above us which means if we use our deck we would have to see her.  Rent isn't cheap in California, and if my landlord isn't gonna do anything I don't see why I need to pay thousands more dollars to be living under a bully with this stress. We have family willing to take us in until we find a new place.  We are very skeptical that he will evict her."	No
Hi all, I am not directly involved, the guy was an ex from 15 years ago who went to jail for a terrible thing against his now ex wife, got out on a technicality, initiated contact with me and over a 6 month period threatened repeatedly to harm her family. I was asked to submit the proof by a mutual friend to police and I did. Ex wife got restraining order and seeking a harassment charge. He did 3 months in jail waiting on trial, and was released last week as trial date was pushed back into next month. His sentencing guidelines for the new charge are 1-3 months of jail time, credit time served. Confirmed with prosecutor's office, that there will be no jail time and they can offer me NO protection order, nothing. Basically they just want me to testify so they can slap him with a felony that will prohibit his job search and he can put blame on me.   I have a baby, no time off work, no reliable transportation to cross a mountain pass to GET to this trial 4 hours away... this is all so irritating. Should I be getting a lawyer to try to get out of this? CAN I get out of this? They have no ability to skype, legal assistant says they want witnesses present to jury can read body language.... I feel like Im being used here for nothing and they cant protect me and I just need some advice man. Can I get out of this?	No
"Hi!  Thank you in advance for reading!   I currently attend a University of California school. I live on campus with my family in the ""family housing"" section of campus living. The property we live at has been there for 50ish years and the buildings themselves are 70ish years old. The buildings are in serious need of renovation, but the cost to do so versus our subsidized rent made it seem as though it was not financially possible (ignoring upper university admin paychecks...) So a need for change was coming - but we did not expect this.   Rumors had been going on for years that they would be closing and/or relocating family housing but we were always told that nothing was put into motion. In the early summer of 2016, rumors started to surface again and I personally called and asked if anything was up. They assured me that nothing was up and that there were no intimidate plans to do anything. About 2 weeks later they announced that they would be relocating family housing to an apartment complex nearby. The original email stated a large increase to our rent - which given our university employment stipends (most of the community is graduate students) the community collectively panicked. There were two town hall meetings held which were so incredibly hostile as we felt totally blind sighted by this announcement. They told us the property was sold to a third party to develop the area surrounding the university. After the hostile meetings, a committee was formed and we were able to negotiate some of the worst parts of the transition (cost to move, lower rent, safer living conditions for children, etc).   However, the entire process has been like pulling teeth from the university. They have given almost no new information since the summer of 2016. Basically all we know is that they definitely sold the property, and we are definitely going to have to move. But we don't know how, when, or where.   One of the major concerns is the units to be leased. The current situation is 2bd/1ba or 3bd/1ba and the new location only has 2bd/2ba and 1bd/1ba. So many community members are concerned about the living situations for their families. We have only been told that those with children and legal dependents will be given priority to the 2bds - but no information about unit assignment has been given. They have asked us to provide information in Feb 2017 that would supposedly be used to determine which families are eligible for the 2bds (had to give birth certificates of children and marriage certificates). In June 2016 they sent an email saying they would have unit assignments completed and leases ready in July. However, they have not met this expectation. I have asked for an update on this and they say they have no new information to give. Which is so incredibly frustrating. At this point I have not signed a lease - but i was made to agree to move or relinquish my spot in family housing.   Another issue is the moving date. They have been giving us a constantly shifting range for move dates. The most recent date they are saying is ""September."" Basically we are told we must move our families in a month, but we have no idea what the living situation will be. Honestly, I don't even know if it is going to happen in September. Which is also stressful as a graduate student - moving at the start of the quarter.   As we move further into August I am becoming more and more stressed about when, how, and where we will be moving. When I call the university to talk to someone they only state that they are ""working on it"" and will ""follow up"" with me. I have been doing this dance with the university for over a year now. I don't know what else to do and I am wondering if I have any rights? Do I have legal rights as a on-campus tenant? Are they required to give us more warning regarding moving dates and leases? I was expected to agree to live at the new housing without any information regarding the living situation or the moving date. If I did not agree they would have removed me from the list and I would have been ineligible to live at family housing post June 15th. So I agreed to stay in family housing, because we are financially tied to the subsidized rent provided. If I don't have any legal rights to require additional information regarding moving dates or leases - can anyone provide any tips for dealing with the university on this issue?   Thank you so much. If you need me to clarify anything I will."	No
"Long story short, we wanna give our home back to the bank. We aren't worried about our credit being ruined, since we have everything we need for the next 10 years (new home and cars, etc). We've tried to sell our home but there aren't any bites. We owe 96k and it's 'worth' 102k. We simply cannot afford the extra 900 a month after we move in 2 weeks. Whats the best way to go about it? Just call the bank and say ""We have made our last payment, as we cannot afford to keep it on the market""?  Its a hard sell because the neighborhood has gone down in the last 6 years or so. Crime is on the rise in Milwaukee. We bought a nice home in the country!"	No
"Hello,  I'm looking at renting a townhouse in Virginia. They sent over the lease and they included this statement at the bottom.   ""Tenant to pay repair/replacement deductible of $100 for each repair/replacement/service call, no more than 5 times in a 12 month period.""  To me, I feel this is a flag. The lease states they will provide an inspection document of the property within 5 days after the start of the lease term. I don't know the condition of any of the appliances other than a quick visual when touring the house.   What can I do to protect myself? My fear would be getting surprised with broken appliances or other issues, and having to pay $100 per issue/service call within the first few months due to whatever reason. I believe it would be understandable if it were due to intentional damage on my part. But normal wear &amp; tear, or abuse from previous tenants?  The way I look at it - It is like renting a car for a day, hitting that ""5000"" mile mark, reporting that the ""check engine"" flag popped up, and getting charged to do the oil change. And then, a few hours later, you get a report of the condition of the vehicle PRIOR to you utilizing it. If I knew that vehicle was in a poor condition upfront, I wouldn't rent it."	No
My father was forced to retire in November, due to being diagnosed with dementia.  Part of the divorce settlement between my mother and father was that he would pay her an amount from his retirement account after he retired.  We have since set him up with a financial manager to help with managing his retirement.  As of July 1st, I took over the bulk of his finances, excluding the his IRA.  Based on the advice form the financial manager, we learned that he can get out of paying taxes if he gets a QDRO.  We have an appointment to take care of that this week.  My question is this: is there anything we can do about the harassment?  He isn't able to explain things as well because of the dementia, and at this point, her behavior is nothing more than bullying.  Also, is he at risk of going to jail because he hasn't yet paid?  Additionally, can anyone help me understand the Qualified Domestic Relations Order (QDRO) a little better?  Any tips for handling this situation would be greatly appreciated.	No
So back in July of 2016 I was at work and lost two fingers. The company I was working for didn't have workcomp insurance. So my insurance covered most of the cost for the surgery and what not. I thought it was completely paid by Medicaid but my lawyer says I actually owe them about 3k. Our options were to sue them and we offered 85k. He came up with that number by figuring out the lose of fingers and a few other things. Sorry dont have the letter he sent me to give exact info. So we sent the offer last month and no response. So I called to see if he heard anything and he said no, He thinks we should go with the Illinois Workers compensation. He said that way we can for sure get some money. But who knows when I would get that and how much since Illinois is broke. My personal opinion is that we should do a civil lawsuit but im not the lawyer. So I dont know what to do. Please advise of any info you might have.	No
   I live in an extremely small town, and apparently I've pissed off the wrong people. Now I can't leave my house without a bunch of people following me and even trying to beat me up and possibly kill or disfigure me permanently.    Is there any legal recourse I can take, I know all their faces but not all their names. I'm pretty nervous.	No
"So my lease clearly states that management is responsible for any pest control and extermination services. They fired their exterminator of 10+ years recently, and still owe him $600 He gave me his contact card when I moved in and they were using him, so I spoke with him about the situation.   Apparently they have their handyman (who's part of management but isn't a true ""handyman""), who is going around spraying apartments for their pest control. The old exterminator explained to me that 1. This is illegal since he doesn't have the proper credentials to qualify as an exterminator (thus breaching the lease contract), and 2. He doesn't have access to anything beyond what I do and have been using.   I'm only here for another month and I know this is grounds to immediately break the lease, but I'd rather not right now since I'm nearing the end of my summer semester in grad school (working 45 hrs + thesis work + school is too much with moving).  But guys... the roaches are SO BAD RIGHT NOW. Literally dozens were coming out if the outlets, cabinets, and walls... my boyfriend and I were up until 4 AM cleaning and trying to kill all of them. They're all over our food and in our fridge and freezer. Half the time they end up getting frozen inside of our ice cubes 😷 My bf who was raised in South Florida said he's NEVER EVER seen an infestation so bad....   Sorry for all of the text, but I guess I'm just at a loss of what to do... They aren't fulfilling their end of the lease contract and they already have this and next month's rent since I had to pay last month's rent when I moved in (so I can't withhold any future payments). Anyone have any experience with this? What do I dooo?? Haaaalp meeee.  P.S. I do the dishes 2-4 times a day and am impeccably clean, so cleanliness clearly isn't the cause of this."	No
I apologize if I come frustrated but I am. My landlord threw out, I really mean disposed of, all my belongings from my apartment even though my lease does not end for a good week. I had everything packed and ready to be moved and they all disappeared. The landlord takes full responsibility. So far I have a lawyer and am making a list of inventory for all my belongings. What else should I do. How should I estimate the worth of my items. Thank you.	No
I own a rowhome in Pennsylvania on a block of homes with a continuous porch roof, [similar to this one here](http://cdn.phillymag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Rowhouses_06-940x540.jpg), but even more connected.  My neighbor's porch roof is badly in need of repair - it leaks, and since our roofs share a main cross beam the water has also begun leaking onto my porch. The water is also causing damage to the interior of my porch roof, and the beam is sagging in the middle, right where our properties split.  I plan to have my side repaired, but I know if my neighbor doesn't repair their side as well it will continue to damage my roof (and if it collapses, it will probably pull mine down as well).  My neighbor is reluctant to spend money on the repairs. I got their permission to have a roofer come out and inspect both sides of the roof, and prepare an estimate for fixing both. I also said I was open to splitting 50/50 even if their side is more heavily damaged, since it is a shared roof.  I'm concerned my neighbor may still balk and refuse to do the repairs on his side. Short of paying for the whole thing or rebuilding my roof to not connect to his (and even then his roof would pose a hazard to my porch), what options do I have?	No
Hey, this may be a dumb question and if I'm putting it in the wrong place please let me know.  I went to a new doctor who started me on a prescription for a new medicine to counter some side effects of another medicine I take. The new stuff actually started to help, a lot. For the first time in a long time it didn't feel like my stomach was trying to eat itself constantly. However, they put a typo on the prescription--they prescribed 15 pills at one dosage, and 15 pills at a second, but the second half had the typo and the pharmacy couldn't fill it. No big deal, they have 15 days to correct it, right? Totally wrong. The pharmacy called them 2-3 times in the first week, and faxed the request over as many times. I spent all of the next week calling, leaving voicemails, and never hearing back. Finally Thursday, the pharmacist got a verbal confirmation it was being sent over that day. I called Thursday and got the same confirmation. Nothing. Then Friday morning I called and told them that it needed to be in ASAP so I could pick up that afternoon, because I only had one pill left. They assured me it would be sent to the pharmacy within the hour.  Pharmacy again got nothing. I tried repeatedly to get through to them again and when I finally got someone on the phone, was told that it was still waiting for the doctor to sign off on it (the girl from the morning had told me she'd messaged the doctor but either she didn't do that, or the doc just didn't bother) and she'd gone home for the day. It's a controlled substance psych med, so the pharmacist wasn't able to even give the one pill to bridge the gap, even though they had the original prescription with that stupid typo.  So today has been an absolutely awful day of being sick, having stomach pains way worse than they were before I started this miracle medicine, and just generally wanting to curl up and cry.   I'm already looking for another doctor, and gave them honest reviews on Yelp and Google, but honestly with their other low reviews (I didn't even check first, was referred by a friend who didn't have as bad a time) I don't think they care to make improvements. Is there something that can be done to fine them, or somehow bring to their attention how badly they communicate? At this point I just don't want them to screw anyone else over like they did me.   Thanks everyone, and have a great night.  TL;DR doctor jerked me and pharmacy around for 2 weeks and messed up on a prescription for a psych med, caused massive frustration and a day and a half of feeling awful. Can anything be done to make sure they don't keep doing this to patients?	No
"I work at a state park in Nebraska. I am currently the only one working in a small store. On my off days someone else works so I have 2 days off. My hours have recently been changed to factor in a half hour lunch, and I am currently at a point where I work exactly 40 hours a week. However, my boss told me that I will have to take a ""working lunch."" That essentially means I remain in the building and continue to work through my lunch, but I am not paid for it. My math shows that I am missing out on 2.5 overtime hours every week.  I am currently a part time employee, so they do not want me working over 40 or else the state gets upset. I told a colleague about my situation and he suggested I keep working until I am done for the season, then pursuit legal action. Tonight at the end of my shift I'm going to collect all past pay stubs and keep them organized.   Am I being wronged here? I just want an outsider opinion on the situation."	No
Last winter, my roommates and I were looking for an apartment, and came across a nice looking student housing complex. When we went to the office of the complex, we were told that we could not see the actual unit we would occupy yet because we had not yet been assigned one, and there were people living in all of them at the moment. A couple days ago, we finally were notified of our unit number (note that we move in Aug. 1st and today is July 28th). Anyways, I live two states over from my college, so I was not able to go see the apartment. My roommate, however, had the joy of seeing it today. The unit was on the out skirts of the complex, basically in the woods. Mt roommate noticed that the current tenants were home, and decided to knock on the door and ask to simply look around. Our town has a real sense of community, and everyone is super nice so this is not as odd as it sounds. The current tenant then proceeded to show my roommate the mold that was growing throughout the apartment, the roach and spider infestation, and the wet carpet from a leak coming from God knows where. The tenant also informed my roommate that there was a snake in the apartment one day... a fucking snake... and management did nothing about it. Their dryer was broken all semester, and once again, management and maintenance did nothing to fix it. I am wondering if there is any way for us to get out of this lease? Maybe because we were not able to see the property beforehand? I know basic contract law, which is why I am scared that we are royally fucked. Can we get out of it because of the unsafe living conditions?	No
A few of my friends are looking to end their lease a month early and move out but per the rental agreement, cannot post online to get sub-letters for the month. Other people can post for them, provided they don't include the renter's names but other than that the renters have to use 'word of mouth.'   Is this legal? If not, why on earth would someone include that in a lease? Is this common?   Thanks!	No
"I just found 2 disconcertingly large marijuana plants growing hidden in a grove on the outskirts of my property where I rarely venture. I didn't plant them, and I have absolutely no idea how they got here. I know for a fact they weren't here in March.  Who do I talk to? Do I just tell the police and hope they believe me when I say I don't know how they got there? Or do I just destroy them myself? They're big enough that I'm afraid the police might think ""there's no way he didn't know these were here""  What do I do?"	No
I work in an IT office in Upstate NY. We have two forms of on call.  Level 1: On call for a week Friday Night - Thursday Night. 2 AM when our office closes to 7 AM (8 AM on weekends) when it opens. Work is done at home on a company issued phone and laptop. You get $7 a night to reimburse for internet bandwidth used. You get paid for the time you spend on a call that comes in. 5 minutes minimum to keep the math easy for hours worked (i.e. if you spend 3 minutes on a call it's logged as 5). The sum of hours worked gets added as overtime as you still work M-F 8 hour days.  Level 2: On for a calendar month. 11 PM - 7 AM weekdays, 5 pm - 8 AM weekends. Work done at home with a company laptop and phone. You do not get compensated every night, but if you answer a phone call once you get $5 reimbursement for internet. Same rules for logging time on calls applies as level 1.  Some people seem to think these procedures are outside the NYS labor laws and I can't seem to find anywhere where that would be true. I've specifically heard the way they pay out hours worked and also one person seemed to think there has to be a minimum hours worked even if only 5 minutes are spent working on a particular night. I just want to know if there is anything outside the law going on.	No
"My parents are being evicted from the home they're renting. Long story short, they're in dispute with the landlord and decided not to pay the rent (which I advised against) and are being served their eviction notice.  While home, my mother heard a man continuously and loudly knocking on the door as if he was trying to break it down yelling ""I have the eviction notice!""   She was frightened and did not answer.  At that point the courier went to the backyard of the property and started knocking on the windows and the glass doors.   After that point, he went back to the front of the house and started yelling ""I'll bring the cops and tell all of your neighbors you're being evicted!""  Is the way this was handled legal? I told my mom to record the situation if it happens again."	No
Baby born in Canada, shared between parents. Court looks inevitable at least eventually. What should she do to protect herself and save on legal expenses? How is it determined where court happens?   There are so many questions but really we just don't want her blindsided and having to fight for custody (even shared) in the US. Also what is to stop her partner from taking her to the US and not bringing her back? I believe without some agreement in place the police can't really intervene, correct?	No
"He and his roommate don't really get along; he told me signed an agreement that he would pay to live there on a month to month basis. the roommate deals with the landlord and he deals with the roommate as his ""landlord"".  Well, long story short, they end up not liking each other and the roommate now tells my friend he has a couple of days to get out and find a new place. She's asking for him to get out and give him the keys to his room. Even threatening to change the locks and call the cops. As far as I know; my friend has been up to date with rent. Is this legal? My friends working right now and he's scared he's going to go home any not be able to get in with the keys he has? What can he do then?   Call the cops and tell him the situation, can he sue for being thrown out of his apartment? He's a good guy; I have no reason to believe he did anything terrible that warranted him being kicked out so quick. But then again I don't know the whole story"	No
Hey Reddit, I need some help here dealing with my new landlord. My friend and I have recently begun renting a condo owned by our new landlord, who had a realtor draw up the lease. Mid-way through the first week, we noticed that the groceries we purchased have spoiled in the fridge. The settings were to their coldest possible temperatures, but the appliance would not work properly. We reached out to the landlord telling him that we either need it repaired or replaced. He said that he would gladly replace it, as long as we pay him $100, as per the lease.   Here is the issue: the lease states that the landlord must cover all repairs/replacements of listed appliances (the fridge is listed) if the defect predated our moving in. He stated that since we did not add the fridge to the list of pre-existing conditions from our walk through tour, that we essentially signed off on the appliance being in working condition. Despite my asking how he would recommend that we had tested the refrigerator during a ten minute tour, he remained steadfast, and even threatened us to have to pay the total replacement fee, for we could not prove that we did not break the appliance.   I do not want to have to jump to litigation this soon into the lease, but the landlord has been extremely unhelpful and outright rude to me and my roommate from the jump. I just want to know if I have any legal footing to challenge him further on this issue, among others, if the need arises. Thank you guys so much!	No
So my mom is trying to find an apartment and the places she has been going to look at have flat out told her no because of her service cat and they don't allow pets. As far as I know they can't do that right? What steps can she take to make sure she can do to defend herself in this situation.	No
"Long story short: Wife works as an RN in California. She hasn't been getting union dues deducted from her paychecks for quite some time (something I've been on her about checking in with, but I guess she/we are just too busy to rectify the problem.. we do acknowledge that unions are important and thought she just wasn't signed on with hers, not that she wasn't paying the dues).   Nowhere on her paychecks since roughly 2014 has there been a union dues deduction. Recently, she has received a letter from her union stating that they have experienced ""phenomenal growth"" in recent years and that some employees have fallen through the cracks of their antiquated system, thus deductions had stopped for some employees.   With their updated database they've discovered that some people owe money, and we're being told that she now owes more than a thousand dollars in back payments just because this union decided to upgrade a system and discovered they fucked up and weren't deducting people properly.   The document is basically admitting fault here. I called the union myself and discovered that it's basically a mandatory repayment (of course they are going to say that), but that there's ""no due date""... they just want to set up a payment plan.  The rep did say, however, that collections could be involved at a later time if no payments are arranged.   What are my options?  It just seems like an odd move for a union to go about correcting their huge mistake like this.. my wife wants to just blindly pay the amount, but I am extremely hesitant.   Any advice is greatly appreciated."	No
"I have just over an acre of land in a residential area. I am in the process of having a fence put up around the entire property. It is being installed by a licensed contractor, we have the proper permits for the work being done, and the plans have already been inspected by the city to confirm it fits code with respect to distance from property line and so on.  The plans for the fence were made over a year ago (they were the last stage in a series of improvements to the property) at which time the homes on both sides of me were vacant. I had spoken to the owners of both properties as a courtesy FYI in case there were any issues or concerns to address.  Unknown to me, both properties went up for sale and were sold to families who have moved in within the past month. I introduced myself at the time they moved in and talked to them about the fact that a lot of work is being done on my property - that it won't be at any odd hours and the date around which it will be finished.  As soon as they saw the fence going up both new property owners were upset. My lot is very large and their lots are substantially smaller, but without a fence the spacing of the houses could give the impression that we all have nicely sized lots (instead of me having a very large one and them having small ones). They both believe that my fence will make it obvious that their lots are small, and make them look even smaller than they are because their lots will be compared to a much larger lot.  After several weeks of discussion they are now threatening to get together and sue me for reduced property values for each of their homes, and the fact that in general they apparently believe my fence is an ""eyesore.""  I am wondering what the likelihood is that this will turn into anything (i.e. a problem for me and my fence)."	No
"Hi guys. I don't know what the format is here so I'm just going to go. Also not sure how detailed I should/shouldn't be, so ask for more detail as needed. GA resident, flew to VA for interview.      I was able to make contact with the VA company through a GA recruiter, so GA recruiter handled all the communication. VA company asked for me to make the flight reservation, which I was uncomfortable with because I am accustomed to the company making the reservation. So I asked the GA recruiter to do it for me on their dime, and they agreed.      When I got to the airport, *excuses here*, I missed the flight. I called up the GA recruiter and asked how best to proceed. He told me he would reach out to VA company and call me back. He called back and said they are fine to do the interview later that day or the next day, and that I should book the next flight I can. I specifically asked whether the flight change fee would be reimbursed, and discussed the specific amount it would be with GA recruiter. GA recruiter spoke with the hiring manager and then GA recruiter explicitly told me on the phone that the VA company would reimburse this amount. After this conversation, I booked the flight change, took the flight, rented a car and hotel, and had the interview the next morning.      I submitted my expense reimbursement request with the flight, car rental, hotel, and taxis to and from the airport. A full month later, I received a check from the VA company, reimbursing the car rental, hotel, and taxis. The flight change fee, which was over half the total reimbursement, was not reimbursed.      I called the GA recruiter, and sent subsequent emails because he was picking up on what was going on and not answering calls anymore, and asked what had happened. GA recruiter told me that an ""HR guy"" at VA company had ""put his foot down"" on the flight change expense, and it would not be reimbursed. To my knowledge, GA recruiter has been reimbursed for the flight they booked.      So I figure I have a couple of avenues. One, there's promissory estoppel re: detrimental reliance on GA recruiter's advice. Two, there's some kind of convoluted argument for detrimental reliance on the hiring manager (although I think that would work better for GA recruiter to use on VA company, and GA recruiter is not interested in suing a client, especially on my behalf), even if he didn't have the authority to make that decision. Three, there may be laws around interview reimbursement I haven't really looked into in VA.      I have already reached out to GA recruiter and been told to go pound sand, so any further communication there will likely need to be all lawyered up. I'm not flush with cash, but I am willing to fight this precisely for that reason.      So, uh, advice?"	No
My mother, who I've been estranged from for several years passed away recently. I'm the only real family she had so I've begun the process to sort through the estate.  She always had some hoarding tendencies but I discovered after going to her house that she had become a full-blown hoarder. Like, rooms so full of junk that you can't access them.  I've run into 3 complications so far that I'm dealing with:  1. Despite an exhaustive search, there doesn't seem to be a will.  2. She was a renter, and the landlord obviously wants the house cleared out.  3. Under what I've read on NC law she would almost certainly qualify under the NC Small Estates law (I seriously doubt that in all that trash there's over $20,000 worth of property.) But under that law I cannot become administrator of the estate until 30 days after she died.  I'm trying to do the right thing by the landlords since they were personal friends of my Mom for over 20 years, and I've found a specialty hoarder cleanout company that can empty the house out.  So here's what my questions are:  1. Is it legally OK for me to clear the house out despite me not actually being the administrator yet? Everyone basically has already been treating me like one since there's nobody else to challenge me on it, but it won't be official for at least a couple more weeks.  2. The cleaners have said that since I'm not actually administrator yet that they want a letter from an attorney stipulating that I'm the only heir. How difficult/expensive would it be for me to get this?  Thanks in advance!	No

(I plan to, can't afford it right now even with the reduced fees i was offered)  Spouse abandoned us and now lives in a different state halfway across the country and has pretty much left me with sole custody.

"Hi,  I live on a second floor flat in London. A few months ago we had a party and some cigarette butts were dropped over our balcony into our downstairs neighbour's garden. They were absolutely furious, we apologised, and let them know it wouldn't happen again.  This morning I received this text from our landlord:  ""Hi, I've had another email complaining about more cigarettes being thrown into the neighbours garden and this time they are about to call a solicitor and possibly confiscate the flat from me. I've spoken to the lady at the council and she says the only way to avoid the solicitor getting involved is to issue you a final warning saying if it happens again I have to evict you. I am going to put this in an email (and cc her in), I just thought I'd let you know in advance. I would strongly suggest not letting anyone smoke on the balcony at all in future as they are obviously taking the matter extremely seriously.  Thanks.""  We do not smoke and none of us have even been on the balcony in the last week. This must have been from people in one of the flats above, but they are clearly convinced it's us.  Should I be concerned? What's the best course of action?  Thanks in advance for your help."	No
8 block complex served by 4 garages. Towed within an hour of being there. They have a sign that says have to go to some of the restaurants to get a parking validation immediately and only valid for 3 hours.  Went to a different restaurant first and then was going to get drinks at the one next door on the list. Apparently I was followed by someone and then they towed.  My argument would be immediately isn't defined in terms of time. Walking from the farthest garage to the farthest restaurant takes 20 minutes in the complex. Gonna try to get a hearing in front of justice of the peace to file a dispute on the tow using immediately as not a time. Think I have a chance?	No
I am currently on the lease with a large NYC management company. There have been several robberies in this building this year and last week my apartment was robbed. Management hasn't replied to an email I sent asking to change locks or do anything to help heighten security. At this point, I really want to just get off of this lease...  My question is, is it legal for the landlord to act this negligent and do I have any recourse here?  Thank you.	No
"Hello,  I recently moved out of an apartment... My lease was not renewed because the complex is renovating each unit, and they wanted me to move into a different unit (along with an $200 increase in rent).   Anyways, when I moved out I left the apartment clean, patched all the paint holes, etc. I didn't do a particularly thorough job cleaning the appliances/cabinets (I left them empty and wiped down, but didn't detail clean them) as they were going to thrown out during the reno.  Yesterday, I received my deposit back. The statement said that my deposit was being deducted by $55 for ""misc. damages."" The 'itemized' statement only had the beginning balance of the deposit, cleaning fee ($0), the misc damages ($55), and the ending balance of the deposit.  I know in Ohio, that landlords have to provide an itemized deposit... But how detailed does it need to be? I called the property manager, and they said it was 'likely' due to broken blinds and a damaged curtain rod, but wasn't sure. When i asked for more detailed information, they said that they weren't required to provide a more detailed statement because the management company is based in New York... I told that even if the parent company is based in NY, they still need to abide by Ohio State Laws, he got mad and hung up.  It's only $55, so I don't know if its worth pursuing, but I'm more curious for future reference. What constitutes an 'itemized statement' under Ohio laws for rental security deposits?  TL;DR: Security deposit deducted by $55 due to 'misc. damages.' Property manager unwilling to tell me the specific reasons for the deduction, due to the management company being based in NY, while property is in OH"	No
Hi all, got arrested for possession of marijuana under 50g. I requested discovery including the dash cam footage, (what they sent me isnt even video from my arrest, it's of some other traffic stop that isn't me) and of course lab results. I am hoping that the lab results will take a long time to come back and eventually the court will be pressed to dismiss the case.  It is actually a significant prejudice to me having to take off of work for the morning only court and drive 1.5 hours away to this courthouse.  In addition to all this, I also received a ticket in the mail for possession of CDS in a vehicle, signed 34 days after the initial arrest. It is my understanding that there is a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic violations , therefore I am submitting a motion to dismiss that ticket.   I am representing myself pro se, and would like to know basically how long is reasonable enough to wait for lab results before I ask for dismissal, and is there in fact a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic tickets?   Thank you all in advanced!	No

I moved into an apartment complex 3 years ago. Since then they have continually raised the rent, which I know happens in a lot of cases, however many of the amenities that they advertised upon me signing my lease were not available.  The ftness center has been closed for 2.5 years, the pool was closed all last summer, and the laundry center has been under construction and  not available due to them renovating the property for about two and a half of those years.   They kept telling me those amenities would come back but now their website does not have them listed. I took screenshots of the website and I've been taking pictures of the property continually for the past 3 years. Do you think that there's any way that I can obtain retroactive rent abatement in small claims court?	No
"So I've been live in my girlfriend's apartment for more then half a year. I've bought a scooter and asked management to be put on the lease so I can have a parking spot. They told me that because she has a ""tax credit"" unit if I'm put on the lease we have to move to another, non-tax credit unit. But the problem is that they don't have another unit for us to move into. Never mind the scooter (i'll park it at friends house), can I keep living in the apartment without being on the lease and can I get in any potential problems because of that?  Thank you in advance."	No
So my neighbors house has a tree root or something clogging their sump pump discharge line and when it rains it will shoot water about 2-3 feet up the side of their house and floods the part of the yard between their house and mine. It stays that way until it eventually gets pumped out by my sump pump. The only reason this is an issue for me is because I have my basement fully finished and I do not want it to flood. I love in Columbus Ohio and believe it or not my neighbor is on board with me forcing it to get fixed as he rents and says he cannot even use the basement in his house because it has flooded multiple times since he has lived there and his land lord won't fix it correctly.  so my main question is should I try to get ahold of the owner by just calling? should I document talking to them? or should I just wait until the house sells when the renters son graduates high school and hope the people that buy it fix it? thank you for the help	No
"A few weeks ago my wife went to the mechanical room in the basement of our condo and found a water line spraying water everywhere.  She shut of the source but by then a good portion of the basement had about an inch of water.  We have damage to carpet and door trim.   I was out of town but I called the property manager and he had a restoration company.   They immediately came out and dried out the basement.  When I came home I looked at the situation and could easily see that the water feed to the refrigerator had chew marks on it.  Obviously my cat had been chewing on the small plastic line and probably got the scare of her life when it burst.    The property manager has been managing the damage and repairs.  I spoke with my insurance company and they confirmed that this would be covered under the Condo Corporations insurance.  This is where it gets a bit complicated.    The total for repairs is around $4,500 and the deductible for the Condo insurance is $5,000.  The restoration company has listed the cause of the failure as a leak in the supply line to the refrigerator.  I have my own home owners insurance which has extra ""Additional Coverage, Contingent Insurance and Special Assessment coverage's""  I informed my insurance company that I would be getting an assessment from the Condo Corporation for $4,500 and they responded with:  ""The bylaw says: ‘In the event a claim is made under any insurance policy of the Corporation and the Board, in its sole discretion and acting reasonably, determines that the Owner (or members of his family, his tenants or members of their families, his invitees, contractors or licensees) is responsible for the loss or damage that gave rise to the claim, the Corporation may recover the deductible portion of the claim refund from that Owner and such amount shall be recoverable by the Corporation as a contribution due to the Corporation from the Owner for the amount of the deductible and all costs, charges and liabilities associated therewith, and with the collection thereof, incurred by the Corporation.”     For AB condo claims, when a unit owner is “responsible’ for a loss, it means the loss  is due to the  owner’s act or omission.  This condo was built in 2016 and pipe that leads to fridge ruptured. We don’t see that it is your responsibility at this time but please forward us the assessment that you get from the Condo Corp and we will discuss how we will respond.""  Should I inform my insurance company that this was the fault of a cat or push the Condo Corporation to pay the $4,500?"	No
I was on a short time frame because my former landlords were selling their condo and I decided to move in with my buddy. I didn't know the building just got bought by a residential management firm. I didn't have a problem with it at first but now the whole building is under construction, every day of the week. I can't work from home anymore because of the noise and I can't sleep past 8 am on the weekends because they start hammering/drilling away then. I'm thinking about asking for 25% off my rent, is that out of line? Am I SOL?	No
"I rent an apartment in Tennessee. My lease is set to end on July 31st, 2017. The leasing office is now requiring that all residents be moved out by 9 am on the 31st, or face an additional fine. Is that allowed? Because my lease just says ""until July 31st 2017"""	No
So just as a warning this will be long, and details may slightly vary due to my mom being the one going through this. If a certain detail is pertinent though I can get the specifics from her.  We are located in Indiana.  My grandma is 90 years old.   My grandma got put in the nursing home around 6 months ago. She had broken her hip and needed rehab.  She is till there because she can't go to the bathroom by herself and sometimes she feels too weak to sit up in bed by herself. My mom stays there with her every other day (all day) and her sister stays on the other days. They do this because they say if you leave grandma alone she will try to get up by herself and re-break her hip (she has done this once before).    They are currently paying the nursing home $225 per day to keep her there. They looked into getting Medicaid and apparently you have to pay a lawyer $10,000 to represent you, it won't cover costs for another year (who knows if she'll make it that long), and once she did pass they would have to pay a certain % of the money back.  She has quite a large farm they had planned on selling (~$1,000,000 my mom thinks) but a lawyer told them if they sold it before she passed they would have to pay a large amount of taxes.   Grandma's savings has run out and my mom is trying to figure out how to pay for the nursing home bill. She is thinking of getting a loan, then paying it back after grandma passes once they sell the farm. However she is having a hard time finding someone to give them a large enough loan. So my questions are:  is this the right option?  Are there options out there we don't know about?  Was she given the correct info about Medicaid?  Tl;dr need advice on how to pay grandmas nursing home bill	No
In the final stages of a divorce as the defendant. She has a lawyer but I cannot afford one. Things have been pretty simple. Agreed on most of everything and planned on signing papers out of court. The papers arrived yesterday and there are a few things I don't agree with mostly being taking my son off of my insurance. Thought this was a harmless act but it added $150 to my child support. She won't budge on keeping him on mine. I really just want this all over with but I also want to stand up to this because I feel taken advantage of due to my ignorance. Is there anything I could do? Would I even have a shot if I took this to court without a lawyer?	No
They told him it was a federal offence and he had no idea. What can he do?	No
My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	No
Hello /r/legaladvice ! So this situation is still unfolding but I have a couple questions for you. I am in the process of moving across country from the east coast to Washington state. I was there last month for a few weeks and got a studio apartment and moved in, stayed there for a few weeks before headed home to grab my car and move there for good. Now I have always carried renters insurance though I forgot to get it right when I moved in, more on that later.   Now I have had a bidet on my toilets for years now and can't go back to toilet paper lol. When I moved into the new spot I quickly ordered one on amazon and installed it. amazing as usual. I was there for about a week after that and did not notice any leaks. I flew home to Boston and have bad been here about 10 days when I get a call from my property manager saying that there is a leak in my downstairs neighbors apt and they want to enter my unit the check. I immediately started thinking about what could possibly be leaking, and was worried the only thing it could be is the bidet. Anyway at this point I did not know that or anything, however my property managers call reminded me that I still had forgot to get renters insurance, I immediately purchased it.      Now here I am 2 days after the initial call and my fears are confirmed, though luckily not as bad as some of my mental images of there being a foot of water in my bathroom. So it was my bidet, I don't know what happened as I have never had a problem with leaks but I am told I am responsible for the damage and they will send me a claim.    So I am wondering about the dates of buying my renters insurance. It was activated the 6th, I don't know when I will receive a bill for damages but I imagine it will cause my insurance provider to be suspicious. My question is, since I did not know of the cause of damage or that I was liable when I purchased the policy would this constitute some kinda of fraud?    Sorry for any spelling errors I kinda just spat this all out as I am anxious about it and feel super bad and embarrassed. I will need to bake my downstairs neighbor some cookies or something.	No
Also, is it a valid form of id in general?	No
Hello LegalAdvice,  I live in Michigan, and I have been renting an apartment with my girlfriend for 6 months. During this 6 month period, we have been having nothing but problems with our upstairs neighbors. They have been terrorizing the entire apartment complex.   They've been pounding on the neighbor's door across the hall late at night, and barking at their door to mess with their dog. They've been excessively stomping on the floor to disturb us at all times of the day, including late at night. Additionally, about 2 months ago, they've started dropping fire crackers from their bedroom window and having them explode feet away from ours, waking us up at 10, 11, 2, and 4 am. I have had to call the police on them 4 times.  The landlord has not done anything about it. He's stated that there's nothing he can do. It's almost like he doesn't read his lease agreement. How he can evict someone for 3+ police visits, and continual nuance compaints. (I am not the only one that has complained about them).   The landlord just doesn't want to lose residents, so he wont evict. But I guess he fails to see that he will lose residents over them?   Anyway, we're wanting to terminate our own lease because the landlord isn't following any of his tenant policies, and he isn't guaranteeing a peaceful living situation.  Are we able to do this without paying the rest of the years rent? I do not want to stay here for 6 more months dealing with constant stomping, pointless police visits, and firecrackers at my windows in the middle of the night. It's driving my girlfriend and I insane.   Please help!	No
"I know, I know, but my friend is looking into getting a divorce.  She is a natural-born citizen who lives in Pennsylvania, and he is in the end-stages of getting his citizenship (from the UK) through their marriage.  As far as I know, all assets (house, cars) are in her name and she has been paying the bills.  I helped her with his citizenship paperwork when it was at the point where he was switching from a green card to a citizen.  The fact that he had joint pay-in to their bank accounts was included in the final interview paperwork.  As far as I know at the moment, he is waiting on the final decision.   His original UK passport however has lapsed.   There have been problems cropping up in their marriage.  He is ""threatening"" to go back to the UK.  Regardless of what he ends up deciding, can anyone here recommend what, if any, type of specialized lawyer she might need in case of a divorce?  Any kind of advice would be very appreciated.  Thank you in advance for your time."	No
As question says, our Landlord had allowed us to move out early at the beginning of June even though our lease technically ended at the end of the July. In the lease we did agree to allowing up to the maximum 60 days under CO law to return the deposit. We also signed an amendment to the lease in which we agreed to the new move out date of June 4th. However, even though it has been over 60 days since we moved out. The landlord is saying that it doesn't start until the original move out date we agreed to. I have been looking around but have not been able to find any info on this either way. FYI he has had people living in the place since mid-June so not sure if that matters.	No
Basically I just moved into a house of friends but the one friend is the one who we pay rent to and they take care of all the bills.    We do our laundry off peak time but the energy bill came in ridiculously high for the first time.  Now my friend is saying we need to limit our laundry to once or twice a week each.  And they're turning off the air conditioning for a few weeks.    The a/c I'm kinda put out about but don't think I can fight it.  The laundry on the other hand, is that legal?	No
"Hello Everyone, I'm writing because my fiance, who lives in the UK, was attempting to visit for a couple of weeks using the ESTA Visa Waiver program. She had the waiver approved but when she went through US Customs in Ireland, they questions what the purpose of her visit was and why she had 3 bags with her. She told them she was going on vacation to see friends and had 3 bags because there were gifts and she had clothes for several weddings she was invited to. They ended up interrogating her for several hours, took her phone and went through every text, email, and even her Facebook posts. They told her that she was not going to visit friends but rather going to visit her fiance. She told them that she was going to visit both and intended to come back in 3 weeks due to her having a job and had a return ticket. After hours of interrogation, the officer told her he didn't care about the luggage or the fiance part but was denying her entry because she lied to 3 officers about who she was going to see. They accused her of trying to use the Visa Waiver as a means to bypass the fiance or spousal visa and said she intended to stay in the US, which obviously wasn't true. He stamped her passport with an ""Application for Admission Withdrawn"" stamp and said if she wanted to enter the US, she has to apply for a fiance visa (which we intended on applying for in the near future anyways. This prevents her from being able to visit me in the US and our concern was how this would affect her chances of getting approved for the fiance visa when we apply for it. Does this negatively impact her chances? What are our best steps moving forward with getting her to the US and is there any way to remove the negative remarks associated with her traveling to the US? Any help would be appreciated!"	No
I live in a [Mitchell-Lama](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/mitchell-lama-rentals.page) co-op.  I moved from a 2 bedroom to a 3 bedroom in 2011.  They never transferred billing of my garage fee to my new apt.  I wrote the management company &amp; CC'ed the President of the Board telling them to do so.  They didn't.  I figured screw them, I did my duty, I informed them, they ignored me.  I wash my hands of the situation.    Now 6 years later they're sending me a bill for six years of monthly fees.  My question is...do I have to pay?  Is there any kind of statute of limitations?  It is after all their job to bill me.  Their screw up, not mine.       PS:  Just so nobody thinks I'm that bad a guy...  After all, why shouldn't I pay for my garage space...  This was an incompetent, possibly corrupt Board with an utterly incompetent &amp; almost certainly corrupt management company.  They were already fighting with me on other issues.  So I felt justified not paying, if they're too incompetent to bill me, even after I brought the situation to their attention.	No
"TLDR backstory: So my wife has been offered an anchor/reporter job that's a big break for her in her field.  However, the location is far from ideal (Southern Michigan) and it has limited jobs in my field (BioEng).  Her offer is a two-year contract agreement with 90-day probational period, however we're not sure of her rights to leave there after those 90 days.  The contract states:  ""Your first 90 days of employment is a probationary period.  During this period, the company will evaluate your suitability for your position and it may decide not to continue your employment for no reason or for any reason prohibited by law.  You are free to resign your employment with the Company at any time either during your probationary period or thereafter. **This paragraph does not apply to individuals who have been employed by the Company or affiliate for more than 90 days immediately preceding the date of this offer letter**  You represent that you are not subject to the terms of noncompetition, confidentiality, or similar agreement that would limit your ability to carry out the duties of your position and your offer of employment is based on this representation. If the Company learns that you are currently subject to any such agreement that would limit or prohibit you employment with the Company, your employment may be terminated.""  Based on that, is she able to leave early without penalty a year down the road if she doesnt like it?  Could she accept a different job in the same field without violating her contract?    Thanks"	No
"Hired about a month ago and the boss asked me during my interviews what my political views are. We were on separate sides and we both agreed it wouldn't be an issue. So today I tell him how I've met a potential client by discussing politics and agreeing with someone at a bar. He states ""you'll never succeed with that mindset"". I ask to further discuss this and to explain. He tries to sway me and I tell him politely I still believe what I previously stated. I then ask him ""you're thinking about firing me over this, aren't you?"" sure enough he says yes and that we'll talk about it tomorrow. At least I got to go home early so there's that.   Anyways if I do end up getting fired is there anything I can actually do about this? I've tried to do some research but it all seems like a case by case basis."	No
Im writting this on behalf of a friend.  A mom and dad are separated, and have a schedule for child custody. The mom sent the kids to camp at a location several hours away from the dad's home. When the camp is done, it will be time for the dad to pick up the kids from the mom. However, the mom purposely did not pay the camp to drive the kids home. This means that the dad is left to drive several hours to pick up the kids. Of course, he will drive there to pick them up. But, is there anyway to discipline the mom?  Is there anything that can be done?	No
"Looking for advice/a restraining order. This woman has done nothing but torment my wife and my children and constantly enrage me. Wife has said she'd take care of it multiple times, but she still hasn't, years later. Now I do have some idea of the time-frame of the following events, but not all of them. Some of them were last year.  Here's a fun story about my Mother-in-law:  12/2015 It comes out that she's been cheating on her husband for ~3 years with her husband's best friend, it comes out her daughter did the same thing for 4 months. Threatens his life multiple times to everyone who'll listen, for five months lies to everyone around her about the whole situation because of ""what he did to both of them"", comes out that she's still seeing the bf, divorces husband and marries bf so he can get his green-card.  -Multiple times has run up to my wife in the store, immediately berating her over not letting the kids come around anymore. Kids now refer to her as ""scary monster lady who yells a lot"".  -Corners my wife when she goes to pick up the kids at her grandmother's house, again immediately barging into the house screaming at the wife.  -We literally move an hour away, just to be in a different area  where there's ""no chance"" of seeing her or bf ever.  -Wife graduates college, specifically tells friends, family, etc. not to even tell her mother about it, so obviously MIL shows up but hangs around in the back so nobody sees her until halfway through, then nobody tells me because they know exactly how I'd react. Thank god for family, right? Wife breaks down about it later. Great job guys.  8/2/17 0915 Shows up at my front door, knocks, gawks at my daughter, then son as I'm coming out of restroom. Is already almost in her truck by the time I reach the front door. Pulls out in a hurry. Kid says ""why was monster lady here? I thought she couldn't find us anymore.""  She has been told on all of these occasions by my wife and I both to stay away from my family to the point that she knows what we'll say before we say it. She is consistently and actively harassing, stalking and taunting us causing us to have to watch over our shoulders when we go out, as a result not really wanting to go anywhere. Would love for this bullshit to stop and for this bitch to stop getting away with trying to insert herself into our and our kids' lives. It's disgusting and disrespectful and I wish she'd drop dead.  **TL;DR** Need crazy MIL to stay away from my family."	No
[TX] I was driving in the left lane of traffic on highway 361 preparing to pass another car that was 1000 feet in front of me, I realize that I might have gotten into the left lane a little early but they were going slow and we were the only people on the road. As I'm coming up on the car I see a black SUV sitting in the median facing the wrong way and I slow down kind of panicking that they're going to pull out in front of me. I do not change lanes because I'm watching the SUV to see if they pull out in front of me. As I pass the SUV they turn their lights on and I realize it was a cop, I was not speeding at any point. I get pulled over and issued a ticket for driving in the left lane, the cop will not listen to the fact that I was preparing to pass a car until I saw him facing the wrong way in traffic and slowed down. What are my chances of fighting this? It's a $500 ticket and as I wasn't impeding the flow of traffic I don't really see what I did to warrant a ticket. The law is so ambiguous, and there is not place (that I can tell) that tells you when you can officially get into the left lane to pass.    Also worth noting, I have a Conceal Carry License but I've never owned a gun or really had anything to do with guns. Got it because my boyfriend is in the military and wanted me to get a gun and I kinda forgot I had it. The cop ran my DL and saw that I have a CCL and came back screaming that he could arrest me for not giving him my CCL with my DL but when I took the class they told is that we're under no obligation to give the officer our CLL granted we do not have a gun on our person, which I most definitely did not. I would really like to file an official complaint for this because as far as I can tell, he's just making up law to suit himself but I want to be sure that this is correct before I raise hell at the police station.

"My soon to be ex has told me that the are the beneficiary of over 5 million dollars in a trust fund(s) that will be transferred to them one or both parents pass away. My ex told me this directly, and also told their friends about it, but in an interrogatory states ""N/A"" when asked about trusts/expected inheritances. I can't find any written record of it. We made financial decisions based on this nest egg, so of course now I am screwed.  It is possible that my ex's parents moved this money or otherwise revoked the trust during the divorce process, but assuming that they haven't, how do I figure out if this trust exists at all so I can learn more about it in discovery?  Note that I am not looking to gain access to this money, but it does come into play when it comes to equitable distribution / alimony (which my ex is requesting).  Them and their parents are of course hostile to this and will not cooperate, and also have a lot of money to fight any requests I make."	No
Hello. I am from Mississippi. My boyfriend and I have been together for two years. We always used birth control. A few months ago, we were fooling around, and, out of the blue, my boyfriend suggested we try to have a baby. I was perplexed because he had always expressed disinterest in children. He started fantasizing about a wonderful family we could have, emphasizing his love and commitment to me. I was so taken aback and, after a few hours, he eventually persuaded me. I probably asked him a hundred times if he was sure, each of which he replied in the affirmative.  Well after a short while, he changed his tune and told me to go back on the pill. I was again confused but obliged. Shortly afterward, I found out I was pregnant. I felt a rush of emotions – fear, anxiety, and, surprisingly, joy. I thought it was nice to have a little person growing inside of me, depending on me for support. But I was mostly worried about how my boyfriend would feel. That night, I gradually broached the subject and eventually told him.   He hit the roof and accused me of plotting against him. I reminded him that he persuaded me to try for a baby, and he said that was just stupid pillow talk. He ordered me to “get rid of it,” to which I felt sick. He has known from the very beginning of our relationship that I am terrified by even the thought of an abortion, and he always said felt the same way. I tried to placate and reason with him, but he just kept calling me a lying slut and a bitch. He snapped that I would never get a cent of his money and stormed out.   I was completely flummoxed and scared. I know several single mothers who were abandoned by their boyfriends/husbands and are struggling immensely to raise their children on their own. I swore I would never end up like them. But I know that I cannot raise a baby on my own. I even started considering abortion, but the closest abortion clinic is over a hundred miles away, and abortion is not covered by insurance in my state.   Unfortunately, I could not even have a conversation with my boyfriend, as he kicked me out of our apartment and cut off all communication with me. I spent weeks simply trying to talk to him. He eventually relented, just in time to introduce me to his new girlfriend, seated in the passenger seat of his brand new truck. I felt defeated and gave abortion a second thought but realized I had just passed the 20-week threshold. To top it off, I was fired from my job for unexplained reasons (just days after I put in a request for a larger uniform to accommodate my baby bump).  My boyfriend was the one who coaxed me into going off the pill and making love night after night. He promised me, swore up and down, that he would always be there for the baby and me. And now that we are pregnant, he wants nothing to do with the baby or me. How can he do this? How can a father want nothing to do his own child? Our baby is our creation, and every day, I find myself growing more and more attached to it. When I feel it kicking inside of my stomach, I feel warm and joyful. But I know that I cannot afford to feed and clothe it on my own, and I know that I will not be able to give it up once I hold it in my arms. I really, really do not want to have to go to court, but as my bump grows and my paltry savings diminish, I fear that I may be the only option at this point. I don't care about myself; I only want our baby to have his basic needs met. What can I do?	No
The Title says it all. I know I could find this info by doing some digging, but I'm extremely lazy. A friend of mine wants to know for whatever reason. he lives in Colorado but goes to school here with me in Louisiana. I know that it's probably not legal in either state, but if it's not what would the penalties be? Misdemeanor, Felony? And what would the fines look like, etc.	No
Ok so first off I would like to ask people to not leave rude comments.    So I was born in Texas and lived here my whole life and my boyfriend moved to Texas from Mexico illegally 9 years ago when he was 14 years old. It might be a few years until we get married but I was wondering how the whole marriage process works with an illegal immigrant.  I know there was an act passed by Obama that might protect him but as I did more reading he might be a year off from the date of being protected. I am mostly really worried about us trying to get the marriage license and the government deporting him. Will he have to go back to Mexico to get a K1 visa or can we just get married and begin filing for a green card? Any other advice or helpful comments on how this all works will be greatly appreciated. 	No
I'm renting an apartment through a management company. The least list my name, the agent's name of the management company, and the independent owner of the property (I guess the company manages properties for clients who own them). However, only me and the agent has sign, and this concludes the contract according to the agent. Should I ask the agent to ask the landlord to sign before I send in the deposit, or is it standard for only the agent to sign?	No
I'll try to keep this short and keep as little reference to names or job titles as possible. Basically, about 6 years ago I met a girl who had semi-famous parents and I ended up marrying. During the course of our relationship, I suggested starting a YouTube channel and various social media with her father who was a professional athlete. My intent was to build a brand around it under the idea that eventually my wife and I would take over once they retire and that we could live off of the fame and publicity (my wife also became a pro athlete after I convinced her to let her father mentor her). Everything was fine, until she decided it would be a good idea to cheat on me and move to a completely different state with the dude randomly. I waited and tried to reconcile with her for over a year with no luck and it tore me up extremely badly. She also ran off with the majority of our assets and money and left me with very little. So not only did my wife disappear over night but also my career. She and her family also refused to give me my filming equipment back until just recently we had it court ordered back to me next month. Over the period with the drama between my wife and I, my in-laws approached me about buying me out in both person and through text. I informed them that I still wanted to wait and see if my wife returned before I made any big decisions, and I was also concerned about whether she would try and claim it as community property or not and if I would get in trouble for selling before we reached a settlement. Everything was created before we were married, so that's not the problem. The problem is that eventually they texted me wanting to buy me out still and after consulting with my family lawyer they thought that if I could get an offer that we could draft up a contract that would legally absolve any possible right my wife had to the stake in IP and social media. I asked them to give me an offer and they did not. After a couple of weeks I was then informed that they were suing me and placing a restraining order against me (even thought I had not voluntarily contacted them in over a year). Since we were family, we had no formal contract- But the agreement always was that I kept the revenue from the channel in exchange for building her dads fame and increasing his value  (which it did EXPONENTIALLY). The YouTube account and all contracts associated are all under my name. The Logo was also created by me and I have all original photoshop, sony vegas, and over 7 TB of footage and pictures to show my ownership- But hiring an IP lawyer is going to cost me a minimum of a $20,000 retaining fee. And I have very little money thanks to my wife taking everything with her and my inability to get my equipment back to be gainfully employed normally. I feel like they are trying to back me into a corner so that I settle for much less than it's worth or just give it up. But this is the last 6 years of my life work and I would prefer if I could at least get some startup money for a future venture of my own so that I can start new. What should be my next step? We're talking potentially millions of dollars worth of value in assets and I know that he is feeling the hurt and pressure from his sponsors otherwise he wouldn't be trying to get it so badly. Especially given the fact that he always belittled my work and acted as if it had no actual value to him (even though he always wanted to continue doing it).   Hopefully this is easy to understand. This is a throwaway account just for the record because I'm not sure if names getting out would hurt me or just them.	No
My financial situation changed due to me leaving an abusive relationship and at the time, the best decision for my son was to let him live with his grandparents while I got into a better financial and living situation. (GA, USA) The problem is ever since I started talking about being ready they started alienating me from my son (now 6 yrs old). So now that I'm fully ready and without doubt can give him the life he deserves, I have filed a petition for terminating guardianship, which was rejected and now has led us to court soon. I have a few questions about what is admissible in court specifically: Text messages, and call logs (where calls were not answered or returned), a notarized statement from a witness, can I have a (sibling) character witness?  It has been about 2.5 years since I signed over guardianship and I've continually requested and been shot down for visitation through the last 2 years. and have been trying to convince them to terminate for at least 6 months now.	No
A couple of months ago I noticed the carpet in one of my two bedrooms was wet. Upon further inspection, I saw black mold lining the corner of the carpet in the surronding area. I called my apartment complex's reality company that handles all issues and had to leave a message. In the meantime more and more area in the room began to have water coming up (with no sign of wall leakage) and the carpet was soaked to the point of squisheness so I used my own carpet cleaner to suck up as much as I could, but it seemed the water would replace itself every time I tried. Within a period of 3 weeks, they had a carpet cleaning company come out twice to remove the water. Both times the water came back. Now we are more than two months from the issue first arrising and it has still not been fixed. I have called multiple times about it, and they give me the run around. At this point, I have not been able to stay in the room for about 2 months and my bed currently resides in my living room. I am getting very impatient waiting for them to fix anything, and now I  am wondering if I'm entitled to some kind of compensation because the room has been unliveable with the smell and mold. I don't know how to go about getting this issue fixed. Please advise!	No
Unsure how this turns because it's not a 3rd party suing to vacate the lease, it's an actual party in privity here.      thanks!	No
Me and my roommate are currently both signed into a lease. We have been arguing recently and she is now threatening to evict me. Can she legally do so?	No
My Grandmother is 66 years old and started cataracts surgery June 1st.  They do one eye, wait 2 weeks, than do the other eye.  With this surgery you also get to choose the type of lens you want, and what distance you'd like to see best - near, intermediate, or far. You can choose other options as well, including having a different power in each eye. But she chose to see better near for both eyes.   Both surgeries themselves went fine, no problems. The problem is that now she has one eye that sees up close and one eye that sees far.   We had many follow-ups with the eye doctor - not the surgeon - Who was surprised on the last visit the difference he saw between the eyes and said he was seeing something not the norm but he wanted to wait a few more weeks to make a definitive conclusion as this surgery can take a period of adjustment.   The problem persists, is pronounced, and we believe is past the time adjustment period and seems to have settled. We have the final follow-up appointment next week but we wanted to know beforehand that if the eye exam follow up does conclude that further correction is needed if we need to pay more for that, if we have legal recourse, and/or what we should make sure to do/get/ask.	No
Hey guys,  I've been serving at a restaurant for a little over 4-5 months. A few weeks ago I was appearing on the schedule less often, and recently, the schedule was sent out and I wasn't on it at ALL. I hadn't been informed of anything, or talked to by anyone about this happening, but since there has been some tension at work regarding myself and other employees, I wondered if I had gotten fired.   So, naturally, I brought it up in the group chat that our coworkers and managers use to communicate with each other, asking if I was fired. My manager texted me, saying they *needed to investigate something regarding my past behavior, and before they got any conclusion I was suspended.* I asked him *what past behavior*, he said he *didn't know, and needed to talk to a few people first.* Furthermore, *there was no conclusion, and they may never get a solid conclusion.* So I asked him *why am I being suspended if he doesn't know what he's suspending me for*, he responded saying *you should ask yourself what happened, that (I) had said something to a coworker about something which was against the interest and honesty of the restaurant, there was no conclusion, and he was going to talk to a few people then talk to me.*  I was so confused, I know that there is no law requirement saying you have to tell someone why you're firing them, but he didn't say I was fired, he said I was suspended.   It has been over 2 weeks since he told me this, and has still not gotten back to me, nor has he put me on the schedule as I'm still part of the chat and see it every week.   Is there anything I can do?	No
First off- I don't believe there is anything nefarious going on (such as sexual molestation).  I do have a lawyer from my past custody issues, but he is currently not on retainer.  Before I take it there, I want to know if I'm overreacting, and if the family court will even care.  I know that co-sleeping is not illegal, and it is not in violation of our current parenting plan.  I have two sons (7 and 9) and have been divorced for 5ish years.  My current issue is that my ex-husband is co-sleeping with our nine year old.  My son sees a pediatric psychiatrist for ADHD, and in mentioning it to her, she believes it's unhealthy and detrimental for his development.  I think it's also unhealthy, and given that my son is in the beginning stages of puberty (and the fact that he's not a toddler), the co-sleeping situation to me is just flat out weird.    I've been discussing this with him for months, since March 2017 that I have written proof of (we communicate via Our Family Wizard).  I understand that transitioning him to his own room can be a process, but given that it's nearly August, I feel that this process should be completed at this point.  He's full of excuses and he doesn't think it's weird or unusual in the slightest.  I believe that my ex-husband is lonely and very co-dependent on our children, which is also unhealthy.  Having my son in his room at night is likely a crutch for his emotional instability.  Will family court even address this?  Thanks.	No
Hello Everyone,  I was moved to Pittsburgh by a company that I am interning with for three months over the summer. When moving in, we handed them a promissory note saying our internship dates and after that we are no longer getting paid. Due to this being my roommates and my first apartment, we were unaware we had to give them the 30 days notice because we thought we gave them the 90 days notice when we signed the 3 month lease along with handing the promissory note in.   We ended up handing in our official 30 day notice on the 20th, but they ended up switching us to a month to month lease, so we have to pay for the entire month. They apartment complex has a way of giving their residents mail by simply putting the letters in the doorways. They said they put multiple notices in our door, when in reality we only got one telling us about a change in office hours. My question is, I know that we made a mistake, but is there anything we can do since we handed in the 90 day notice? We were already paying a premium for the short term lease and as of the end of the internship, none of us will be working since I'm getting surgery and my roommates are going on vacation. Lessons were learned, but having to pay tuition and rent for my apartment near school, I would appreciate not shelling out $700. Thank you in advance.	No
She hasn't seen the kids in days and her husband isn't picking up the calls. She's high and wants to do nothing. People are cussing at her on facebook. Cousin says we can't even call the cops because we're not as close and don't count, cps was already called they don't know where they are. Anything I can do?	No
In Michigan, Broke up with girlfriend and packed her stuff.  She took it and left to her friends.  I bagged and box almost everything and set it in a neat pile in the driveway.  She came back with friends to help, and spent 4 hours collecting things throughout my house and refused to leave.  I called the police after one of them threatened to kick in my daughter's door over a vacuum.  The police said she can kick in my front door if she has stuff in my house, and she can bring anyone into my house.  Is that true, and if she leaves with her belongings, how long is it still her residence?	No
I am a homeowner. The house next door is vacant due to the owner being in a nursing home. Her son, whom I have never met and cannot get hold of, is supposedly a real prick according to my other neighbors. They tell me he will likely never sell or rent it out as it was his childhood home. Seems stupid to me to leave it empty, but whatever.  Long story short, the yard next door has become overgrown with blackberry bushes and other brambles and scrub. It's infested with vermin (had rats in my my attic over the winter, and have seen them scurrying over the fence from his yard), and the brambles are destroying the posts of the 7 foot fence between our yards. The fence is on my property.  My one neighbor who has his contact info was reluctant to give it to me, but he did reach out on my behalf a few months back to no avail. At this point, I do not want to deal with or talk to the owner's son. I will happily eat the time and cost of trimming/fence repair just to resolve the issue.  I want to know: Am I within my legal rights to go into this yard with a brush cutter ($75 to rent for 4 hours ought to do it) and take care of it?	No
"Long story short. California case. Husband had temporary restraining order placed on him, and I filed for divorce. He has a charge of domestic violence. Actual restraining order was not granted. (Judge HATED my attorney.) Judge ordered a ton of things, including a social services investigation on our child. Husband and I worked things out, don't live together but want to stay married. I filed a form for dismissal of the divorce, and was told all upcoming hearings would be dropped. Guess they weren't because I got a letter saying we are being ""sanctioned"" for not appearing  and are due in court to discuss dismissal.. What the hell does this mean? What will likely happen? I'm terrified of this judge, he is extremely powerful. I've never been so terrified of someone in my life. Can someone please give me an idea to what this all means? (Please no judgments on the fact that I'm with my husband still. It would take me days to write out our whole story.) Thank you."	No
"Back in Oct. 2010 I got a DUI in FL. My license was suspended until the completion of 6mos Interlock and a DUI class. I've spent the past few years using public transportation and have also moved out of FL. Where I've most recently moved in NorCal is very, very rural (I live on 40 acres, and all the plots are 40 acres) and I'm also in the process of getting a small Tech Support business started. So, I knew I'd need to get my license squared away.  FL tells me I need to get the Interlock device on a vehicle (which I have), then go to CA DMV with the paperwork, they will verify and issue a limited license (for work, school, errands, etc.), and once they issue my temporary license to mail a copy of it, along with some paperwork, to the FL DMV and they'll start the 6mos for my Interlock ONLY THEN.  I go to the CA DMV and they told me as long as FL has a hold on my license there's nothing they can do for me, Interlock or no. The DMV worker gives me the Mandatory Actions number, but they tell me the same thing.  It seems I'm stuck in a catch-22- the lasy with Mandatory Actions actually told me ""you may have to move to FL for 6 mos."" :|  Does anyone have any insights? Feel free to ask me any questions to help clarify, etc"	No
My boyfriend's ex is taking him to court for additional child support. Without getting too much into the details, because I don't believe they are relevant...  He has been asked to fill out one of those income/expense worksheets. Obviously he has filled it out with the amount of the bills he pays (his portion of rent, etc) but it also asks for household size. We live together but are not married. Am I correct in assuming that the household size is 1 and not 2?   We live in New York, if it matters.	No
As stated in Title. I just began working in the area a coworker has said I can move in to help save my rent money and their mortgage. As far as I'm aware they own the home and have one or two people already living in the home with them. Is there anything we should sign or get put in writing other than what my obligations are as far as rent and utilities goes. Also how official does the rent, utilities, and anything else need to be?	No
"I bought a house about nine months ago for my mom and sisters to live in. I'll call it my house for ease, but I don't live there. I have met the neighbor but have had little interaction with him. We aren't in good or bad terms, just neutral.     The backyard neighbor and my house share a property line and a single shared fence of 88 feet. The fence is a wooden privacy fence that is nailed from their side. The fence is older but solid. A few slats are kind of loose and I'm sure there a few nails popping out (I can't tell for sure though, because the nails are all on his side). He also shares a fence with his next door neighbor, the exact same fence (age and style and condition).     This past spring they extended the fence to divide our side yards for the purpose of enlarging the fenced in area of their backyard. This new fence is bright and shiny and perfect in comparison to the older, shared fence. He asked if we wanted to replace our ""old falling down fence"" while he was extending his. I was out of town but told him I didn't think so, although he was welcome to have his fence guy send me an estimate. He did, an estimate of $2000, to which the neighbor added he would pay $200. I didn't respond to it (was out of town caring for ailing grandparents and life got busy, plus that's kind of a laughable offer).     Last week he sent me a text that said his niece had run into the fence and gotten cut and needed stitches and ""could we PLEASE start looking at replacing the fence or taking care of much needed repairs?""    I have no problem at all with taking 50% financial responsibility for replacing a few slats and adding some screws where nails are popping out. I do not want to replace the whole perfectly good fence, almost entirely at my cost, simply because he wants me to. I suspect that he would like his whole backyard to match his new shiny fence section. I would even take 100% responsibility and go replace the few bad boards myself but I would have to jump the fence and go in his backyard to do so.     I am worried he might try to sue if I don't replace the fence, claiming I was negligent or something. I'm not sure why he thinks I should pay $1800 and him $200, or what I can do other than pay a contractor a crap ton of money to replace a perfectly good fence just to cover my butt.     Any advice or suggestions?   TL;DR: neighbor wants me to pay for and replace a perfectly good shared fence, I can't do the minor needed repairs myself because it's his yard, and I'm worried he trying to establish grounds to sue me."	No
First post, but I'm at my wits end. My ex (divorce final 3 1/2 years ago) is now on trial for lewd and lascivious acts against a minor. The child is a relative, but not one of our children. I have repeatedly refused to get in the middle of the case, in order to keep my kids out of it, and to maintain my sanity for their sake. Our kids have been solely with me for almost 2 years, and blissfully unaware of what their father has been accused of (I don't speak negatively about him to/in front of them, but I believe he's guilty).  The alleged acts are from 2009, when we were together and my oldest was less than 2 years old. He and his attorney just served me with a subpoena to be in court, along with my now 9 year old child.  My kids have been with me 100% because of an order from superior court (California) that their father cannot be with any child without supervision by another adult, and his girlfriend doesn't qualify. Our divorce got settled with 50/50 custody, and that still stands, as I lack the funds to hire a lawyer to go for full custody at this point.  All I want is to keep my kids out of this whole drama - they (and I) have no involvement. Wtf can I do???	No
So my moma house was foreclosed on. She is being court ordered to leave by the 18th.  The company thay bought her house, let themselves in today, while she was in her room, and changed the locks and didn't leave her a key. She explained she had till the 18th of August, and they said it wasn't her house anymore.  This is in New York.   Also, they were taking picture of the inside of the house.    This cannot be legal, correct?	No
"Hi /r/legaladvice,    Posting this on a throwaway.    I live in NE Ohio in a suburban area. I live in a residential area, a small city of approximately 20,000. My neighbor has lived here for many years - far longer than I.  I bought the house going on two years ago. Although I quite enjoy the city, my house and the area I live in - I can't stand my neighbor. In fact, nearly everyone around me can't.    Here's the problem with them - we live in a residential area. They run an auto shop out of their garage. They work on cars **all. day. long.**  Up until recently - they used to happen until 1, 2, 3 even 4 or 5 AM. They were ""decent"" enough to close their garage door but all that would do is muffle the noises.    Their garage is at most 50 feet from where I am sitting now and all I hear is loud talking and grinding.   My choices are to close my windows and turn on the AC or open the windows and listen to obnoxious noises all day long.   Sitting in the backyard - which should be a peaceful activity, is broken by them constantly banging on a vehicle, grinding on something, etc.    I got to the point of eventually calling the police every time they were working beyond 9 PM (quiet hours) and they seem to has ceased working beyond that time.     This has been going on for years. I spoke with another neighbor and found out that the person I bought the house from used to call on them all the time and the city has never done anything. I've called the police 3 times.     I've also contacted the Ohio EPA, who referred me to the Cleveland division of air pollution. The reason being is because a large portion of what they do is body work and there is a lot of air pollutants that I know they are not properly handling. There is also the possibility of fluid spills.     I have some concerns about going at this in a more aggressive manner - we share a fence. It's my fence and it's a privacy fence. It's in somewhat rough shape that I plan to replace in the near(ish) future. That means I'll have to deal with removing it, and standing on the other side while staining it.    More importantly, I have a dog that I am concerned about them trying to do something to while she's in the yard.    This isn't something that can just be talked about with them - they know people don't like this and they just don't care. They're really inconsiderate (and sketchy) individuals.    I'm really upset at the city for failing to do anything - it's against city law to run a automotive business out of a residential area. The city is aware of this and they refuse to do anything. I've contacted a city councilman and the law director. Both have not done much.   Right now is a ""slow"" time. They recently decided that they weren't making enough money to keep this up so they quit for 2 weeks only to start back up. However, the routinely have 12 or so cars in their driveway, garage, backyard + on the street. In doing so, they ALWAYS park in front of my house and leave their house open.    That may seem petty - but when they do this, they double park in front of my house and park as close to my driveway as possible. I've had times where I almost hit the vehicle parked there while turning in / pulling out. Which is another violation - parking too close to a driveway.     Basically - they're constantly violating city laws, the police routinely just show up and tell them to stop. The city won't do anything about it.    Looking for advice on what I might be able to do to get this to stop so I can get some peace. I'm tired of being woken up at 4 AM because they're working on their cars 6 feet from my bedroom window - in the middle of the driveway.  Thanks!"	No
This is in Orange County, CA. I left the lease early because of several reasons, vermin, harassment (by landlord), and many other issues.  Now my landlord states that they don't want to deal with someone like me ever again, and won't find someone off of craigslist like before. Also claims that they have different standards now.  My question is, am I responsible for the real estate fee's because of this? As far as I'm concerned they want to find a tenant a different way whereas they were cheaper before, and I shouldn't be responsible.  I think they are doing this to keep my security deposit.	No
Hello,  As the title says, I am on my ex (husband's) insurance plan as a dependent. I am not able to get onto a different health insurance plan without cancelling this one. They say that only the primary account holder can have me removed from the plan, but my ex and I are not on speaking terms. Is this legal? Do I really have no say in this? I live in Canada, btw.  Thanks in advance...	No
I need legal advice regarding the no contact order.  A friend got into argument with live in partner and she broke something.  He called the police and had her taken away on charge of domestic violence.  She had a no contact order put on her but she tried to see him after that to smooth things over.  However the court doesn't know that she broke the no contact order, only the live in partner.  My question is can he use knowledge and evidence of her breaking her no contact order down the road as a way to blackmail her into getting what he wants?  Thanks for your advice really appreciate it.	No
Sorry, I accidentally deleted my last post.   Hey, y'all. Any employee law information you can give me, either state (Indiana) or federal (US), as well as any advice on resolving any legal matters as quickly as I possibly can would be greatly appreciated!  So, since I teach during the school year, I have employment over the summer with a summer camp. I signed no contract with my employers after receiving the job offer - only an employment application and information for payroll. I accepted the job on the premise that I would be paid an hourly wage as I did last year for the same job, but I was told after approximately a week of work that I would be paid a flat rate of $450/week.   The new year also came with some new rules for the camp counselors. We cannot leave the campus without permission, and can only leave for 2 hours at night, one-at-a-time between 11PM-1AM. We were also told that we would be getting overtime pay, and if we worked overtime, to log it on the final week of the payroll cycle in which we will only be present on campus for 1 of the 7 days.   On another note, I was offered a better position at this camp initially, and then they took the offer back to give it to another candidate after I had already made living arrangements for the summer. But I'm not sure that I can prove this/it will hold up in court.   • Since I am required to be present unless given permission and am only allowed 2 hours per night off campus with that permission, does this mean that I am on call 24 hours? If so, can I be paid for the hours that I am not necessarily actively doing something since I am essentially required to just be around?   • Is keeping me here for a month with no release okay? How can I get some time away from here if I want to see family or when I have to move my permanent residence in 2 weeks?   • Do I have a case against my employer for not paying overtime and asking us to alter our time sheets even though this was discussed in a private meeting and there is no written record?   • Can the camp be liable for my expenses since they took back a job offer after I made living arrangements? Again, I'm not really sure I can prove this part.   • Who do I report the above issues to, and how long will it feasibly take to get fixed? Is it possible to resolve some of these issues within a couple of weeks or will I be toughing it out until the end of the camp?	No
"My friend [early 20s F] lives in the dorms on her job's campus. Monday night, she was at an employee social until early in the morning, but ended up getting a fairly good parking spot near her dorm. She was the designated driver for a few of her coworkers. Later on Tuesday morning (around 11am) she discovered damage to the back corner or her vehicle. Deep scratches and a missing reflector. She was unable to find the reflector anywhere in the lot, and assumed cleaners had picked it up. Of course we were both upset, but there isn't much to do when the parking lot has no cameras.   Cue Saturday morning. At my advisement, she finally tells her mother about the damage to the vehicle since the car is not titled in her name. Her mother is a bit of a hardass, so she told a white lie and said she was unaware of the damage until today (since she had waited so long. Strike one against her).   Saturday afternoon, she's summoned to the local police station and is questioned by officers. She called me right after the questioning, but I have little details as to the tone of the interaction. Whoever had hit her car originally had taken the reflector and given it to the police, stating she caused the accident. STRIKE TWO: she told the police she was unaware of the damage until today so her story would remain straight in the eyes of her mother. I disagree, but I'm currently too far away to take action about it. I believe I can pull text messages from five days ago where she told me she discovered the damage.   While I'm furious with her over that, there isn't much she can do about it at this point. What steps should she take now? My late grandparents were retired police officers when I was growing up, and I wouldn't dream of lying to an officer. I have no advice for her now. I met this girl in college and we have been close for awhile now-I would love to find a solution for her. Is there anyone who knows what to do in this situation?   (There is also not a doubt in my mind that she is innocent. The fact that it took the other person four days to present this ""evidence"" to the officer should also be of credit to her.)  TLDR: Friend is being framed for a hit and run by the actual perpetrator days after the accident. There are no cameras or witnesses. How should she proceed?"	No
Good afternoon! Just a quick question. I have been googling all afternoon with no luck. Someone i know discovered bed bugs in her apartment. After contacting the landlord he informed her they came from the tenant below. I was told this is a HIPAA violation, but I think that's ridiculous.  Thanks!	No
My step-daughter and wife signed a lease in February of 2017 in order to reserve a spot for her for the Fall of this year. Some shit happened, and it isn't in her best interest to go back to school there so she won't even be living in that city or going to school there.     The apartment complex is telling her that she is responsible for re-letting the apartment and if she does not, she is still responsible for the monthly rent, and thus me and my wife as well.    I haven't seen the lease yet, but am working on getting a copy. Is there anyway out of this thing? She never took possession.	No
"My friend [F25] was out drinking at bar with a few friends and acquaintances over this past weekend. She drove home very drunk and one of her ""friends"" followed her home and raped her in her apartment.    I want my friend to go to the police and file a report against this scum bag so he doesn't find another drunk victim to rape, because I just don't think this was his first time. She doesn't want to go to the police because she drove home drunk and is afraid of the consequences. Can she get charged with a DUI or a misdemeanor if she admits that she drove home drunk without any incidents? If we find out that it's unlikely, then I think she'll agree to file a report of rape against this guy. Once that question is mostly answered, we need to find out if there's enough ""evidence"" of the rape to actually do anything. She's really worried that it'll just be her word against his.   Thank you for any help/advice on this issue. It's such a sensitive situation and she nor I knew where to turn to for help."	No
I'll start at the beginning. My boyfriend &amp; I moved out of a crappy apartment in North Dakota. We moved into a nicer apartment with the same company, different offices. So my boyfriend drops off the check for rent ($700) at new apartment. A few days later, we get a call we owe late fees and rent. We show them we gave them the check for rent. They say they'll figure it out. That was almost 2 months ago. So now they called and said they messed up and gave the rent check to the old apartment. On our move out check, we got back $644. (They took over $800 for cleaning, replacing blinds, etc.) So now they're saying it's their fault for losing the check but we still owe them the $700 for first month rent. We barely scrape by as is so finding another 700 is beyond me. Is there any legal binding for me to pay the rent that they used and misplaced? They did use the money, they just accidentally gave it back a portion.	No
Is there any way I can get my money back? 2 days have gone by and this guy hasn't done **ANY** work to my car. I'm [pretty sure](https://imgur.com/a/QCVc8) he has ran off with my money... What can I do to recover my money? 	No
So we're in a conflict with my neighbor. There is a tree on his property but all the branches grow out on our side and it leaks sap all over ours cars in the driveway. They're constantly covered in thick sap. Asked him to cut it down he said no. So my plan is to cut all the branches that hang over my property line. I'm going to sheer all the limbs off tomorrow. Is that against the law?  Thanx in advance for any advice.	No
Hey all,  My fiancés friend is in Cincy, Ohio. Single mother who just had her baby. She is currently drowning in medical debt, getting warnings about having her utilities shut off, and her baby daddy who has done nothing for the kid is lawyering up to get custody and child support. My fiancé and her parents are trying to help her anonymously with money and I'm trying to get a bunch of clothes and stuff together for her.   My question is, is there anything we can do to help her regarding the child support/custody case, utilities, or even medical debt? I do not know if she's on government assistance or if she has tried to have her medical debt forgiven, nor does the fiancé. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much!	No
"There is a two car width driveway between our houses. It's the only driveway for both of us. The back of the driveway leads to their garage (that's off to the side closer to their house, not in the middle of where the driveway ends). That's where our neighbors park. There is a patch of gravel right in front of our house that we are able to park in. However, we were told that half of the paved driveway is on our property.  Before we even decided to buy the house, we knew the neighbors had disputes with the now previous owners of our house. They had a property inspector come out, measure, and determine that half the driveway is, in fact, part of our property. The neighbors disagree, but as far as I'm aware, they have no legal documents to prove otherwise.  (Again, the day after moving in) my boyfriend and I hired someone to clean our air ducts in the house. He parked in the middle of the driveway closer to the street. While I was walking the cleaner around the house showing him where all the vents were located, the wife neighbor decided to go somewhere. Their cars were parked side by side (her car was probably technically on our side of the driveway) and thus, the cleaning guy's van was blocking her in. I got to the second floor and see her outside a window trying to get my attention. I opened the window and she immediately says ""I need him (cleaner) to move."" She didn't even start with a ""Hi, I'm your neighbor, and I need your assistance,"" which would've been fine. Then, she proceeded to tell me about the driveway with, ""I don't know if you're aware of this, but the driveway-"" and I cut her off, telling her I was aware of the situation and we could work it out later. I apologized for the van in her way and told her he was about to move it. She then became nice and tried to chit chat for a moment before leaving.  I really do not want to have a bad relationship with my neighbors, and I have no problem with parking in the gravel in front of our house, but her immediate rudeness and attempt at dominance is setting the stage for problems. I will not tolerate it.  I don't want to get a lawyer involved, but I was wondering what legal action I can take to come up with a solution. Considering the property inspector has come out before and the neighbors still disagree, I assume the decision, while still legal, was only verbalized to the previous owners and our neighbors. I want to get some document that we both have to sign, stating that we acknowledge the property line set by the inspector and that we will respect it. I even thought of the inspector spray-painting a property line on the driveway for us, if they decide to be that petty. That way, if they do park on our property or try to cause problems, I can bring out that document and/or call the cops so they can get whatever talk or citation they need to realize they need to be respectful.  Do I need a lawyer, or a notary? Can the property inspector draw up the document?  TL;DR   one driveway for two houses. We apparently own half, but the neighbors disagree even though property lines have previously been established. I'll become petty if they do."	No
"I'm currently moving to a new place somewhere else in Minnesota.  Yet, my roommate is demanding I remove my stuff from the living room because ""it looks like junk"".   I'm currently packing stuff up for my new place, yet he's strongly demanding that I get my stuff out of the living room.      I told him repeatedly not to touch my belongings.  I even told him that I called the police and informed him that he's trying to throw out my belongings.  What should be my next step if I find that my belongings are gone?      Do I have any recourse to call the police and show them the text messages?  Is that enough proof to charge him with theft?"	No
I'm a college student at a school in Ohio. I signed a lease and put down a deposit for off-campus housing and everything was fine until I ran into issues with my guarantor. The issue wasn't getting the guarantor, but she issue apartment leasing office and their, frankly petty, requirements. It was no issue for me though. I talked to the office workers and they said I could get a credit check ran for myself. I passed. Then they said I needed to either put down two months rent or show proof that I made 3x the monthly rent.   I talk to the office workers again, tell them that I don't have two months rent and don't make 3x, but will have more than enough money to pay the entire year with my refund. They tell me this is OK. A day later they ask me where this money is coming from. I remind them it's from a refund. They tell me that it isn't enough and that they need proof. I show them proof. They say it's not enough and I still need to make 3x the monthly rent. By this time i'm just tired of them so I inform them I don't want to lease their anymore. That was 4 days ago. Today they inform me that that's not how leases work and i'm still required to pay. However, I already signed another lease at a different apartment and plan on moving in soon.   So, did I screw myself over or is there anyway to get out of this? I haven't been assigned a room, haven't payed any rent, don't have the means of paying them and feel as if they led me astray. So, advice?	No
So I am divorcing first and foremost as a preface. Awhile back my soon to be ex wife setup her child support from her first child with another man to be deposited in my banking account. I have sole access and rights on this account still. There recently was a large deposit through the state enforcement office of back child support paid out to her that was deposited into my account. I won't go into detail why but am I in a legal state if I refuse to withdraw and give this money over to her? Yes it sounds scummy but I have my reasons. I just wanted to ask. Thank you in advance.	No
"Not sure if this is the right place to post... if not, please let me know where's the best place to ask this.  So I convinced my travel buddy to apply for global entry so I wouldn't have to wait for her during security and customs. She went through the online application, and was conditionally approved. During the interview, they asked her if she had ever been arrested - and she answered truthfully. She was arrested over 30 years ago for shoplifting as a teenager, but the charges were dropped. They then told her that she was denied due to her ""criminal history."" Is there anything she can do?   I've read online where the decision can be appealed. Any advice on what to say or do?   Thanks in advance!"	No
I work as a waiter in Pembroke Pines, Florida, where minimum wage for someone in my profession is $5.08. My paychecks have been about $35-$40 dollars and i'm definitely working more than 8 hours. I know that if an employee doesn't meet the hourly mark in declared tips  the company makes up the difference. But does it work the other way around? if i'm declaring tips which reach or exceed the appropriate hourly mark are they allowed to cut into my hourly paycheck and give me less than $5?	No

We moved into a pet friendly community recently. We were shown a model unit before signing the lease, so we didn't get to see the actual place we were going to move into. In our lease, it states that the landlady has the right to show the tenant's apartment to prospective signers, but when we asked about seeing the place, we were denied. They justified it by saying that only applies to some of their properties. They promised that the place would be cleaned before we moved in and that it would be like new. They even said they would replace the carpets! (But only if they were in need of repair.)   We had just dealt with our last place not being given to us after signing, (current tenant wouldn't move out) and our current lease was non-renewable at this point, so we were running out of time quickly. (We live in a college town.) We signed the lease since we liked the size and price, and hoped for the best.  Now we're moved in and it's fucking miserable. There's dirt and pet hair collecting in every corner of the carpets and it's causing my husband unbearable allergies. We asked if the last tenants had pets, and were told no. Bullshit. I realize that we could fight to get the carpets replaced, but I don't have faith in these people anymore. We just want to get out and search for a non pet friendly place. We would've done that in the first place had we known how bad the allergic reaction would be.   TL;DR: Landlady wouldn't show us the apartment despite her ability to do so as stated in our lease, but we were promised a clean apartment. Now we're moved in and it's a shit hole. Can I back out?	No
My roommate recently got an Amazon Echo home system, which has an always-on, always transmitting microphone. I do not want anything with an always-on microphone in my home; can I force them not to set it up? I own the house, they rent a bedroom from me.	No
Sorry for the long title, I called my dad who is the owner of the property and since I have shit service where I live it dropped, so I gave them his number and then they just left and never called him back. I have tried looking their numbers to people that I think are related, but no one answers. Can I just untie their boat and let it drift away or should I do something else?	No
"We live in Missouri in Saint Louis County. We moved in on Oct. 1, 2015 and signed a typical 12-month lease agreement. When our lease was up again in 2016, we asked to renew for another 12 months with plenty of notice. Logic would tell you that it totals to 24 months and our lease would be up on Sep. 30, 2017. Right? Not according to our landlord.  He said, ""Because the lease started on Oct. 1 and ran for 12 months, it was effective until Oct. 1 the following year. You lived there under the first lease until Oct. 31. I re-upped your new lease for another 12 months and it started Nov. 1, 2016 and ends Nov 30, 2017.""  Me: ""That can't be right. How do two consecutive 12-month leases equate to 26 months total?""  Landlord: ""The agreement stands. Will you be paying me for November or not? I will allow you to move out early if you want.""  And the truly terrifying part? Our landlord is a prosecuting attorney who's tried over 30 jury cases. What gives? Shouldn't he know how to count to 12? Are we just dumb?  Because we didn't catch the change of date in the second lease and we signed it, we understand we're legally liable to pay him through the end of October. But we shouldn't have to pay for November as well. If we don't, he will definitely withhold our deposit could potentially take us to court. With our first child due in December and a pending mortgage, this really sucks. He won't even talk to us on the phone after many polite texts and my insistence that it's a simple misunderstanding.  Any advice?"	No
"Hey guys, I'm a bit stuck right now. I got a message from a woman who claims to have my fiance's kid. They had talked years ago about the baby, and his mom told her she would pay for a paternity test; she saw it and ignored, then waited until the day before he left for basic to reach out again. His mom and the girl argued, then the girl ended up blocking her after saying military men do not make good fathers and she doesn't want him in the child's life, she just wants the child support.  So, fast forward to where we are now: two years have passed, and she just messages me out of the blue saying she wants to take legal action for sole custody and to get a paternity test, so she can get child support.  His name is not on any documents, or the birth certificate. Also, he has texts where she admits she essentially raped him. At a party while he was passed out, she ""went for a ride.""   He think she's just playing games again, and he recalls her doing the same thing to another man - trying to get child support from him.   Any advice? I'm super stressed about this. Can someone explain to me how the child support and paternity works? How does he sign over his rights? He said he would want to do that if it came to it.   We are in Missouri, she lives in another state but had the baby here."	No
Hi Everyone,  This is our first time renting a apartment so I am looking for advice in my situation.  So ever since we moved into the apartment 4 months ago, my brother and I have been having health issues. My landlord lives right below us and we've been complaining to him about health issues living here.  We noticed that our health symptoms only come up in our apartment and they don't surface when we are located somewhere else.  We spent tons of money trying to solve the issue. We bought a $300 air purifier, humidifier and anything you can think of.   Our gas bill was ranging from $150-200 as well which raised suspicion and we've alerted our landlord 3 months ago that there is probably a gas leak or something.  They've taken ZERO action on addressing the issue. It wasn't until we personally contacted and got someone from the gas company(national grid) to take a look until they've confirmed that there are 4 different gas leaks in the basement. Furthermore we also found that there was a gas leak leading up to our apartment as well.  Our landlord paid and got a plumber to seal the leak and solved the issue.  Over the course of 4 months living here my brother and I had  -nose bleeds  -nausea  -headaches  -inability to breathe(stuffed nose)  -insomnia  all of these symptoms on a regular basis.   What are my choices here? They sealed the gas leak so everything should be fine.... but they lack the responsibility of being a landlord. I shouldn't have to personally go out of my way and spending my money to figure out that there was a gas leak in the apartment. I am on the lease for 11 months as well.   I am hesitant on breaking it since the broker fee costed me quite a bit of money and it would be expensive for me to pay the brokers fee again.  I am also paying $2200 per month for rent as well.  What are my actions for recourse? Can I get a compensation for all of the damages that the landlord caused to my health? I've also spent a lot of money and time on air purifiers, equipments and medicine as well trying to solve the issue.  Thank you for everyone's time, I hope no one would have to go through this.	No

"My 3 roommates and I just moved into a new house. Let's call my them Aaron, Adam, and Matt.   Aaron and Adam found the house. It fit all the criteria and after seeing the place with the landlord they told her that we're 4 room mates. She didn't like this and said the house is for 3 people to live in. It's practically 4 bedroom and 1500 square feet so it made no sense. They said okay thanks but we will keep looking.   Later the landlord calls back Aaron and they talk more about the 4 room mate situation. Aaron tells the landlord that Matt is just a guest and not really a ""roommate"". This part was true. He moved in with us at our old house and was staying as a guest but it looked like he'd move in full time (as the new house was bigger). Lease is signed. Three of us signed the lease (not including Matt).   After moving in this weekend the land lord is saying that she wants a written document with the guest's SSN &amp; the exact date he will leave with all of us signing it. If we fail to do so she said she will use it as grounds to evict. No where on the lease does it say anything about 4 people not being allowed to live in the house. Quite honestly two of the bedrooms are big enough for 2 people to share (for a total of 6). No idea why she's doing this. I should mention that one of the bedrooms is actually a family room but has a separate door and is private. It can be used as a bedroom. She verbally expressed to Aaron and Adam when they were looking at the house that she wouldn't like it to be used as a bedroom. Does she even get a say in this? I'll sleep in the kitchen and cook in the bathroom if I want can't I?  I'm not in love with the house but moving is such a hassle that I do not want to deal with it again. What should we do? Should we write up a document as she requested? Or just not contact her? Is she allowed to come and inspect to see who's living where and how many people? Any help is appreciated!"	No
"My wife and I are both residents of Indiana. I've been split with my wife for 9 months - not legally, just physically. We are still married. We moved into our own separate apartments and split all time and expenses with our child 50/50. She continually led me to believe that she didn't want child support or full custody - which I figured was a lie, but I really hoped for the best. In the last couple months I paid off the family car (2010, in my name) with the entirety of our tax refund and some of my own money, knowing and communicating that I planned on giving it to her. I've also sent unofficial 'child support' to her since I'm not there to split our son and his expenses 50/50. For many of those months I also paid her car insurance, and I've always paid half the babysitter bill.   When I'm at home I teach, and my margins are so small budget wise I can't afford to pay her a big child support payment after the divorce. I'm only able to afford it now because I'm making two incomes - my summer teaching check and my active duty money from the National Guard (my second job, I'm in MO at a branch schoolhouse).   She now tells me that she does want physical custody and child support, but our son will still be split 50/50 in whats called ""parenting time"". Her rich uncle has gotten her a lawyer and she filed right before I came here. It can't go through until I go home and take a mandatory children/divorce parenting class. I also am not home to be served officially/through certified mail (is my understanding)  My questions:    Does anyone know of an accurate child support calculator, or an idea of what I'd be paying if I lose custody but have 50/50 parenting time? I already have two jobs - she doesn't even work full time. Will the judge care? From what I've seen that doesn't matter - just the fact that she's making less than me is going to jack my bill up.   Are any of her text messages admissible in court?   What rights do I have to the vehicle? She is driving it and has the keys but I have the title in my name. Can I have it towed and scrapped? Would her lawyer sue me? Could the judge give her my car - the one I have in Missouri, even though that's in my name too (and that one's not paid off - would I have to give it to her AND pay it off?) Could I pay it off, put it in a friend's name and continue driving it? Could a judge touch that?  I know I sound vindictive - but I paid to put this woman through college, made endless efforts to get out marriage to work, was treated like absolute crap for a very very long time, have been lied to so many times, and now she wants to take my son too, and have me pay her, when I am a good dad, and she knows it.  I just got done taking her name off my insurance bill - what can I do about the vehicle, and what should I anticipate about child support?  Hopefully you guys are willing to help. Thanks for reading."	No
"I'll try to make this as in a nutshell as possible, and be watching the comments for any questions needing more information. Grandparent's left will for all belongings to go to my father. Uncle rarely ever visited them. Grandfather passed about 3 months ago. Uncle for whatever reason is executor of the estate. Grandmother has hardcore alzheimer's, is in bad shape (bed sore, can't feed herself) and staying at uncle's personal care home.  Uncle wants to keep her away from hospice cause ""feels like she has a while more to live"" -his words. He is getting paid any money she gets from herself and my grandfather's pension, including he stated another $1K per month for her to stay at his home. He plans on selling my grandparent's estate in order to pay for the cost of her staying there.... AKA he will get everything in cash from my father when in reality nothing was left to him. Father said he doesn't have enough cash to hire a lawyer currently, though I feel as if he's milking the estate he should be reported to having my Grandmother still at his home since she should not at all be at a care home and needs to if so be in actually nursing home with actual nurses. The care home is all run by my Uncle's side of the family.   Any advice here would be wonderful as no clue where to start calling or looking for help on this matter. My father wanted my grandparent's house to move into and didn't want to have to sell everything especially the house for my Uncle to end up taking everything when he's never been around for years. (Plus Uncle came into the house today taking bags of stuff, didn't tell us he was going or what he took, as my father installed cameras around the property).  Also, this is just outside Pittsburgh if that helps with any information on who I would contact on any of this. Thank you guys again for your time. I lurk a lot but really needed advice this time myself."	No
So I lived with a roommate who refused to pay the last month of rent and to avoid it showing up on our credit, my girlfriend and I paid it. Obviously, I am less then pleased with him. However, lo and behold he must not have provided a forwarding address, as we just got all three shares of the down payment. Now, the return we got was about 1000 which splits evenly. The share of rent was 343 plus the 50 dollar late fee he caused. Now, my thinking is, fuck him, that's essentially the exact value I am owed. What kind of repercussions could I be looking at if I just take it?	No
The lease started the very day I happened into what would be the perfect situation for my family, which was fully unexpected.  The lease states they require 60 days of intent to vacate at the end of the lease, and if this is not received, a new year long lease will automatically renew.  They slipped a note under my door two months ago.  I didn't sign anything but the original lease that states this will occur.  One extra bit of info - my original lease was set to expire on Nov 1st, 2016.  When it did, I asked that my next lease end in 9 months rather than 1 year, so that my moving day would be in the summer (as I anticipated an eventual move and this would be better with school).  So my lease *actually* would have ended exactly when I needed it to.  Sigh.  I never technically signed off on this, but the auto-renewal notice did say that the lease would end on August 1st.  The company has been good landlords, and I don't want to screw them over, but this is an extremely good opportunity for my son and me, and I can't let it go without trying my best.  I'm actively seeking another tenant to take my place.  But I'm curious as to what would happen if I cannot find someone and I wanted to break the lease - are those actually the only reasons one can break the lease, or is there some other loophole?	No
So I recently moved into an apartment and I don't feel as though its clean enough. I've come across dead bugs, alive bugs, dust, and mildew in my AC. I've submitted maintenance requests for them and am waiting for the reply. Should I ask for professional cleaning to be done? Upon moving in, I was never shown the apartment, which is bad on my part because I should've asked. Instead, I was shown a beautiful model of what my place would look like and when move in Day came it looked totally different. I'm not sure what to do about this. [dirty apartment](https://imgur.com/gallery/OVzPT)  There are pee stains on the side of the kitchen table, cracks in the corners of the walls, dust everywhere, stains under the cabinets, the toilet bottom of the toilet looks hideous. I asked if maintenance could take care of the decaying floor board behind the toilet, and they just covered it up with a new one. I feel as though I've been cheated and locked into a lease. Thank you	No
"Hello,  Started a new job recently at a restaurant in a busy neighborhood. Not sure on the specifics  of the restaurants income. I worked 50+ (more like 50.5-52.0 hours) on the first week of my work week. I approached my employer after I got my check and my shift was done and asked if I was owed OT for the week I worked 50 hours. My employer said OT is only required for 80+ hours in a TWO week period. I pointed out I had worked 81.80 hours in my pay period and didn't receive 1.80 hours of OT if that was in fact the case. I also told him all of my previous jobs, which admittedly have been big business/corporate (compared to this family owned business) have paid me OT after 40 hours in one week. He gave me a run around and I pretty much got no where with him.  1). Is this legal in MN? Seems MN law dictates OT can only be applied after 48 hours in a 7day period, which still at MINIMUM (correct if wrong) would me I owuld have 2ish hoours of OT.  2).

Hi, thanks for taking the time to read this! Okay, let me explain the situation to you. When I was born my mother groggily signed my birth certificate and misspelt one letter of my last name. Apparently this went by unnoticed until now, but that's a different story. Anyways, I'm 19 now and I would like to correct my name. My misspelt name shows up in my social security card as well. I was wondering what steps I could take to correct this. I live in Kansas but I was born in Missouri, would I have to change it in the state I was born in?   Thank you and sorry for any mistakes. I'm new to Reddit :)	No

I am renting a guest house unit (a large room detached from the house and attached to a garage) in California and noticed that it doesn't have smoke detectors/fire alarms at all. I brought this up to the landlord and he said that they will not install one since there is no kitchen in the room and therefore it isn't necessary. This doesn't make any sense to me. There's a reason that bedrooms and hallways have smoke detectors too. I'm considering buying my own smoke detector but feel that I shouldn't have to. There is also no fire extinguisher in my new place. What can I do?    Thanks in advance!	No
"Well to put it simply my roommates called the sheriffs office on me? They said i wasn't a legal resident and screamed at me and when i tried to go into my room they pushed the door open and yelled at me some more. but yea i've been living here for over 3 months and have been paying 500 dollars a month for half a room i wasn't late or behind on the utilitys they ""the three gay roommates that all have sex together"" decided they didnt want me there any more and said they wanted me gone by the first of the month. the current situation is that they called the sheriff to have me kicked out right now and i know that i am a legal resident and i have pay stubs with this address and my name on them going back months. so im wondering if ill be okay if the police actually arrive and what to say to them."

I'm moving out of the US and from what I understand, should have a POA to act on my behalf if needed with regard to banking, taxes, etc. I have a sibling in MI and a friend in FL that I would like to give independent POA. Obviously they can't sign one form at the same time in front of witnesses and a notary. Is it okay if I create two separate forms as long as I reference the other POA on it? Thanks in advance.	No

"I notified my landlord of a possible bed bug infestation in my room on Tuesday. Today he told me that an exterminator that he contacted said that the bed bugs were brought in via a suitcase or furniture, and therefore were my problem to solve.  I have been getting bites that resemble bed bug bites, but I have not found any physical bugs or eggs. So far I have taken normal precautions such as vacuuming, bagging and washing of all clothes and bedding, applying OTC bed bug spray as well as a mattress bag intended to trap and kill bed bugs. But because I have bites and not my 2 roommates, he says it confirms that I brought them in.  According to the last paragraph on this website from North Penn Legal, there is an implied ""warranty of habitability"" law in PA, which requires landlords to pay for bed bug extermination.  http://www.northpennlegal.org/sites/www.northpennlegal.org/files/NPLS%20Bed%20Bug%20Flyer.pdf  In the addendum section of my lease it states: ""Landlord will pay for any necessary pest extermination during the first 30 days of this lease. Thereafter, it shall be tenants responsibility to pay for any necessary interior or exterior pest extermination.""   Does this absolve him from any legal obligation to pay for an exterminator? or is he still liable through the warranty of habitability law?  Please and thank you for any advice!!!"	No
"Background: I'm building a prototype of a sustainable home and purchased a parcel of land, not knowing at the time what CC&amp;Rs were. I'm fine to proceed at the state/county level, but would be violating CC&amp;Rs, which say  &gt; DWELLINGS: All dwellings shall have at least 1,200 square feet of living area, not including garages, porches, patios, and guest houses...  To avoid starting from scratch and because I like the location, I'm willing to make some sacrifices. My idea is to permit, build, and use it as a workshop. I would sleep somewhere else and just use it during waking hours. Would this allow me to get around the definition of ""dwelling""? Additionally, other than electricity, lighting, and a toilet, it would not have any of the amenities of a typical dwelling. (Bed/showers/kitchen in an RV or communal/commercial building not on the property).  It'd fit the CC&amp;Rs guidelines for Guest Houses and/or ""additional structures"". My concern is that I may not be able to claim it's a ""guest"" or ""additional"" building if I don't have a ""main"" home."	No
"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	No
Our original move in date was August 4. We signed a lease for this. The lease was then voided and we resigned the most current lease to move in on August 1. We went in this morning to get our keys and discussed the money that was due. We wrote them a check for the money due and started moving in. Now they are emailing us and saying that what they accidentally charged us was the prorated rate as if we moved in on August 4, and that we owe them a little over $100 to cover August 1 to August 4. Are we responsible for their accounting error? Thanks!	No
I am a 20 year old living at home in Wisconsin with my mother, younger siblings, dog, and my mother's ex-fiancee. They have had a falling out he is threatening to kick me out. Due to my mother's plan to leave him (violent temper and alcoholism)she left herself off of the paperwork for the house they purchased together a few years ago, on the taxes this most recent year. However per him not my mother I was to be charged rent at the beginning of each month. Since I am paying rent can I be forced to vacate immediately?	No
So here's my deal: I live in Los Angeles. About last November I was looking for a new place to move into. A friend told me about two friends of hers who were looking for a roommate. Rent's $350/mo. Cool, right? I move in, no lease, mo-mo, no contract, but I pay a $210 deposit. (If I got a receipt at the time it's gone now.) Well this place was alright (except for the cockroach infestation) and these two fellas seemed ok at first.. but they're both actors and one has a hot head because he looks like Thor. If Thor was a total tool. As the weather started to get warmer (I'm talking like low 70s here) I open the windows to let a nice, cool breeze in. Apparently my roommates were allergic to fresh air and wanted the windows to be closed at all times and have the a/c running 24/7. We didn't pay any utilities so they could care less about what it cost to run it. The bathroom smelled like mildew and there was black mold on the windows when I moved in (I took care of that, as well as a large part of the cockroach infestation.(Endorsement: Check out Advion Bait syringes👌)) So I keep the bathroom window open to air it out. By and by these guys kick me out because I won't keep the windows shut (I think I bruised Thor's ego because he's used to getting his way.) Anyway, I'm told I'll get my deposit back when someone else moves in (smells like BS). I say screw it and go on my merry way. A month later (a few days ago now) I text Thor telling him that I need my deposit. He says tough luck, claiming there are damages (a lie. I did nothing but improve that place.) By CA state law, any deductions from the deposit must be taken out within 21 days of a tenant having moved out, and an itemized list of said damages along with the (reasonable) costs. I never heard anything from my old roommate until I texted him and he refused to return my deposit. In that sense, I have the upper hand..however, I have no contract. No receipt of a deposit (only a PayPal transaction for an amount greater than the deposit), no hard evidence except my recent texts and the check images and deductions from my bank account over the course of my having lived at that apartment. So I sent Thor a request for Deposit Return letter and my next step would be to take this to small claims court..but is it worth it? Do I have a leg to stand on or would it be a waste of time and money?  I only have texts and my check images and PayPal statements directed to him. I don't have a written contract or receipt of deposit, etc.  Should I just accept that there are unscrupulous douches out there and I'm a victim of theft, or is there a way I can fight this? Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice!	No
In order to fully understand the level of confidence I have in the opinion that my daughter is being abused psychologically would take a very long time. I will give the highlights.  My ex and I got divorced due to deployment related stress in 2010 when my daughter was 2. She moved back and forth between TN and NE during my deployments and eventually, after the divorce, she settled back in NE because of better schools and better standard of living (Omaha vs Memphis).  During the time that she lived in NE, I was unable to see my daughter frequently both due to a refusal to cooperate from my ex and my continuing deployments.  I got out of the military and hoped it would be a good opportunity for me to make up with lost time, but I was met with the same lack of cooperation as before so I really only saw my daughter a couple times a year (always only at her mom's house).  I filed for a custody hearing, my ex never responded to the notification so we had the sheriff's office serve her. The day after we got our receipt of service, she moved to TN.  Since the proceedings, the lack of cooperation because a full force of loathing and spitefulness from her. Her dad wanted to fight me in front of my daughter and told me I wasn't allowed on his property. My ex has sworn at me and called me things like an asshole in front of my daughter. My ex's mom has said, in front of my daughter, that I abandoned her.  After many proceedings and a trial-style hearing on the record I was able to secure some visitation times including the school vacations. I was so excited to get her for the very first extended period since she was 2 years old, now she's 8. That excitement and blissfulness of being with my daughter is now accompanied with total anxiety.  My ex got our daughter a phone, she said that she's supposed to have to have the phone on her at all times both in TN and in NE, but I have a lot of evidence suggesting that she doesn't get her phone in TN (i.e. a complete wipe of my text messages and phone calls from her phone when she showed up here this summer).  Through conversation it is fairly obvious that my daughter has been coached about a lot of this stuff with the phone (i.e. how to always keep location on, to call her mom every morning and every night, and not letting me or my wife see the phone as well as password protecting it).  All things considered, it was really easy to get access to my 8 year old daughter's phone and the things that have been going on this summer are startling.  My ex has interrogated her nightly about her situation and what me and my wife do, more so than asking about what all she's been doing and if she's having fun or not.  She has consistently thrown shade on me over and over, though that is to be expected I guess. I am the type that tells the truth to my daughter unless it could negatively impact their relationship, I'm not about that bullshit shade-throwing.  She told my daughter only to speak to her when she can be away from me and my wife and is always asking if either one of us have had access to her phone.  In the last few weeks my daughter has really warmed up to being here and has put her phone on the back-burner most of the time. She's fucking 8 years old and she doesn't give a shit about the phone, she just worries that she's going to be in trouble if she doesn't keep it on her (she's told me so).  During those few weeks she has been unresponsive at times that she's having a sleepover or she left her phone at home. On nights that she doesn't respond, my ex is very harsh.  During a vacation to Texas my daughter left her phone in the car overnight. The next morning, my ex had sent her a text before she went to work saying that she was up all night crying and didn't get any sleep because she didn't hear from her.  Tonight, she threatened to call the cops because she wasn't responding and had her FBI ex-boyfriend blowing up her phone as well.  1) I have all of these things from her phone backed up, but I don't own the phone. The communications are taking place in my house and concern my child. Is that information admissible in an informal hearing setting... I know that if I were able to subpoena the records from the phone company that would be admissible during a trial, I just want to know if I'm going to be breaching any privacy laws by having the information (hence the throwaway).  2)I'm legitimately freaked out about what my daughter is going through, what the fuck can I do to stop it?  Thanks for the help.	No
My ex and I have 50/50 custody. We both have to agree on anything related to education or else take it to mediation. Our kids go to private school. He has remarried and now has 2 step kids. He recently was fired. Our divorce paperwork stipulates that our children will attend X school. He said he cannot afford to send them there since he lost his job. I told him I would pay for X school. He said no and that he intends to enroll them in school in his district regardless of what the court order says. He said he wants both our kids and his step kids in the same school, and since he can't afford tuition for step kids, all of the children will go to the school in his district. Can he be held in contempt? Will a judge allow them to be pulled out of X school to keep our kids in the same school as his step kids? HELP!	No
I was in a car accident and the other driver was at fault. The car was totaled and my insurance is paying ~$6,000 for it and I still owe ~$7,000. I have GAP insurance so that should cover the rest of what I owe, and the insurance said the other guy's insurance will cover the deductible. I have no help for getting a new car though, can I pursue having the other driver pay for the new car?	No
We have had water damage in our bathroom ceiling for over two weeks and I have contacted the landlord once via text and once via a letter. when we texted she said she would send someone but never did, and she has not responded to my letter yet, although its only been two days. We have been planning to move soon (which the landlord knows), but now we are considering leaving at the end of the month and forfeiting our security deposit.the problem is that seems wrong to me because it feels like we are legally in the right. I have looked at the RTA but I still do not know the legality of leaving or how long she has to fix something like water damage. any legal help is appreciated as I do not know how to proceed and I am worried she will come after us for rent if we bail without giving a months notice.	No
I requested to use my PTO and sick days instead of short term disability or FMLA after I give birth in a month because I will need to take FMLA later in the year when I will have no family help and therefore need to be at home.  My employer says they have never had this type of request before (taking PTO instead of FMLA) and that they will dock my vacation days since I do not want to take FMLA at this time.  Is this OK to do? I know they can't legally dock my sick time as per NY law you are required to provide 40 hours of sick time but is it OK for them to dock the vacation time they provided me as well?  Seems weird.  My husband is taking parental leave from his company and he gets to take his full PTO (his is accrued). My PTO is not accrued, I get it the first day of the year.	No
"Hey there! Throwaway, of course, because little bro reddits and I'm not giving up my real account. (Hi, D!)   I own my own home in small town Virginia and I've got a big problem with a neighbor who is renting the property next door.   A little backstory. We bought this place about a year ago and met the neighbors soon after. One side is a lovely young lady who works in some government capacity and is never home. The best neighbor. The other side, though, is quickly becoming a nightmare. Nightmare lady is home all the time. Her husband is a trucker who is gone for weeks at a time. I've met him a handful of times and he seems...off. I witnessed her lying right in front of him and he just puts on a shit eating grin and nods along. Whatever. So it's her that I'm dealing with. Her and her dog.  When we first met her, she seemed pleasant enough. A little more talkative than I'd be with someone I just met but whatever. (This has now turned into hours-at-a-time instances of listening to her rant about people stealing things out of her yard, conspiracy theories, her self-diagnoses of many different mental illnesses, her Christianity, how she's not afraid of anyone because she has a gun, and her landlord.) Her dog is friendly enough, but it's now constantly coming into our yard as soon as we come outside. The dog is enormous, smells awful, has fleas, and doesn't know to not jump on people. We've talked to her over and over about not letting the dog over.   Things are starting to become more shitty.   She asked us once about taking a bit of wire off of the old fence between the properties for an art project. We said okay, and now there's a huge hole where her dog comes over. Not cool. We've now had fleas brought inside the house and have spent additional $$$ treating our house and our three cats.   Two weeks ago she spent four hours outside our living room windows, grunting and talking to herself. We paid no attention. The next day, she banged on the door and insisted that we come outside because she had something to show us. She'd cleaned out an entire flower bed - weeds and planted stuff - and then said ""I was thinking about planting something there"". That was our flowerbed. It's right up against the house.  I stammered out a ""Uh, thanks, but please don't do that again. We actually have lawn care that comes and takes care of that stuff. And no, we don't want you planting things there."" That same day, she also asked if she could mix up some extra cement she had laying around and cement our mailbox in. I told her ""No...it's a temporary mailbox until I find one that I really like. That's why it's not cemented in."" I've told her this before. This is when she walked me down there and said she'd ""just noticed"" that the mailbox was hanging off of the post and that the door wasn't closing. WTF? We'd gotten the mail that afternoon and it wasn't like that. She has a history of ruining things so that she can fix them in the way that she likes. I don't have proof, of course, but I strongly suspect she did the damage.  A week later, I come home from running errands and she's cleaned out the second flower bed on the same side of the house, and was hacking at/removing the tree roots of one of my trees. She claims she was tripping on it. (She wouldn't trip on it if she stayed out of my yard...). I was aghast! I don't know much about trees, but I'm pretty sure that hacking out the roots causes...death? Again, I said that wasn't asked for and I didn't want them touching that tree. Her husband said something about not touching it, because I'd notice a chainsaw if he was and that the tree was diseased and needed to come down. They've been after me since we moved in to pay for a survey, put up a fence ON the line (as opposed to offset on our side), tear down the row of trees, and they've graciously offered to pay for half of the fence so long as it's a ""ranch style barb wired fence"". Um, no.   This woman has come over in a panic because she swears people are stealing bolts out of her lawn equipment, stalking her from across the street, prancing around in her backyard ""meowing"" at her to ""lure"" her back there. She corners my kids and tells them how she's OCD, NPD, ADD, and ""in general mentally ill"". No shit. Honestly, I think she might be a paranoid schizophrenic.   She's now threatening/suggesting that she'd like to come over and fill in some of the masonry on my house. I've told her emphatically ""NO"" but I don't trust that she won't. I have outside cameras ordered. I have pictures taken of the outside of the house, especially on the side next to hers. I have multiple calls out to surveyors for someone to come ASAP and find my property markers so I can literally mark the boundaries. The town manager is calling me on Monday to let me know if a privacy fence can be put up. I have plans to speak to her landlord first thing on Monday and if she touches anything this weekend, as I fear, I will be calling the town police.   My thoughts so far are to go through both the town police and the landlord. Reporting any trespassing and dog issues to the police, while sending a courtesy letter to the landlord at the same time. My hope is that the landlord gives them 30 days to find someplace else.   Guys, what else can I do? A ""No Trespassing"" sign? Should I speak to her landlord in person, or just mail them a letter as a ""courtesy"" before speaking to the police? Should I mention to the landlord my concerns about her mental health? How can I avoid a legal battle? For those of you here who are landlords, what could I say (truthfully) about this situation that would make you want to end your month-to-month lease with a tenant like this? What should I do about the tree?  Thanks!"	No
My landlord informed me today that she was planning to raise my rent from $1100 to $1200 starting on August 1, 2017. However, I have a signed lease the explicitly states the rent is $1100, and the term of the lease is from January 1, 2017 to January 1, 2018. As far as I can tell, there is no provision in the lease that states she can raise the rent at random.   My question is, can she legally raise my rent even though the lease states the rent amount? Also, can I legally refuse to pay the rent increase and continue to pay the rent as stated in the lease? Will I be protected from any retaliation from her if I refuse to pay the increase? She has shown herself to be mentally unstable at times,v and I wouldn't put it past her to negatively affect my life. Also, was it when legal for her to inform me of the rent increase with only 10 days notice?   I live in New York City, in case my location needs to be known for the appropriate laws. I appreciate any help anyone can provide.	No
We are in Ontario Canada and have been looking at places in Toronto, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario.  We signed one buyers representation agreement with an agent in the Toronto area when we were looking to lease a place in Toronto. We just moved to Toronto on July 1st and ended up finding a place without the agent.  The agent marked on file that he is helping us out for the Toronto central, east and west area. He says he only works in the Toronto area and Windsor is about 4 to 5 hours drive away.  In Windsor we are signing with another agent and purchased offer was accepted yesterday evening.  Today we are planning to send acknowledgment forms, sign buyer representation with the Windsor agent and so on.  I am wondering if there will be any problem with the previous agent trying to take the new ones commission or anything.  Any info helps!   ** TL;DR: Signing buyers representation with two different agents in two two different cities about 4 to 5 hours away from each other.  Neither of them work in the others duristiction but are in the same province. Any problems here?  **	No

Hello!   My wife and I have been married almost 1 year, but together for 5 years. We have had our 6 year old living with us since she was 1. It was established verbally that her father has seen her every other weekend and paying 500$ a month for child support. For years and years he never really paid consistent child support or was there emotionally there for her. We have done completely everything and she is everything to us. In the  past 6 months he has paid 200$ of child support so he told us about his financial troubles about his car getting reposed and he asked me to adopt his child. I knew this was an easy way for him to get out of child support but I didn't hesitate to look it the process of adoption, but 2 weeks later he changed his mind. We decided to submit to the state that we would like to establish child support so he has to pay through the state. It seems like since he found out about this he has now served us papers so he can have split custody. I work on base and am going to talk to the JAG and hire an attorney, because we don't want to risk anything. We have text messages talking about the adoption, to his financial troubles. My wife is bipolar and he used her illness in the papers saying she is not stable enough to raise children, and he also stated that we are withholding his daughter from him. Her illness is managed completely and we felt like it was a low ball. We have a house on 4 acres of land and he lives with his girlfriend in an apartment. He has never taken her to school or taken her to a doctors appointment.  We live in the state of Washington and I am active duty in the United States Air Force. Sorry if anything is difficult to read as I am just recently transitioning from graveyard work.	No
I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up. He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.  Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car. He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point... I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt. I also have a text message from a couple weeks ago where he threatens to fight me if I ever talk to him or if he sees me with the girl he was dating (neither of these things have happened but it is still a credible threat).  I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor. I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes. Will they take me in for my warrant? Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted? Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order? Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing. I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.  My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school. Is this a good plan?  Thank you	No
I'm just curious if I have any recourse against them. They charged me for blind replacement (cited reason was broken) and i know for a fact it wasn't broken because I never once opened my window or touched my blinds. Do I have any recourse? Anything I could throw at them to make them prove that the stuff was broken before charging me for it? I know it's a long shot but they're trying to rape me for ever dollar I have it seems like and I don't have much. I was very meticulous and diligent about cleaning and checking everything when I left. Nothing was broken and everything was clean. 	No
"So, I was made aware the landlord was putting the condo into foreclosure only recently.  I spoke with her about it and renewed our lease agreement for a two year contract prior to when the condo went up for bid with the city.  It was my understanding that whoever would be taking over would not be able to break my current lease agreement, so long as I continue to make payments.  But having received this notice from a new realtor stating they are taking over and are my new point of contact and are looking to offer financial relocation assistance to make my ""transition out of the property as smooth as possible  and avoid the eviction process"".  Should I be concerned?  Can anyone advise what I can expect when I reach out to find out exactly what this offer is?  Also, could there be any chance of them allowing me to continue as tenant?  I would expect a rent increase but is this something possible?  One thing of note, I have PTSD, severe social anxiety, and agoraphobia.  I'm actually seeing my therapist next week and with this occurring, I have to ask, the place I'm at I feel safe, and have built a comfort level with the people in the small building.  As well, the small community allows me to feel safe and I'm working on getting out more.  I have a dog, that I got on my own, it's not an emotional therapy dog that was assigned to me, but she has and is helping me through a lot of the social and agoraphobic issues.  So with that, would this be... as a last resort, as I don't like to use my bullshit issues I have to deal with as a crutch, I prefer to fix shit with out bringing up my problems, but I feel this time it's certainly necessary as I was in an extremely bad place just 6 months ago and I don't want to fall back.  So could a medical option also be looked at into why I shouldn't be forced to leave?  I'm not looking at not paying my rent or anything like that.  I just don't want to leave the setup I have as I feel safe and moving would throw my whole system and emotional setup off.  Any advice or information would be greatly appreciated."	No
"So as the story goes my wife and I start looking for a house and after a few months we find one with the help of our  Real estate agent (Brian).  The wife and I decided to put an offer in on the house at $390,000 with the condition of a home inspection.  The sellers of the house get back to us and agreed to our offer!!!  After the home inspection was completed it came to light there were a few issues with the house (mould) but nothing that was a deal breaker. As the wife and I talked about the house we decided that we would alter our offer and that's where Brian comes in.   We still liked the house, the problem was we wanted the mould gone, so we wanted to alter our purchase price so we would have money to fix the issues. So we sat down with Brian and told him that we thought about offering $370,000 that way we would have money left over from the down payment to pay for the renos. His response was that the sellers were not going to accept the offer, but suggested something totally different. He suggested that we keep our offer at $390,000 but request a cheque of $5,000 on the day of signing to be issued to us from the sellers, so we can fix the mould when we move in.  To us that sounded great, because we didn't want to lose the house, so we sent off the new paperwork to the sellers.   The sellers then contact Brian and tell him that they want $390,000 and the cheque to be $3,500 instead off $5,000. We stand by our guns and tell Brian that we won't move and the $3,500 won't work for us, we want the full $5,000 or no deal. All the while Brian is trying to convince us that we are going to lose out on the house for a mear $1,500. The sellers get back to us and agree to sell the house at $390,000 with a $5,000 cheque signed over to us on day of closing ........ everyone is happy!!!   So a few days go by and my mortgage broker calls me up needing clarification, she doesn't fully understand what's up with the $5,000 cheque. I explain the situation to her and she tells me that I won't be getting the $5,000 cheque and that it will be going towards the purchase price of the house. She's a  Real estate agent as well as a mortgage broker and says that these types of deals are no longer allowed. So I call up Brian and tell him the situation and his response was ""that's not my problem"" and won't accept any responsibility.   The next day I go into Brian's office ( royal le page) and talk to the manager. The manager says that no one in the office was aware that they had changed the regulations, but at least I was getting $5,000 off the asking price. I explain that's not the deal we made, I wanted the cheque not $5,000 off the asking price. He's said they would look into it and get back to me that night.   Brian's manager doesn't call back and it's getting late so I call him.  Essentially he tells me there's nothing they can do, and I shouldn't be upset cause I'm getting $5,000 off the 390,000. Then proceeds to tell me that I will have to  amend the agreement to $385,000 and remove the $5,000 cheque or my mortgage broker won't be able to get me a mortgage. I tell him that's not happening cause then I would be letting them off the hook. I call the mortgage broker and she says that not the case at all the mortgage will go through but I won't be getting the cheque, that's going to the lender.    Now I'm here looking for help!!!!  The difference between 390,000 and 385,000 mortgage  a month is about $18, which won't help me fix the mould issues in my house but the $5,000 cheque upfront would have.  This was Brian's idea to do the cash back not ours but now we are stuck buying a house with a deal that we didn't agreed to.   Also, the closing date is in about 4 weeks and we have already sold our house and have to be out around the same time"	No
My ex husband (38) and I (35) included a morality clause in our divorce agreement.  That he nor I should have someone of the opposite sex not related by blood or marriage spending the night when the children are present.  He recently told me that he plans on moving in with his girlfriend (23) of a year this fall.  In fact, they have already been spending the night together when the boys are there on visitation.  I have expressed to him and her how this upsets me and that it goes against our divorce agreement.  I don't have a problem with people in general living together while not married.  I just don't want it around MY children.  We are raising them in Catholic schools and they are taught this is wrong.  What are my legal options?  I can't afford an attorney because we are barely getting by as it is.  This isn't the first time he's broken the divorce agreement.  I feel like I'm being walked all over.  I'm willing to save and try to talk to an attorney but I don't want to waste my time if the clause is not likely to be enforced.	No

I live in St. George, Utah, and got pulled over for speeding. The officer noticed that my airbags had been deployed (because of a crash in the past) and wrote me a citation for failure to repair airbags. I went in to the city building and learned that it would be 500$ for the citation and scheduled a meeting with the judge. The meeting ended up with another court date in August.  Is driving without airbags installed illegal? The citation page sounds like it only applies to a person repairing a vehicle and I was just driving, did the cop fuck me over with the wrong citation?

"I recently moved to Cleveland for 6 months for a training stint with my company. Since my company was paying for my apartment, I had to find a furnished place that included all utilities, cable and internet.   I found a place that had everything I needed and had my company sign the lease. When I moved in I noticed the wifi was very slow. When I brought it up with the landlord, he said it goes up and down because my wifi comes through a booster that relays the wifi from the main house (I'm in an apartment above the garage). A couple weeks later I contacted him again because the internet was still always slow. He then said it was an issue with the ISP's infrastructure and they were paying for best package available so there's nothing they can do.  ""High speed internet"" is specifically listed as something to be provided by the landlord in my lease. The FCC defines high speed internet as 25Mbps and above. When I run speed tests I average 2-3Mbps, never higher than 5Mbps and often below 1Mbps. I don't need 25Mbps but what I'm getting is nowhere near what's expected.  I know this is a ""first world problem"" which is why I'm hesitant to escalate it with him, but it's frustrating not being able to watch netflix, FaceTime my family or watch YouTube without waiting forever for it to load. Even normal webpages takes  much longer than usual to load. It may not be water, heat or electricity, but I think reliable fast internet is fair expectation nowadays, especially when it's agreed upon in the lease.  What are my options?"	No
"I own a condo in Saskatchewan. Recently, I received a ""summer updates"" email from my condo property managers stating that pets are not allowed. This was the first time I had heard of this rule and there is no indication in any of the past 3 years of AGM minutes that a 'no pets rule' had been discussed or voted on by the condo owners to become a bylaw.   The condo I own is occupied by new tenants who have one cat (and now want a second). I have told them not to get a second cat until I figure this out.   I also want to get more information about this new no pets rule/ bylaw from the property managers but I am worried that if I start asking, they will then realize that my tenants have a cat and will take action to have it removed. I really like these tenants and want to keep them happy.   Any advice or thoughts on how to proceed?   Should i just ignore the rule but only let my tenants keep one cat? Should I contact my property managers and potentially point out that I have a cat in my unit while getting more info? Any other ideas?"	No
hey, so to make this a short long story, my father has never paid child support even though my mother had got it in writing what he was supposed to pay (the amount slips my mind as I was 3 when this all happened and I have lost all the paperwork). but as of now I am of age of majority and still wondering if i have any entitlement to that money. I'm also in Canada, British Columbia. So I guess what I'm asking is where I stand with all this in a legal level, what my options are, what kind of lawyer to look into. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this. Will update with any info as needed.	No
I was looking for apartments in the Los Angeles area and found one I liked.  As part of the application process, I was required to deposit one month's rent (roughly $1,500) with the current tenant, who had leased the entire unit and was looking to add a roommate to the lease.  Neither party was particularly experienced with the process, so all I have is an email from the current tenant confirmed that I sent them a deposit for 1 bedroom / bathroom in a 3 ba/3 br unit.  My application was approved by the building management to be added to the lease, but I ended up finding a better housing situation, and so informed the current tenant that I was no longer interested.  Aside from the application, nothing was signed with the building management, and certainly no lease.  The current tenant now refuses to return my deposit on the grounds that it was a holding deposit meant to compensate them for these types of situations.  My position is that, given that this entire process start to end lasted less than 10 days, it's unreasonable to retain an entire month's rent as compensation for this.  Is the current tenant justified in keeping all of my deposit, and, if not, what options do I have for getting it back?	No

Hey! If your reading I thank you so much because I need to clear something up in my mind. So I basically shoplifted a few months ago, at sears (ik it's dumb) in April. The police were called as there're policy states. Anyways the police interviewed me and decided not to charge me. They took my info down (DOB,Adress,name) my concern is whether if it would show up any check for any type of employment in the future for event if they didnt charge me (police encounter)! Am I good?	No
In a nutshell: monthly tenant paid an unofficial security deposit, abruptly decided to move out, now wants it back.  A few years ago Roommate A moved into this 3-bedroom apartment with two other people. They signed a 1-year lease and put down a security deposit in the amount of one month's rent. No new lease was ever signed and eventually the other two original tenants moved out and were replaced by various people throughout the years who never signed anything and paid month to month. I moved in last September and Roommate A said not to worry about a deposit. Roommate B moved in months later and was told the same. Around May one of the original tenants had their car stolen and needed money so A asked us for a deposit. Roommate B gave a month's rent which went to the carless original tenant. I never did, being wary that A might not get the full deposit back.   Roommate A moved out at the end of June. Roommate C is  scheduled to move in in August and when we told the landlord she said she wanted the three of us to sign a new lease and put down a full security deposit. Roommate B gave every indication that he would be signing the lease and staying long term, as he had always intended. On July 11, B announces he had been secretly looking for a new apartment, had just been approved, and would be moving out on August 1st. This put me and Roommate C in a tight spot as we had no idea how the landlord would react or if/how soon we could find a replacement. After a lot of scrambling around we find Roommate D. The landlord approves C and D and tells me I can give the security deposit directly to Roommate A, who only asks for 2/3 of the amount since B had paid in May. B now wants his deposit back.  I'm hoping that because B broke the terms of his implied month-to-month lease by not giving proper notice he has no right to recover any security deposit. Also, his girlfriend has been secretly living here after the landlord clearly said no one could move in short term or without her approval. The landlord indicated to me that technically Roommate A had been liable for the entirety of the original lease and everyone not on it. It seemed that paying him the deposit transferred the liability to me, C, and D. If we had given A the full amount would he have had the right to keep B's deposit even though he wasn't living there when B broke his terms? If so, does that right transfer to us? Am I entitled to the deposit since only B and I were here when he broke the terms? Is the landlord entitled to that money? Is giving only 20 days notice not enough to lose a deposit? Do we owe B his deposit back? He was a real dick about this whole thing I really don't want him walking away with zero repercussions, though obviously I'd like to have legal grounds to refuse him the money instead of just spite. If we can't keep it I'd rather C, D, and me pay the remaining 1/3 to A or the landlord than give it back to B.	No
"So i live in a end unit townhouse in northern VA with another couple with our own fenced in backyard. I own a 15 year old dog who is both deaf and mostly blind. I received a somewhat threatening email today from our landlady...  (I had a chance to go to the house today to see what ""blank"" had cut down.  I was disappointed to find that, again, the yard is FULL of dog waste. Please let dog owner know this MUST STOP!  If there were no yard at all, she would be walking the dog with a bag ready to collect its poop per County code.  Why does she feel it is ok to leave the waste in a small yard where you all live if it is not ok to leave it in the streets or sidewalks???  I don't get it...I would think it would be in your best interests, and everyone else's to have the waste collected...  Please let her know I mean it...this has got to stop. This was one of the prerequisites to our renting the house to you with the dog...remember?It is disgusting to see, not to mention a major attraction for rats. Do you want rats around there?)  My wife and i were caught completely off guard because we pick up the yard once a week and maintain the yard per the lease agreement, even going so far as to finished jobs that were started before the last tenants left but not yet finished. Her husband has come over several times and spent time in the backyard and never said a thing. We went home to check our yard and found maybe 5 spots where my dog had used the restroom but we had not yet picked up since returning from vacation. To call is ""full of dog poop"" is a gross over exaggeration.   We checked out lease again to make sure we did not miss a section pertaining to picking up after our dog once a day. The lease states that we must dispose of waste in a timely manner. I do not understand the point of getting a closed in yard used only by our home with a dog and getting what i perceive as a threat from the Landlady.  Is it possible she can have us evicted if we don't pick up after our dog every single time in our own backyard?"	No
i see stories of people who were convicted for saying that pretty seriously to someone they know on social media or text. but what if someone says that in the way that most people do on here, or on other sites/apps like ifunny or something, where people say that not actually intending for the target to kill themself, and they dont even know them in real life?	No
My parents got divorced when I was about 6 months old. As part of this agreement, any part of college that is not scholarships is supposed to be split 50/50 betweeen the two. Now, recently (and by recently I mean the past 4-6 years) our relationship has ceased to exist due to large disagreements between me and the rest of his family, and him, as in nobody really talks to him anymore. I just recently graduated with my Bachelors, and today received a Bill for his payment plan saying I need to pay it. In the past, he has always taken the route where he could not pay or steal what he can in regards to me. I.e. my college savings, avoiding medical bills, etc. Now that I am a completely independent adult, can I still go after him for this? Would it be worth it? For reference, its about 2 grand, and I make enough to make it go away within 3 months or so. But I have to pay back the amount of government loans i did take soon, and this may be rough if I do so.	No
I guess I'll start with the situation that led up to me discovering this. Please pardon any spelling errors. I've done the best I can to piece everything together from memory.  Up until yesterday afternoon, I had been staying at my parents' house for a few days with my cats because I was in between apartments and my new unit wasn't ready yet. Then the landlord of my new unit ghosted me after I'd paid my deposit/application fees, and I was stuck trying to figure out where I was going to go when my mom came into the living room and started asking me about it. She accused me of lying about it, so that I could somehow use her/manipulate the family. (I've realized she's a narcissist and all the abuse I endured as a kid all made sense after that but I digress. That's a post for /r/relationships.)  Anyway, one thing led to another and I decided to pack my bag and leave, rather than endure her verbal assault. My dad and sister weren't home to witness this fight (I think she waited for that to be the case before instigating) and in the moment I needed to vent to someone who would believe me, so I texted my half brother in Massachusetts and told him what was going on, that I had a horrid sneaking suspicion that SHE was the evil manipulative monster, and not my biological father.   Now, my mom has always told us that he left her in California with us when my sister was 2 and I had just been born, and moved to Massachusetts where the trucking company that he owned was stationed. He asked her to bring my sister and I up to the east coast so they could all be a family, then slapped her with divorce papers the day she got there. He'd been cheating with another woman and was planning on starting a family with her. The divorce was messy and my mom claims she fled back to California after he was a no-show for the termination of his parental rights. I was maybe 4 or 5 years old at this point. When she got back to California, she happened to reconnect with the man who would eventually adopt us (that happened when I was 8) and married him.   After speaking with my half-brother, who still lives with my biological father and my half-sister in Massachusetts, I decided to reach out to him and hear his side of the story. And it's not what my mom had led me to believe for the past 20 years.  He had been planning to divorce her because she'd grown cold and unloving towards him whenever he came back from trucking. (He didn't know that she'd met my step-dad/legal father before she met him, he thought they met after the divorce when in reality that's probably why she was so distant towards him- she already had someone else.) And he did cheat on her, which is what led to him filing for divorce. But he never asked her to move us to Massachusetts- she chased him up there when she suspected he wanted to leave her and then moved us and herself in with his mother and step-father against his wishes to try and keep him from going through with the divorce. It didn't work of course, and he went through with it anyway. The courts granted him custodial rights to me and my sister at first, and he would have us on the weekends while the divorce proceedings were being finalized. When it was finished, at my mother's request, she was also allowed to move us back to California under the stipulation that 1.) he would have us for vacation time and 2.) she would have to provide him with contact info, i.e. a physical address and a phone number- which she didn't do. In fact, the only reason the courts let her take us back to California was because she said she had a support system there and family to help her (another lie). She took us back to California and never told him where we were. He received one letter from us through CPS but there was no address on it so he couldn't send anything back. She also quietly filed for the termination of his parental rights with her attorney by forging his signature on the paperwork. After paying for the divorce, he couldn't afford to hire another attorney to fight the termination of his parental rights and he'd also would've had to come to California to do so. It wasn't within his power to stop her. When he found out we'd been adopted, he stopped paying child support and the courts threatened to take him to jail but he contested it- because we were legally not his anymore. He sort of gave up trying to speak to us after a few years, until he found her info when we moved to Georgia (presumably because we left the protection of the state of California) and called us wanting to connect when I was 16. It was the first contact he'd had with us since we were taken from Massachusetts. My mom had brainwashed us and painted him as a manipulative monster who would turn us against her if we gave him a chance, so when we spoke to him we basically told him to fuck off and we didn't hear from him anymore. That's how things were left until I called him yesterday.  I really want to sit down with my sister and tell her everything, because this is not the truth either of us grew up with. Through the mess of the divorce and custody battle, we cultivated a closer bond than anyone else in our family but that also means she's very loyal to my mother (she was a bit older than me and remembers a lot more than I do) and has already told me she's not choosing sides in the situation about my mother kicking me out of the house. My mother has texted me since that incident to berate me the way only a narcissist can, and I've refrained from responding. At this point, all that I care about is telling my sister in hopes that the web of lies my mother spun and protected for 20 years will finally fall apart. I'm really not sure at all what advice can be given about this because I have no paperwork to support his claims, but I want to see if there's a way to possibly request it somehow from the courts. My current boyfriend is completely up to date on this situation and has a lawyer I may be able to speak to, but I'd like to gain some clarity here so I can be more organized when we get to that step.     TL;DR I have to find irrefutable proof of my mother's alleged illegal actions to show my sister to support or I'm afraid lose her with the rest of my mother's family.	No
Straight-forward question, I hope.  I was charged what appears to be two full months of rent for failing to give 60 days notice when I broke my lease from a Texas apartment in 2015.  I know that it took approximately 2 weeks for them to clean the apartment, but before the next month, there were tenants in that apartment.  Are they due the full fee, or the part of the fee for which there were no tenants in the apartment?	No
I work as a lifeguard. My company does things which I'm not sure of the legality of.  This time they just informed me that my pool will be closed tomorrow all day and that they knew of this well in advance but didn't tell me or the other guards. Its less then 24 hours until my shift would have started and this cuts into my over time. I'm loosing 9 hours of $16.75/hr for a day I could've made plans for but didn't because of no notice. Do I have any rights here?  I'm from anne arundel county maryland.	No
Husband works in the oilfield.  They want to close down the yard here and relocate him to Oklahoma.  If he says no they say he has to quit so he won't get severance or unemployment.  What are his options?  Is this legal?	No
I thought I'd get ahead of the ball with this one.  I'm moving into an apartment complex in September. I've reviewed their rules and there is nothing regarding noise complaints.  I play piano, guitar, and love listening to music so I just know someone will complain even if I be respectful and play at reasonable times.  If nothing is listed in the Rules and Regulations am I safe from any overbearing neighbors or buzzkills in general?  What would I do if I did receive a fine for a noise violation?	No
Long story short, me and my family are very happy. I have two stepsons that i love very much. They both have abandonment issues and I would love to adopt them, and they have brought the issue up themselves without provocation. One father is in jail for attempted murder and won't be out until my son is an adult. And the other's father abandoned him at birth and has not seen him or paid a penny in child support. I have spoken with both fathers, they both are very appreciative of my raising their sons but neither will go so far as to signing adoption papers.	No
"Hi, I have an apartment with the lease in my name. I also have a roommate who is not paying rent and I want them to leave. She will not communicate with me, so I ca't even ask her to leave. She only comes back to the apartment when she knows I'm at work. She won't answer my calls or texts.  At this point, I don't care about the back pay in rent; I just want her gone. I'm scared that she will hurt my cat or steal my stuff.  What I want to do is have the locks changed and put a note on the door that says, ""Call me and I will let you pack up your stuff to leave"". Since she is not on the lease, the main office won't be able to let her in or give her a key. I'm worried that this is illegal though? I'm not trying to keep her stuff; I just want her to talk to me.  Could anyone give me some insight as to what to do?"	No
Ok this is my second posting of this and I'm legitmately serious how can I seriously prepare for a divorce? Are there secret bank accounts? Legal loopholes for evading alimony?	No
"My spouse and I are getting amicably divorced and own two houses. One is being used as a rental property that we intend to sell, with most of the proceeds going to her to cover her ""half"" of our assets. I am keeping the house we are living in.  She almost certainly cannot assume the mortgage on the property we intend to sell. I intend to assume the mortgage on our current house.  What should we add to our divorce decree to best protect ourselves?  * I would like to ensure the other property is sold so I'm relieved of the mortgage.  * She would like to ensure she is no longer liable for the mortgage on current house and gets most of the sale proceeds from the other house.  * I want her to quitclaim the current house.  * I also want to pay her from the sale of the house proceeds so that I don't have to liquidate other assets for her half.  I honestly don't expect any if this to really be an issue (we're still friendly and just want what is best and fair for us both.) We can probably do all of this without anything in the decree, but it seems like we should have something in place, just in case one of us loses their head."	No
"My boyfriend has been living with his much older cousin (he's 18, and she's in her mid-60s) for about a month now. Until he finds a job, he's agreed to do yard and housework for her in exchange for her letting him live in the spare room.  He's already cleaned out her basement, painted a shed, installed a fence, got rid of an ant problem, power-washed the porch, mowed the lawn multiple times, and she even made him drown an opossum that she caught. And he's followed the rules she has laid out (no visitors inside the house, no alcohol allowed, etc.)  Here recently, another opossum got caught in the walls and died. And she refused to allow a professional to come and get it out because she didn't 'want her wall messed up'. And as a result, maggots are crawling into my boyfriend's room and he's having a helluva time keeping them out. The issue just keeps getting worse, and he keeps finding more of them.  To add insult to injury, she also notified him that the agreement, ""Might not work anymore,"" since he has a job and won't be able to do yard and housework for her anymore (even though he is fine with just paying rent since he recently, finally found a job). And it feels like she's just used him for free work and is kicking him out now.  Anyhow, the important issue now is this. I'm pretty sure my boyfriend counts as a tenet at this point. And if so, can she just kick him out like this? And does she have any legal binding to remove the dead opossum and/or take care of the maggot problem?  Thanks for any help you may have."	No
I know this is super petty and I'm new to this subreddit but my ex has a Reddit account that he's been posting personal details of our relationship in. This is information that may seem like no big deal in general but is information that can cause trouble for me down the line and is, I guess, character defamation. Is there anything I can do here in order to get him to stop posting personal details? I've already had a friend and family member comment on his posts cuz they've come across them and I'm worried about him saying something that might put me in hot water. Any advice would be extremely helpful, thanks.	No
As a general rundown, I live in a college town where dogs are very rarely welcome due to students not taking care of their pets and not paying deposits. Unfortunately, this blocks good pet owners like myself from being able to keep their furry friends themselves.   My therapy dog has been in my family for 8 years and came up to college with me as soon as I was able to bring her. This year, roommates and I agreed to move into a house for the next school year. Unfortunately, two of my roommates signed their part of the lease before I was able to read it over. When the landlord learned that I was planning on bringing my 5 pound poodle mix, he freaked out and would not let me sign my lease. He told the other two friends that they were stuck to a four bedroom house that they would have to split the rent between the two of them. After a week of pleading emails, he finally agreed to let me sign, so long as I signed a contract agreeing not to bring my dog or try to claim her as a therapy pet next year or I would be evicted. Normally I would be angry with people who sign at an apartment complex without planning anything for their dog, but I was in a bind where I had to help my roommates out and knew my family could take care of my dog if need be.   After a few months, I've grown angry and generally curious about how legal my landlords actions were and whether or not there was a way for me to bring my therapy dog with me next year.	No
"Hello everyone, please help me out.   My Mom needs to get her insurance done, so I need to report my earnings from Wendy's to her report. The last month I worked at Wendy's was January 2017. Recently, I called and they gave me this site to go to which is called netsecure.adp. This is the site that shows all the times they paid me, and I need it to show it to the insurance people. I put in all my information and when I click ""enter"" it says my account is ""locked"". So I call back my Wendy's place and ask the guy if he can help me. I say, ""Can I have a number to talk to? What can I do to fix this? I really need this for my insurance."" He doesn't give me a number to talk to at all. He says I'm locked out my account because I don't work there anymore. I told him I really need it for my insurance, in which he replies ""I don't care"" with a chuckle. Please, someone help me out.

I am a young expat having a US insurance in a country where insurance is mandatory for every resident.  My insurance declined my doctor's request for a treatment for a recently diagnosed life-long debilitating disease.  It simply said that based on the medical evidence provided, the insurance was refusing. No explanation was given.  Basically, my question, what happens from then on?	No
"I've lived in my apartment complex for 2 years, there's no security deposit. I've kept the place in extremely good condition. I've even been a live in model for the complex.   I'm moving out in two weeks and my property manager dropped off a packet for move out procedures. My manager wants me to repaint the house, get the carpets professionally cleaned, pressure wash the outside, and so on my own dollar.   My place is VERY clean. I completely understand not leaving the place a mess! But to redo the entire place for the next tenants doesn't seem like a job I'm supposed to be doing. We have onsite maintenance teams and they always are outsourcing renovators for other units. I don't recall ever reading this in my lease (I'm going to go through it again though).   They are offering a wildly expensive ""express check out bundle"" where I can pay $500 for them to do it all for me. That is nearly my monthly rent. This doesn't seem like it's my responsibility to be doing. Obviously I was going to clean the place, but to paint and pay a professional to pressure wash?   I feel like my complex is ripping me off because I'm a student and ""don't know better"". Is this a normal procedure for moving out of a rental unit?  **TLDR;** My property manager is making me redo my already nice apartment on my own dollar. Am I being played to do the work they're supposed to be doing?"	No
"Hello all,  I am in a predicament right now regarding my current employer. I recently became a member of the management team at a new local restaurant. My company currently has six restaurants under its belt, and we opened this new restaurant for business last year and I've worked there since. My co-supervisor was recently trained on how to complete payroll before payday rolled around. In passing she candidly said: &gt;I have so much work to do! I have to go through everyone's time punches and edit them to be at least 5 minutes before their shift.  Our company policy essentially states that all employee's punches that are earlier than 5 minutes before a scheduled shift time will be edited to be, at most, 5 minutes before that shift.   That night I talked to one of our company's longer tenured managers and asked him about this practice. He told me that its ""company policy"" and everyone agreed to these policies when they signed their contracts. Many of the managers at other restaurants seem complacent about this practice. I know that you can't just write whatever you want in a contract and call it a day so I was thinking this may be an unenforceable.  I did some light research on the topic on the DOL's website and, from my understanding of the law, the law states that an employer may only edit time punches if an employee incorrectly recorded time (i.e forgetting to clock in or out). But they may not edit time punches in order to reflect something like a ""company policy.""  Now I'm not losing any sleep from my punch being edited from 2:54pm to 2:55pm. I am, however, concerned that my company is simply operating unethically. I want to talk to my HR representative and understand more about where this policy is coming from. But I also feel a little slimy doing payroll and having to edit these punches. Long term I am not interested in going to court about lose wages, etc. I just want my company to operate ethically and fairly.  So, my questions: 1) Is this legal at all? 2) Is this employment contract ""unenforceable"" because of this verbiage? 3) Is there anything a lowly supervisor can do about this company-wide practice?  Thanks in advance"	No
Hey all. My girlfriend's brother (17) is currently in custody dispute between his mother and father. His father is abusive both physically and emotionally, but has the legal right to him. He moved with his mother at the start of the summer and was supposed to start school in the fall. The father now wants him back.   The mother is convinced that there's nothing to be done about the situation, and he has to go back with his father. He has lived with his mother his entire life, but he had been struggling in school and was held back a year. The father lived in a better area as far as schooling for children like him was concerned, so the mother gave him to his father and paid child support last year to see if things would turn around in school. Her brother now wants to live with his mother again because of the abuse, but his father wants him back.   The father is also in custody of a baby girl whose mother is a drug addict, who is not in the picture. Her brother does not really want to go to anyone and say he abuses him because then he could lose custody of the little girl, whose mother doesn't want her.   I had asked him to talk to his father and tell him that he wanted to live with his mother, and he needed him to sign the papers or he would get the courts/law involved. If he wanted to keep the baby, he would have to sign, and if he didn't, then that's not a parent the baby needs either. He is now convinced that if he were to do that, the father would tell everyone who is in his house (a few other people, mostly adults,) that he was lying and he's not abusive at all.  What can my girlfriend's brother do about this? LEgally, if he does go to the cops and say he's afraid to go back, and the father had people vouch that he wasn't abusive, what would happen? I want to be able to help him out, but I don't know what rights he has, and what he can do at this point.    Thanks for any help. This is in Michigan if that matters for state laws.	No
Hi everyone, first post here but I will try to explain efficiently and fully.   First of all, when I was growing up, I never really understood what gutters were even for. Turns out (and this is obvious when you think about it for 2 seconds), all the rain that drops on that entire half of the roof - let's say 400 sq ft, falls exactly into about 4 sq ft (a 3 in x 16 ft area) of area off of the roof, and that area is right off of the patio - basically you have to walk through a 3 ft wide (because the water expands)  area of mud just to get to the rest of the of the backyard. We have a dog (which is the reason I would assume most people go townhouse over apartment), and it's just a big pain in the ass. She gets dirty feet every time she goes out, and we have to put up with it every time we gotta get that shit. I'm talking that there is a literal river off of our patio enveloped by a foot and a half of mud off each side, even if it hasn't rained in 2 weeks.   We even spent $200 (and 8 hours of hard work for me and my wife) and installed pavers 3 feet deep and they still only help to a degree. The water just pools up after them, and the water just pools up next to them. There was no apparent general landscape water flow for our place. That is what we are going to do next if necessary but I came here first.    Also, the tenants before us put a trampoline in the yard and the owner did nothing to bring it back to goodness. There's basically just a big mud pit in the center of the yard. Grass/weeds are kind of starting to come back but it's really crappy looking still. Should it really be my responsibility to get some sod and fix it?   Basically what I am asking is: what are my options? I've looked over other people's fences and they all have the same mud puddle we do. Should I start a petition or a class action or something? What about the trampoline grass?    I should also mention we pay top fucking dollar for this place for the area. Why do they take deposit money if it's not for fixing shit like that?  Sorry if my post isn't Kosher but I would really appreciate some help. Thank you in advance and also later.	No
"I went with a friend to his custody hearing yesterday, and I have an odd feeling about the situation.  He had cancer 18 years ago, and has been on SSI/SSDI after they overdosed him with Chemo and he was paralyzed. After years of physical therapy, he can now walk short distances with a cane, but is still very limited and had his disability reviewed/reapproved just 6 months ago.  During the case the Judge has been pressing him by asking things like ""Well you can still sit at a desk and answer phones right?"" And now she wants to see his Soc. Award because she is considering ordering child support based off of minimum wage instead of his actual ~$700 full disability income.  Is this a violation of the ADA at all? He was declared disabled by SSI/SSDI, but can the judge overrule this and charge child support because SHE thinks he can work, even though he has a full disability declaration?"	No
I drank yesterday and while drunk cut myself because I was mad at my landlord for yelling at me to clean the bathroom. I live in this house with 6 other women, and they were bitching about me not cleaning the bathroom. I don't even fucking take showers, and they're saying the hair in the shower drain is mine. It's not even the right color. Because of that, my landlord now says I need to keep my bedroom door open. That's fucked up. Can she legally do that?	No
The individual who signed a lease with the landlord has a two bedroom apartment and subleased out one of the bedrooms to myself.  The individual is currently living in the other room with dogs and did not specify in the sublease contract that there would be dogs living in the apartment as well. Furthermore, the individual left their belongings in the room I am subleasing.  The sublease agreement was without the knowledge of the landlord.  I am unhappy with the arrangement and looking to leave. I want to know if the sublease contract will hold up, as it was done without the knowledge of the landlord?  The individual's original rental agreement states they cannot sublease without the approval of the  landlord.  What are potential actions I can take to get out of my sublease agreement?  Thanks in advance for your help! (I live in California)	No
I'm not sure if I can report this or how I should. or if by reporting it I can be retaliated against. But here's what happened.  A few months ago I attended training with my supervisor, we are both males and he is significantly older than I. We had originally planned to stay at the same hotel, however different rooms as is policy.  On arrival he did not book his room correctly and turned to me almost expecting me to say he could share mine. I offered that he could use my room to look for another hotel.  He found another hotel and after the first day of training he complained about how my hotel had the better facilities. I offered for him to use the facilities at my hotel and we could go to dinner after he was finished. He went swimming and after he was finished I said he could change in my bathroom and then we could go to dinner. He said he didn't need to change in the bathroom and proceeded to undress and change right in front of me in the bedroom area of the hotel. This obviously made me uncomfortable and I looked away.  I guess my questions are, 1) Should I report this? Or is this just acceptable as its not unlike a locker room situation? 2) Has to much time gone by for me to report this? It just recently came up again in a conversation and obviously it does bother me a bit. 3) If I take this to our HR what potential fallout could harm me?  Thanks in advance.	No
"So where do I begin? My partner and I lived in an apartment(in St. Louis, Missouri) for 3 years and moved out the first of this month.  There are plenty of details that may or may not be relevant, but I decided to just include the history of our stay there, in case it could be of use.   Timeline of events:  July 2014 - Signed a lease with first property management company. Simple and straightforward, was done almost entirely online. He tells me to take some pictures of damage and email it to him if I want some repairs. I take *some* pictures, but not in detail. I ask about repairs, but only get little fixes here and there. They clearly were not that invested in the property, but I was okay with it because the rent was cheap.  Fall 2015 - Water main broke, landlord(owner) has to pay for everything. We were without water for a week, but compensated.  Summer 2016 - Property management company lets me know the house is up for sale. He said this doesn't have to change anything for me. He said we can sign a lease as usual, and that is what we did. Same lease as before, just different dates. Business as usual. Soon enough we get a letter from a different property management company (with their address, phone number, etc). I want to repeat that I did not sign a lease with them, it was the first company, but I assume they just took over the lease. I looked up the company's reviews online, and they have terrible ratings. Awful. From this moment on, I've only conversed with one person at the office about repairs, I've had no other contact with any of the people from the company besides a repairman. They did not see the apartment or speak with me.   Early 2017 - We ask for window sill repairs(they had been rotting out for some time). This is something that we bugged the other property management company about, but nothing happened. A repairman did come over, but they did a pretty crappy patch job... This is when we were thinking it might be a good idea to move this summer.   Summer 2017- In the middle of June, we find out we're approved to move into the apartment we've been looking at. I was concerned about the require notice to vacate before this, so I looked it up online and could only find a 30 day requirement for month-to-month rentals and leases without a fixed end date. Our lease has a fixed end date. Nowhere on our lease does it state that the property management company needs to be notified that we are moving out. It is around a week before our lease was up that we emailed the property management company about our intention to leave, and information about how to get a hold of us.  Yesterday - We get an email back from the company, they seem confused. They say ""do you mean you are leaving at the end of this month?"" We email back and explain ""no we left at the end of last month, that is when our lease was up."" In response, they said they needed a 30 day notice, that it is state law. Now, I had zero knowledge of this. Nothing in the lease. Nothing I could find online said this is true. We haven't responded.  I included lots of info about repairs, and their lack of understanding of the property, because I think these guys are indeed very sketchy, and I wouldn't be at all surprised if they try to withhold our deposit or even try to charge us for damages that were already there. These folks make me nervous.   I know this was long, thanks in advance!"	No
So i have a few questions, can jeugdzorg really do this (inspect/searchwithout a warrant? Or are the parents-in-question lying to save face? I was just wondering. Even if their apartment was very dirty, isn't that justified by the joy/stress of having a baby?  Thank you	No
Hello,  I'm trying to move into an apartment. I've signed all the legal paperwork, and they have been giving me the run-around once they received my holding deposit.  One thing they did was that despite only having only policies for cats and dogs, they suddenly decided my pet bunny counted as a large animal as well, and I need to treat it as a cat or dog. I decided it was fine, since some apartments do do this, and though my bunny doesn't chew, I could see why they'd want an extra deposit.  However, they are claiming I MUST vaccinate my bunny against rabies.  The issues is -- there is NO legal or approved vaccination for bunnies in the US. Whatsoever. It shows up again and again when you google it -- there are vaccinations in the UK and Denmark and so on, but not against rabies.  I have called five different vets who confirmed this.  The apartment claimed to have called around *until they found a vet who disagreed*. I called that exact vet because they gave me the information. They said they had a universal vaccination. I asked how it could be used on bunnies if no vaccination is approved for them in the US. After the person on the line spoke to the vet, they confirmed that no -- this is NOT an approved vaccination for a bunny. I was relieved because this vet has 1 star reviews, but even THEY were honest and adamant about it.  I then called the apartment again, and they told me it's too bad, I need to vaccinate the bunny despite no legal or approved vaccination for them. I have read from several people that such a vaccine has a decent chance of harming the bunny since they are usually for carnivorous animals.  Can they legally do this? They already agreed bringing my bunny was fine, they signed and I signed a paper stating so, and I'd understand if there WAS a vaccine, but literally none are approved in the US. Even their own vet that I called confirmed I'm right.  They claim that someone did this to their bunny in a sister-complex, which I think isn't true. All the vets (even the one they sent me to) I spoke to said no reputable vet would give a rabies vaccine to a bunny unless there was some sort of serious risk of that bunny running around outside in dangerous areas.  Is there anything I can do? They already have a deposit they took from me. I'd lose it if I say I can't do the vaccine, according to them.  Thank you for your time.	No
So in March, my girlfriend and I signed a one-year lease for an apartment in a small city in PA. Everything was going well, until around May, when our landlord request we start sending our rent to his property management company. Although they were not mentioned on the lease at all, we did what he asked because we figured it would be fine.   About three weeks ago, our ceiling started leaking. Water is coming in the side of the house and was dripping through our drop ceiling. Last Friday, one of the tiles caved in dropped a bunch of water on the floor. It's Monday, and the property management team came once and has been avoiding us since, maybe to come tomorrow, but i'm really starting to get worried. They also said that they just got this property, so they have been introduced into the equations since we signed our lease. Our landlord tells us there is nothing he can do and to call property management. Is it legal for him to do this when they were not mentioned on the lease? I really don't want to break another lease but I cannot live like this.  Thanks so much in advance.	No
Hi all, I've been living out the summer on a lease with a subletter that one of my housemates found.  Turns out that he hasn't been paying rent for the past month+, so she has started eviction proceedings and he has made himself scarce around here, although all of his belongings are still here.  (This all could honestly take up its own post, and it's not why I'm here today!)  I'm more worried about the two kids that showed up halfway through July and have been staying with him for most nights since.  From what I can tell, he has a baby who is 4-6 months old and a toddler who is about a year and a half old.  Cute, right?  Wrong, since our house definitely isn't equipped for children!  His room, specifically, has a mattress lying on the floor as a bed; no crib, no bassinet, nothing suitable for little kids.  I'm really worried about the safety of these kids, especially since he seems to have left his car seats and stroller here. (He may have multiples, and the mother may have a set, but they seemed to be sharing the ones currently sitting at the house.)  I've been looking online and I haven't found any specific CPS guidelines, but I'm really worried about the safety of these kids, especially now that they're God knows where.  Should I contact CPS?  Would they be able to do anything, even a welfare check? Does the pending eviction throw any of this into hazy territory?  Any insight is greatly appreciated, thank you.	No
So we had just renewed our lease, which we pay 3 months at a time, and we were told that in between the leases they would inspect the house and charge us for any damages. We did cause some damage and were prepared to pay, however we found out that when the house was built they completely fucked up the foundation and the city immediately condemned the house.  It was decided they would demolish the house and our lease would be terminated. However, they are refusing to give back our June and July rent, and are saying our august rent is to be used for the repair costs. I know for a fact there are no repairs going on because they are demolishing the house and I spoke with the contractor.    Also to be clear, our damages had NOTHING to do with the house now being demolished.   Do we have anything to stand on legally? It feels really fucked up and wrong but I don't want to waste my time and money on a lawyer if nothing can be done.	No
"Case Location: Michigan. My Location: North Carolina.  A while back, I was evicted for failure to pay rent (2006). After the judgement was issued in the eviction case, the landlord opened another case, a small claims case, and got a second judgement.  Time passed, eventually, he finds me in North Carolina and sends a nasty gram, ""You owe me this money.""  I email back, asking for details, and get court documents related to the eviction case. Looks legitimate. I don't respond.  In a few months, I start getting garnished. I think its for the eviction case, but really, it's for the small claims case.  He gets this money, the judgement is satisfied, and I think its over. I had no idea I was being garnished via a separate court case. The validation documents he sent via email were from the eviction case.  A few days ago, I get ... another writ of garnishment. This writ is attached to the original eviction case for substantially more money.  I don't understand what the small claims judgement was for. I've requested the court documents to try and make sense of this.  Ideas? I'm in correspondence with an Attorney, but haven't heard anything back yet."	No
"Hey everyone, this is happening right now, but this is all the information I have.

Hello. The company I work for requires a yearly hands-on competency test. This year, they have mandated that if you miss your testing time, and don’t give 24 hour notice, you will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction. Obviously, it is illegal for an employer to deduct wages without approval; however, my employer seems to think they’ve found a way around that. There is an online test that you must take beforehand, in which 100% is required. The very first question is along the lines of, “I agree that if I miss my hands-on test, I will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction”. To me, this sounds as though they are forcing you to agree to a payroll deduction in order for you to stay employed. Is this legal? If not, any advice on how to approach management with my concern? I do not want to agree to this, as I can think of multiple scenarios where I may have to miss my test, and be unable to give 24 hours notice. Thank you for your help.	No
"Hi,   We are moving, and we notified our landlord that we would like to be present for the move out inspection via certified mail with the required 15 days prior notice.  According to Maryland law, the landlord has to ""upon receipt"" notify us of the date of the inspection to take place either 5 days before or 5 days after the move out.     We are moving out on the 31st, so we are in the window. I can't find anything other than ""upon receipt"" for how much notice the landlord has to give us, but I am worried that they are going to try and notify me the day before.  Do I have any defense here?   Additionally, the state AG says their response has to be via certified mail to me and I have nothing from them. They called last night, but I have asked that they email me and handle everything in writing.    Because they have waited 12 days from receiving my letter, have they violated ""upon receipt""?"	No
Oklahoma is the place.   So, friends of mine are dealing with their mothers death. She passed last week. They are pretty sure that their parents were not divorced but have been separated only for 20+ years.   The father(or widower) might be married to someone in another state for around the same time of the separation to now. He is also starting to try and call the shots on many things with the estate.   Anyone have any advice on what they should expect? This is confusing me to no end but I'm not a lawyer.	No
SERIOUS REPLIES ONLY PLEASE.  Hopefully I used the correct flair, I don't see one that really fit for veteran questions...  I just had one ask me today and it caught me off guard, made me feel very uncomfortable, and kinda pissed me off (no, I don't have either issue, but I can see it leading to vets with PTSD becoming homeless because they are immediately stigmatized and not given housing due to having these personal medical issues).  Any legitimate answer are appreciated.	No
So the title says my STBX and I are getting divorced. There was a domestic incident tonight and I'm filing for a restraining order in the morning. I've read the documents online but I'm still confused on whether or not I need to file for temporary custody of our son separately or if that will be granted with the OFP?  I'm in MN. 	No
"My boyfriend and I rent a house directly from the homeowner. He always argues with us about the necessity of any requests we make for repairs or maintenance, so I've started emailing him lists of things we need addressed just to have it documented in writing. In these communications, I have tried to be as cooperative, polite, respectful, reasonable, and understanding as possible. He refuses to respond in writing and will call instead, making promises that he later claims he never said (I suspect this is why he does not respond in writing).   Last week, he sent some employees to replace our broken fridge and remove a broken window unit AC.  The next day, he came to the house with one of those same employees to look at some other problems.   He and I were talking about some of the items in my latest email, and he began getting angry and increasingly loud with me. He is upset that we ""complain about every little thing."" I remained calm and did not raise my voice, but I did respond to some of his accusations and complaints. At one point, I said, ""Please do not yell at me.""   My boyfriend heard the argument (just him yelling, since he wouldn't really let me speak) and came into the room to ask him not to speak to me in that manner. He also said, ""What's the problem here?""  Landlord turned his anger onto my boyfriend in an even louder, more aggressive tone. He accused my boyfriend of being on drugs the day before (something the employees he sent out must have said). Not true at all - he works second shift and had just woken up. The employee present this day came into the room at that point and stood behind my boyfriend. This was in a small, enclosed space, where the landlord and his employee had my boyfriend effectively trapped. The landlord started waving his fists around and threatening to fight my boyfriend.  Boyfriend managed to get out of that room and went to the bedroom in an attempt to walk away from the situation. Both men followed him and also trapped him there, still yelling and threatening.   We are considering filing a police report just in case anything like this were to happen again in the future, but also fear that may make the situation worse. I know he would not be notified unless a warrant was signed, but we live in a small town, so that's not always a guarantee.   I'd really appreciate any advice or feedback you guys may have on whether we ought to pursue this, since we now don't feel particularly safe around him and definitely don't feel as though we can ever mention another maintenance problem. Thank you."	No
TL:DR-In my “infinite wisdom” I believed it a good idea to get married at the age of 21 as a US citizen to my long-distance boyfriend who is a Canadian Citizen. It was my first serious relationship as an “adult” and while at the time I made excuses why, it was a very rocky relationship. After almost two years of being married it all fell apart and I moved back home with my parents. He jerked me around with dancing on the “Maybe I still want you” line for a bit before I finally said it was over. While back in the states it took him years but I finally got request for divorce papers in the mail. I believed that was the end of it, but after contacting him he swore up and down he still has a bunch of paperwork to work through before we can be properly divorced. I no longer believe him when he said he would handle it. I just got engaged 8 years later but I have no idea if the divorce went through or how to handle it moving forward as I plan my first proper wedding.  We were married IN Alberta and when he filed he was still there and I was (and still am ) in Rhode Island.  I’m going to preface this all by saying I’m very ashamed of the whole situation. I was a very stupid lonely kid who didn’t realize just how greatly I was screwing my life over. I’m sorry this got long, I still get pretty emotional thinking about the whole situation. If this is not the right place to post this I would really appreciate being directed to the right place.  2006 - I come from a pretty tense and dysfunctional family, so when it came time for me to go to college I chose something far away. While attending my first semester at college I did not know anyone there and spent the majority of my time by myself in the library or computer labs. It wasn’t long before I got officially involved with a long-distance boyfriend from Canada. Huge phone bills were racked up due to international calls and he even ventured out to see me on a very long bus ride.   2007 – I ended up transferring back to my home state and after a short time spent back at my parent’s home I decided I needed to get out of there. If I went straight back to school the next semester my parents agreed to help me get an apartment if I could prove I could pay for it. I worked full time and went to school full-time that semester but ended up failing most of my classes because I was just not able to handle that load on top of depression. The Canadian long-distance boyfriend came to stay with me for roughly a month where I supported him as he had no job back home and had been living with his parents. Had I been smart I would have seen that the relationship was clearly toxic at this point, but I’ve always had a quiet sappy romantic side that had me wanting to believe that this “first love” was special enough to be the one.    In the fall I moved out of the apartment and transferred yet again, this time to a college where I could live on campus, but still close enough to home where I went back to my parents nearly every weekend. My mother was convinced I would do better in this setting, and to her credit my grades were all passing even though my heart wasn’t really in it. Many Many phone conversations later he (Canadian Boyfriend) convinced me to move out there with him so that we could be together. At that point he had gotten an overnight job and a small studio apartment that I had flown out for a week to visit so I honestly believed it was a logical next step.  Spring 2008- I packed up a single bag and two carry-ons and moved to Canada. Whether I believed it might not work out, or that I would be stopped by suspicious customs folk I can no longer remember, but I went there with a return ticket that went unused. While the relationship was okay in the beginning it quickly deteriorated. As I wasn’t a citizen I could not get a job, car or really anything else that required money so I was at his mercy when it came to pretty much anything. He insisted I have the same sleep schedule he did as an overnight worker and that pretty much killed any hope of a social life outside of him that didn’t involve the internet. Sex frustrated him as we were both virgins and he came to place that blame on me. While I was willing to work through everything, he was impatient and eventually decided it was all because I was not attractive enough for him. Yes, he would explain this to my face. Believing that I was indeed the problem I did my best to try to fit into that mold he kept claiming he wanted. But I came to learn that if I improved one thing he would quickly find another fault that MUST be why he wasn’t interested in me. He would pepper in romantic conversations saying I was beautiful and he didn’t know what was wrong with him and that he loved me in between all of this so I moronically stayed.    The six-month mark rapidly approached and I was told the only way I could stay any longer is if we got married. Believing myself in love I was for it, “If I really love you and want to be with you, why now?” I’d thought. We decided that was what we would do. He did not pop the question he just called me over to the computer one day to help him pick out wedding rings from a cheap site online. I convinced myself that that was what I wanted so it didn’t matter that it wasn’t romantic. We filed for a marriage license and a short time later I was informed by him that we’d be getting married a couple days later in a park because he had already booked the officiant. I bought a dress I hated from some outlet store (It was brown and black with some green but it was the only dress I could find in that store at a low price that looked ok on me.) So on a muddy day when the trees didn’t even have enough green on them to look nice I got married. The whole affair was almost as miserable as that evening when he wouldn’t have anything to do with me because he was too tired. My family and friends were confused and more than a little upset that they were not invited or even told when this was happening and some of them stopped talking to me completely because of it.   The rest of the time (Less than a year of marriage) I spent there is a dismal blur of fights about filing paperwork for citizenship (He procrastinated for EVERYTHING. The only thing he stayed on top of was getting married to I could extend my stay) or where he said hurtful things and me falling into a depression so deep I started sleeping away the time I didn’t waste playing video games and started to rationalize jumping off a local bridge to just get out. Multiple times I caught him having long-distance relationships, the final one I knew about was some 17-year-old from Texas who he told we were already divorced. After weeks of sleeping on the couch after learning about that one (Clearly it was my fault for not being able to hold his interest on a physical level and being a moody depressed boring person. Oh yes, he said these things to my face.) I broke down and called my mother and told her it was over and I needed to go home. This was almost a year exactly after we had gotten married. I remember being on the road and laughing like a crazy person when I realized it was out anniversary.   2009- My mother has her issues and we don’t always see eye to eye, but on this occasion, she came through so hard for me. She quickly got time off work and drove with my sister from South Dakota to Alberta in two days. When it was clear that she was showing up and not leaving without me my “husband” did a lot of back-pedaling trying to explain that I had been irrational in being so quick to find a way back home. She showed up and he left while I packed my things into my mother’s car. When we were finished he came back and kissed me goodbye saying he had no idea if he wanted me to come back again.  When my family and I got to the hotel I had received an e-mail from him saying not to contact him, he needed space, he would tell me when it was ok for us to talk again. I was very broken. After getting home I spent a month so shattered I lost 20 pounds from not being able to eat much. My mother helped me get my license back (it had expired in Canada) sort my school debts out (He had refused to pay any of my school bills because it didn’t affect us in Canada). I moved in with friends for a few months before moving back home. It was at this time that my Canadian “husband” had decided he wanted me back and that some of our troubles were actually his fault. I was angry, but usually heard him out. After falling into an old fight I just stopped taking his calls after I told him I wanted a divorce. He popped up on my doorstep not long after trying to win me back. He convinced me to give it another try but it came down to me being unable to trust him. So we were over. He said he would handle the divorce, it would be cheaper if he did it himself without a lawyer. At that point I was so scarred from the whole experience I didn’t believe I wanted to ever get married again anyway so I wasn’t overly concerned and agreed he could do it.    In October, when I had been living with them, my parents started going through a messy divorce. During that time, I kept my head down, worked a lot of hours and started planning to move out. My mother and siblings had moved out due to the divorce and I guess because I was an “adult” she just left me staying at the house with my dad. I’ve never had a good relationship with my father, he’s a very angry man, with a touchy temper prone to violent outbursts. (My mother had been so convinced he would react violently she told him via text message which my father made me read aloud to him when he got home) It was pretty fucked up. Time went by, life happened and a long-distance friendship blossomed into a romance and relationship by December.   February I flew out and spent a week with my new beau trying to just move on with my life. Nothing physical happened outside of making-out because I had been completely upfront and honest about my situation and he wanted to take things slow. After coming back to South Dakota I became much more interested in the progress of the divorce, but when I contacted my Canadian Ex I would get a lot of excuses and run arounds. He would make brief progress after I threatened to get a lawyer involved from my side but it never seem to stay on track.   Unhappy with my living situation it didn’t take long for the idea of moving out to the east coast to sound really appealing. Initially I had wanted to get my own place and build into the new relationship slowly, but making minimum wage and paying for some of my parents bills I didn’t have the means to amass the money for a down payment or rent for the first few month while I got settled. In 2010 I moved to Rhode Island from South Dakota and into my new boyfriend’s apartment.   Years later my Canadian Ex got my address and sent me papers declaring intention to divorce. He had told me I did not have to do anything and the divorce would go forward soon. I was so happy that I had thought it was finally over. That stupid raincloud was going to be off of my head and out of my life.  After this in 2013 my New Boyfriend attempted a proposal at Disney World. I say attempt because I was still so skittish to the idea of marriage that in a panic I yanked him off of his knee and walked forward like nothing happened. This naturally caused tension, but he was very patient and understanding about the whole situation.  After a lot of serious discussions and talks about our future he finally got the nerve to ask me to marry him again on May 25th of this year 2017. I said yes. After a few months of excitedly planning and dreaming what our big day will look like I’ve come to realize that the raincloud of my first marriage might not be fully gone. The last time I spoke to my Ex a couple years ago (AFTER he had send me the papers) he said he had messed something up and it was going to take awhile because it cost a lot of money. (Another excuse, he gave me this song and dance after telling me he was in an upcoming magic the gathering tournament, and that man never skimped on buying cards for his perfect deck)  My Future husband believes that I shouldn’t do anything. That there is no technical record of me ever being in the United states so I should just pretend like it never happened. I have always filed my taxes as single since moving back to the states and getting back into work so as far as the system knows and cares I’m single and I have always been.   While in Canada I didn’t file any taxes, I never paid any bills, had nothing in my name save for a single credit card where the Ex used my “married name” (I never filed for a name change but apparently the marriage certificate was enough to open a joint account in that name)  I don’t want my stupid decisions of the past to have any effect on my upcoming marriage or future life with the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.   Is there a way to figure out just where my Canadian Ex is in the process? Is there somewhere where I could get this information to see if it went through or just is stuck in limbo? Or do I need to find an attorney to get to the root of this?  Or would it be better just to follow my Fiancé’s advice and pretend it never happened? What possible legal backlash could this cause if any?  I feel a little slimy at the idea of filling out a marriage certificate saying I've never been married before, but if my last marriage is stuck in a hellish legal limbo trying to get that wrapped up with proof that it's legally over sounds like an expensive nightmare.   After over 6 years separated I just want this to be over.    Frankly I have no idea how to handle this situation moving forward. Contacting my Ex would likely only lead to another set of run arounds and excuses that give me no information whatsoever.  If you’ve made it this far I am extremely grateful, I did not anticipate this would end up being so long or so…all over the place.   If I have made anything unclear or you have any questions please ask. Thank you for your patience.	No
"I'm looking for advice from people who maintain totally separate finances or are real estate experts. My partner and I got married mostly because we wanted the legal protections marriage gave us and we planned to buy a house. From my past experience with my ex, I knew that buying while married has significant advantages, especially when you both make a lower salary. However, over the course of my current relationship I have ended up out-earning him, and I now make in the low 6 figures while he is barely middle class. Which would be totally fine, except for when it comes to the house. We want to continue keeping our finances totally separate, and with the house we would ideally both be paying equally into it and into house maintenance, taxes, etc, but that can't happen now due to the fact that any house/condo in our area is going to be too much for him to pay half of either the downpayment or the mortgage. The ""solution"" seems to be I just pay more for everything, but we are both feeling very uncomfortable about this. It breaks up the plan of keeping finances separate and if we break up, he walks away with 50%. Neither of us think this is ok. The reality is he can pay about 35% of the house down payment and mortgage. Has anyone who had separate finances dealt with this situation before? In an ideal situation we would be single and my partner would be renting from me and I would write my will up so he got the house if anything happened to me, but we are married now. How would you write up a contract designating that he gets a percent of the house and how do you figure out what that percent is? Are there any emotional things we should think about? We're considering getting a divorce to be able to do this but I would like to know what my options are."	No
"After approaching her boss he said ""you havent got the raise because i dont think you proved enough to me""  my question is, is this legal?  technically they are withholding money from her that she should be getting since shes been promoted.   Ive tried looking at NYC job laws but cant find anything.  shes been doing the work load of her current title from the promotion but wont give her the raise that came with it.   Before i say anything to her i was just wondering if this falls under illegal by labor law"	No
My relationship with my landlord is not that nice and I am moving out by the end of the month. I am 100% sure he is going to hoard my deposit and I am preparing my case. I have few problems.  1) I don't know his address, how can i sue him if i don't have his address? The way i pay him is via bank transfer. I try to ask for his home address by saying i can't do bank transfer anymore but he simply gave me his work address and say he can receive mail there.   Any pointers in help me build the case would help. I did my fair share of research; making sure all damage is wear and tear etc... but without his address it makes everything difficult.	No
"Marina del Rey, California.  I know that certain appliances are in the unit as a ""courtesy"" and landlord takes no responsibility for repair. This applies to my washer/dryer. However, upon moving in, I discovered the washer leaks water everywhere and was not in working condition when we entered into the lease.  For more background, I rented a condo from an individual landlord. It's a nice place with high rent, and I deliberately looked for a place with an in-unit washer/dryer after not having one at my old place. I would not have signed the lease had I known the washer wasn't in working condition. Part of me thinks it's my fault for not checking, but part of me thinks there's no way to check...it's not like you can run a load of laundry in the ~15-20 minutes you see the unit!  Am I SOL here?"	No
"So I recently moved into a new place, but my old landlord keeps dodging me. He keeps saying that he's sending my security deposit back from my old place, which I left absolutely spotless, but it's been two months and I'm still missing my entire deposit. I thought of recording him on the phone where I request either the bill for the damages or the deposit back, but don't know if this is the best idea. For the record his real estate ""company"" no longer exists and the only address is a PO box he gave me. Is this an issue of I should've been smarter to begin with or is there anyway I can still get my somewhat large deposit back? Thanks for all your help"	No
So basically my ex-girlfriend borrowed my cat on Thursday under the pretense of needing to spend time with her for emotional support.  Then this morning (Sunday) she started sending me text messages saying that she is keeping the cat and that she will not return her at all.    What can I do here?  I've already called the police but they said I'd have to hire a private attorney and take her to court.  I have mountains of evidence and witnesses that the cat is mine and not hers, the cat is chipped to me and I have vets bills etc with my name on it.  I also have the texts where my ex says in clear terms that she knows the cat isn't hers but is keeping it anyway.    What can I do here?  I know this is a silly question but I really love the cat and want to get her back, thanks for your help.	No
Me and my daughter were assaulted by my wife and she was charged with assault in the 4th degree and domestic mischief in the 3rd. She was a stay-at-home mother of our 1yr old daughter, but with the protection order I put in place for her own safety, her mother isn't allowed to see her.  I live in Bellevue, WA, and was already living pretty modestly, but it's damn expensive here and considering the immediate legal fees I'm going to have filing for divorce and full custody, I barely had enough to get by BEFORE all this happened.  Daycare centers are $2000/mo, and I already checked don't have any immediate openings, and I haven't been able to find a nanny on care.com for less than $15/hr.  I had a nanny, but it was a friend of my wife was was being paid with the meager income my wife had. She quit abruptly and I can't use my wife's income to pay for another.  I'm trying not to panic, but what can I do? It's going to take me some time to scale back my modest expenses (moving, primarily). I just moved here, so I don't have any friends who could help, and my family is too otherwise obligated and far away to help more than a week or so.  Any suggestions would be appreciated.	No
"I was an independent contractor for an online business that had a lot of members (gaming related). In my non-disclosure agreement there is a clause that prohibits me from communcating with any previous or current members. ""The Indepependent Contractor may not commmunicate with any previous or current members that have been or are apart of XYZ properties"".  This has a 3 year term to it and is based out of New Jersey. Many of these members are my friends, and many of them are no longer active members yet I still according to this cannot communicate with them for 3 years.  I would understand not being allowed to solicit members. Also, none of these members are employees of the company. I feel like this goes way beyond examples I have read about where a current employer forbids communication with previous employees. Is this a legitimate, enforcable clause?"	No
My landlord verbally agreed to release me from my lease and told me he'd follow up in writing. I expected an official document of some sort, but instead I got the following email:  &gt;Per your request, here is a quick note to document our agreement.. We have agreed that we will release you from all future lease obligations. In the next few days, please [...instructions for returning keys],  **Is this enough to release me from my lease, or do I need to request something more?** My limited knowledge of contract law says this is enough, but my gut tells me to be wary.	No
I've been carrying this on my shoulders since Nov. 2015. The therapists know the entire situation, in depth, and even though I feel iffy about what to do, they still encourage me. It is not such a black and white/cookie cutter situation, it's also very twisted, and gross, and sick... So I'll spare you the details and make this brief.   I don't have money to hire a lawyer, but my current therapist told me to at least seek a free consultation with one. How do I do this? If the crime happened in another county, what do I need to do. What will happen if/when I finally press charges? What should I expect? I need to know so much, but I don't know what all to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	No
Earlier this week on Tuesday, i had people over at my house to drink and hangout for fun. Someone went outside and started revving his engine very obnoxiously which later on caused a noise complaint to be issued. anyways, so about 2 hours after the car being revved loudly (approx 3:30 in the morning) everyone in the house was asleep with the exception of one of my friends. there was 4 others of us in the house and the landlord that we rent the property from stormed into the house with police, unannounced, and started taking photos of everything and everyone in the house. she then proceeded to bang on every door to wake everyone up who was sleeping and started yelling and interrogating us, saying we are irresponsible for everything going on (keep in mind everyone was 21 or older). after about 30 minutes of her and the police yelling at us and saying we will go nowhere in life, they left and then actually e-mailed the photos of everything to one of our roommates parents who co-signed on the lease. Do we have any legal rights here? she barged in unannounced, with police, and took photos of all the alcohol and people and tried to get us all in trouble but could eventually do nothing because we were all legally able to drink. is there any action we can take?	No
"My fiancé's ex wife is threatening to withhold the kids from visitation. This isn't the first time and she has a habit of calling the cops and child protective services, etc. a few times a year. Every time, by the way, it's been considered ""unfounded"". The newest issue is sleeping arrangements. The kids are 5 yr old triplets. I personally have 2 kids of my own who live with me full time and we have the triplets every weekend. We have a 3 bedroom home with a finished basement (that was that way when we bought the home). The current sleeping situation is my two kids sharing a room, and the triplets (just turned 5) have toddler beds in a shared bedroom. We wanted to move them to big beds. We decided that we'd use one room of the finished basement and turn it into their bedroom (their play room/the theater is already down there and they spend most of their time down there anyway). We got the 2 girl triplets a queen bed to share, and the 1 boy triplet a twin bed. They only sleep at our house on Saturday nights. In the room that is now their bedroom, there are two means of egress (escape). One is the stairs leading to the upstairs, and the other is a Bilco door that is in the room leading directly to 4 stairs that lead to outdoors. Before we moved them down there we went to the township and spoke with the building code guy for the township-explained the situation and asked if we were in the clear to have them sleep down there. His answer was yes. No new construction or anything as it was finished when we bought it.   Ex wife states that it is against court order custody agreement which only states that there be an ""appropriate sleeping arrangement"" for the children. Obviously we're never going to have a house with 6 bedrooms, and so nothing will ever meet her personal definition of ""appropriate"" because she'd prefer they all have their own room. She states she called the township and asked if it was a legal bedroom and she says it's not.   I guess I'm just wondering if her complaints have any legal merit. I just think of these single dads with studio apartments or something and I can't imagine that as long as the child has an appropriate and safe place to sleep, that the court would dictate specifics on sleeping arrangements. Any thoughts?"	No
Our landscaper did mention the neighbor asked them a lot of questions and that the landscaper felt the need to explain that our house had 15 security cameras. I thought my landscaper was just being weird, although I've known him for 16+ years. However, since Nov 2016 one of the neighbors got the idea I was responsible for his issues with our HOA. (I'm not, he's been breaking rules and getting cited, not related to me at all)   Unfortunately, since then he has become focused on my wife, repeatedly trying to ask her why we are reporting him, looking over the fence and insisting on speaking to her about his tickets when she's outside with our kids, driving by and giving dirty looks (this to me, her, the children) but then when she told him she did not want to speak with him, he (I suspect) posted ads on CL that got her over 100 respondents directly to her email/phone number (luckily it was only a burner /number and not her main email). We notified the HOA.   He approached her again to try to 'talk like adults about his tickets' and she said do not talk to me. He  came to our front door and attempted to speak with her about his tickets.  (We have footage). That night she was signed up for a pornhub account to that same email that is just for neighbors. At this point we made a police report. We were advised by the police to record all convos and to ignore him, completely. He never brings these concerns up to me, but did go on a rant on a neighborhood website. (Mods took it down) The police did mention they'd had complaints about him previously.  Did the previous owners have some kind of duty to disclose this problem neighbor? I've put a call in to my agent. I travel for work so am gonna lot during the week, and this guy is triggering my protective instinct.	No
"Hi everyone. I've been renting an apartment in MA for almost 4 years now. My lease is up on August 31, and I've been trying to get in touch with my landlord for the past 3 weeks to let him know that I'd like to renew. I've emailed him and gotten no response. I've called multiple times but it just goes to voicemail. I haven't received a ""I will not renew your lease letter"" or anything like that.  When the first lease was up in 2015 he actually contacted ME to renew. I'm concerned that I haven't heard from him in awhile. The last time we spoke was by email around last November. However, I always mail the rent check to him, and *someone* has been cashing it. So I'm not sure what to think!   I'm not sure what to do. This is the worst time to be apartment hunting on short notice in the city, and the prospect of having to find a new place to live, hire movers, and take care of everything that comes with moving is really stressing me out. I've recently suffered the loss of someone very close to me and I've been depressed, and haven't had the heart to apartment search. I was hoping to renew for another year, and I can't think of a reason why he would not want to renew. I always pay on time or early, I have rarely contacted him about issues, and when there have been issues (eg. plumbing) I always take care of the arrangements.  What should I do? Can I continue living in my apartment month-to-month once the lease expires, if my landlord hasn't given me notice to terminate tenancy? Is a termination notice required if I have a lease? Do I need to worry about my things being removed from the apartment while I'm away?  Thanks for reading!"	No
"I live in an area of Los Angeles where parking is extremely tight and limited. My complex has 100+ units and 10 private parking spots. It looks like some people have taken to spray painting red zones to create additional parking spots that look like other zones which are painted white. In addition, I was operating under the belief that your front tire has to be within the boundaries of a parking spot when a red zone is involved.  I received a ticket for an LAMC 80.56E4 violation, which reads:  &gt; 4.   No person shall stop, stand or park a vehicle at any time in any red ""No Stopping"" zone or portion of street posted with signs reading ""No Stopping Any Time"", except that a bus may stop in such zone or portion of street marked or sign posted as a bus stop.

I own a condo on the second out of three floors. Two weeks ago I notice a water stain forming in my dining room. All of the units are identical, so this was not a sink or dishwasher leak.   Called the HOA's maintenance and he cut a 1 sq ft hole in the ceiling to find complete saturation in the ceiling, crown molding, and wall. Found the source of the leak to be the upstairs owner's fish tank that has been leaking for this two week span. When maintenance went into his unit, the owner's girlfriend (who is also part owner) allowed him inside. When she called her boyfriend about everything, he immediately ordered maintenance to leave.   Turns out, he doesn't have home owner's insurance.   He works for a restoration company and offered to dry everything out and repair the damages. I declined. I called my insurance. The restoration company contracted through my insurance has come and found that an estimated 20 gallons worth of water has leaked from ceiling to floor. The wall has been cut out and is currently drying with machines.   I spoke with him earlier today and let him in to see the hole that has been cut and the damage he has done. He immediately said he is getting himself a lawyer. Do I need to do the same? Or will my insurance company's legal team do all of that?   I'm not sure if there is anything here that I need to be doing, or if I just pay my deductible and let my insurance take the reigns from here.	No
For background information, my friend and i are both 17 going to be 18 soon.  To start the story off my friend and i were smoking a blunt on the side of the road when a cop pulled up behind us and walked to the door. After making eye contact with the officer he opened my door (drivers side) and asked us to get out and put us against the wall. After that we were patted down and put into the cop car. About 2 more cop cars came and they started searching my vehicle where they found about 2 grams of weed. When suddenly the officer pulled out 3/4ths of an Ecstasy pill and asked me to identify what it was. We were eventually taken to the local station where they filled out the paperwork and than after about 6 hours transported to downtown. my friend and i were both charged with the marijuana but i was charged with controlled substance on top of that. This is my first offense of any kind. But, on the police report they stated that when the police were patting us down they found weed on us which isn't true. The only thing on me was my wallet and my friend had nothing on him at all. They also stated that we were going door to door selling weed, that they found the X pill in a pill bottle with my name on it which also is not true. There was a pill bottle with my name on it but it had marijuana in it. they also stated that when we went to the local station we were being questioned by detectives the whole time but in reality we were put into singular cells and chained up the entirety of the time there. if i'm being completely honest i really am unsure of what's gong to happen. Is my life over? Is it even possible for me to have an ending that will be relatively okay? Also, I'm enrolled in an EMT program for this upcoming senior year and we have to do a background check and i suppose that's over for me? i appreciate whatever advice you can give.	No
