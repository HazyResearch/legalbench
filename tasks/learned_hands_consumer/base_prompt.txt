Does the post discuss issues people face regarding money, insurance, consumer goods and contracts, taxes, and small claims about quality of service?

Post: Hello, my girlfriend took out a payday loan about a year ago and now we get a call from a collection agency stating they will take her to court if we do not pay an agreed amount by the end of the month.  I do not know if they have been trying to get in contact with her in the meantime at this point.  Do they have any legal right to do this, what would become of going to court and could I be getting scammed?  They knew her full name, last four of social and some other information that could be a little hard to get.

Post: They keep referring to it as "policy change", but they have, in reality, altered the essence of the service provided: I have signed a contract for unlimited data for a certain price, and now they're charging me the same price for a limited amount of data.   They have issued a notice around New Year's saying that they intend to do so; I have immediately called their customer service and said that I do not accept that type of service to which they have told me that the ""new policy" is not being rolled out yet"" so basically to chill since is not impacting me any time soon. I have just logged into my account to discover that the data cap has been imposed for some time now without anyone contacting me after my declining of the altered service.  Does this qualify as a breach of contract given that I have specifically declined any alteration to my contract?   Again, they keep saying that it's a "change in policy" which, based on their standard contract terms they have the right to update, but I see it as a change in service provided since I'm now getting less for the money I'm paying and I specifically disagreed to take that cut. Thanks guys!

Post: Hello,  The company I am having issues with are holding my account that I have them under certain restrictions (one of which is quite serious, money related) due to a claim of theirs to which I do not agree. They want to video interview me over the internet. Not sure why they wanted to do that but there is no such thing explicitly written in their ToS. I find this rather intrusive regarding my privacy, not to mention unprofessional and quite barbaric. And no, there have been no reports of any sort of fraudulent activity on my account that I know of, my track of record is excellent there, and they have already verified my account about 8 years ago. The company is based in California, USA, I am based in the EU, Romania.  Are there any USA / EU / international laws protecting my privacy over the internet that I could enforce upon them ? Do I stand a fair chance of winning such a lawsuit ?  Thank you

Post: I received a letter from our landlord today (fairly large apartment building) claiming that multiple other residents have filed complaints about us having marijuana  smell coming from our apartment on two occasions. They note that no smoking of any kind is allowed anywhere on the property and that according to a human rights tribunal decision landlords are now permitted to give a single written warning to a tenant on the issue and a second occurrence would require automatic lease termination and that the matter must be rectified by tomorrrow.  Now this is extremely unsettling to my husband and I for multiple reasons. First neither of us or any of our guest have ever smoked anything in or around the building and definitely not in our apartment. Also I am currently 8 months pregnant and we are scheduled to move out of our current apartment into another apartment run by the same management a few weeks after my due date. I am very concerned because we seem to have no way to prove our case, not only that, it would greatly effect our lives to have our lease terminated for this reason since it would mean us not being able to move into our new place at the end of september, and it would most likely prevent us from being able to find a new place to move into since the vacancy rate in our city is already about 0.5% so landlords can be extremely picky. I will obviously be talking with the building manager/landlord as soon as possible, however this is really stressing me out as I don't know how I am supposed to prove that I haven't been smoking and there seems to be nothing stopping these people from complaining again since they have done so in the past. The other detail to note is our apartment is next to the elevator which I have noticed the smell of marijuana in before.  Any suggestions as so how we should approach this would be greatly appreciated.

Post: I made an offer on a house in Georgia. The transaction uses a digital contract so you can see a verified signing date. The seller is also the broker. The seller (in her capacity as the listing agent) signed the contract 30 minutes prior to the offer expiration. She then signs the contract in her Seller capacity 6 minutes after the Offer expiration. She then allows us to do a home inspection, which cost us money. Now, she's saying because she signed it late, that we don't have a binding contract.   I believe what happened is she was waiting on another offer but it didn't come by the time our contract expired so she planned to use us as a safety net and string us along until a higher offer came in or just sell to us if it never came.  Do I have an enforceable contract?

Post: This is Washington State, US.   I applied to work for a company called [Fun Flicks](http://funflicks.com/). It was a strange process to get this job. The interview was conducted outside and was really casual. It seemed too easy to get the job. It was an unusually small amount of time from application to being on board. Almost all of our communication has been via text, and I have not been shown the building they operate out of. I gave them my application with some sensitive information on it, that's all I am worried about. None of the information seemed out of the ordinary for a job application, but it is still concerning. They said I was 'on board' in May, and nothing happened after that besides some texting about the position. The last time we talked was a month ago. It all seems very odd. I can't even find one in Washington on Google maps. Either they are sort of unprofessional, or something sinister is afoot. What can I do to check the legitimacy of this company/job offer? Is there even a scam like this? Thanks
