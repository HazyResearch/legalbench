"Hello! So here is what happened:    Back in April I paid $250 to have a self-employed stylist (she goes to people houses to do hair) to give me a ""brazilian blow-out"". For those of you who dont know what that is, here is the definition:    Brazilian hair straightening (also called Breezilian straightening, Brazilian Keratin Treatment, BKT, Brazilian Blowout, Escova Progressiva, Keratin Cure) are a semi-permanent hair straightening method done by temporarily sealing a liquid keratin and a preservative solution into the hair with a hair iron.   Typically this is supposed to last 10-12 weeks.   Well I paid her for this service, and awoke the next morning to discover my hair was a giant frizzy poofy mess (my baseline). I have had these done before in the past at salon's so I knew what to expect (not this); this was the first time I had used this individual.   I contacted her via facebook, as that was how we were communicating, informing her that her treatment did not work whatsoever and that I either want a refund or a treatment that actually works.   She blocked me.   I attempted to contact her via telephone and got no response.   Seeing as I didn't want to pay $250 for someone to shampoo and straighten my hair for an evening and given that I attempted to get a refund from her, I contacted my bank to dispute the charge on the basis of not receiving services I should have. (Of note, there was no 'no refund' agreement with this individual)  The bank decided in my favor and returned the amount to my account.   She has now charged me $250 again, without my permission and without contacting me.   Where do I go from here? Thank you in advance!"	Yes
"Bought a used car in Harris county, Houston, Texas, from a small car dealer at his residence.  Before purchasing the car, I did have a call out mechanic inspect the vehicle. After I had thoroughly inspected and driven the car.  Hours after purchasing the car, the IMA (Honda Civic Hybrid battery) and the catalytic converter are showing errors.  We have already paid $3,700 for the car cash in hand and owe him $400 for the cost of registration which was in the paperwork we signed. Also stating we would not sue and buying the vehicle in ""As is"" condition.  The seller states he can transfer the vehicle registration and that he does not need the vehicle for the vehicle inspection report.  I need a car as there is little public transport. What options do I have either for the mechanic or the seller to fix the problems with the car? Or is it possible to get my money back?"	Yes
Hello,  First time on this thread so please bear with me! First of all, thank you to everyone for taking the time to read my post.  I owe someone money (less than 9K) and signed a promissory note that I will pay the person $400 a month until the debt is paid. Recently, he told me that he was updating the addresses on the note and would like me to sign the note again with the updated addresses. This is fine, and I would read over it carefully to make sure nothing is amiss. What kind of irks me was that he wanted a photo copy of my ID, a billing statement/utility bill showing my address.  Am I legally obligated to hand over this information to this person? Thank you again for reading through this post!  **TL;DR: Person I owe money to wants a photocopy of my ID and billing statement/utility bill. Unsure if I'm obligated to give this information to him.**	Yes
"They keep referring to it as ""policy change"", but they have, in reality, altered the essence of the service provided: I have signed a contract for unlimited data for a certain price, and now they're charging me the same price for a limited amount of data.   They have issued a notice around New Year's saying that they intend to do so; I have immediately called their customer service and said that I do not accept that type of service to which they have told me that the """"new policy"" is not being rolled out yet"""" so basically to chill since is not impacting me any time soon. I have just logged into my account to discover that the data cap has been imposed for some time now without anyone contacting me after my declining of the altered service.  Does this qualify as a breach of contract given that I have specifically declined any alteration to my contract?   Again, they keep saying that it's a ""change in policy"" which, based on their standard contract terms they have the right to update, but I see it as a change in service provided since I'm now getting less for the money I'm paying and I specifically disagreed to take that cut. Thanks guys!"	Yes
We have a month to month lease and our landlord decided he wanted to go to student housing. So he notified us that we have till Aug 1st to leave (This was on July 2). Now we are moving out the 14th and have notified him via text that we are leaving. I also asked since we already paid rent for the whole month could we get back the money for the days we wont be living here plus security deposit (The place is in great shape no damage or anything).  He has not contacted me since I notified him of us moving out and asking for the money. My question is are we entitled to the money covering days we won't be living here? From my understanding from the day we leave till 30 days after, he has to give us a written review of the property and security deposit.   He has done this all though text also nothing written.	Yes
Hello, I'm an out-of-state student attending a UC campus. My father makes upwards of 500k annually as an entrepreneur and lobbyist, while I work a minimum wage retail job over summers. Naturally, I did not qualify for any need-based aid, so we had to take out a Parent Direct PLUS loan each year to cover the majority of expenses. I was under the impression that, since my father makes so much money, that he'd pay off all these loans, even moreso because the loans are entirely in his name and the FAFSA website says that the debt of these loans cannot be traditionally transferred to the child.  I just recently learned that he has been telling everyone, except me, that he was only going to provide 15k annually while I would pay off the loans myself. All my family believe his side of the story because that is all they were told. Is it possible that he could sue to somehow transfer the debt? Does him telling everyone that I'm paying for it help such a case? In general, what should I do here?	Yes
Here's what I know.   Back in March of 2017, I used my roommates phone and account for Lyft but used my card information to pay for ride. Afterward, we deleted the app and it was done.   In June, my roommate wrecked his car.   The charges were small because I didn't notice them until a week ago (end of June) and notices they were coming up more frequently.   I have probably cause that my roommate is using my card information without my permission to use Lyft.   Where do I go from here?   I called my bank and Lyft and have taken care of it on that end.	Yes
Hello all,  A little back story, my grandfather purchased a car for me in his name... I made the payments, it was insured in my name ETC.  He died last November, and my mother never had took any of the paperwork down to the bank after he died.. Fast forward to last Wednesday i went and made my payment like normal, except later that evening there was a tow truck outside of my house towing my car...  The tow truck driver said that they had been looking for the car for months etc..   What should i do? I have been told that we are able to sue BB&amp;T because they shouldn't have been taking payment for the car once it was out for repo, I am only looking to be able to finish paying for the car as there is less than 2k owed on the car....   Thanks in advance!	Yes
