"I'll start with the brief background.  My mom has been an alcoholic for just under a decade, and she dragged my dad into it for a while too. My sisters and I were emotionally abused and berated for the last 5 years or so. I was getting the most of it and would instigate to prevent it from getting to my sisters, but I was at University this last year and it got to them.  Finally, my mom got into rehab. Instead of getting better, she cheated on my dad with an alcoholic 25 years older than her in rehab and abandoned us for him after getting out. She's refusing to help with any bills, even though my dad can't cancel her off the phone plan without paying a $600+ fee. She won't help with any of my sisters' activities costs or my schooling.  I'm 19 now. I built my car up from scratch with my dad, and it was given to me for my birthday at 16. Stayed in parents' names for insurance purposes. I've got a job now and am paying my own things because my dad can't afford it all on his own, but my mom is refusing to sign anything over. She won't sign off on the title of my car to me, or even my sisters car to her. She changed our legal address on our accounts so all of our bills, which she isn't helping with at all, go to wherever she is and we can't access them.   She's literally holding everything in our life ransom because she got sober for a hot minute and ""fell in love"" with this guy and has gone completely loony on us. (Yet she keeps texting us kids how much she loves us.) As a result of this, in addition to paying my own things as I mentioned above, I'm having to send my dad hundreds of my earned money (which I desperately need because Michigan raised public university tuition prices almost 3% again this year) because he can't afford everything on his own.  She apparently wants to do an ""easier"" (I know it's never really easy) divorce that doesn't require court or anything, just filling out the documents and seeing a judge or something, I don't completely understand how it works. My dad is trying to fill out the divorce documents, but it's hard. He's been struggling massively with depression since all of this started happening. (To make it worse, my internship is 10 hours away in Minnesota, so I can't be physically there to help.)  I guess the question/advice I'm seeking, is what are our legal rights against my mom as the remainder of our family (Me, dad, sister 16, sister 14), and what are my legal rights against my mom in terms of my car, when I have my dad's backing? (The plates and everything expire this month and I don't know what to do.)  Title has MI in it, but for clarification, we live in Southwest Michigan. Even though I'm in Minnesota for the whole summer my legal address is still our home there.  Thanks everyone. I'm sorry if this was a bit too long; I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, never thought I would need to use it for something like this, though."	Yes
You know, to have best of both worlds? Keeping the wife happy by knowing I wont ever leave her empty handed, but also having all the benifits of being two separate owners of our various assets in case something happens during a business venture or whatever	Yes
I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	Yes
My friends soon to be ex husband moved from their home in Florida to Iowa. He some how made himself an account manager on her Verizon account. Then he went and charged a $1000 iPhone to her account and split the line. When she tried telling Verizon it was fraudulent they basically told her she was up the creek. Can there be legal action taken here ? 	Yes
Given that in my 23 years as their son, they've hated each other for just about every waking second. And me and my siblings have had to obviously put up with it. But for some unknown reason they just won't cut ties and get apart from each other. So I ask again: Is there some way I can force them to just end it?	Yes
My friend is in the process of getting a divorce. My friend moved back home in the mean time.   Her ex lives in Florida. She lives in NYC. He has been opening credit cards in her name and so far has spent more than $25,000 under her name. The ex has stopped all communication with her.   What are the next steps.   Thank you.	Yes
My parents got divorced when I was about 6 months old. As part of this agreement, any part of college that is not scholarships is supposed to be split 50/50 betweeen the two. Now, recently (and by recently I mean the past 4-6 years) our relationship has ceased to exist due to large disagreements between me and the rest of his family, and him, as in nobody really talks to him anymore. I just recently graduated with my Bachelors, and today received a Bill for his payment plan saying I need to pay it. In the past, he has always taken the route where he could not pay or steal what he can in regards to me. I.e. my college savings, avoiding medical bills, etc. Now that I am a completely independent adult, can I still go after him for this? Would it be worth it? For reference, its about 2 grand, and I make enough to make it go away within 3 months or so. But I have to pay back the amount of government loans i did take soon, and this may be rough if I do so.	Yes
I'm an E3 in the Navy stationed on Naval Base Ventura County in California. I'm going through a divorce with my ex at the moment and we've agreed on all the terms and all the paperwork is filed.  We're still legally married until October 26, 2017, because of California's 6 month waiting period. The problem is one of our terms is that she would take half of the credit card debt, which is in both of our names, and I would take the other half, and she has yet to make any attempts at going to the bank to take her half or to even pay me back for the past couple months where I've been the only one making payments on it.   We're still legally married, but I was wondering if I could possibly have the start of a case against her? Could I sue her now? Or do I have to wait till we're legally divorced for all of our agreements to be put into place? We filed all of the paperwork back in April. I hope the information I've provided is enough to get good answers, I'll provide more if you need more details. Thank you for your help.	Yes
