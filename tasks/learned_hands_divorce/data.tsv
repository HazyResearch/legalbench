"My ex-wife has agreed to reduce the amount of monthly alimony I give to her.. courts.ca.gov says:  ""If the spouses or domestic partners can reach an agreement on a new amount of spousal or partner support, they can write it up as an agreement/stipulation and give it to the judge for signature to have it become a new court order.""  I cannot seem to find anything that really explains how to DIY this process.  Any suggestions?  thanks!"	Yes
Long story short wife and I are going through a separation, she will be moving out for August 1st, after telling me on July 26 that she would be moving out. Anyways the issue being is I am going to stay living in the home we own together, while the house is fixed up and some renovations are done. Am i able to change the locks so she cannot come and go in what is essentially our house but my home. She has already signed a lease at her new residence, so there will be a change in address for her.	Yes
My stbxMIL is suing me, she already sued me for something else and won (mostly because it was considered a martial contract that was violated) but has since agreed to drop it in exchange for me relinquishing my half of ownership on the cars. This suit is for a bunch of stuff, most of it is money she gave to him for various things before we got married and the money never went through my hands. There was one thing that we were married for but there was no agreement attached to it like her first suit and a couple of other things that I probably won't be able to get out of. She is also pursuing almost $1,000 for emotional trauma. Earlier this year she kicked me out, pushed me to my limits and ended up calling the police and filing a protective order. I want to countersue for emotional damages but I'm not sure for how much and all of that. It is small claims. Any advice is much appreciated	Yes
Hi r/legal! Recently split up with my s/o and am now in the process of setting up a new life for myself. While with s/o, we had an arrangement for rent/bills. Basically everything was split 50/50 including mortgage. The mortgage was paid off earlier this year and since February, we have both been setting aside money to pay property taxes and insurance at the end of the year. I still continued to pay my half of utilities while putting the property tax/insurance money aside in my savings account.   S/o is now asking me to give him all the money that I've saved up for that, now that I've left.   Am I legally obligated to pay him back?	Yes
My parents got officially divorced in 2014, but were in the process since 2012. My dad defaulted on his 2012 taxes which was the last year that my parents' names appeared together in any tax capacity. The IRS then expected my mom to pay off the 2012 taxes ($35000) that my dad owed, which she did recently. There is A LOT of bad blood between them.   My mom doesn't want to spend any more money on lawyers to try to get him to pay so she now fully expects me to try and get the money from him. I'm a college student who is now very stressed by the burden of his parents' tax situation.	Yes
Earlier this year, my ex husband stole money from me ($600 to be exact). We were still going through the divorce when he took the money. We ended up going to mediation for the divorce, and the money he stole was put in the mediation papers. Those papers later went into the judgement of divorce. The divorce was finalized a month ago, so now he legally has to pay me back. The agreement in the papers was for him to pay me back within 90 days of the date of mediation, which was back in April. He is refusing to pay. What should I do? Should I go through small claims?	Yes
I don't know if he ever changed his legal/ mailing address. I never evicted him or anything like that. He was free to come and go as he chose. I filed for divorce, he signed the papers and has since cut off contact with friends and family and stopped showing up for work. His current location is unknown.   He spent most of his time in the basement. I am trying to clean it. It was filled with empty beer cans, broken glass, tobacco, and piles of dirty clothes directly on the cement floor. I want to dispose of these clothes. Can I do that legally?  He has other items in my home (a home in my name, purchased before I was married. His name is not on the mortgage.) including a couch and many golf clubs.  I live in Connecticut, USA.	Yes
My friend is going through a contentious divorce right now. She has asked me to give a deposition and possibly testify for her. I really want to, but have an underlying concern holding me back.   They both have a history if drug use, and I have smoked pot with both of them in the past. The things she wants me to testify about have nothing to do with drugs, so I guess my question rests with the likelihood that I would be questioned about my own drug use and what the consequences would be. Is it possible that testifying to that could mess up job, adoption, or similar prospects for myself down the line? Also, my friend seems to think I might get drug tested for agreeing to be a witness. Is that right? I really just want a clear understanding of what I'm getting into if I agree to do this.    Do they drug test witnesses in situations like this?	Yes
I live in Washington state.  About 4 years ago, the ex and I decided to replace the house on the property as it was in serious disrepair (had been a rental before we owned it and the ex refused to do work on it and I didn't know how, so it was in bad shape at this point).  I suggested we consider a manufactured home, we looked at what was for sale and bought one that the state inspector said was a nice one when he gave it the once-over for the occupancy certificate.  I bought 1800 square feet of well-insulated, well-built housing for $25K, and I believe I got a very good deal.   Two years later the marriage ended.  In trying to figure out how to refinance the mortgage (which has subsequently been paid off) I discovered reverse mortgages.  This looked like a good way to obtain the money to continue my education, pay bills, etc. after the money from the divorce ran out.  AFAIK, in WA all reverse mortgage lenders/underwriters are FHA approved, meaning they are required to follow the rules that the FHA (and by extension, its parent agency HUD) makes.  Nothing gave me any reason to believe I would be refused a reverse mortgage.    However, one of those rules (24 CFR 203.43f(d)iii) is that if, in the past, if someone ever moved their manufactured home from its first placement, no mortgage will be insured.  When I said to the lender in passing that I'd gotten a good deal on the house and moved it to my property, she said 'HUD/FHA has a rule that if you moved your house you can't get a mortgage.  Since I have prior professional experience with manufactured home movement, I know from that and research into this that the regulation has no basis in law, and in fact violates federal law in that it imposes a penalty without prior notice and is retroactive without prior authorization from Congress.    When I was refused, however, there was no contract signed as yet.  The process is that you go to the lender, find out how much you can get (theoretically), get counseled (and I've owned several pieces of real estate so a lot of this is I already know) and then go back to the lender to start the process of getting the house appraised, etc., etc.  Appraisers are required to report on whether or not a house has been moved, so the visual evidence, or an appraiser searching the tax roll, will give that fact away, so before I've 'signed anything', I've been refused a mortgage.  Note that in Yesler Terrace Community v. Cisneros, the Ninth Circuit said that the third-party implementation of HUD/FHA rules, even if it did not immediately apply to the plaintiffs, did not deny them standing.  How can I prove injury-in-fact when I haven't even got the chance to sign anything?  Would a formal letter of refusal from the lender citing the federal regulation do it?	Yes
"Sorry I've never poster in this sub so not sure if this is the right place.  My wife and I use to work together at the same small company years ago. I left there about 3 years ago for another job and my wife still works there. The company owner is a nice person but he used to do some subtle shady shit that made me think he was scamming people. A decade ago he asked me to photoshop and change some information on a contract that had already been signed by someone. Other weird things.  Anyways.  My wife calls me the other day to tell me what had happened at work that day. Her and another co-worker were trying to remember the owner's middle name because he was really embarrassed of it and they thought it would be funny to put it on some gag gift, so they started googling his name to see if it would pull up. On the first page of results, it showed some marriage records stating that the owner had just gotten married in 2006. Um thats weird. Owner, has been married to his wife since the early 90's. They even have two kids in college. Everybody at that office knows his wife (who is a financial planner) and she is very active at office events and friendly to everybody. Some of the older employees even went to their wedding in the 90's. She is very sweet and they are very loving to each other and don't seem to have any major problems in their marriage.   Scrolling down in the google results she finds divorce records for them in about the year 2000. My wife's co-worker starts to remember that years back, when she would check the office mail, that the owner would receive child support payment notices and she never really thought about it at the time. Everybody in this office is very close and would know if the owner had divorced his wife and remarried to her years later. My wife brought this info to her manager who has been an employee there since the owner started the company. She had been at their wedding in the 90's. She had house sat for them during this time they would have been divorced. Me and my wife even house sat for them while they would have been divorced. My wife's manager was weirded out about this whole thing and told her to delete her search history and not bring it up to anyone else.  So to get to my point: We are pretty sure the owner of this company and his wife (who is a financial planner at a large financial company) officially divorced on paper, kept living together telling no one, the owner paid child support to his ""ex"" wife to keep up appearances, and then secretly re-married on paper years later telling no one.   Is this some sort of tax scam? How could someone benefit from being legally divorced on paper from their spouse while still actually being married to each other and then secretly re-marry years later? I can try to get more details if it helps solve this mystery. Thanks"	Yes
My wife recently filed charges on me and dropped them today after she realized they were felony charges. We are going through a divorce and she is now threatening to bring the charges back up if I don't agree to her terms of divorce. Can they be brought back up? 	Yes
Hi there, this is really sad and scary, but I think we've reached a point where we would no longer be helping our kids or ourselves to continue living together, and our goal will need to be divorce for everyone's happiness. That said, before I talk to my wife about this and we formalize a plan, I am looking for some advice about things I need to pay attention to to ensure equitable treatment around custody and financial wellbeing should things ever get to a contested divorce or otherwise acrimonious.  Children: My wife and I have child together (2) and a stepchild (7) (she is bio mom). We are on good terms with the father and he sees his child on weekend days.   Finances: We have separate accounts. My wife holds over $30K in debt on various cards and student loans. I have a few thousand debt on a line of credit. My name is on all the house papers and mortgage etc., hers was left off at time of purchase because we couldn't qualify for the mortgage with her debt. I can't see either one of us being able to hold onto the house if we divorce, we will need to sell it.  My fears are specific--that my wife will go on an out of control spending/gambling spree (she has a historic gambling problem) during a year of separation. She gets bitter and grudgey and this clouds her thinking when she is angry. Or, that my wife will play some unbeknownst to me card that allows her full custody of our child.   Any advice about steps to take before, during, or after discussions of separation would be appreciated.	Yes
"After a few years of suspicion, I found out my father is having an affair (still married to mother). I have a few questions, so I will be brief. Please feel free to respond to one or all of my questions.   First, I admit that I caught him by going through his emails. He wrote down his email/passwords in his journal, and I found it; I looked through his inbox and discovered many things. I discovered that he is dating a young woman with a child (not his) and he has been sending her money through Paypal (because I also discovered his paypal account). He has been telling this young woman that he is in the middle of a divorce from my mother (he is not), and that my mother is ""stalling"" by ""not signing the papers"".    He sent his girlfriend an email (fwd) from his lawyer, talking about the Judge (who does not exist) looking at the case. However, his lawyer does not really exist either; my father created this lawyer, created his email address, and proceeds to email himself, so that he can fwd the email to his girlfriend, making it look official. I apologize if that sounds confusing.  Additionally, he has told this lady that he served the Iraq/Kuwait conflict (he did not) and he created an email address for a soldier he ""served with"" who does not exist. He then emailed himself, as this character he created, and gave this detailed story, making himself look like a war hero. This story he made up was meant to serve as a character witness to the Judge (who doesn't exist) for his divorce (which is not happening).  My questions: **1)** Since I went through his emails and other accounts to find this information, have I committed a crime? **2)** Has my father committed a crime (fraud?) by telling this woman he is getting a divorce? What about the lawyer, judge, and character witness he made up? **3)** Has my father committed a crime with the ""war hero story"" he made up? He claimed to have ""turned down the medal of honor"" ..is this stolen valor? **4)** His Paypal account has a few bank cards linked to it. He and my mother run a family business, in which my mother is the owner. If he has been sending his girlfriend funds from a business account, is this a form of laundering?  Again, I apologize for the length of this post, but there is a lot to describe, and I really don't have anyone to go to with all of this."	Yes
Wisconsin; can she legally take my truck if its titled tehninjamonkey or ms tenhinjamonkey as apposed to the word and? I need this truck so i can get to work to pay child support.	Yes
A friend is married in both Brazil and California. She got married here then registered it in Brazil. Now her ex is paying for the divorce in Brazil- does she have to pay again to get divorced here? Or will California recognize a divorce that is completed in Brazil then Officially translated? Divorce in Brazil was only $200, in California over $700.	Yes
I'm behind on a loan payment I agreed to pay and have missed a couple of payment. Now my ex-wife is threatening to have me held in contempt of court. Does anyone have any idea what will happen in this situation if I can't pay?	Yes
Hi reddit.   So he gave me the engagement ring a few years ago and recently I found out he had been cheating on me for months. Now he is asking for my engagement ring back.   I looked online and found out that unless he specified when he gave it to me that he would want it back should we split up, he is not entitled to it. Well, he never informed me before the split that he wanted it back, and it was a gift, and he was the one who cheated causing the relationship to end.   So does he have any leverage at all?   Thank you for reading, any help is appreciated.	Yes
So my mother just called me to let me know that her tenant informed her that a man had moved in boxes to the garage and was sleeping there. Turns out its my dad! They have been separated over 20 years. He just left one day and that was that. They never divorced and the mortgage is still under both their names. I didn't see my dad after that or talked to him until maybe 2 years ago when he randomly contacted me to get money. My mom had tried contacting him before about refinancing house to remove his name from loan with no luck. We would hear about him from time to time as he remained in the area. She wants to ask him to leave but she thinks he will still stay because it is still his house. What can be done in a situation like this? Obviously she needs to divorce him.	Yes
So my friends sister is married to a marine. They have been married for nine months. Yesterday he served her divorce papers but would not let her see the papers. He now is telling her today that if she doesn't sign by 5am tomorrow then he is going to go to the court and say she is refusing to sign them. With a quick Google search it looks like she has 30 days before he can do anything. But he is refusing to let her even see the papers so she can't sign even if she wanted to. What's her best course of action? Thanks! 	Yes
We married in 2016. She has about $50k in student debt. She has family about an hour, hour and a halfish from her school, where she also works part-time. We have split rent about 75%:25% since we moved in together.	Yes
I'm an E3 in the Navy stationed on Naval Base Ventura County in California. I'm going through a divorce with my ex at the moment and we've agreed on all the terms and all the paperwork is filed.  We're still legally married until October 26, 2017, because of California's 6 month waiting period. The problem is one of our terms is that she would take half of the credit card debt, which is in both of our names, and I would take the other half, and she has yet to make any attempts at going to the bank to take her half or to even pay me back for the past couple months where I've been the only one making payments on it.   We're still legally married, but I was wondering if I could possibly have the start of a case against her? Could I sue her now? Or do I have to wait till we're legally divorced for all of our agreements to be put into place? We filed all of the paperwork back in April. I hope the information I've provided is enough to get good answers, I'll provide more if you need more details. Thank you for your help.	Yes
My wife and I are splitting, we're divorcing, we're done. Not going to get into who's fault or whatever, but there's a big issue.   She took my debit card, basically taking access away from money. Basically she decided to hold the money over my head. The account is joint, I have a card with my name on it and she has one with ours and it goes to the same account. She would basically give me cash when I got paid and tell me to get another bank account, which I eventually did but the latest paycheck still went into the account. She would drop the money off and yet I wouldn't get the full amount. Basically she's leaving me with nothing and also controlling how much I can have. She told me she is closing the account so I will no longer have access to it. Fine. We need to split.   Here's the twist... I found the card. Apparently she didn't think to chop the damn thing out before throwing away (and apparently she needs to work on her skills because she missed the garbage can) And the account isn't closed. I check the balance and found she has a lot more money than previously thought. I'm sitting here with my card wondering if I have any right to withdraw whatever money I want. And I'm confused... Do I? I mean... It's our account, she took my debit card, and the card has my name on it..... What do I do? I need to pay bills, I have a mouth to feed and she just left me with nothing. I could take the loss and wait until I get paid again but during this split she's done nothing reasonable. Everything done, especially the money situation, has been uncalled for. It may sound mean, and like I'm trying to get revenge but that's not what I want. I just don't want to starve the next two weeks. So... Do I have a right to withdraw the money?	Yes
Hello My wife and I agreed that we need a divorce. We are aiming for uncontested divorce.  We have been married for 4 years - we have reached a point after counseling and therapy  And multiple attempts that our relationship is toxic and we need to end our marriage. This is so overwhelming to me as I am ali dealing with my ill father and finding work which adds up stress. Now we both can't afford a lawyer in the Los Angeles area and need to find legal help to do the paper work properly. Since we neither can't afford at the time to get our own place we will have to live together till divorce is final and also since we have three months on our apartments lease- can we still live together while seeking divorce? Does it really take all 6 months till we get divorce decree? Is it possible to get a Probono lawyer to help us submit the uncontested divorce paperwork?  We only share a car loan debt of 9000$ no assets or property we own and no children. This breaks my heart as I love her and it's days before my birthday as well as my fathers third surgery. I don't know what to do or how to go about this- it will definetly cause me financial hardship now that I am currently unemployed and she works part time  I can use any piece of advice or experience I can get from those who have walked down that line	Yes
Essentials: Ex had a dog before we were married. After divorce, she asked me (via saved text messages) to take care of said dog until she found a place that allows pets. 18 months later, and with only one attempt to visit the dog 14 months ago, she's moved to California. I'm renting at the same house since the divorce, and the ex provided the $500 pet deposit for the dog at my house. Assuming no further contact, what do I do about the deposit money when I move next year?	Yes
My friends soon to be ex husband moved from their home in Florida to Iowa. He some how made himself an account manager on her Verizon account. Then he went and charged a $1000 iPhone to her account and split the line. When she tried telling Verizon it was fraudulent they basically told her she was up the creek. Can there be legal action taken here ? 	Yes
(Michigan)  Their marriage lasted from may 2015 to may 2017. He owns a pizzeria that I currently manage. He opened it with his own money in 2008. They were in a relationship at the time and she worked there with him and put all profit in their combined personal bank account. She's now suing for lost wages. Since their marriage he's allowed her to pursue her hobbies and be free from work. She had the affair in august 2016. He caught her. They gave it another shot. May 2017, she's at it again. He had to end it. She's also trying to sue for a piece of the business. Any advice would help.	Yes
My partner and I are divorcing in San Diego California.  We agreed to go our separate ways, divide our stuff on our own, and just end it.  I moved out and filed the paperwork, and they lawyer-ed up and are now asking for more than agreeing to.  My question is can I, as the petitioner, amend what I am asking for from the court?  There are no children together, or anything too complicated like property or large 401K's.  We make almost the same amount of money, the marriage lasted 2 years.  Just dept and assets acquired during the marrage.  I have an appointment with my own lawyer next week.	Yes
Throw away for obvious reasons!  The gist of this is the soon to be ex wife filed a false PFA against the soon to be ex husband. Ex husband DID NOT plead guilty, but DID take a plea deal to make things easier and to avoid a battle. STBXWife currently has sole legal and physical custody, and STBXHusband is paying support on kids. Children are allowed to text dad, set up times and places to meet dad, etc.   However. Things the kids have said have made dad think the home environment has become seriously harmful and STBXWife has become uncontrollably irresponsible.  To avoid involving the kids and asking they testify against their mother, the option of a PI was brought up.  STBXHusband knows where she lives, as she's still in the marital home with no intention of leaving (which is no issue). Knows where she works as she owns her own business. The PFA is essentially a court enforced no contact. It states STBXHusband isn't allowed to contact via third party or otherwise. But this isn't contacting.  As the divorce is proceeding, is STBXHusband allowed to hire a PI to get specific information to use in said divorce and subsequent custody battle?	Yes
"My parents were in the process of renovating an expensive historic home when they divorced, ten years ago.   The mortgage has been paid one way or another since then, but nobody has liven in it, but both are still on the mortgage.  Parent A would like to get the home to rentable condition, and start making income. A has already invested money in restoring the home.  Parent B would like nothing to do with Parent A, hence why this issue has not been addressed for so long.   Parent A is concerned about Parent B coming after A's rental income or the value of the property, and wants B to sign a ""quit claim deed"", eliminating A's interest in the property.   I advised B not to sign anything, after some googleing suggested that this would not eliminate the responsibility to pay the mortgage.   Would it be possible to informally draft a contract that covers these concepts? Or is an attorney strongly advised in this situation?  - While A pays the mortgage, B won't make any claims or interfere. - If A pays off the mortgage (or refinances), B will sign the quit claim deed.  Both have a large amount of illiquid assets.   Any other advice?"	Yes
"The ""tenant"" is actually my dad and my mom is kicking him out of our house. They thought they could make it work after the divorce but obviously not. This is her house 100% (bought after the divorce) and we're in Iowa.  Is there anything she can do to make sure he doesn't take anything he's not suppose to? She's already noticed some of her antiques missing.  Dad plays dirty.  Please help ease my poor mother's mind."	Yes
"Hi guys, I had a few questions regarding property ownership rights and financial rights in California.  My wife and I are going through a divorce, we have a a house together and joint credit card, checking and savings.  In short what are my my rights to the money in the checking and savings.  Also, what should I do with the property, what does it mean for her to ""buy me out"" regarding the property?    If you're curious about the situation, please see my previous posts.  In a gist we have a house which she says I don't contribute enough, even though she knew before hand that I would be on deployment and have my own living expenses."	Yes
I'll try to keep this as short as possible... Divorce in 2012 - Ex Wife was awarded the home and signed a decree agreeing to refinance the home within 60 days and hold me harmless. She has never done this and is constantly late. She is up to 120 days past due now and I finally was able to contact her through a friend's cell phone and she says she's filing bankruptcy and to contact her attorney.  Is there anything I can do or should I just go ahead and file bankruptcy.	Yes
Question. Me and my ex got divorce about 7 years ago. In the MSA, she got the house.  The title/ deed and mortgage are still both still in my name. She wants me just sign the deed over so she can refinance, but I don't trust just signing over the deed without her promising to payoff the existing mortgage and releasing me from liability to the house and mortgage.  Do I need any other paperwork or is the MSA and deed transfer enough?	Yes
I am one week from moving to a new state and out of nowhere my wife wants a divorce. We have a toddler aged daughter. She had been the one pleading for the move. Ive already quit my current job, and cannot get it back. I have no option financially but to take this job. The job pays significantly more than what I am making now. I am freaking out, if i leave the state, am i giving up all the rights to my daughter? She is hounding me now about rescinding our notice and allowing her to stay in the house we are renting. I am in shock right now. She locked me out of the house with no access to a car. I am worried ill never see my daughter again.  I am contacting lawyers and getting answering services. Hoping one gets back to me soon. Just hoping someone could give me some guidance here. I am completely stuck.	Yes
"Location: Colorado  I'm in my mid-20s. My mom was recently served with a ""Petition for Dissolution of Marriage"" document by my stepdad. I went over to talk to her about it, and she started handing me things to bring back to my place. These include legal documents for the ownership of several valuable horses that she owns ($20k+) as well as two guns that she uses for horse-mounted shooting (if it matters, they're crippled guns only capable of shooting blanks).  I have a suspicion that this was the wrong decision, but I just took the items from her and put them in my car because she was crying and I just didn't know what to do in the moment. She also tried to get me to take my half sister's passport (she's a minor), but I refused to take that.  What sort of legal risk am I at for being in possession of these items? I believe the Dissolution of Marriage document states that she's not allowed to hide assets."	Yes
"Hi,  Im in the UK. Me and my wife separated when i found out she was having an affair. Her dad wants to buy my share of the house we own.  Bit of background: Her parents gave us £44k deposit for a £220k house. They said it was a gift and it was her inheritance early. Due to this, the house was split 60/40 in her favour. I have all this in emails.  As i said, she had a few affairs so we are separated, we cant afford to divorce at the min. We also have a little girl who was born after we bought the property. Her father has offered to buy my 40%. He is claiming that as the house is now worth £250k and was worth 220k when we bought it, i am only entitled to 40% of the profit (about £12k for 40% share).   I told him that it was from the equity of the property (we owe £160k so that would be £90k equity. 40% being £36k) he said that because he put down the deposit that that should be deducted and he ""isnt just giving that inherritance money away to me.""  As the property is split 60/40 in my ex wifes favour because of that inherritance am i correct in thinkong that i am entitled to the whole £36k?   12 grand for 40% of a 250k house with 90k equity seems very underhanded to me. But we are keen to do this without a  horrible divorce and court battle.  Any advice appreciated! (Sorry for all the numbers)"	Yes
A quick question to you brilliant legal minds since I haven't really been able to find a good answer on the Google.  In short, my brother's divorce is going to end in a trial. He has exhausted all other avenues and the case manager finally recommended trial. His lawyer, unfortunately, recently moved provinces and is no longer representing him because of that.  While he, and everyone around him, knows that it would be best if he hired representation, there just isn't money for it.  However, we're wondering if he can ask his former lawyer to be a witness at the trial or is that some sort of conflict?  Thank you!	Yes
Can I get in trouble for anonymously registering a domain name (let's say janesmithsucks.com if Jane Smith was my ex) and publishing true things (I could all prove in court if needed) things about my ex wife. No pictures or revenge porn or anything like that, but needless to say though they would not be things that painted her in a positive light.	Yes
"I'm trying to find a job so I can afford to leave an unhealthy marriage. My immature husband cannot handle this like an adult and is now telling me that if I'm not gone (from our apartment) in a week, he's going to call lawyers and the authorities. Because he makes 90% of our household income and pays rent etc. he feels he has the legal hand and that he can kick me out because I'm a ""squatter"" who is ""taking advantage of him"". Both our names are on the lease. I give him money monthly (we have separate bank accounts) to contribute to expenses but it isn't much. Is there any legal authority he can take with regards to living space?"	Yes
Hi all.  My lawyer is on vacation for another week, so looking for some general guidance until she returns. It looks like I may need to make some decisions before she gets back.   I live in Massachusetts and am in the middle of an uncontested divorce with my husband. We are selling our marital home and I will be buying a new one in my name only. It looks like the house sale and new purchase will take place during the divorce nisi process. Is there something I should do to protect myself when making an offer on my new place to prevent my soon-to-be-ex-husband from having a claim to the title?   Thanks!	Yes
My dad is going through a divorce in Indiana. He inherited a 50% stake in his mothers house (in Ohio) when she died. His brother inherited the other 50%. I know that Inheritance can be considered marital property in Indiana divorce law, unlike most other states where inheritance is not included as marital property.   What factor does his brother owning 50% stake in the house have in the court calculation to split inherited property in divorce?  Thanks.	Yes
I am unable to locate my ex-spouse.  We are in contact with their lawyer; however, the lawyer will only accept service if we delay our case conference--I would like to maintain our case conference date so we can start filing motions.  However, they have mail forwarding from the house to their new address.  Can I send registered mail with return receipt / signature to the house, and let Canada Post deal with forwarding it to their new address?  Is this acceptable as service?  Does this make sense?	Yes
She has a psychiatrist, therapist, and will be taken to a mental hospital soon. She wants to know if she can be required to give the name/s of her rapist and if she can be punished for not doing so. She lives in Ohio.	Yes
Been married for a little over two years. She's unemployed, but collects Social Security benefits as a representative payee for her kids (the kids dad died last year). I realize that alimony laws are different from state to state. Therefore, does anyone have any specific knowledge about alimony laws for Alabama?	Yes
"Hi, r/legaladvice  I'm at work and on mobile so forgive any issues formatting and I'm also going to try to keep this as short as possible.  Back story: Wife and I together 5 years, only married for 3 months before we separated. She moved out because she had been seeing someone behind my back for a while, fell in love with him and moved in with him.  Prior to that I worked. When she took a new, much higher paying job that also allowed her to be home more (but on call) her hours changed and was unable to keep her kids (2 boys from previous marriage) as often as she liked. She asked me to leave my low-ish paying job so we didn't have to deviate from the kids' schedule they'd had for years. I reluctantly agreed, but did and hadn't worked in about a year.   Fast forward to us getting married then her shortly moving out abruptly. This left me with the rental lease on our home (though the lease is in both our names) and forced to somehow come up with rent money with no job on a home I could not afford by myself.  I quickly went back to work but making roughly $1600/month and paying almost $900 in rent + utilities just wasn't happening. Her and I agreed I would move out by the end of July, splitting the rent until then, and then she would move back in with new boyfriend. Fine whatever as far as I was concerned.  I have been doing my best to save up money to move while sharing rent and utilities with her for 3 months, but it's not easy to save up the roughly $1500 I need to move on my security salary.  I told her this last month and she agreed (in text message, I still have) that she would pay rent for July and August and I would be out by the end of August. Last week my landlord came by saying rent has not bee paid and she called him saying she was not going to pay it. She had changed her mind.  Now my landlord has filed eviction on me, and my court date is the 26th of this month. I do not have the money I need to move out by then, and no friends or family to stay with. My mother lives an hour away in a retirement home and cannot have overnight visitors.  My question is, assuming I'm not out by my court date of the 26th, how long do I have to be out before my landlord can start removing my belongings and lock me out? Do I have any legal protection at all considering the circumstances?   I also would like to add - and this is speculation - that I have very good reason to believe that my landlord and my ex are working together on this. He is not responding to text or phone calls from me, nor is she. I know good and well she wants to move back into our home with her new dude because he has kids, plus her and her kids and it's my understanding that his two bedroom is just too small, whereas I have 4 rooms. The landlord has had a ""thing"" for my ex for sometime and their families are close knit. He was always very rude with me and her and I used to both joke it's because he's jealous of me.  Thank you in advance for any help.  (This is South Carolina btw)"	Yes
"[Throwaway for legal reasons]  Hello everyone,  As the title says. I'm looking to divorce my wife. I've been out of the military since June 2016 and am now on Inactive Ready Reserves. We got married in October 2014. In April of 2015, she gave me 6000 dollars to put down on my vehicle. While in the military and once I got out I have been financially supporting her while she attended college full time. I am working full time and going to school full time. In March of 2016 we co-signed a vehicle which I am the primary holder. We have two dogs. I have been paying all the bills  Move Forward to now. I have moved out of the house. The house is her aunt's. I met a woman who I kissed(which will be talked later). That's it. Now she found out, and is threatening to take me to court if I don't pay her back the 6000 dollars and pay for the damages the dogs did to the house. She is also threatening to call my commander and tell them I committed ""adultery"". I am receiving VA benefits, and a disability check which she wants to take away. She wants me to pay for her bills until they add up to the 6000 dollars plus the damages. I am just looking for the best way to handle this because I'm honestly unsure of what to do. Any and all help will be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much."	Yes
I have severe anxiety issues and my father said that there should be a witness on the hearing which he read on a letter that was given to him. I don't know what I should be doing as a witness since I've never been in one and it just makes me scared thinking about it.   My step-mom is the plaintiff and she said she would not be bringing anyone.   EDIT: My father is perfectly okay of me not being there. He is just making sure if there is a need to have a witness on court.    	Yes
You know, to have best of both worlds? Keeping the wife happy by knowing I wont ever leave her empty handed, but also having all the benifits of being two separate owners of our various assets in case something happens during a business venture or whatever	Yes
"Hi all, my wife and I bought a house in Silicon Valley almost a year ago.  I was on deployment so I was not home.  We used my VA loan, I put down $10k and she put down $72k down payment; this was after we had a joint account.  He family, mother, father, brother live in their house rent free for almost a year now.  Her uncle lives there with $1,000/month rent.  I'm back home now, and our relationship is very rocky.  I can't handle the constant verbal abuse and her caustic nature day in an day out.  I want out.    The problem is she cut down 4, 70ft birch trees in our back yard while I was gone, tore up all the grass and did the same to the front yard.  She wants to remodel everything.  I feel suffocated in this this house.  Should I wait to finish the remodeling and file divorce or do it now?  I'm going to get a divorce, but I want to hear your advices too.  I can't pull equity on the house until one year and as it is, the property price probably dropped due to her ""renovations""."	Yes
I'm in NY and preparing for a divorce and have a quick question, since I haven't been to a lawyer yet and am trying to anticipate things in advance in order to make a rough plan.  We own a house but have only about $8000 in equity. We've decided the best option is for me to keep the house. I am assuming this means he will just owe me $8000 less (since I will be receiving half of his retirement funds, etc.) but he seems to think that the court will order half the cost of the entire house deducted from what he is supposed to pay me. (So, including all the money that we still owe the bank.) That doesn't seem right to me, I'm just curious if anybody could help me out with what to expect.	Yes
We live in Ohio, and my mom said if my stepdad found out she was cheating he would get a divorce settlement and not a disillusion.  She told me he'd get half of everything she owns - her savings, her retirement fund, and most importantly the house. She'd have to sell the house so she could give him half of its worth.  The thing is, they've only been married for two years. She makes house payments to the bank, but she's not renting. We've had this house for 17 years, so I feel like he would have no right to get any of it since he only moved in two years ago, but I don't know if that's how the legality of it works.  They bought two cars during their marriage, and he's a car salesman so they came from his place of work. How would this factor into the settlement?  I'm going through a lot, so my mind is just flooded with confusion. I tried googling this stuff, but I think information attuned to my situation would be the most helpful.	Yes
"I live in Oklahoma. Roughly a year ago, while still married, my sex life was in a rut in my marriage, and I went on The Pirate Bay, clicked on recent porn uploads, and downloaded about 15 of the most recent files. My wife found these files and went through them, she confronted me and told me she thought some of them were underage. They were mostly amateur porn, and while I didn't see anything that indicated under 18 (appeared to be in dorm-rooms, indicating college age), I deleted the files out of concern for violating the law and because my wife didn't want me to have them.    For roughly a year now, she has brought up the photos during conflicts (roughly half a dozen times). She apparently saved them to her computer right away, and has been using them to settle arguments by threatening to go to the police. In May I decided to leave the marriage, and these photos have come up several times since then to get me to back down from demands regarding material possessions and keep me from arguing.    It seems like blackmail, I don't have the best documentation though, just a few text messages (most was over the phone or in person)    6/10/17 ""I look forward to all of the underage porn of yours that I get to show in court""    5/24/17 ""I have...so much underage porn that came from your laptop!""    And then one talking about how we would discuss the porn in marriage counseling, can't quote it without butchering it to avoid sharing personal info.    I've avoided doing anything about this out of fear that I would get in trouble for potentially downloading illegal pornography. This evening she has been threatening to share it with my boss and with the police, and I'm not sure what to do. Do I contact the police? Do I lawyer up? Is this blackmail if there weren't recorded demands, only threats?"	Yes
My mother-in-law is about to visit my wife and I for 3 days (Thursday night, leaving Sunday evening.)  We have strong reasons to believe that MiL's spouse will attempt to have her served for divorce, while she's staying with us.  (His motivations would likely be: (1) doesn't have to deal with her in the immediate aftermath, since she'll be 200 miles away (2) snubbing my wife and I for perceived past transgressions, and (3) MiL might be inclined to ask to stay with us, rather than return to a tension-filled situation at her domicile  (a request that my wife and I would unanimously deny.)  While we don't want to interfere with the court, we also don't want to be used as pawns in MiL's current-husband's game.  Asking her not to come is not an option that I am allowed to consider.  So I want to know where the legal limits are on how I can delay service until after we have returned her home.  * Are we allowed to lie to a process server, and claim that she is not present at our house, when she is? * If we decide to just put her up in a hotel room &amp; visit her there-- taking other precautions to not be followed-- can the court's process server just hand the documents over to another adult at my residence, and consider her properly served?	Yes
"This is in Nevada, Clark county.   I am helping pay for a relative's divorce. It is not going smoothly, but I don't need to get into the relationship part of it here. What I'm concerned about is that I am not being told the truth about the legal proceedings, court dates, etc. I would like to verify a few things without relying on the word of this relative.  For instance, this relative has said he has appeared in court a number of times due to the soon-to-be-ex ""filing things against him"" and ""dragging him into court"". So there should be a record of that somewhere, right? Can I look up that kind of thing online?  There have definitely been custody hearings for their minor children. Are records of those publicly available?  Their court date for the divorce hearing has supposedly been postponed several times and is now allegedly scheduled for October. Again, is there a way I can verify this without going through my relative (or his lawyer)?  You may have discerned by now that I am not happy paying for this relative's divorce, and you would be correct. There are lots of relationship issues going on in the background and perhaps I will make another post to discuss those. This post is just to learn how I can get more information to verify if I am being told the truth or not about what is going on."	Yes
"I'll start with the brief background.  My mom has been an alcoholic for just under a decade, and she dragged my dad into it for a while too. My sisters and I were emotionally abused and berated for the last 5 years or so. I was getting the most of it and would instigate to prevent it from getting to my sisters, but I was at University this last year and it got to them.  Finally, my mom got into rehab. Instead of getting better, she cheated on my dad with an alcoholic 25 years older than her in rehab and abandoned us for him after getting out. She's refusing to help with any bills, even though my dad can't cancel her off the phone plan without paying a $600+ fee. She won't help with any of my sisters' activities costs or my schooling.  I'm 19 now. I built my car up from scratch with my dad, and it was given to me for my birthday at 16. Stayed in parents' names for insurance purposes. I've got a job now and am paying my own things because my dad can't afford it all on his own, but my mom is refusing to sign anything over. She won't sign off on the title of my car to me, or even my sisters car to her. She changed our legal address on our accounts so all of our bills, which she isn't helping with at all, go to wherever she is and we can't access them.   She's literally holding everything in our life ransom because she got sober for a hot minute and ""fell in love"" with this guy and has gone completely loony on us. (Yet she keeps texting us kids how much she loves us.) As a result of this, in addition to paying my own things as I mentioned above, I'm having to send my dad hundreds of my earned money (which I desperately need because Michigan raised public university tuition prices almost 3% again this year) because he can't afford everything on his own.  She apparently wants to do an ""easier"" (I know it's never really easy) divorce that doesn't require court or anything, just filling out the documents and seeing a judge or something, I don't completely understand how it works. My dad is trying to fill out the divorce documents, but it's hard. He's been struggling massively with depression since all of this started happening. (To make it worse, my internship is 10 hours away in Minnesota, so I can't be physically there to help.)  I guess the question/advice I'm seeking, is what are our legal rights against my mom as the remainder of our family (Me, dad, sister 16, sister 14), and what are my legal rights against my mom in terms of my car, when I have my dad's backing? (The plates and everything expire this month and I don't know what to do.)  Title has MI in it, but for clarification, we live in Southwest Michigan. Even though I'm in Minnesota for the whole summer my legal address is still our home there.  Thanks everyone. I'm sorry if this was a bit too long; I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, never thought I would need to use it for something like this, though."	Yes
So.    My ex was arrested for child porn and i am divorcing him.  He is now filing motion after motion to delay not only his trial, but our divorce.    I can't get legal aid because of the circumstances, and don't have the money to get a lawyer.  I know Florida tends to have the spouse who has custody stay withibk 50 miles of the other parent, but I need to get out   Any ideas, info, advice....  Would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
My father is dying of cancer and is separated from my mom. He hasn't lived with us for three years. Me and my younger brother have a complicated relationship with him, so we almost never visit him. I recently got into a fight with him and have decided that I don't want to see him again. In response, he is threatening my mom that if me and my brother don't see him once a week, he'll take our house.  He bought the house with my mother 15 years ago, but the title is in my mother's name only. Would he be able to take the house? Should my mom divorce him before he dies? What special precautions should we take?	Yes
Keeping things somewhat obfuscated for safety, if you need finer details, please PM me.  This happened in upstate SC. I am now in FL.  About 4 years ago, I offered to open up my house out of the kindness of my heart to my best friend and their spouse, who have a child. The next several months after that, it became very apparent that there were things I wasn't aware of. My friend's spouse was very abusive towards my friend, mostly verbally. I found out that my friend had been raped by the spouse as well. I confronted my friend about it after witnessing abuse towards the child too, and finally my friend recognized the need to end the relationship and demand a divorce. We filed to have the spouse evicted. My friend did not leave as they did not have anywhere to go.  My friend refused to pursue charges, mostly out of fear of things not going well, potentially some Stockholm Syndrome or something going on. The spouse accused us of cheating, openly vilified myself and my friend, and claimed to be innocent of what we witnessed.  No formal divorce or custody agreement ever entered in due to the previously mentioned fears.  There was peace some time after the split. The spouse seemed to be stabilizing. There was an agreement to allow visitation. The spouse however not only has a child with another person now, but has also kidnapped my friend's child as well, and has made wild baseless accusations.  I have been asked to submit an affidavit to what I witnessed. I am concerned that if my involvement comes forward, that the target will be drawn to me and I may have false allegations filed against me, forcing me to return back to SC, which could potentially have a number of consequences for me outside of legal. However, if I don't submit my affidavit, it could potentially weaken or ruin my friend's case and the chances of my friend's child being returned to the parent who is actually a capable parent.	Yes
My soon to be ex wife is divorcing me after we got into a fight after being drunk. She stated that she is not pursuing alimony. Could she pursue alimony for one incident that did not result in any impairment? We are meeting with an attorney where we both sit down and discuss terms this weem. Do I need to lawyer up on my own? We have no assets as we are in college. Just electronics and two cars and furniture. Any advice is appreciated 	Yes
My ex and I agreed that we would pay our fair share of taxes, in proportion to our earnings, at tax time. Because I withheld too much, and she withheld too little, I ended up paying her taxes for her. Per our divorce agreement, in this situation we agreed to pay back the other, but she is now refusing to pay. Do I have to go to divorce court, or could I take her to civil court, or even small claims court, to get my money?	Yes
Given that in my 23 years as their son, they've hated each other for just about every waking second. And me and my siblings have had to obviously put up with it. But for some unknown reason they just won't cut ties and get apart from each other. So I ask again: Is there some way I can force them to just end it?	Yes
My husband and I have been separated for over a year and living in different states. All finances are separate and neither relies on the other for any assistance. We have not even been in contact for over 6 months. I recently became pregnant from my boyfriend. I know my husband is the assumed father and I should put him on the birth certificate.   I have tried several times to get in contact with the husband to try and proceed with a divorce but he hasn't returned any texts or phone calls. I also know that he has moved at some point and I don't know his address or if he still works at the same job.   Could I just say that I am separated on any paper work and list my boyfriend as the father? I just want to do this with the smallest amount of stress and financial burden on myself and worried about legal fees adding up with having to try and track the husband down and having to do paternity tests. 	Yes
It is am amount equal to 5% of my income. 	Yes
"A couple months ago out of the blue my husband(34) said he wanted a divorce. I (32)was shocked and I broke down. He was adamant about it and went the next day and opened his own bank account and moved over his direct deposits from our joint checking account.   I make my own money and it is still going into the joint account, but his money goes into his and he moves it over to the joint account.    He was ready to walk until I told him I'm not selling the house and plan to stay. He was hoping I'd want to sell and split the profit (I put 30,000 down payment from money I had gotten from retirement- gained while we were married). After that, he suddenly wants to ""work"" on our relationship. In reality, he is preparing for divorce. He has a large sum of money coming from some back pay and I believe that is why he moved his direct deposit over to his personal account. He's waiting on it before he fly's the coop-approx. a year from now.   Anyways, a month ago he got a direct deposit from some disability back pay and it went into our joint account. He wasn't expecting back pay and doesn't check our bank statements so I was able to transfer it into my personal account before he seen it.    I want to withdraw this money and put it into    a fireproof safe and hide it- just until this whole thing has blown over. I'm hoping to stay together. If he sees it on the bank statement, I'm saying I gambled it away (I never gamble, but its all I got to go with).   So I want to do this and then close my personal account, if a discovery is done will they be able to look at closed accounts?  missouri"	Yes
"On Jan. 31, 2012 I left my abusive (now ex) husband. The next day, I got a restraining/no contact order against him. Divorce was finalized 12/12/12.  Fast forward to 5/5/15. I was pulled over by the police and I wasn't sure why (I'm careful, don't speed, etc.). I was told there was a warrant out for my arrest for the past 3 years! I asked the officer to please double-check and re-run my license.  He did and told me the warrant was for ""Failure to pay a medical bill to [name redacted] Community Hospital"". Officer's exact words.  I was taken into custody and was in a holding cell for several hours while my son and my current boyfriend paid my bail. I was held on a $5000 bond for a $1000 medical bill.   On 5/8/15, I went to my mandatory court date. I thought I was going in front of the judge, as per my release papers. I  was actually taken into a conference room with the owner of the collection agency that was holding this medical bill. I tried to explain to him that I had no knowledge of the bill and no knowledge of a debtor's exam....I didn't go  to the debtor's exam because all papers regarding this issue went to my ex's house and I had the no-contact order. I had NO way of knowing about any contempt of court charge from missing the debtors hearing.  I was told by this man that if I missed one more payment or was late even by 1 day, that he would re-instate the warrant.   I have been paying $25/month for over 2 years now and they still say I owe over $700 on this bill. None of my $500 bail went for the medical bill....and this is a medical bill that I believe is actually my ex-husband's.   I did take the owner of the collection agency to court and was only awarded damages in the amount of $1000. I was not allowed to take the 2 police departments involved in my arrest to court. Both agencies harrassed me during my arrest even though I gave them  no problems whatsoever. For instance...when I was switched between departments,  I was put in leg irons and my wrists chained around my waist and had to ride in the K9 cruiser and I was told I was the ""new chew toy"" and they threatened to sic the dog on me for no reason. I was harrassed for ""ignoring the bill"". Mind you, my ex's father is also a bailiff in that particular jurisdiction and at the time I still had their last name.  One more point of interest....when my bail was paid, the owner of the collection agency who also posed as a judge on 5/5/15 was the one who signed for my bail! (I still have the receipt).   My question is, do I have any recourse in any of this? Is there some way to make all of this go away? I honestly cannot afford this bill and I do not believe it is mine....no one has ever sent it to me to look and no one will show me. I honestly do not know if it even exists.  How can I handle this. This bothers me and since this whole incident, I refuse to  drive alone and I  get scared to even go into the jurisdiction this happened in. This is negatively affected my life and I'm fed up about that fact. Please help/advise. Thank you!"	Yes
I was in jail when my wife divorced me. She got granted ownership of everything we owned, custody, child support, and alimony. I live in Wyoming where alimony is rare. I don't make very much money, I am a chef with two jobs barely making it. They are going to take 50% of my income to supplement the child support and alimony, making it even harder to survive. I cannot afford an attorney and the courts have no paperwork to reopen our decree based on alimony. I don't know what to do! I will always pay my child support, but the alimony is killing me! Please, if you truly know any viable options for me, I need help!	Yes
My friend is in the process of getting a divorce. My friend moved back home in the mean time.   Her ex lives in Florida. She lives in NYC. He has been opening credit cards in her name and so far has spent more than $25,000 under her name. The ex has stopped all communication with her.   What are the next steps.   Thank you.	Yes
Throw away account used as precautionary measure.  **Short version**  Mom got in over her head and made a lot of bad decisions, potentially out of cognitive incompetence, in regard to buying a house she couldn’t afford. She put $97k down in earnest money. We now need to back out of the deal and the realtor has decided that they want half ($48500) for compensation of damages.  **Long version**  My dad died just a few weeks ago. Before then I had been pretty estranged from the family, but came back for the funeral. My mom and dad were getting divorced at the time and my mom had plans to move to a house she was intending to buy in TN and was anxious to get the money she was owed from the settlement of the divorce to pay for her home. My brother and I were appointed as co trustees of my Father’s estate, and as I started pouring through the asset inventory I realized things were messed up beyond normal comprehension. Here is a summary of what happened according to the pieces of the puzzle that I have.   Please note there is a good chance that there are inaccuracies to this summary, there are still missing pieces to the puzzle.  When my mom realized she was getting divorced from my dad, she started looking for a home. She had recently reconnected with her brother in TN, who in turn brought her down and started showing her properties in the area to purchase with the money she was expecting to get as part of her divorce settlement. They found a house that she liked that was being sold by a realtor that owned the property in question. A purchase agreement was signed. My uncle acted as proxy and signed the paperwork, putting down earnest money. There were conditions on the purchase agreement that a barn on the property needed to be finished (to date this is not done), and that my mom had to come up with the rest of the money including a mortgage.  There were complications with the divorce, things were taking longer than expected. The due date for closing on the house was drawing close fast. My mom made arrangements with the realtors to extend the contract, but it was conditional on her sending more money. The realtor didn’t specify how much money, but stated that more would be needed in order to extend. My mom wanted to show that she was very interested in the property and after withdrawing from an investment, sent $100k down to add to the earnest money via my uncle. My uncle was owed money for what he originally put down as earnest money so he repaid himself out of the $100k, which no one takes issues with, and then gave the rest to the realtor, bringing the value of the earnest money account to $97k. Which for those of you who are familiar with purchasing a home know is completely absurd. Obviously the realtors were happy to take it and weren’t going to argue.  The divorce takes longer, papers aren’t getting signed. Cue dad’s death and me making my way back into the life of my family. The new contract is set to expire in 20 days and mom needs assets to pay off the rest of the house. Things are complicated because the divorce was in a weird stage when he died, but I at least know what mom was owed.  The problem is that the vast majority of the cash that was coming her way via the settlement was in tax deferred investment vehicles, nothing that can be liquidated rapid without taking serious hits from the IRS. All of the non-deferred investments were emptied to send down what money she already sent. She was getting some money every month, but likely not enough to make a mortgage payment without making serious adjustments to her lifestyle. Long story short, she didn’t have the money to be able to close on the house and wasn’t going to be able to get the money.  This is only the tip of the iceberg. My brother and I quickly discovered that mom had been making a lot of bad choices in regard to her personal finance as well as other parts of her life that I would rather not get into publicly. There may be a cognitive issue. She’s going to be okay, but it’s yet another reason why a mortgage is out of the question. Plus after what we’ve witnessed we’re not okay with her leaving the state and want her to stay close to her remaining nuclear family so we can help deal with whatever it is that’s going on.  I immediately injected myself into her financial life. Over the course of 5 weeks and well over a hundred hours of phone calls, emails, etc, I was able to keep shit from hitting the fan in other areas, but not this one. I called the realtor and started negotiating us backing out of the deal. The guy seemed cordial enough, understanding, etc, but was frustrated with how this had all be tied up for months. Over the last couple weeks we’ve been talking about the scenario. They finally met with their lawyers and the have emailed stating that they believe that they are legally entitled to all of the money, but only want half, $48500, in repayment for damages including lost commission on the sale.  Obviously what money we lose is going to have a serious impact on quality of life for my mom long term. We don’t want her to buy the house, we don’t want her to leave her nuclear family due to everything we’ve witnessed, even if we did there’s no way to get the money needed to close the house, a mortgage is out of the question.  Any thoughts are appreciated.	Yes
So I am divorcing first and foremost as a preface. Awhile back my soon to be ex wife setup her child support from her first child with another man to be deposited in my banking account. I have sole access and rights on this account still. There recently was a large deposit through the state enforcement office of back child support paid out to her that was deposited into my account. I won't go into detail why but am I in a legal state if I refuse to withdraw and give this money over to her? Yes it sounds scummy but I have my reasons. I just wanted to ask. Thank you in advance.	Yes
Ok this is my second posting of this and I'm legitmately serious how can I seriously prepare for a divorce? Are there secret bank accounts? Legal loopholes for evading alimony?	Yes
"Some background information: So my mother and father are currently going through a divorce. I'm legally an adult (18+) while my younger brother is a minor (Under 18). My father recently moved out of the house because of this divorce and is currently living in Chicago. My mother, who had been previously diagnosed with a personality disorder, left the house for 3 days without a word to me or my brother on when or whether she would be coming back or not. During day 2, we broke down the door to the house's office room in order to get more information or maybe a hint on her whereabouts. The actual act of kicking down the door was committed by my younger brother but I witnessed it and did not try to stop him. She is now trying to take me to court for ""convincing"" my brother to kick down the door. I don't think she has any legal standing as the house is under my dad's name and he pays for all the bills because my mother has been unemployed for years now. My dad understands my side of the story and doesn't care for the damage done. Can she really do anything or is she just trying to scare me and play mind games? I am now living with my dad in the city during summer break from college to get out of the house but my brother is stuck with her because he's still got a year left of high school back home.  Some other stuff she has done to me I think I can use against her to file a ""counterclaim"" (don't know if I'm using that word right) or just in general is: 1) Logged into my newly opened bank account (which was only suppose to be under my name) and taken $5,000 from my savings and tried transferring it into her personal bank account. I, foolishly, used an old username and password from a previous joint account with her when I was a minor to open the new one. She used that previous information to log into my new account and tried to steal my money. I called the bank and reversed it but I would still consider that some form of identity theft, right? 2) She has been constantly berating and belittling me over text message (calling me names, using every swear in the book, threatening me, etc.) for a little under a month now. I don't want to block her as I think I can use this as evidence as some form of abuse, correct? Yes, I find it very disturbing and am deeply saddened that my own mother thinks I'm worthless simply because I refuse to take sides in the divorce.   More info on her mental issues: She has obviously had this Personality Disorder for a while now and during my childhood would constantly go through bouts of yelling at me and my brother and acting like a normal mother. She use to see a therapist but I'm not sure how often she attends appointments now. I think the stress of the divorce accelerated/intensified this disorder as the abusive text messages have gotten more frequent. I've even come home one night (in the old house) to see dozens of holes in the wall across different rooms of the house which was very creepy to say the least.  Thank you in advance for all the help."	Yes
I have been assisting a family member (the respondent) with a separtation. I have all correspondence and pleadings to date. Some letters and emails are between the respondent and the applicant's lawyer. Some are between the respondent (or myself) and the respondent's lawyer. Legally, can I make these letters, emails, and forms public online? The application, answer, reply, affidavits, and financial statements are part of a continuing record that is already a public record, is it not? And I have the respondent's (since all of this information was mailed or emailed to him or myself) permission to do so. We are hoping to change lawyers. Until we find a lawyer who is a better fit, I thought that by sharing all of this information online, anyone who has the time can read the information and offer advise. I thought there may be legal professionals who are retired, or suffer from insomnia :), who may be interested in helping. That is my reason for wanting to make this information public.	Yes
My parents got divorced when I was about 6 months old. As part of this agreement, any part of college that is not scholarships is supposed to be split 50/50 betweeen the two. Now, recently (and by recently I mean the past 4-6 years) our relationship has ceased to exist due to large disagreements between me and the rest of his family, and him, as in nobody really talks to him anymore. I just recently graduated with my Bachelors, and today received a Bill for his payment plan saying I need to pay it. In the past, he has always taken the route where he could not pay or steal what he can in regards to me. I.e. my college savings, avoiding medical bills, etc. Now that I am a completely independent adult, can I still go after him for this? Would it be worth it? For reference, its about 2 grand, and I make enough to make it go away within 3 months or so. But I have to pay back the amount of government loans i did take soon, and this may be rough if I do so.	Yes
Hi, I have a software company that actually doesn't have any money in it, besides a couple of hundred dollars in bank, and I'm going through divorce. (it's an LLC, solo to my name)  My soon to be ex is fine with me having all rights, etc. on the company, but how would that be legally phrased?  I have a lawyer, and he will put in something, but if there's some specific Intellectual-Property advice I can get, then we could put that statement in.  Or maybe a generic statement of me getting entire business is enough?  There's some code there, i don't think it's of value, i just don't want there to be a battle over the business later, if I continue the business and actually make a profit in the future.	Yes
Hello,  I need some advice on getting out of purchasing a condo. I have put a 20k deposit down on a $408,000 condo (Mississauga, Ontario). I am still waiting to hear confirmation from the bank in regards to a loan (home equity loan instead of a mortgage). The thing is my husband who is the breadwinner has been cheating and I cannot move into a condo with him knowing this. The condo and all paperwork would be in my name. Move in date was supposed to be Sept 01/2017.  Can anyone please provide any information on whether I can get out of this?	Yes
TL:DR-In my “infinite wisdom” I believed it a good idea to get married at the age of 21 as a US citizen to my long-distance boyfriend who is a Canadian Citizen. It was my first serious relationship as an “adult” and while at the time I made excuses why, it was a very rocky relationship. After almost two years of being married it all fell apart and I moved back home with my parents. He jerked me around with dancing on the “Maybe I still want you” line for a bit before I finally said it was over. While back in the states it took him years but I finally got request for divorce papers in the mail. I believed that was the end of it, but after contacting him he swore up and down he still has a bunch of paperwork to work through before we can be properly divorced. I no longer believe him when he said he would handle it. I just got engaged 8 years later but I have no idea if the divorce went through or how to handle it moving forward as I plan my first proper wedding.  We were married IN Alberta and when he filed he was still there and I was (and still am ) in Rhode Island.  I’m going to preface this all by saying I’m very ashamed of the whole situation. I was a very stupid lonely kid who didn’t realize just how greatly I was screwing my life over. I’m sorry this got long, I still get pretty emotional thinking about the whole situation. If this is not the right place to post this I would really appreciate being directed to the right place.  2006 - I come from a pretty tense and dysfunctional family, so when it came time for me to go to college I chose something far away. While attending my first semester at college I did not know anyone there and spent the majority of my time by myself in the library or computer labs. It wasn’t long before I got officially involved with a long-distance boyfriend from Canada. Huge phone bills were racked up due to international calls and he even ventured out to see me on a very long bus ride.   2007 – I ended up transferring back to my home state and after a short time spent back at my parent’s home I decided I needed to get out of there. If I went straight back to school the next semester my parents agreed to help me get an apartment if I could prove I could pay for it. I worked full time and went to school full-time that semester but ended up failing most of my classes because I was just not able to handle that load on top of depression. The Canadian long-distance boyfriend came to stay with me for roughly a month where I supported him as he had no job back home and had been living with his parents. Had I been smart I would have seen that the relationship was clearly toxic at this point, but I’ve always had a quiet sappy romantic side that had me wanting to believe that this “first love” was special enough to be the one.    In the fall I moved out of the apartment and transferred yet again, this time to a college where I could live on campus, but still close enough to home where I went back to my parents nearly every weekend. My mother was convinced I would do better in this setting, and to her credit my grades were all passing even though my heart wasn’t really in it. Many Many phone conversations later he (Canadian Boyfriend) convinced me to move out there with him so that we could be together. At that point he had gotten an overnight job and a small studio apartment that I had flown out for a week to visit so I honestly believed it was a logical next step.  Spring 2008- I packed up a single bag and two carry-ons and moved to Canada. Whether I believed it might not work out, or that I would be stopped by suspicious customs folk I can no longer remember, but I went there with a return ticket that went unused. While the relationship was okay in the beginning it quickly deteriorated. As I wasn’t a citizen I could not get a job, car or really anything else that required money so I was at his mercy when it came to pretty much anything. He insisted I have the same sleep schedule he did as an overnight worker and that pretty much killed any hope of a social life outside of him that didn’t involve the internet. Sex frustrated him as we were both virgins and he came to place that blame on me. While I was willing to work through everything, he was impatient and eventually decided it was all because I was not attractive enough for him. Yes, he would explain this to my face. Believing that I was indeed the problem I did my best to try to fit into that mold he kept claiming he wanted. But I came to learn that if I improved one thing he would quickly find another fault that MUST be why he wasn’t interested in me. He would pepper in romantic conversations saying I was beautiful and he didn’t know what was wrong with him and that he loved me in between all of this so I moronically stayed.    The six-month mark rapidly approached and I was told the only way I could stay any longer is if we got married. Believing myself in love I was for it, “If I really love you and want to be with you, why now?” I’d thought. We decided that was what we would do. He did not pop the question he just called me over to the computer one day to help him pick out wedding rings from a cheap site online. I convinced myself that that was what I wanted so it didn’t matter that it wasn’t romantic. We filed for a marriage license and a short time later I was informed by him that we’d be getting married a couple days later in a park because he had already booked the officiant. I bought a dress I hated from some outlet store (It was brown and black with some green but it was the only dress I could find in that store at a low price that looked ok on me.) So on a muddy day when the trees didn’t even have enough green on them to look nice I got married. The whole affair was almost as miserable as that evening when he wouldn’t have anything to do with me because he was too tired. My family and friends were confused and more than a little upset that they were not invited or even told when this was happening and some of them stopped talking to me completely because of it.   The rest of the time (Less than a year of marriage) I spent there is a dismal blur of fights about filing paperwork for citizenship (He procrastinated for EVERYTHING. The only thing he stayed on top of was getting married to I could extend my stay) or where he said hurtful things and me falling into a depression so deep I started sleeping away the time I didn’t waste playing video games and started to rationalize jumping off a local bridge to just get out. Multiple times I caught him having long-distance relationships, the final one I knew about was some 17-year-old from Texas who he told we were already divorced. After weeks of sleeping on the couch after learning about that one (Clearly it was my fault for not being able to hold his interest on a physical level and being a moody depressed boring person. Oh yes, he said these things to my face.) I broke down and called my mother and told her it was over and I needed to go home. This was almost a year exactly after we had gotten married. I remember being on the road and laughing like a crazy person when I realized it was out anniversary.   2009- My mother has her issues and we don’t always see eye to eye, but on this occasion, she came through so hard for me. She quickly got time off work and drove with my sister from South Dakota to Alberta in two days. When it was clear that she was showing up and not leaving without me my “husband” did a lot of back-pedaling trying to explain that I had been irrational in being so quick to find a way back home. She showed up and he left while I packed my things into my mother’s car. When we were finished he came back and kissed me goodbye saying he had no idea if he wanted me to come back again.  When my family and I got to the hotel I had received an e-mail from him saying not to contact him, he needed space, he would tell me when it was ok for us to talk again. I was very broken. After getting home I spent a month so shattered I lost 20 pounds from not being able to eat much. My mother helped me get my license back (it had expired in Canada) sort my school debts out (He had refused to pay any of my school bills because it didn’t affect us in Canada). I moved in with friends for a few months before moving back home. It was at this time that my Canadian “husband” had decided he wanted me back and that some of our troubles were actually his fault. I was angry, but usually heard him out. After falling into an old fight I just stopped taking his calls after I told him I wanted a divorce. He popped up on my doorstep not long after trying to win me back. He convinced me to give it another try but it came down to me being unable to trust him. So we were over. He said he would handle the divorce, it would be cheaper if he did it himself without a lawyer. At that point I was so scarred from the whole experience I didn’t believe I wanted to ever get married again anyway so I wasn’t overly concerned and agreed he could do it.    In October, when I had been living with them, my parents started going through a messy divorce. During that time, I kept my head down, worked a lot of hours and started planning to move out. My mother and siblings had moved out due to the divorce and I guess because I was an “adult” she just left me staying at the house with my dad. I’ve never had a good relationship with my father, he’s a very angry man, with a touchy temper prone to violent outbursts. (My mother had been so convinced he would react violently she told him via text message which my father made me read aloud to him when he got home) It was pretty fucked up. Time went by, life happened and a long-distance friendship blossomed into a romance and relationship by December.   February I flew out and spent a week with my new beau trying to just move on with my life. Nothing physical happened outside of making-out because I had been completely upfront and honest about my situation and he wanted to take things slow. After coming back to South Dakota I became much more interested in the progress of the divorce, but when I contacted my Canadian Ex I would get a lot of excuses and run arounds. He would make brief progress after I threatened to get a lawyer involved from my side but it never seem to stay on track.   Unhappy with my living situation it didn’t take long for the idea of moving out to the east coast to sound really appealing. Initially I had wanted to get my own place and build into the new relationship slowly, but making minimum wage and paying for some of my parents bills I didn’t have the means to amass the money for a down payment or rent for the first few month while I got settled. In 2010 I moved to Rhode Island from South Dakota and into my new boyfriend’s apartment.   Years later my Canadian Ex got my address and sent me papers declaring intention to divorce. He had told me I did not have to do anything and the divorce would go forward soon. I was so happy that I had thought it was finally over. That stupid raincloud was going to be off of my head and out of my life.  After this in 2013 my New Boyfriend attempted a proposal at Disney World. I say attempt because I was still so skittish to the idea of marriage that in a panic I yanked him off of his knee and walked forward like nothing happened. This naturally caused tension, but he was very patient and understanding about the whole situation.  After a lot of serious discussions and talks about our future he finally got the nerve to ask me to marry him again on May 25th of this year 2017. I said yes. After a few months of excitedly planning and dreaming what our big day will look like I’ve come to realize that the raincloud of my first marriage might not be fully gone. The last time I spoke to my Ex a couple years ago (AFTER he had send me the papers) he said he had messed something up and it was going to take awhile because it cost a lot of money. (Another excuse, he gave me this song and dance after telling me he was in an upcoming magic the gathering tournament, and that man never skimped on buying cards for his perfect deck)  My Future husband believes that I shouldn’t do anything. That there is no technical record of me ever being in the United states so I should just pretend like it never happened. I have always filed my taxes as single since moving back to the states and getting back into work so as far as the system knows and cares I’m single and I have always been.   While in Canada I didn’t file any taxes, I never paid any bills, had nothing in my name save for a single credit card where the Ex used my “married name” (I never filed for a name change but apparently the marriage certificate was enough to open a joint account in that name)  I don’t want my stupid decisions of the past to have any effect on my upcoming marriage or future life with the man I want to spend the rest of my life with.   Is there a way to figure out just where my Canadian Ex is in the process? Is there somewhere where I could get this information to see if it went through or just is stuck in limbo? Or do I need to find an attorney to get to the root of this?  Or would it be better just to follow my Fiancé’s advice and pretend it never happened? What possible legal backlash could this cause if any?  I feel a little slimy at the idea of filling out a marriage certificate saying I've never been married before, but if my last marriage is stuck in a hellish legal limbo trying to get that wrapped up with proof that it's legally over sounds like an expensive nightmare.   After over 6 years separated I just want this to be over.    Frankly I have no idea how to handle this situation moving forward. Contacting my Ex would likely only lead to another set of run arounds and excuses that give me no information whatsoever.  If you’ve made it this far I am extremely grateful, I did not anticipate this would end up being so long or so…all over the place.   If I have made anything unclear or you have any questions please ask. Thank you for your patience.	Yes
"Long story short, my partner of [N] years, together in general (not married) of [N+2], called me back on [a recent date] to say we should get a separation. [shortly after] I drove some of her belongings to her [quite a distance] and we settled things and had a verbal agreement to kinda go our separate ways.  [there is a significant piece of ""ammo"" I have to use against her, however it is heresay, although she is the one who told me this piece of information]  In our relationship, I worked, she became sick, I told her I'd take care of us. So I'm not sure how the separation is going to work money wise. She has since picked up a job. Never actually getting diagnosed. We were not intimate for the last 8 months of our relationship (her decision).  She is recollecting a time in which we were intimate early in the relationship and she is now phrasing that I assaulted her.   I am scared, and I want to just tie things off and go our separate ways, even if I absorb all the debt and she leaves with what she came into the relationship with.  I have a consultation with a lawyer setup for next week. for 250$. We bought a house, vacationed, got in debt. So even though I have a great job now. My past has financially crippled me. The lawyers office said the retainer is 1500, at a rate of 240/hr. Of which is 6 and a bit hours. Of which if we chat and get a document together. If we send it to my ex, and she doesnt agree, then its just a waste of money? Or if she doesn't respond? or something to that effect ...   I just don't know what to do or where to start. I mean, the 250 consultation, but no legal advice until 1500$ ... and I can't do legal aid since I make too much. And I don't have cash because I'm back to back paying off loans and credit card debt.  Thoughts? need more info? inbox me?"	Yes
"Before I start, this is not about me.  I know a certain someone, let's call this person T, who just got married.. Let's call the person T is marrying ""SO"". Maybe like 3 days ago. NOBODY approves or know about this marriage, besides a handful of people. I found out that the ""SO"" cheated on T. There are a lot of other signs that screams NO to this marriage.   I'm wondering what are the consequences of T getting a divorce. What can T do so that there are a minimal amount of consequences for T? What are some advice for this fool?"	Yes
I got married really young and now I want to get a divorce. Ex says he doesn't want to get a divorce lawyer and wants to kinda just get papers and sign off because he's in a hurry to join the army and not allow me benefits (which I'm not fighting for). We have a house under both our names and he kicked me out a year ago and I've jumped around living here and there since.  We live in Indiana and I don't know what to do. I want to sign off on the papers because I don't want to have connection anymore to him. Even though I'm not fighting for much anymore I don't know if a divorce lawyer is still something I should do. I've never dealt with this stuff before.	Yes
My wife and I divorced 2 years ago. During the divorce she signed off on the house we owned jointly giving me sole possession. Since then I have had a new deed prepared in my name only so now, as far as the house is concerned, I'm the sole owner. However she is still on the loan which I've been making the payments on since she moved out in March 2013. I've never been able to refinance due to terrible credit and though it's improved since I'm still having issues qualifying. She wants me to refinance ASAP so she can be removed so that it won't show on her credit (she's trying to purchase a home elsewhere). Totally understandable and I'm trying to get it done but I'm curious as to my legal obligation to do so. For instance if I cannot qualify, does she have any legal right to challenge my possession? As far as I understood that when she signed away the home during the property division and a new solo deed was processed her rights to the property ended. Is this correct? I live in California for reference.	Yes
"I have been divorced for many years.  During the divorce I was ordered to pay my ex $300 a month and he was ordered to refinance and take my name off of the house and loan.  After an extended time of him not doing this I contacted my lawyer and asked why do I keep having to pay and he hasn't done anything he was ordered to do... after me nudging the attorney he finally let the judge know and the nudge put a ""Stay"" on my part of the order where I used to pay the $300 a month.  Years later and he (my ex) still hasn't done anything.  Does this mean years from now if he finally takes care of this I'm going to have to start paying him again while living on Social Security retirement or is there a time limit for someone to complete what a judge has ordered.   Needless to say I did not want to contact my attorney from years past he was worthless and I learned later he doesn't do divorces but only doors court cases for marijuana rights. "	Yes
I'm asking on behalf of my friend, so I may have some details incorrect.    As part of my friend's divorce agreement, he co-signed on his ex-wife's lease for a new apartment.  My friend has never resided in the apartment, and in fact lives out of state.  The initial year is over, and he no longer wants to be on the hook for this, however he is being told that since he was on the original lease, he must remain on any future leases if she is to remain in the apartment.  Is this true?  Does he have any recourse to have himself removed from the lease without her moving?  Thank you!	Yes
I've already signed lease and payed first months rent but upon seeing my apartment, there's cockroaches and a possible cockroach infestation. Where can I go from here? Location: Kentucky	No
My ex-wife recently filed an application for divorce.  There were some issues pertaining to the separation agreement that I wanted ironed out prior to accepting the divorce (specifically fixing FRO arrears to $0 since the amendments to the agreement were not on file as I had assumed she would have done which had adjusted the support amounts payable, as well as some other access issues and firming up some wording on the agreement).  We were able to settle all these issues in our first case conference, and a court order was filed to amend these changes.  I just received, from her, Form 12: Notice of Withdrawal, requesting that I fill it out so she can proceed with the divorce.  Now, I don't want to get boned here, so I was just wondering:  Does this notice of withdrawal rescind my answer that I had on file, nullifying the court order or is it just a formality since we are now in agreement to move forward?  I've also read in the Ontario Family Law that if a Notice of Withdrawal is submitted, that I will have to pay the court fees.  What kind of fees am I looking at?	No
My dad has found himself a golddigger and in an effort to not have to sell the house he built (he's a contractor) which is seven years from being paid off my parents are looking at other alternatives. Is it at all possible to have a legal binding agreement that says only my mom and him are the owners of the property? My mom would also like to keep the property (she's lived here for 35 years, parents ashes buried here, etc) but is afraid that my dad's golddigger girlfriend would be able to claim part ownership if my dad happens to pass.	No
I have a roommate. My grandpa is very sick and needs someone to care for him. What are my rights as a tenant? Apartment complex wants to keep me on the lease even though we found a replacement for my room, and also wants me to keep paying for parking. Is there anything I can do to get off the lease in this situation?	No
I am paid up with rent through August, I have never been late or broken any part of our agreement. I left for work this morning and locked my door and when I came home the lock was entirely different. All my things are locked inside.   I had been emailing my landlord about some wet spots in my carpet after coming home from a few days away and she said she would send someone in to check but she never got back to me and now this. No phone calls, no note or notice, no email. What is my recourse?	No
I started to work with a startup 3 months ago. They wanted to know my hourly charge and how many hours I am going to work in a week. Then they said they need the app asap, because they are going to release their product within 2/3 months. So I worked overtime and made the app almost usable (according to other fellow devs) within 2 and half months. Now when I asked for my overtime payment, they clearly denied my payment. They did not pay me 3 weeks payment. They did not pay me overtime payments. Then they stopped to communicate with me. Removed me from slack. No reply to my emails. How should I deal with this situation ? I am working as an hourly freelancer from India. This startup is Brooklyn, NY based startup.	No
Under our side of our duplex there's a little door that leads to the piping, heaters/boilers, machinery of both units. Under our unit, while inspecting it with the maintinence guy, my boyfriend found a large amount of black mold.  &amp;nbsp;  For one, we've already spoken to our landlord about our AC not working properly, and we're in Georgia in the summer, so this is about as pleasant as you'd expect. They sent someone out and supposedly fixed it. They did not. They then (also on the first visit)  pointed out that there's a leak in our washing machine, to which the second maintinence guy said is probably what caused the mold.  &amp;nbsp;  We took a few pictures of the mold, and I plan on sending our leasing company an email outlining these issues, as well as the fact that we've been running our AC under their assurance that it is working and it wasn't, running up our electricity bill. I will be asking them to re-reimburse us as well as either fixing this mold issue within 24 hours or that they need to house us at another property, or something to that effect, as we just got a two-month-old puppy a day before finding this out, and black mold (which is right under our bedroom) is particularly dangerous to infants. **I've even read somewhere that this may be valid grounds to break our lease without damaging our credit and even get some sort of 500-dollar civil fee from our landlord?** I don't care about the fee so much as leaving this place, because I honestly don't feel like they're going to fix this in a timely manner, and my boyfriend and I are beginning to feel signs of the mold's effects... we have no clue how long it's even been down there, but the side effects have been felt for a month or two now (chronic fatigue, chest compression/finding it hard to breathe, etc.) and my boyfriend and I are fit, and healthy, well under weights considered to be obese.  &amp;nbsp;  What can/should we do here?	No
My friend is paralyzed from the waist down and rarely leaves her bed. She has been living there with her daughter for about 10 years now.  The tenant was only increased the rent a couple of times (very affordable place) but he also has not maintained the place.  The other day he walked into her apartment unannounced to tell her that he is increasing the rent by 15% starting next month which my friend cannot afford. He has been back a few times to discuss this but has ended up in arguments with him saying it's my house and I walk in here whenever I want and I could you have in the street any day, etc..  She is a wreck now since she cannot physically go out and look for apts herself.   She never received a copy of the original lease (10 years ago)  What options does she have?   I told her to ask the landlord for a copy of the new lease with the new rate... but what if he adds something unreasonable like getting rid of her dog? Then should she not sign this new lease and keep paying the old rate until he starts the eviction process?  Thanks for help.	No
"I am in the process of a 730 evaluation for primary custody of my kids.  Two kids 7 and 5 Today, was another doozy of an exchange...and I am fearful for the kids  I don't know what my options are here... if any  My Ex was 53 min late to the exchange today. at 4:24 she sent me a text stating she was exiting the freeway That is 2 miles from the meeting spot arranged in Co-parenting for today. she doesn't show up until 4:53  Exchange goes ok. But I know something is coming, because if she is ever in the wrong she has to lash out and blame someone else or invent a scenario where she is the victim.  I had to wait all of 4 min.  I got a text stating ""I just drove by your car, and the back seat was empty. where are the kids?""  I said ""Wasn't my car. I have two kids"" then knowing where this was going sent a picture of them in the car.  Response: ""when did you have time to take this? because I had plenty of time to look at the stoplight. You were alone. It's ok if Donna (my current wife) has them. It's totally legal, just weird to hide it.  I then called her. She answered. I said. Hi, she said Hi, and then I asked the kids to say Hi. I then asked the kids ""where are we at kids?""....at this point She started saying ""hello, hello? is there anyone there?  I then got a text ""Thank you for the phone call. But there was no sound  I responded. ""I am turning off my phone now. these accusations are bizarre""  I got back: ""Not as bizarre as pretending to pick up our kids. Just tell me who has them""  I called again. Immediately with the ""hello? hello?"" I knew for sure it was a game at this point. I just ended the call  She responded ""You can't just keep ending conversations because you don't want to deal with the facts."" ""If this turns into another 49 hour abduction like New Year's, I will definitely filing a report"" (Read the last post on that [incident here](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/5lfqi6/legal_rights_surrounding_a_primary_custody_parent/)  This is next level insane. I am terrified for the kids. This is like raising to the level that she needs to be committed.  Thoughts apart from just continuing with the psych eval I already have going?"	No
As stated, My roomates and I each have signed our names to a lease for an apartment. Together we make the required 3x monthly income. However he recently bought a car that makes him unable to move, but is willingly to keep his name on the lease. We can make the payments for the apartment, without his aide.  However, would we be penalized for having his name on it.  If he doesn't live with us? The lease is signed with five people, but only four will be living there.	No
I work in an office with one other co-worker. He is male and we have the same position but I am the senior of the two.  I requested a transfer to work in another state to live with my fiance. I worked on detail in the other state who is aware of my interest in transferring and would like to have me. Unfortunately, they can't hire right now.   After this request my supervisor, who is not the authority to determine if the transfer is approved, began treating me much worse. I get that being a jerk is not illegal but I have documented several incidences where my male co-worker was clearly favored.   I then was up for a promotion, which was at the discretion of my supervisor, and which I didn’t get. She said she decided I needed to obtain a job certification first which she hadn’t told me prior. Additionally, part of my supervisor’s job is to help support me in getting certified.   I made an informal complaint to her supervisor about what was going on and the treatment I’d been getting compared to my male peer. He thought she was being fair.   Since this complaint my supervisor has been even worse. Lack of communication, discussing my work with my co-worker and not me, and preventing me from working towards my certification. Other senior staff are aware of this and no one is trying to help me. She has a history of bullying her staff.   So I need the certification to get the promotion, as well as for my job, and I’ve been told to stop working towards requirements for the certification. I think this is considered retaliation and there is a financial loss from this.   Side note: She is still supporting my co-worker in progress towards his certification.  Also, I was told that my informal complaint didn’t impact any decision on approving a transfer. It’s basically political.  There’s a lot of other examples I have documented of unfair treatment but I don’t want to make this post too long.   Ultimately, I have great job security. I like my job and I don’t want to let one supervisor stop me from pursuing what I need to do to advance my career. I also don’t want to jeopardize my chances of working with the other state or anyone to think this is just complaining because I want t to transfer.  Any advice on what to do here? Pursue discrimination case or retaliation case? I was thinking about filing an informal grievance and going from there.   Thanks in advance!	No
Just a bit of backstory,  About 7 months ago my friend who was living with me lost his job, I said I'd pay a months rent for him to give him time to find a new job and he would pay me back over the next few months or if he moved out he would pay me back when he started a new job. Unfortunately he didnt get a job and moved out and I paid his rent for that month. Now he's had a new job for 4 months now and has been avoiding me like the plague and coming up with excuses each month, Im certain he has no intentions of paying me back now, can I still take him to a small claims court even know there was no written agreement, it was just a spoken one. I have saved texts showing him saying he'll pay me back.   Yes I'm an idiot for lending him the money.	No
Working part-time and get paid bi-weekly. Just over a month ago, one of my days was not registered and wasn't paid. I emailed management, they said I'd get it the next pay period. That didn't happen either.   The week in question, I managed to get a lot of extra hours and ended up with 50 total (including the 8 that weren't paid). I finally got back in and spoke face-to-face with a manager and they sorted it out. With all the fuckups, I made it clear that those were OT and that I had 42 hours that week and those 8 would have made it 50. (With the understanding that anything over 40 in a week is OT.)  I was told that the only way I, as a part-timer, could get OT was while working more than 8hrs in a day. The whole OT after 8hrs is foreign to me, but I know I've seen it as part of the union contract.   What I would like to know before I escalate this is... is the manager right? I never received a copy of the union contract, so I'm not sure what my rights are from that side. I just thought federal law required payment of OT for anything over 40.  Right now, I'm just kind of pissed at the fact that it's been over a month and I still haven't gotten paid for that day and nobody seems to give a shit.	No
I am not from Virginia but I was pulled over while moving from Philadelphia to Atlanta. The officer said I was clocked at going 93 in a 70 zone so it was automatically a reckless driving charge and I had to appear in court. I didn't realize at the time but apparently Virginia is the worst place to get pulled over for speeding. This is my first offense, Ive never even gotten a ticket before. So my question is how do I prepare for this? Do I need to hire a lawyer? I do not have a lot of money but law offices have been sending me letters saying they could represent me. I looked online and apparently you can do jail time for this and I'm pretty young and don't want this to ruin my life. I tried to do some research but it seemed like a lot of lawyers trying to scare people into hiring them and it worked a little on me. Pretty much I have no idea what to do please help!	No
I am moving to Seattle next month and have found a listing on Craigslist for a reasonable short-term lease. I am on the other side of the country and very afraid of getting scammed, so I would really appreciate your advice, as I have searched everywhere and need to make a decision very soon!   What I have done to avoid getting scammed is (thank you, reddit, for the advice btw):  - had a friend in Seattle go and see the apartment, shown by the same person I spoke to over the phone - she said he seems legit, and the apartment was definitely the same on I saw listed online, same address too - person sent me a signed lease that is very clear about the terms and seems legitimate (RHA template), after I did an application and he said my credit/background check was fine - asked person to verify his identity - he sent me a picture of his driver's license, although with his license # and address blacked out - Googled the hell out of everything I can to verify that he exists (he is listed as a previous tenant of the address on one of those personal info websites but has a generic name so can't find much else), and that the company on behalf of which he is signing the lease actually exists  The thing is, the property owners (it's a small, multi-unit property in Capitol Hill) are a family that have established a LLC to rent out the units, and he claims to be the property manager for 13 years running, and rents out this one furnished unit on a short-term lease because he gets a cut of the monthly payment for having furnished it. But he is not able to show me anything verifying that he has permission to rent out the unit or that he works for this LLC, despite my repeated requests. He claims that the owners are in their 70s and very low-tech and even his paystub doesn't have the company name on it.   He wants me to send $1000 through Paypal as a deposit to hold the unit, and I have the signed lease in his name, with the LLC listed as the owner, as proof of...something? But should I take the risk? *Is* there a risk - or am I overreacting?   THANK YOU IN ADVANCE, REDDITORS!  TL;DR I have a signed lease from a guy who claims to manage an apartment for the owners, but is unable to provide anything that explicitly proves that he has permission to rent it. Friend met him to see the unit, and the company on the lease does exist, just not sure he is allowed to sign/rent on their behalf. Do I send him a $1000 deposit or nah? Thank you!!!	No
Im kind of in a bind and really need help with my forms. I live in Massachusetts but im filing for divorce in Rhode Island. The residency requirements there are that one spouse must have lived in the state for a year prior to filing, which my spouse has. However, the first line of the Complaint asks me to verify that ive lived in the state for that period. Do i leave it blank?   Also, we don't have children so do i need to file the forms regarding children with N/A or not file them at all.   My last question pertains to the financial form. I filled it out to the best of my knowledge but there is a part on the top for total liabilities but seeing as i didn't list any Im not sure whether to write N/A or leave it blank.   Im sorry to put this on you guys but im filing Monday and haven't been able to afford a lawyer so doing it myself has been tough. Any help would be awesome and Id be soo grateful.	No
I've been working to get all holds on my license taken off. I was told I owed $1,300 to a county in Louisiana (I currently reside in Arizona). I paid the money, but realized the hold never came off my license. Turns out I have a seperate ticket in the City Court that has a bench warrant attached to it. They said I owe $710, must be paid in full (No payment options) or I can get my butt to the court where I will be jailed for 45 days as retribution to the ticket. I don't have 710 bucks and honestly I would do the time if i could get to Louisiana but that's not an option, either. Is there any other way I can go about getting on a payment plan or fines reduced?!? I just had to take out a damn loan for the first 1300 bucks and am paying on that, so another loan isn't really an option for me.	No
It's just the morning after and I'm still a bit shaken over this, but not entirely sure which steps to take.  Last night my bf and I got into a fight over something trivial (he's currently staying with me while he sublets his apartment, until our new lease starts - yes I signed a lease with him).   During the argument I told him that I needed space and couldn't talk to him about this right now- I just wanted to be alone. He ended up locking me out of my room because I stupidly left the key inside and he took and hid my phone as well. When I was finally able to open the door he wouldn't let me through the doorway and ended up shoving me to the ground twice.  At some point- it's all a blur now, I make it past him and grab keys/phone and leave to take a walk.  I was on the phone with my best friend for the entirety of the walk, about 15 min. When I get back to the apt the front door is ajar, and my bedroom is locked. It took a while to open it because the lock had been damaged- when I finally got it open my entire room was trashed. There are several minor damages to the room, and after inventory my computer and a few other possessions (of low value) are missing.  I called the police and filed a report, can pick it up today and see if any charges can be pressed. They advised a restraining order (he's also known to be violent and had been in the past).  I'm at a friend's house now, as he still has copies of the apartment key. All of this puts me in a financial mess- we were signed to live together at the end of the month, obviously that's not happening but I'm signed onto that lease and have nowhere to go after 8/31.  What other actions can I take? Any hopes of getting my computer back or suing for damages?  TL;DR- got in a argument with bf, left him alone in apt, returned to find room trashed and computer stolen (and he put his hands on me).	No
"Thanks for checking out the post.  Here's the story: My landlord lives outside of the country and I am only allowed to pay via chase quickpay basically.   Apparently there was an issue this month and I might have accidentally set the payment to be sent on the first of August instead of July.  I don't get a receipt or anything saying that she's received the quickpay so nothing was out of the ordinary.    Last night on the 26th the landlords son wrote me saying that he doesn't see payment on the bank statement so I owe an additional $1200 in late fees ""per the lease.""  Now, they could be cool and say ""ya we all over looked it.  Lets work something out."" Instead of just waiting until an arbitrary day when they just notice they didn't receive a couple thousand dollars.    My question is what sort of notice should be given or can a landlord just wait the entire month before letting you know that you're late?  I feel like they can intentionally wait just to penalize a tenant more.  I'm considering not paying because I do not believe this is ""reasonable,"" but I could be wrong.  I do not have a history of paying late.  Its a nice neighborhood and we're good tenants its just that to wait until the total is $1200 over half the price of rent seems ridiculous.   What are my options?"	No
So long story short a guy at work took a picture of a friend in the bathroom stall at work cropped him out and placed in a lot of hilarious locations. It was then distributed around our group text among friends at work. Everybody, including the guy on the shitter, found it extremely funny and it good humor. Somehow this picture got out HR got involved and interrogated everyone apart of the group text. We explained it was horse play and admitted to the foolery. Can they company terminated the person and anyone involved in the group text?	No
So there's an apartment complex that's trying to keep my administration fee. There's an application fee to have my credit checked, then an administration fee to hold the apartment. If I change my mind in x amount of time or I am declined I get the fee back. They said they were going to refund me, but never did. I called back and they still didn't refund me.  Can I take them small claims court? What are my legal options?	No
I've been brushing up on Fair Housing and I'm not sure about this distinction.  I know the [protected classes](https://laborcommission.utah.gov/divisions/AntidiscriminationAndLabor/x_what_is_housing_discrimination.html) in my state and locality.  Say I have an open house for a few hours and when I'm done I have X online applications.  Am I required to select the first applicant who meets my requirements (income + credit score) or can I select the applicant with the largest income / credit score?  My belief is that since size of income is not a protected class, I am allowed to select (discriminate) based on this information.	No
So we have had this problem now 3 times. The hot water pipe burst again underneath the foundation and is flooding our apartment. We notified them this morning and they won't send anyone out till Monday. The water is already in the hall after last night it was just a small puddle in the family room. What are my options?	No
Alright so I've tried googling this but have no guts on my specific situation.  I'm a server and the owner has 3 more restaurants all within a block, so we swap and take things we need from the other 3 if we ever run out of anything. Occasionally we will run out of a certain liquor and they will typically send a server to go grab an unopened bottle and bring it back to the restaurant they work at. Is it legal to walk it if you're under 21 since it is for business and you're on the clock?	No
[Picture of the relevant clause in the contract](http://imgur.com/a/ji4uz)  This seems like an excessively draconian clause, saying that she can be evicted within 24 hours if her father steps foot into the flat! Is this legal to include in the contract?  (This is South Yorkshire, United Kingdom if that's relevant)  Thanks	No
Can a screenshotted snapchat of a little bit of weed (like maybe an 8th) be enough for police to come do a search? I have been threatened by an ex and I would really like to know if this is possible. He says he will report the photo to the police.	No
"My ex-girlfriend and I recently split up, we dated from March - June. We found out she was pregnant in May. She wouldn't tell me how far along she was and didn't seem too worried about going to the ultra sound or doctor's appointments and had a different story every time I asked her anything about it. She indicated that her and her ex had slept together a week before her and I got together, no condom. Her and I have never had sex without a condom. She even tells me that she ""knows"" that it couldn't be mine (I never came in her.) and is sure it's her ex-boyfriends, but is threatening to take me to court to pay for the test, out of spite. Is this legal?"	No
Okay I was driving on the far left lane left lane from a 3 lane street. I see a driver in my rear view and side mirrors driving like a f***ing maniac so I keep my eye on him. Once he is done swerving in and out of traffic he now has a complete clear road in the lane he is in (the middle lane). I see him accelerating SUPER fast as we are approaching a red light and immediately I know he is about to cause an accident: either he is going to rear end the truck in front of him or he is going to try to overtake my car and swoop in front of me but theres no way that he could make it. I couldn’t get out of the way because this all happened in a matter of seconds. So I’m still in the left lane and he car is slowly passing mine and I see his car coming closer to mine and literally he just switches lanes as if I wasn’t there and pushed my car into the curb then swerved back out to the right after impact (there was nowhere to go as he was literally squishing my car against the curb). Now here is my issue: this accident is clearly his fault but he is telling his insurance that I swung out from behind him and got over when he was starting to merge. My issue with his statement is that either way it goes (even though my story is what TRULY happened) both stories indicate that I was 100% in the left lane as he was merging. Wouldn’t he be at fault either way? His insurance is saying it’s a dispute of facts but its really just two different versions story which ultimately have the same point: Driver failed to yield when merging. Am I misunderstanding something. I honked at him for a few seconds which I guess he didn’t hear. I drive a BMW (small car) and this guy drives a Ford F-150 which huge tires. I am almost positive he didn’t even see me at all.   Please help. 	No
I was involved in a serious hit and run where the other driver got away. My car looks to be totaled as I ran into a tree trying to swerve to avoid the accident. There was a police report filed also where I initially said I wasn't experiencing and pain. My policy is two-way and I am based in California. What do i/How do I proceed now since I'm experiencing pain and file this after the report when I speak to the claims and what should I tell my insurance to receive the most payout so I'll able to have a vehicle to drive to work on Monday? How should I hand the pain to receive the most payout to pay for potential medical costs? Will I receive anything now since I didn't state the pain earlier?	No
I'm asking this question for my boyfriend. Several years ago through a one night stand my boyfriend got a girl pregnant. About two years ago he found out it was his and has been paying child support since, but has not had or wanted any interaction or custody. The mother was fine with this arrangement and would still be. However, it turns out she has a pretty serious drug problem. The child has been taken from her and dcyf is demanding that my boyfriend take custody. He does not have the means or the ability or the inclination to care for this child. If it were up to him he would give the child up for adoption. He works full time and is about to start going back to school. But they say he has to or neglect charges will follow. I'm hoping somebody here can tell me what his options might be from this point and what possible consequences could come from those actions. Should he bother with a lawyer (We don't really have the money, but could probably fit it on a credit card)? The mother is being given a year to get right before having her rights terminated. The child is currently in foster care	No
"Jane (fake name) is an international student renting an attic in New Jersey (real state). There is a door at the base of the stairs. When you go up the stairs to the attic, there is the living space and a bare closet. The closet is not a regular closet, I guess the best way to describe it is if the attic is an upside down V, half of it has been carpeted for living space, and there's a wall with a door seperating the other half of the attic that contains the closet.  Jane was not informed not to use the closet. There is no sign. There is no lock on the closet. She stored some luggage and other items in the closet space. Today, while at work, Jane received a text from the landlord, claiming that Jane broke the Central AC by storing things in the attic. 2 of the landlord's text messages:  ""The electrician and owner was at the house.  I took out luggage and stuff from the closet yesterday where unit is and he found two more suitcases and hangers.  This caused the air unit to break.  He fixed it but charged me $150.  Please include this charge with your rent check this Friday July 14 and please do not ever store anything else in there.  You can use the garage.""  ""I am sorry Jane but I am not going to pay for it. I did not create it.  It was super dangerous to have stuff next to those cables too""  I feel like the landlord is completely in the wrong here. I think it is reasonable for Jane to assume she could use the closet as she was paying to rent the attic. Even the landlord called the space a closet in the text. What if a fire had broken out while Jane was sleeping?  Jane is willing to move out, but the landlord has the deposit. The repair bill is $150 so it's really not worth consulting an attorney. If the landlord is in the wrong, how can we approach this situation?"	No
I have a friend who is a minor who lives in the UAE (united arab emirates) whose parents just divorced. They are all citizens of the US and not of the UAE. There may be some up-coming custody issues and what court system they would take place in would completely change the outcome. So the question is where would the decision take place? In the US where they are citizens, or in the UAE where they live most of the year?	No
I am in Washington state. I am on a year lease and am pretty sure it states I forfeit my deposit if I move out early. This is a long one, so I don't blame you for not reading.  So it all started upon moving in. We did a walk through, it was 5pm in February, so it was dark out (we found all sorts of things after the walk through that I know they're going to try to screw us on).  To spare you all the details, we didn't end up staying there until the next night. When we went to take a shower the next day, there was no hot water. We fucked around with the weird instant water heater but could not get it to work. By this time, it was after hours on a Friday. After harassing them all weekend, we finally had hot water that Wednesday.    Then, they freaked out on us that we got a puppy. Even though we had told them we had planned on getting a dog, at no point did they tell us it had to be pre-approved or that there were age restrictions. We managed to haggle our way into a trade-off because of the whole water fiasco.   Then, they call us all the time, at least once a week. About hey, someones gonna stop by to do this or, in the summer time someone is going to have to do this. They wouldn't tell us how to get the dog's paperwork all done, and then kept calling us when we had done it wrong.  They gave us a call saying someone was stopping by to look at some water damage noted in the walk through. We say it's not a good time and they're like oh shit. Look outside and there is a van pulling in. Not much of a 24 hour notice. They left right away though.   In rolls spring/summer, and surprise! they do quarterly inspections (for our benefit of course).  They give the time frame of 9-5 on a weekday and that they need full access to the house. Also, somebody is coming to seed the grass, oh and we need to water it in, but no one has shown us how to work the irrigation system.  Plus, the dog can't be out there. All day long.   They do the inspection, and we get a letter that some areas need the weeds pulled. The areas aren't in the lease, but I decide I'm capable of handling that. A few days later, I get an email saying that they found a pin hole in one of the blinds with a shit resolution picture and that the slat needs to be replaced. I go inspect all the blinds and not one of them is damaged. After going back and forth over these fucking blinds for a month about are you sure that's our house? which blinds are they? bedroom 1, which bedroom is bedroom1? okay, where on the blinds is it? having to deal with a whole bunch of bullshit, sending them 20 pictures of the blinds in detail, they finally send the inspector back out, she goes, says she doesn't know why they didn't just mark it as fixed, looks at blinds, scratches off a piece of dirt and says they're fine.   Then they say the landlord is stopping by for a few days to paint the house and do other outdoor work but no one needs to be home. While he was there, he needed us to open the gate, and he took off our front door, so we went a day without a door in the heat.   Then comes the final straw. We had someone over, roofing the house. Once again, all outdoor work, no one needs to be home. Good cus it's a Monday and we have jobs. Well, I got home and my dog was gone. They had unlatched a gate and left it open. I drove all over the neighborhood looking for her. Stressing out major. I tried calling them, to ask wtf, pissed at this point. Then I get a call from them, saying some neighbor had called the landlord saying they thing the dog got out and that the landlord had left the gate open for the workers when he left. They said they would call back through to see if they had my dog.  I went outside, about to go searching, when I heard her whining. She was next door. It took hours to get her to stop whining. The neighbor had watched her all day, took her swimming, and asked around the neighborhood about her.   I called the management company letting them know I had the dog but that I was still unhappy with all this shit. They basically said, oh we will just note this in your file so it doesn't happen again. This is not good enough. I am so tired of dealing with them. The house and area is alright, but I am so sick of having to deal with this company. I just want to live somewhere, pay rent, and then move on. Not be called or visited by them all the time and then have them screw up this badly.   What can I do?  TL;DR management company sucks, indirectly responsible for my dog going missing, and a whole host of other issues.	No
"Hello! As a small business owner, I am looking for help from lawyers/business owners alike. I have run into a fraudulent injury lawsuit from a stranger on my property. This person claims that a piece of equipment on my property hurt him as he was passing through. The person has no proof and when asked to provide medical documentation or pictures of the injury, the person refused. Knowing what I do about the equipment in question and his story presented, it is not possible that what was claimed actually happened. In addition, the person is claiming an exorbitant amount of money. It is obvious that it is someone with a piece of shit lawyer looking to make a quick buck. As a small business owner, I do not have access to high power lawyers nor do I have the money to just pay off people for everything they threaten lawsuits with. When asking my insurance appointed lawyer how this could possibly hold up in court, I am told it is a sympathy case and there is no way to defend against it. It is absolutely infuriating that I am not protected in some way from fraudulent injury claims especially with no proof! It seems that the system is rigged against the ""big bad company"". How can a small business stay in business with no protection against these shit heads? Big companies obviously have cash to pay off people or lawyers on retainer. For me, a lawsuit can literally make or break my company. Does anyone have any advice on how to deal with this? Or how to retaliate?"	No
Does California have any laws that prevent the landlord from posting text messages/emails between the landlord and tenant? Asking since a family friend has a particularly unruly tenant that has been damaging property, withholding payment, using racial slurs, etc and the landlord (my friend) wants to share this. Thanks.	No
I help run the treasury of a small club in Michigan. Someone is sending fraudulent emails, claiming to be the club president, and using the presidents name and current vacation location. I've already talked to the president, and we need to get this taken care of. Who exactly do we call about this? Aside from ignoring it, what can we do? They appear to be using our clubs own email.	No
"First off, this is in California. Here's the issue: we moved into our current apartment about 6 months ago. There were no signs of bed bugs and we did not have bed bugs. 6 months later we begin to find bed bugs and we contact our property manager. They inform us the owner will not be paying for treatment and it is our responsibility because he replaced carpets before we moved in. I've been doing lots of reading/research and I can't get a definitive answer on who is truly responsible for the treatment cost. Anyways, couple days later the landlord has a exterminator come out to inspect. Before he even looks around, he tells us ""the bugs came from your neighbor next door. She's had them for a long time and doesn't want to pay for treatment. She wants me to look inside but I'm not going it. It's pointless. I know she still has the bugs."" So now we know where they originated. Here's the part where it gets tricky. We signed a bed bug addendum when we moved in basically saying we understand the landlord believes there to be no bugs and we will not hold him financially responsible for treatment. Does that still hold up if we signed it under the impression there were none when the owners knew that there were? I want the place treated either way, but can the landlord hit us with the bill for treatment if it is known that they didn't originate with us? Do we need to go after the neighbor for the cost? Sorry for the long post, just trying to find answers before I start raising serious hell."	No
I spoke to management today about it and she said he is a football player and they have had issues with football players being loud and a disturbance. She said she would email him about the complaint and told me to call the cops next time I heard it. I also constantly smell weed from in front of his department. I really don't want to call the cops and get this guy kicked off the team, and I'm also not sure they'll take me seriously because I already called once and no one came out that I'm aware of., and this is a college town so I'm worried they'll just let it slide because of his status. However, I can't stand the loud thumping at 2 am every morning coming through my walls. I don't want to go over there in case they gang up on me (usually multiple football players there at one time).   What should I do and would the cops even take me seriously for a noise complaint? It IS against our city ordinance for it to be heard through an apartment dwelling.	No

My grandfather has dementia and my mom and him set up my mom to be his financial and medical POA. Located in Illinois.  It's been 4 years and my mom has slacked completely. She hasn't done his taxes, some bills have gone unpaid, and last but not least his debit card bounced because she didn't transfer money to it (really confused him and was a bad day).  I'm not sure my mom wants to give up this title but it's at a really bad point. It won't be an easy conversation but something needs to be done.  What are my best / worst case scenarios?  Thanks.	No
So it all started one sunday morning when me and my family decided to fly to california. My mom is a relatively frugal woman so she tried to get the cheapest tickets for an airline due to us having 6 members including her in the family. So we go to the airport get passed security and find ourselves boarding the plane she boards first due to her having multiple sclerosis. Then the rest of us board. We get a little confused because we got business seating. Theres first class, business then the regular coach. But there we are literally in the back of the plane with no way to push our seats back. And other people start boarding so were literally stuck there for the ride. After that terrible flight were onto another flight to get to cali. My moms bladder is insanely good thank god. Her having no movement of her legs, it gets quite hard as you can imagine. But on this flight she finds herself needing to use he bathroom and what do you know the bathroom isn't handicap accessible they had to hold up a curtain on both sides of the plane so no one could see her and my dad as she used a basic right. I would curse every sentence but im sure thats probably not allowed. So my mom was utterly humiliated and she wants to sue the airline. My question to you lovely people is should she sue? And would it have to be a class action suite of some kind?	No
A neighbor hired a contractor to come in my land and remove ivy plants that had been growing up my trees for decades. I've spoken to four arborists, and all say they don't value trees or plants, and that I have to ask the insurance company for a valuation. For obvious reasons, I'd rather have my own number going into this.	No
I have an apartment in south west Wisconsin. I've lived here for 5 years and been a very responsible tenant. I have two other roommates.   So our faucet would leak when used, but it was a small drip and we didn't notice it for a long time. The result of the leak was mold in the cabinet space below. That section will need to be replaced. I reported the leak and concern for mold. They fixed the leak and sprayed the mold with an assurance that it was taken care of, but the cabinets have not been replaced.   I'm about to move out next month and I'm concerned that they have put off the replacement until after we move out and charged me for the damages and I don't have renters insurance.   Is there anything I can do to get some assurance that I won't be effected by these damages?	No
"Location: Los Angeles, California  Stressing out about this. It's the first lease I ever signed, and I messed up.  I've been living in this unit for the past two years without being on the lease (basically subletting from my friend/roommate). He's moving out, and a new lease was signed. I am on good terms with the property manager, whose parents own the property and are thus technically/legally my landlord(s) (I think?). I've never met them or interacted with them in any way.  Specific section:  &gt;Tenant agrees to pay for all utilities and services, and the following charges ___ (left blank in our lease), except ____ (also left blank), which shall be paid by landlord.  &gt;If any utilities are not separately metered, Tenant shall pay Tenant's proportional share, as reasonably determined and directed by landlord.  My roommate and I were previously not responsible for water. Neither my roommate or the person who's room I took recall if the lease they signed had an exception for water in the contract. I asked around, and no one that I know who rents anywhere in Southern California pays anything for water unless the water bill is in their name and they have a separate line.  I messed up here by assuming that the PM had written in the exception prior to meeting, since everything else that I expected (like parking) was written in. The PM and my new roommate seemed to be in a bit of a hurry, so I felt a bit rushed and didn't read through everything as thoroughly as a normally do. I know, not an excuse, lesson learned.  The building does not have separate meters, only one single meter for the entire building.  I called the PM after signing and realizing that the exception for water wasn't written in. He told me not to worry about it, they cover water because it's a single meter for the entire building, and they would continue to cover water as before even though it wasn't written in the lease.  What I'm worried about now is receiving some sort of backcharge for water bills. If the landlord starts to ask for $x per month to account for water and it's reasonable, that's fine, my fault for not getting the exception in writing.   My concern is that, at some point long after I've moved out, I'm going to get a bill for months or years worth of distributed water charges. At that point, I feel like I would not be able to realistically ask for proof and a breakdown, and I may not even be in California anymore to contest it.   I'm worried that such a bill would not only take the tenants into account, but also landlords costs like watering the lawns, and thus end up being quite significant.  The biggest thing that worries me is the possibility that we are the only tenants who have agreed to be responsible for water costs (or that there's a couple more in the building, but not many).   I'm worried that my new roommate and I could suddenly be legally responsible for more than our proportional share of the water costs based on other tenants' lease agreements, or, in the worst case, legally responsible for *all* of the building's water if everyone else has a water exception in their lease.   Did I basically just give my landlords carte blanche to distribute any water usage running through the building's meter in any way/proportions that they see fit?   Do I have any right to say something like ""hey, it's fine for you to start charging me for water, but you need to charge me on a regular basis, and we need to agree upon the terms for our share of the cost""?   Is there any way for me to protect myself against back-charges?   If I wanted to ask for an assurance in writing that I wouldn't get billed for water without first working out a specific calculation for the split, where do I find a generic template or guide for creating a document like that? I know my PM / the landlords won't be under any obligation to sign it, but I hope he'll consider it after I explain how much this is stressing me out."	No
"I just opened a letter containing a warrant for not attending the court mandated, ""Mothers Against Drunk Driving"" class. It's not a good excuse, but the deadline slipped my mind as I've been focused on completing my 3 month DUI program (weekly group sessions, 6 weekly education classes, 3 AA meetings). In fact, I'll be done with the program this Friday.  I called a bail bonds place and he said they could put the bail ahead of time or something like that, where they would schedule a court date. But he also mentioned for a misdemeanor warrant, he doesn't expect I would have to do any jail time.   My question: what should I expect going to court tomorrow? The letter states to come in at 8:30 Monday-Friday. If I try to handle it without the bail bond and try to show up at the court and attempt get and extension with a public defender, will I be arrested on the spot? I'm just struggling for cash, so I want to know if paying the bail bonds place ahead of time is absolutely necessary."	No
My gf works in hospitality, she closed out her drawer and made her drop into the safe at work which then got stuck and did not make it into the safe. After she had left her coworker came and stole the envelope out of the safe. They have cameras and caught him on camera doing this. He is denying it and will be taking a lie detector test. The owner of the business told her that if he doesn't fess up she will be responsible for paying him back. Im trying to figure out what we need to do. Apparently this is a problem with the safe and she has always made sure to check to make sure her drops made it into the safe, apparently this time is got stuck on the side and she did not notice it when checking and thought it made into the safe. I'm just worried that if he does not fess up etc that they will try to hold her paycheck, it was around one thousand dollars stolen and she does not have the money to pay them back.	No
Hey now, So I wanted to move out of my apartment for 3 months of summer so I could go to europe. Well, I put an ad on facebook for someone to take over my lease for 3 months. We're not really allowed to do it at the apts I live in so we just agreed to have him pay me directly.   we didn't have a contract or anything. But I've got texts and so forth.   He paid the first two months, 500 each month, but i was gone the first two weeks of this month (july) and it's been difficult getting him to pay me.   Is there anything I can do to make sure that he pays the last month before he leaves?   I have his phone number but I dont know where he's moving to next.	No
So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
She asked for all original copies so she could bring them to wherever and have them copied. She said I wouldn't have to sign anything and it would be fine, because they just need proof that the person coming here knows a citizen from America.  This seemed really sketchy to me, 1 because I haven't known them THAT long... and 2 - she asked not to tell my mom (who keeps all of those documents for me) and lie to her and say that it was for work purposes.  My question is - is this as sketchy as I think it is? My mom told me it was definitely not OK to give those documents over and not to 'vouch' for anyone coming especially someone I don't know.  What are your thoughts?	No
My ex-wife and I separated nearly 3 years (8/2014), we were unable to file divorce paperwork due to a lack of finances. I was laid off a couple days after we split up. We eventually gathered the money ($200 ea) to file and I sent it to her along with my side of the paperwork as I was out of the state. This was in 03/2017. After she received it, she filed indigent and ended up only paying $10 in court fees. Unbeknownst to me, she was pregnant at the time and gave birth just prior to our 1st court date sometime in May. The court ordered her to filed an amended petition stating the child was not mine. The case manager would not provide me with a copy of the amendment, nor would she. I went to the clerk of the court where she reaffirmed that the new petition has the child as being not common to the marriage. So I went ahead and filled out the Answer Waiver and Request for Copy of Final Judgement and filed it with the clerk. Since then, I've now received a general form informing me about child support and their website. Then just today, I received another Case Management Conference date. This is asking me to file a Financial Affidavit and a Certificate of Completion of Mandatory Disclosure prior to the next court date in 2 weeks.   So my questions here, is this standard protocol for divorce proceedings with a child? I'm not sure if she's trying to come after me for child support or if this is the normally required paperwork. Also, why would I be required to fill this out, when in the initial Dissolution paperwork, we both signed that our finances were being taken care of between us. Now, if she is trying to get child support, can I get the judge to order a paternity test and have it thrown out? And I've been without any steady employment for nearly 6 months and I'm a full time student. What can they possibly expect to get from me for child support. If it makes any difference to the child support, she's already engaged to be married to the guy she cheated on me with and it is his child. Would this help me get out of paying child support for this kid?  Sorry for the wall of text, obviously just don't want to get stuck making payments for someone else's kid for the next 18 years.  Thanks for your time	No
Hi Reddit, I'm wondering if I'm responsible for one year's lease if I have sent photos of the lease to the landlord. *Details : - It's a 3-bedroom apartment - Myself and one other roommate secured the apartment  with a security deposit only  (no first &amp; last month rent, and no realtor fee) - We each signed the lease before taking photos of the pages to the landlord - There is no signature from the landlord  Question is, am I responsible for the entire year's lease?	No
Hey everyone and thanks for any advice in advance. I have already contacted two lawyers that specialize in this kind of thing. I am waiting to hear back.   So last sunday my now ex went back to the hospital to be admitted for the 5th time because of her refusal to stay in treatment for her bi-polar and psychosis.(im using that as a catch all because eash time she goes in they call it something different. Schizophrenia, schizophreniform and a number of other things)   I am just tired of it. We have put alot of effort into this and she drops out of treatment every time. This is the first time she has gone twice in one year. Just last month was the other time.  I really don't want her having full physical custody of the children because i dont feel like she will stay in treatment again anyways. Besides some of the stuff ahe tells them when she is having an episode i dont think she has the means by herself.   I have supported her for years, someone always has. The support she wouldb get from me would no where near enough to raise two children in a decent setting.  The other complication is we are moving out this week and she wont be welcome. I wont be staying in this house anymore and neither will the children. I told her i would give her a key to getv her things but the electric and water will be off on the 26th. So there is no point in her staying here. The only place she could go is her dads and he has begged me not to pawn her off on him. .  As far as the boys go.. I offered to do an unnoficial agreement where they live with me and she can come get them whenever she wants. But i dont know how well that will work. Or if it is even legal.  With the info i provided do i have a chance? This is scary because i have heard so many stories of how men get screwed on this stuff.   Isv there anything i can do to prepare?	No
Location: Tippecanoe County, Indiana (West Lafayette, zip code 47906)  Hello fellow Redditers,  I am having an issue with a girl I subleased my apartment to. It is an unofficial sublease and management does not know about it. There is a clause in the lease stating unofficial subleases are not allowed.  Basically what is happening is my tenant is 2 weeks late on rent and is avoiding any questions about it. I paid rent to my landlord, but have not been reimbursed for it. She is also ignoring my calls and texts, or says she is at work and cannot take my calls. She also lacks the common courtesy to return my calls once she gets off work. I have no idea what to do in this situation.    Additionally, the lease ends on August 2nd 2017 and if she is not moved out and has the keys turned in to the management, there is a $250 a day holdover charge. What options do I have to fix this situation?   There are agreements that have been made over text that I have a record of. However, I need advice on how to handle this predicament currently, and possibly legally in the future.  Thank you for your advice!	No
"I had 3 teeth extracted yesterday by a local oral surgeon, and after I got home and the numbness began to wear off, I realized that one of the 3 was not one I had asked them to pull. I had a referral list with x rays from my dentist that reccomended 5 for extraction, but included a note that said ""per patient which ones"". I had opted to only do 3 for now since they were patially broken and painful, was going to ask my dentist about options to save the other 2 since they hadn't been painful. Before they started I was showing the assistant which ones I wanted done, and I opened my mouth and pointed to each one. I explained also that I had no clue which teeth the numbers on the list corresponded to, and my dentist had told me to just show them which ones that they would know the numbers. I thought she seemed to understand which ones I meant, but later I realized they pulled the one in front of one I had asked them to pull. It was on the list, but as I said, I wanted to try to save it. I called the office up, but they were already closed and the best I could do was leave a message with the answering service explaining what happened. What are my options for dealing with this? ""I'm sorry"" clearly won't bring my tooth back, and I'm less interested in money than I am in being able to eat as normally as possible again."	No
"Hello, long time reader, first time poster.  I'm writing on behalf of my mother (the leaseholder), who is writing on behalf of my sister and her boyfriend (the occupants). My sister has some pretty serious mental health issues--this wouldn't be relevant, except it makes her particularly suggestible and easy to manipulate, which the landlord has tried to take advantage of.  Three weeks ago, a quiet flood started in her apartment's bathroom late at night, coming from the toilet bowl. The toilet does not have a shut off valve, and even if it did, I believe that only stops the flow to the tank. The water was already coming out of the bathroom before they discovered it. They attempted to dam the bathroom with towels and pillows, but the apartment was flooded with several inches of water before a late-night plumber could arrive. The plumber is the one who reported that the leak was caused by a ""failed safety valve"". A remediation crew was called in, who set up heaters and dryers for four days. The apartment smells like mildew as a result. Unfortunately, my sister is very suggestible and yields to anyone she sees as an authority figure: the landlord told her that she was not to take any pictures of the damage under any circumstance.  Yesterday, an eviction notice drafted by a paralegal, dated last Friday was slipped under the door (the part that normally gets filled out regarding delivery method is completely blank). Notably, no notice was provided to the actual leaseholder, my mother. It says the following:  &gt;You and/or your occupants are seriously interfering with the Landlords' management of these premises as well as with their lawful rights, privileges and interests. You are further interfering with the other residents' reasonable enjoyment of these premises.  &gt;That on or about January 22, 2016 you entered into a tenancy agreement to rent these premises from the Landlord and that these premises were fully furnished by the Landlord for you at move in with furniture, towels, linens, pictures, mirrors and/or household items.  &gt;That on or about Wednesday, July 19 2017 between approximately 3:00 pm and 4:00 pm the Landlord inspected your premises and discovered that you and/or your occupant(s) are not keeping your apartment in a clean and sanitary condition. The landlord noted that all of the furniture, towels, linens, pictures, mirrors and/or household items in this unit as given to you at move in is destroyed and/or ruined by you and/or your occupant(s) and that there is a foul odor emanating from your apartment.  &gt;That the landlord is holding you responsible for the costs of replacing all damaged furniture, towels, linens, pictures, mirrors and/or household items which were not maintained by you and/or your occupant(s). That the cost to furnish this apartment and restore the apartment to a habitable condition as was given to you at move in is in the amount of $11,413.14.  &gt; That is in accordance with the Residential Tenancies Act, 2006, S.O. Chapter 17 Paragraphs and 64 (1) and 62 (1). It states:   &gt;64(1) - A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant is such that it substantially interferes with the reasonable enjoyment of the residential complex for all usual purposes by the landlord or another tenant or substantially interferes with another lawful right, privilege or interest of the landlord or another tenant.  &gt;62. (1) (1) A landlord may give a tenant notice of termination of the tenancy if the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person whom the tenant permits in the residential complex wilfully or negligently causes undue damage to the rental unit or the residential complex.  &gt; Furthermore, Section 33 outlines the tenant's responsbility regarding the cleanliness of their unit:  &gt;33. The tenant is responsible for ordinary cleanliness of the rental unit, except to the extent that the tenancy agreement requires the landlord to clean it.  &gt;You are hereby notified to immediately cease and desist from all the forgoing conduct and to restore your unit to a clean, sanitary and habitable condition within 7 days from date hereof. Further, you hereby requested [sic] to make payment for the damage caused in the amount of $11,413.14 as detailed above within 7 days from date hereof.  &gt;Your failure to comply with this Notice will result in the Landlord instituting eviction proceedings.  Now, I'm in real estate myself--the appraisal side of things--I've taken real estate law, but this is a little over my head. I know Ontario has some of the most tenant-friendly laws in the country. I'm confident the tenants didn't cause the flood. I'm confident the plumber would agree with that, unless he's on the take. As far as I can tell, it's actually the landlord who should be on the hook for breaching the tenants' right to quiet enjoyment and a safe home. The RTA states:  &gt; 20 (1) A landlord is responsible for providing and maintaining a residential complex, including the rental units in it, in a good state of repair and fit for habitation and for complying with health, safety, housing and maintenance standards.  2006, c. 17, s. 20 (1).  Tenants are only responsible for:  &gt; 34 The tenant is responsible for the repair of undue damage to the rental unit or residential complex caused by the wilful or negligent conduct of the tenant, another occupant of the rental unit or a person permitted in the residential complex by the tenant.  2006, c. 17, s. 34.  This landlord is well known for being a scumbag; reviews for the property on rental sites are not favorable. If this were a commercial lease, I'd call a lawyer... but I know tenancy-issues sometimes go through a board or tribunal or something. It's also under the small claims limit, which means a paralegal can represent you in court, should it get that far.  What's the right move here? What would the leaseholder be entitled to if we went after them for breach, and is that a reasonable course of action? How would that be initiated?"	No
My roommates and I leased a place for a year, we since moved out after making sure its clean except a broken window. We even moved out early so that the new tenants can move in ASAP. Its been over a month and we still haven't received our deposits back, we tried calling and emailing, we received an email about a month and a half ago saying that he'll send it mid june, its august now. That was the last we heard from him. We're still attempting to contact him, and no response yet. What should we do?   NOTE: landlord has a rep of not returning deposits and taking a LONG time to response for money related issues.	No
"The company my wife works for called in a worker today who was ""randomly"" chosen for a drug test (turns out, the owner just assumed he was on drugs).

"Hi guys.  I went to get my license changed to a new state (TN) and realized I had two outstanding tickets in Vienna, GA. One was for speeding (46/35) and the other for driving with an expired license.  I completely forgot about them because I was on a work trip, I had left my license with my laptop at the office I was working at and the guy said he couldn't find my new state license (KY) but that he would issue a ticket against my old GA license, which was expired, if I didn't go to the police station and present my ID before with left. I ended up getting called to a different location that night, and now, two years later, am having problems.

I had a monthly parking service with Impark and I no longer needed to use their parking lot after April. I cancelled the service online at the end of April and thought everything was done. During May, they mailed me a letter saying I owed them $52.50 (monthly payment for may) + $25.00 (rejected payment charge) + $15 (late payment admin fee) + $0.75 (service tax). I called their customer service and they told me that their policy is if don't cancel before the 7th of a month, I also have to pay for next month. The payments were supposed to be automated, but my credit card was lost/stolen at the start of May, so they also added on extra charges because they couldn't charge my credit card. I explained to them I haven't received a new card yet and they told me there was nothing they could do because that was their only accepted form of payment. I initially signed up for the service through the phone, and didn't sign any contract; however, they say that since I chose to use their services, I agreed to their terms and conditions.   I didn't deal with it right away because I had to go on vacation 1.5 months. Now that I'm back, I see that they have added on even more additional charges. On top of the $93.25, they also added on $50 (rejected payment charge) + $30 (late admin fee)+ $1.5 (tax) for the months of June and July. Now they say that I owe them $174.75 or my debt will be collected by a collection agency and will affect my credit.    I find it absurd that I have to pay $174.75 when I haven't parked in their parking lot since I cancelled at the end of April. Is there any way I can dispute this or will I have to pay them the money?	No
"Roommates and I moved out and the landlord is asking for money for repairs to damages because the deposit we provided prior to move in is ""not enough"".

I moved into an apartment three weeks ago and since day 1 ive been bombarded with roaches. the first day I walked in there was a dead roach next to the door. immediately called pest control and they said it only comes out every Monday (this was Tuesday) and so for the next week I saw about 4-5 every day. they're in my cupbard, crawling on the walls, in my bathroom... ive laid traps and done everything. its been sprayed twice since then and there are actually more. roach feces everywhere. I have so many pictures. this is bullshit. is there anything I can do?	No
For starters my girlfriend and I signed a year lease four months ago that the only wording for smoking was “Smoking is not allowed.” We both took this as no smoking on the premises. So we smoke across the street and up a couple of houses.  Our landlord recently contacted us stating that there have been complaints from other residents of the property of my girlfriend and I smoking.  He claims this is breaching our lease, and will evict us if we do not comply.  Can he really regulate our smoking off the property? Can he move forward with eviction even though she and I both smoke off the property?  Really don’t want to get evicted here, obviously I know quitting smoking is the easiest way to solve the problem. Any advice other than that?	No
College student signed lease to live in basement room.  Whenever it rains, the carpet gets soaked in certain areas in the room.  I notice it smells when I leave the room and come back.  I have a dehumidifier and air purifier but I'm wondering if I'm endangering my health by spending most of my time in my room.    Does the landlord have any obligation to fix this?  So far the landlord has been nice about it, lending me a large space heater to help dry the carpet.  It would probably be fairly expensive for them to fix the root cause of the problem.  For the most part I do not mind it unless it is affecting my health which I probably will not find out if it does for a while.	No
My property has a city storm drain, which looks obviously broken. The exit of the drain hole is far below the ground level, and all the dirt from my property is sliding into it, and there's no retaining wall to prevent it from happening. The hole of the drain pipe looks like it was snapped, it's uneven. I think the original pipe was longer. The water out of the storm drain gets dumped straight on my property, there's no waterbed, it erodes my hillside  I requested city to repair, they sent a guy and he said it operates as designed, they won;t do anything  To compound the problem, the old owner of the house built a deck close to the drain pipe exit, and there's an easement. The city guy is now threatening that he'll have us remove deck, and that's the only way to get to the basement.  That leaves me in a limbo, as I can't fix city drain (I assume, since they own it, they'll come after me if I do, right?), and not only they won't fix, but if I asking them would make them come and remove the deck. And while that happens, my property takes damage every time it rains  Questions:  1. What are my legal options here? 2. Is there a good attorney in Portland or south of Portland here on Reddit, who could take case, and what will it cost me?	No
Backstory:  Bought my home in Aug 2016.  This is a Phase 2 of a 3 phase development.  There is about 40x40 feet of common area between my property and a drainage ditch.  (see photos at bottom of post)  When I bought the property I was told by my builder that the area would be maintained and sodded to look nice and maintained by the HOA.  Fast forward to March of 2017.  We've engaged the developer and HOA to find out when this common area was going to be developed.  It was basically a wild grass field and was causing weed problems on my property and looked awful.  No response to multiple inquiries.  In May, the developer calls me and asks if I want to take over control of the property with an easement.  They would level and SOD it and extend my water/sprinkler system on to it.  I'd have to water, mow, edge, weed control, everything.  I politely declined and told them it was common area and needed to be handled by the HOA and Developer, including setting it up correctly and maintaining it.  It's already expensive to water and maintain my property, and I'm not paying to maintain HOA controlled property.  Another 2 months pass, we've been going back and forth.  I offer to let them use my water if they pay me for it and they need to maintain the lot.  The developer thinks that's ok and says he'll get back to me.  I speak to one of HOA board members and she said its not fair to compensate me for water and other common areas (Common areas behind property) are maintained at home owners expense if they want anything beyond mowing.  I told her I felt that was a poor decision and because the property is on the SIDE of my home and attached to my property it looks like MY PROPERTY and thusly if they don't properly setup this lot it makes my property look bad.  Regardless, I was ignored.  A week later, without notice, they come out and level the lot and hydroseed it.  No water hooked up to it, nothing.  2 days later, we have a storm blow through (common for OKC) and 25% of the hydroseed blows away.  Keep in mind, Common areas attached to the side of a property in our development are all SODDED with water hooked up to maintain it.  Phase 1 is like this in every case.  The two pictures attached are from May 24th and July 17th, 3 weeks post Hydroseeding.  The lady at the HOA isn't responding to me.  I'm ready to call the developer, but wondering if I should just wait until November at the HOA annual meeting to file a formal request to fix.  My options as I see it today are:  1.  redo the entire lot myself (over my dead body) 2.  Wait until November and file a formal request to fix the lot and setup water on it + RESOD. 3.  Hire and attorney and send a demand letter to resolve and if ignored, file suit to force them to resolve.  Pictures:  http://imgur.com/a/Uyqtd    Thanks in advance, Mackie	No
"I live in Southern California, moved back in with my parents about a year ago with my 2 kids.

"I own a condo in Saskatchewan. Recently, I received a ""summer updates"" email from my condo property managers stating that pets are not allowed. This was the first time I had heard of this rule and there is no indication in any of the past 3 years of AGM minutes that a 'no pets rule' had been discussed or voted on by the condo owners to become a bylaw.   The condo I own is occupied by new tenants who have one cat (and now want a second). I have told them not to get a second cat until I figure this out.   I also want to get more information about this new no pets rule/ bylaw from the property managers but I am worried that if I start asking, they will then realize that my tenants have a cat and will take action to have it removed. I really like these tenants and want to keep them happy.   Any advice or thoughts on how to proceed?   Should i just ignore the rule but only let my tenants keep one cat? Should I contact my property managers and potentially point out that I have a cat in my unit while getting more info? Any other ideas?"	No
"I'm in MD, currently kids are visiting their dad in FL.     To make a long story short (and less identifying) there is an INSANE amount of inappropriate stuff going on at the fathers house where my 2 young children are staying, where they are currently on their court ordered visitation for the next few weeks.  I understand different houses have different rules, and I can't ""make"" their father do anything.  But in light of gathering some actual evidence of how out of control this is, am I legally allowed to record a conversation with my kid if they know they are recorded?  My guess is as minors the answer is I would need permission from their legal guardian, but since that's me I don't see it being an issue?  Or would their father have to consent?      Custody order is in MD, I have legal tie breaking authority.  Basically I have the final say over the kids well being education, health, etc wise."	No
"I am the only one of my 4 roommates moving out. I am moving out of my apartment on August 2nd. The next tenant waived the ""clean up"" period to move in as soon as I move out. The apartment complex told me that they don't prorate rent and that I need to pay the full month, but told the other guy that they DO prorate rent and that he would have to pay for the time he lived in the apartment, which is essentially the whole month. So they are basically charging both of us a full month's rent for the same room in the apartment. Is it legal for them to prorate for him but not for me? They are double dipping and it feels illegal, but I'm not a lawyer."	No
I'm trying to put out a piece of hardware that would be used by laboratories, so I guess it falls under the umbrella of lab equipment. Obviously, I would like to comply with all regulations, but was wondering what relevant organizations/documents I should take a look at. I was thinking along the lines of FDA/FCC maybe? Any help would be appreciated!	No
In North California.   So we are 5 guys and got a girl to live with us. I meet this girl winter quarter and she seemed normal. Really social and seemed chill. She turned out to be friends with my friend from high school and I was like ok she must be normal and all. However, this girl turned out to be crazy. She doesn't understand boundaries. It's clear she has a mental illness. She caused a fire in her current place and instead of calling 911.. she snapchatted it. She eats other people's food. She can't take care of herself and cooks food that is raw, which caused her to be hospitalized. She turned out to be really shady. Like we have no idea who her family is or if there are any guardians in her life. Literally, her family didn't visit when she was in the hospital. This is too much for college students to handle. Worst part is that she claims to have a family full of lawyers and she has already on the lease for next year. Now one other housemate is saying he'll move out if she lives with us. I don't know what to do. We talked to management and the only way we can take her of the lease is if she agrees. I'm not sure what to do. This girl isn't someone that can be reasoned with. I'm really not sure what to do.	No
So this is somewhat long, please bear with me:   It is my first time renting and after 18 months (last 6 in a month-to-month) I got a 90-day end of tenancy notice saying that the house is for sale.   Now, I was not sure what I was doing and this followed:   1) Unaware of the 30-day notice to vacate I had to sent I immediately started looking for new apartments and was accepted on a new one today (07/11) with move-in date on August 1st.   2) and I called the property management to notify I had found a new place and that I would be able to move on August 1st. The agent said it was OK through over the phone.   After reading about it better I found I had to send a 30-day notice, which was not compatible with move out date of 08/01.   3) I give the agent a call and tell him I have to send a 30-day notice but in order for it to be valid for 08/01 my date would have to be 07/01. He says it's OK and even tell me that simply stating via email that I was able to move 08/01 was enough. I disagree and say I'll send you a 30-day noticed like that anyway.   4) I send him a 30-day today notice to the same email he was talking to me, backdated 07/01 and ask for him to acknowledge it and confirm that he was in agreement with my moving date. He does neither of that and ignores the e-mail.   In other e-mails he is always really vague and avoid direct answers to my August 1st move-out date. He refuses to specify a prorated rent in the case I move in that date.   Now to the problem:   That 30-day notice says I recognize that failure to vacate on the date set forth may cause owner/agent to suffer actual damages.  Question:   1) Does he have to acknowledge the 30-day notice on his e-mail and answer my question in order for the notice to be valid?   2) What happens if I do it the usual way and send first class mail with another one dated 07/12 with a later move out date? Will he be able to say I already had sent one and did not vacate, therefore causing damages?   3) What is the best way to fix this mess, invalidate the unanswered, previous 30-day notice and have a valid move out date so that I don't end up paying an extra rent?   Let me know if some part of it is too convoluted so I can explain it better.  Thanks all!	No
Today I found out that my company didn't contribute to my 401k for 3 years ever since I started working there. Even though I elected to have it maxed out and Fidelity has that on record, my employer simply has never carried out the contributions. When I asked HR about it they only said that there is nothing they can do. Is this true or am I legally entitled to some compense or solution to catch up on what I missed?	No
This is in Brooklyn, NY. Last Saturday, 7/1 I picked up my car from a parking garage I rent a space from in Brooklyn. I noticed some body damage that I hadn't seen before, so I filled out a damage report since I believed it was the responsibility of the garage.   Today I heard back from the owner of the garage. He let me know over the phone that the staff had pointed out the damage to me when the car was returned, so unfortunately it wasn't their responsibility. I didn't remember this happening and while my wife also uses the car, she hadn't told me anything about it,  The owner sent me the security footage to review, but because of the format I wasn't able to at that moment. I promised him I would and then get back to him.  When I reviewed the footage I did see that on June 30 (the day before I reported the damage) the car was in the lot and I see an attendant pointing out the damage to someone. I'm assuming that person is the driver, returning the car to the lot.  The person in the footage isn't me or my wife, the only two people who pick up the car. I never authorized anyone else to pick up the car, nor did my wife.   The body damage is just cosmetic so it wouldn't be thousands (I don't think) to fix, but it would be at least a few hundred, maybe more. I'm also really anxious about what was done in my car without me knowing and how often this might have happened. I am due to move out of state this Thursday, 7/13, so I'll be severing my relationship with the garage anyway, but I'd appreciate any advice on how best to proceed. Thanks!	No
So I was dropping off uber passengers in the City of Chicago on wrigley field.  They told me to stop on the street on the main light. Cops were there and they started writing a ticket on me and she pulled out a paper and was probably writing my licence plate.  No one was behind me, so I just went off. Could they mail me a ticket with just my licence plate? Or did the cop give up and let me go?	No
"My brother got a girl pregnant via one night stand, the baby is now 2. He wants primary custody. Here are the circumstances.  The mother has no criminal record. Has her own home. Has 3 kids. Works as a CNA and makes probably $25,000ish a year. She is the custodial parent. We are concerned about her volatile relationships. She has had several boyfriends since her daughter was born. She keeps getting back together with the other 2 kids's dad, an alcoholic who has been arrested for DUIs several times; as recently as March 2017. Everytime they've broken up, she blasts him all over Facebook, posts pictures of him cheating on her with her sister, goes into these huge drama posts. He supposedly threatened to set their house on fire during one of their off-periods.   My brother expressed concern the last time she got back together with him. She said he was still drinking, but that she would get him help by bringing him to a church sobriety program once a week. My brother used to check the fridge every time he'd go over there out of concern for Baby. 3 months later, they're still together, she's still having alcohol around the house. She posted on Facebook a few weeks ago a picture of her boyfriend working on their car next to a beer, and captioned it with ""yeah that's his beer, if you have something stupid to say about it, say it to my face!""   It's just a matter of time before they break up again and more drama erupts. Last time they broke up, she had posted on Facebook that the guy wasn't safe for her kids to be around, and that she'd never let him around them again. Before she brought this guy back into her life, she had a different boyfriend where there was a domestic dispute, they both assaulted each other but neither pressed charges, and the kids had to be locked in their room. Brother has a text of her talking about it.   She smoked cigarettes while pregnant with all of her kids and still smokes. She sent my brother a text about how she was smoking in the car and an ash flew under her butt and she crashed the car, several months ago. She's posted several videos on Facebook of her recording her kids dancing to music at a 180 degree angle from the road, and has one video (albeit a year old) where one of her kids is next to her in the passenger's seat.  Brother is a registered sex offender. Offense was committed 8 years ago. Makes 40k a year, has his own home and lives with a girlfriend. They've been in a stable relationship for a year. Never has brought the daughter around any other girls.  In the court ordered parental agreement, my brother is only supposed to see Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. However, through informal agreements, my brother has seen the baby every weekend Thursday-Sunday for several months. Before that, informally he had the baby Thursday-Sunday every other week, and visited on the alternating weeks.   My brother drives 1 and a half hours to see his daughter one way, it should be mentioned. He's driving 6 hours round trip each week to have his daughter.   Our biggest issues are her instability and that everytime Mother gets mad she threatens to ""enforce"" the actual parental agreement, which would mean that Brother only gets Baby every other week Friday-Sunday. She uses the daughter as a pawn to control my brother.   He used to give her $200 a month, undocumented, on top of his child support. He stopped after a lawyer advised him to, she went hysterical and nearly ""enforced the agreement"" again. It's walking on eggshells with her now. Any day she will probably pull their informal agreement. We don't even know if he'll  be allowed to get her this upcoming week.  Our question -   My brother wants to hire a lawyer and go to court. He wants the primary custodian title, shared decision making and to have Baby 5/7 days while the Mother would get her during the weekends. Is this possible, considering the circumstances? We have screenshots of everything I mentioned, texts she's sent him, etc. He just doesn't want to waste the $4000 retainer for a lawyer if this is going to be a waste of time or if there's not enough here, if his sex offender status would not allow for it, etc.   The mother likely can't afford a lawyer. Don't know if she would be representing herself or what, but probably.   Thanks."	No
I'm just wondering if I'm opening myself up to anything here. I bought a car last year and was told that it had a clean title. When I asked if it had been in any accidents they avoided the question. I Carfaxed the car a couple months ago and found out it was a total loss rebuilt that is somehow not marked on the title.   I submitted a BBB complaint and the owner has done nothing but make up lies, saying I was told about the damage and repair before purchase, and even lying by saying I hadn't driven the car prior to purchase.  It's ridiculous, and at this point if I'm not going to be compensated I will make sure others know about their practices.	No
"Hi, I'm in the UK currently, and I'm 18 years old. My mum and dad had a really bad breakup.Me and my Dad are moving to Canada in a few weeks, and while my dad is in Canada looking for a house, I've been staying with my Mum. Long story short she let me borrow a laptop, and she left her Facebook logged in when I went to use it. I saw a message that mentioned my name so I used the search bar in the messages to find other messages mentioning me.   She mentioned to two separate people that she wants to 'Go buy some illegal drugs and stuff them in (dad's) suitcase.' Obviously intending to cause issues at the airport and stop us from flying, possibly even worse.   She also mentioned ""Someone left their keys here by accident... Must have had the wrong ones cut when I went to get a copy of our own house keys made"", implying that she purposely had a copy of my dads house key cut. She also says that she used this to find documents in my dads house that told her what part of the new city we will be living in, and where my dad will be working.  She explained to a friend how she was planning on putting a satellite tracker in my camera bag, talking about how its battery is good for 5 days, and how it is accurate to 5-15 meters.   IN this conversation she also mentions wanting to find where to get drugs to plant in my dads suitcase.   Other more minor things she talked about were an IP grabber to find our new IP and using this to find our new location, and giving me essential oils without me knowing to help me sleep. Obviously the oils are not as concerning as the other problems but still makes me uncomfortable.  Screenshots to see what I'm talking about:  http://i.imgur.com/IgGHwpe.png?2 Illegal key cutting, finding documents in my dads house leading to our new adress and his new workplace  http://i.imgur.com/ozSoLnx.png?3  Wanting to plant drugs in my Dads suitcase, the satellite tracker  http://i.imgur.com/ZtT4P6e.jpg?1  Another conversation where she mentions putting drugs in my dads bags  http://i.imgur.com/TClYiXv.png?1  Family friend telling her how to use grabify to get our new ip/find our location  Any help would be appreciated on what to do, is it possible to get a restraining order based on this? There are screenshots for proof in case she deletes the chat logs, she's also taken away the laptop and told me that I will have to find a place to stay until my dad is back and we move to Canada."

Hi r/legaladvice,  I have a question regarding the enforcement of a judge's ruling, and provincial jurisdictions in Canadian courts for small claims.  So to give some short background info, I want to file a case in Small Claims Court against an ex-girlfriend who I lent a lump sum of money to for a week. It's been years and she refuses to pay me back, so I want to go the legal route to get my money back from her.  The issue is that I live in Ontario (whereas she now lives in Alberta) and would like to file the case here, in an Ontario court. The incident also happened in Ontario, so the courts here will accept the case. The problem is that if a judge rules in my favour and she must pay me back, they can't enforce the ruling in Alberta where she lives now, because it's out of their jurisdiction.  So the person I spoke to for information in the Ontario Small Claims Court said I should find out if Alberta courts will enforce rulings made by Ontario courts? I did a lot of online research and couldn't find an answer, so would anyone here know if they would?	No
I am helping a client who has multiple issues with her “rent stabilized apartment” (so trying to help her solve instead of her moving). The apartment is located in a 5 story mixed use building. She lives in the rear on the first floor and the first two apartments are medical offices.  The receptionist and some of the patients smoke in the hallway and/or the front stoop of the building. This smokes permeates into my client’s apartment. She requested from the manager (one person who works for various small landlords) that he place a NO SMOKING sign in the lobby. He refused stating “the landlord would not want that.”  Additionally, there is a noise issue. Again my client is on the first floor and both the patients and other residents will linger on the first floor (hallway) or the front of the building to chat at night (as late as 1:30am). The walls are so thin as are the windows that she hears everything and is awakened at night.  What, if anything, can she do (other than move) – because this, to me would constitute a constructive eviction. Thank you in advance.	No
