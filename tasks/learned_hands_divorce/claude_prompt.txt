Does the post discuss issues around filing for divorce, separation, or annulment, getting spousal support, splitting money and property, and following the court processes?

Post: Hi there, this is really sad and scary, but I think we've reached a point where we would no longer be helping our kids or ourselves to continue living together, and our goal will need to be divorce for everyone's happiness. That said, before I talk to my wife about this and we formalize a plan, I am looking for some advice about things I need to pay attention to to ensure equitable treatment around custody and financial wellbeing should things ever get to a contested divorce or otherwise acrimonious.  Children: My wife and I have child together (2) and a stepchild (7) (she is bio mom). We are on good terms with the father and he sees his child on weekend days.   Finances: We have separate accounts. My wife holds over $30K in debt on various cards and student loans. I have a few thousand debt on a line of credit. My name is on all the house papers and mortgage etc., hers was left off at time of purchase because we couldn't qualify for the mortgage with her debt. I can't see either one of us being able to hold onto the house if we divorce, we will need to sell it.  My fears are specific--that my wife will go on an out of control spending/gambling spree (she has a historic gambling problem) during a year of separation. She gets bitter and grudgey and this clouds her thinking when she is angry. Or, that my wife will play some unbeknownst to me card that allows her full custody of our child.   Any advice about steps to take before, during, or after discussions of separation would be appreciated.

Post: I am unable to locate my ex-spouse.  We are in contact with their lawyer; however, the lawyer will only accept service if we delay our case conference--I would like to maintain our case conference date so we can start filing motions.  However, they have mail forwarding from the house to their new address.  Can I send registered mail with return receipt / signature to the house, and let Canada Post deal with forwarding it to their new address?  Is this acceptable as service?  Does this make sense?

Post: My wife and I divorced 2 years ago. During the divorce she signed off on the house we owned jointly giving me sole possession. Since then I have had a new deed prepared in my name only so now, as far as the house is concerned, I'm the sole owner. However she is still on the loan which I've been making the payments on since she moved out in March 2013. I've never been able to refinance due to terrible credit and though it's improved since I'm still having issues qualifying. She wants me to refinance ASAP so she can be removed so that it won't show on her credit (she's trying to purchase a home elsewhere). Totally understandable and I'm trying to get it done but I'm curious as to my legal obligation to do so. For instance if I cannot qualify, does she have any legal right to challenge my possession? As far as I understood that when she signed away the home during the property division and a new solo deed was processed her rights to the property ended. Is this correct? I live in California for reference.

Post: Hello all, I work as a seasonal full time employee at my college over the summers. It's a pretty sweet deal, because I get to live in campus apartments for free, on top of having a full time job. I have a second job as well. This summer, I'm working with the catering crew in the dining hall. They have lost a few people, leaving us a bit understaffed, and as a result we've been over scheduled and worked over forty hours in one week four times.   We sign in by writing down when we came in and took our breaks, and then we sit down while our boss enters our time in online based on what hours we've worked. However, she lies about when we come in - when we reach overtime, we are told that we're not allowed to work overtime, so we "have" to spread our hours out in the pay period to prevent that. My friend who is also working this job this summer got fourteen hours of over time. She was unable to even claim all of her hours - she's not getting paid for the full time she worked because we were closed down for a week, and it would look suspicious to put down times that no one else would have at all in the entire dining hall staff.   I personally have five hours of overtime that I was told I couldn't claim, and my boss put it down for last Friday and said if anyone asks, we could lie and say I only came in to help unload a delivery truck. In the state of Virginia, which is where I am, overtime (which is when you exceed forty hours in one week) is paid by time and a half, so instead of making $7.25 on those five hours (and my friend on her fourteen that she didn't even get to claim all of), we should have been getting paid $10.88 for each of the hours that we worked over the forty hour limit. By spreading the hours over the pay period, we are only getting paid the minimum for our week of overtime.   I have worked forty hours in the past three days. I'm poor and mostly self supporting, and I used the promise of my paycheck motivate myself to pull through. I need all of the extra money I can get, and frankly, after pulling 12+ hour shifts and only getting six hours of sleep, I feel pretty freaking cheated. My friend is really upset too, because she's in the same boat, and she recently lost her second job.   I have emailed the Virginia Department of Labor, because I went to my boss's supervisor and asked why I couldn't claim the over time that I had worked. He said "Well, it's just not in the budget." I asked him who made the budget, and he said it was campus administration. I ran into my work study employers from the school year, and asked why I was being told I couldn't claim over time. He said the school has the money for it, but doesn't want to pay for it. He also said however that what my boss is doing is extremely wrong, because he's had to give people overtime before. He got chewed out for it, but the student worker was still able to claim their hours and he just made sure not to schedule the student overtime again.   What should I be ready for?? I honestly have no idea what's going to happen from here on out. And I don't want to get in trouble with my boss at work for snitching, or for anyone to get fired, I just want me and my other coworkers to get paid for what we did according to the state's labor laws.

Post: I work for a large, national corporation.   Our local labor union which represents more than 400 local employees has tentatively agreed to a contract this week. They have set a date to vote on the contract, which is this weekend (under 7 days notice).  The union is refusing to let any of the union members read the contract prior to the days of the vote.   I am looking for a legal basis to force them to give us the contract or to extend/block the vote.

Post: Hello world of Reddit.  This may seem inconsequential to some, but for me, this is a big deal..one that has been weighing heavily on my mind the past couple of days..and I do not know where to turn, who to talk to, or if there is any action that can be taken. So...here is my story in short.  I am a first time homeowner. I bought a house in January of 2016 under a construction loan. Although that part does not mean a whole lot to the story, there is a small significance to it. Since my house loan still has not been 'closed' due to us fixing it up, the homeowners insurance cannot be escrowed in yet. Therefore, the first year of homeowners insurance was included in the initial loan amount, and when a year passed, it was time to pay again. This time, it would be out of pocket, because, again. We still have not completed the loan process. Well. We have updated the house significantly. The insurance company told me that I could send in proof of all updates, and that the policy amount would drop significantly. So, time comes to pay the bill, I call the insurance company and they tell me what to send in to update the policy. I send in the documentation. Call back, they don't have everything. Apparently I didnt understand one part. Agent says. No big deal. So I send I'm the proper documentation to the e-mail given to me. I don't hear anything....I send it again. I still don't hear anything. I finally call, and am told that where I sent it was not the proper place. They give me a new place to send it. So I send it...again. At this point I have faxed and emailed. So fast forward to freaking June.... Yes this started in January... And I get a cancelation notice. I call them and explain what is going on, yet once again. They tell me why something wasn't right. I explain to them that it I DID send what they are asking for...once again. They give me a new e-mail to send it to. I send in the info. The insurance agency says, OK, we have this taken care of. You are not canceled and your new policy is $XXX (almost half of what it used to be). I am ecstatic. I get a new e-mail asking for that amount, due by the 28th of June. I pay the full amount on the 12th of June. The money is taken from my account. Fast forward...once again...to yesterday. The bank contacts me to let me know they have received a cancelation notice of my homeowners insurance. I send the confirmation e-mail to my bank, and call the insurance company. After being put on hold numerous times and being on the phone for over an hour, the insurance company tells me that the policy was canceled and the amount I paid was for the coverage from Jan-June! The told me that my policy was NOT canceled and that amount I paid was the new policy amount. There was no mention of the policy only being for the beginning of the year and if my policy was canceled, why was I not offered to reinstate a policy? Oh...that's because they told me it wasn't canceled. Well apparently that is too bad for me. The insurance company gave me a mailing address for a complaint department. They told me I could write a letter and send it in. They would not provide me with a different number, a fax number or e-mail. Just the mailing address. They would not provide me with a refund or a reference number for the call. I also asked for an e-mail to be sent with documentation of contact from the call and proof of attempt of resolution to both me and my bank and they refused.  Now my bank is mad, I'm broke, and uninsured. Do I have any case at all whatsoever? Is there anything I can do? I'm just at a loss at what step to take next. I don't even know if this post will get read at all...but I would be forever grateful for any advice.  TL;DR. Homeowners Insurance agency told me I was covered, took my money, and then canceled my policy. Help.
