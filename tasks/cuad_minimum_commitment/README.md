 ## Task Description
 
 This is a binary classification task in which the model must determine if a contractual clause falls under the category of "Minimum Commitment".
 
 ## Task Construction
 
 This task was constructed from the [CUAD dataset](https://www.atticusprojectai.org/cuad), which annotated clauses in 500 contracts according to 41 types. Positive samples for this task correspond to clauses for which annotators answered the following question in the affirmative:
 
 ```text
 Does the clause specify a minimum order size or minimum amount or units pertime period that one party must buy from the counterparty?
 ```
 
 Negative samples are randomly selected from other clauses.
 
 ## Column names
 
 - `label`: whether the clause is an instance of the type ("Yes") or not ("No")
 - `text`: text of contractual clause
