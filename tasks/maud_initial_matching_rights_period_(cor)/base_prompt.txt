Merger Agreement: Section 5.11    No Solicitation by First Choice; Superior Proposals. <omitted> ( e )    Notwithstanding Section 5.11(d) or any other provision of this Agreement, prior to obtaining the Requisite First Choice Shareholder Approval, the First Choice Board (or any committee thereof) may make a First Choice Subsequent Determination after the fifth (5 ) Business Day following Enterprise’s receipt of a notice (the “Notice of Determination”) from First Choice informing Enterprise that the First Choice Board (or such committee) has determined in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, that an Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a First Choice Subsequent Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal would breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law (it being understood that the initial determination under this clause will not be considered a First Choice Subsequent Determination), but only if: (i) the Notice of Determination includes or is accompanied by the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and the identity of the Person making such Superior Proposal, including copies of any proposed material agreements providing for such Superior Proposal; (ii) during the five (5) Business Day period after receipt of the Notice of Determination (the “Notice Period”), First Choice and the First Choice Board shall have negotiated in good faith with Enterprise, to the extent Enterprise desires to negotiate, to make such adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable First Choice to proceed with the First Choice Recommendation without a First Choice Subsequent Determination; provided, however, that Enterprise shall not have any obligation to propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and (iii) at the end of the Notice Period, after taking into account any such adjusted, modified or amended terms, if any, as may have been proposed by Enterprise in writing before expiration of the Notice Period, the First Choice Board has again in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisor, made the determination that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal and the failure to make a First Choice Subsequent Determination with respect to such Superior Proposal would breach or reasonably be expected to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law. In the event of any material revisions to an Acquisition Proposal that is the subject of a Notice of Determination and that occur prior to a First Choice Subsequent Determination, First Choice shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Determination to Enterprise and again comply with the requirements of this Section 5.11(e), except that the Notice Period shall be reduced to three (3) Business Days.
