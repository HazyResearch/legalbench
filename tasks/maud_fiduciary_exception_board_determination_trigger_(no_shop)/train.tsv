0	B	7.2 Acquisition Proposals; Change of Recommendation <omitted> (b) Exceptions to No Solicitation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 7.2, but subject to the provisions of Section 7.2(c), after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier of the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article IX, the Company, its Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives may, in response to an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that is made after the execution and delivery of this Agreement (but only if the Company did not violate (other than in immaterial respects) any provision of this Section 7.2 with respect to the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal): (i) provide non-public and other information and data concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries and access to the Company and its Subsidiaries’ properties and books and records in response to a request from the Person or Group (or their Representatives) who made such an Acquisition Proposal; provided that, to the extent applicable, correct and complete copies of such information or data or access has previously been made available to Parent, or is made available to Parent prior to or substantially concurrently with the time such information and/or access is made available to such Person or Group, and prior to providing any such information or data or access, the Company and the Person or Group making such Acquisition Proposal shall have entered into a legally binding confidentiality agreement with terms not materially less restrictive in the aggregate to such Person or Group than the terms in the Confidentiality Agreement are on Counterparty (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) (it being understood that such confidentiality agreement need not contain a standstill provision or otherwise prohibit the making or amending of an Acquisition Proposal if such Acquisition Proposal is made directly to the Company and not publicly disclosed, but shall not include any restrictions that would reasonably be expected to restrain the Company from satisfying its obligations contemplated by Section 7.2(c)) (any confidentiality agreement satisfying such criteria, a “Permitted Confidentiality Agreement”); and (ii) engage or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any such Person or Group and their Representatives regarding such Acquisition Proposal (it being understood that, notwithstanding the remainder of this clause (ii), the Company and its Representatives may at any time contact in writing any such Person or Group to the extent necessary to clarify the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, so long as a copy of such written communication is promptly provided to Parent), if, prior to taking any action described in clause (i) or this clause (ii) of this Section 7.2(b), the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that based on the information then available, including the terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal and those of this Agreement, and after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that (A) such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal and (B) the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the directors’ fiduciary duties under applicable Law.
