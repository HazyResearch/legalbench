Text: the texas code does not define election laws, and we have found no case construing this phrase. thus, we first look to the ordinary, contemporary, common meaning of election laws. see perrin v. united states, 444 u.s. 37, 42, 100 s.ct. 311, 314, 62 l.ed.2d 199 (1979) (noting that it is a fundamental canon of statutory construction ... that, unless otherwise defined, words will be interpreted as taking their ordinary, contemporary, common meaning). we think that the common meaning of election laws is laws that specifically govern elections, rather than generally applicable laws that may affect elections. if the texas legislature wanted 31.003 to cover the latter, we doubt that it would have inserted the adjectival modifier election directly before the noun law. by forming an open compound phrase such as election law, the texas legislature meant a combination of separate words that are so closely related as to constitute a single concept. chicago manual of style 6.33 (14th rev. ed. 1993). an election district, for instance, is not a district devised for many functions, including elections; it is a district created for the purposes of elections. 5 oxford english dictionary 116 (2d ed. 1989). moreover, an election board is not an agency that carries out all the responsibilities of a municipality, including elections; it is an agency charged with the conduct of elections. blacks law dictionary 519 (6th ed.1990).
