Post: I moved into an apartment, taking over the lease of someone else. They had the power bill under their name, and when I asked about it I was told to not handle it now and we'd sit down and transfer later.  Perhaps this makes me sound bad, but I'm not about to hound a man after three attempts at trying to take over a power bill. I don't have any records of it, but I asked him repeatedly to help me by at least giving me the name of the power company and the account number. I was never given either of those, although I later found out all I needed was a name and address, which worries me since that seems ripe for abuse when I can take over that easily, but I suppose there aren't too many people paying other's bills.  That was over a year ago. My power has never been turned off. He called me, very irked and demanded I take over the outstanding balance. I called the power company and immediately put it in my name, until today I had no idea who was my actual energy provider. The company said there was in fact an outstanding balance, but they would not, indeed they said they could not transfer the balance to me. I'm not looking for moral advice, I want to help him out with part of it, but I don't want to offer without making sure there's no real way I could be liable, especially as I'm moving out of state, because he chose literally two days before I move to do this.  TL;DR: moved in, old tenant kept the power bill in his name (not provided by landlord) for over a year even after I asked repeatedly for info to switch it over, eventually I gave up/forgot and now he finally gives info along w/ demand for outstanding balance paid. I feel I don't owe him all of it, worried he could complicate my move by doing this

Post: Someone has been filing lots of code violations against our neighbors. I got hit last week with a totally bogus report saying my house was neglected and that my wife refused to clean it up. The code enforcement showed me the report but it was filed anonymously. Am I able to petition the government for information on the person filing the complaints? It appears that you have to create a sign in and give personal information before you can file a complaint. I'd like to have this stopped before this gets out of hand or our neighborhood has a major issue.

Post: She just told me an hour ago (it is almost 3am) that she will be coming around 9am to my apartment to pick up the rest of her things and demands that I do not be at the apartment while she's there. She mentions that she is bringing someone to help her move. I don't know who this person is.   She is no longer on the lease, yet she is demanding I leave my own apartment or she's going to call the police. Is this right? I don't feel that I should have to leave my apartment because she doesn't want me there so her and some stranger and pick up the rest of her things. I don't feel comfortable as I don't know if she's planning on taking more than she's supposed to. What do I do? I challenged it and she threatened a police escort and I really don't want cops at my house.

Post: So this is a throw away account since I'll be giving away a bit about my location here. I've trying to find a solid awnser to this for the last 2 months and have been getting nowhere.   I'm asking on behalf of a friend (for simplicity let's call him Horsie since its what my niece calls him) and this situation is a bit messed up. Horsie is pretty much family in every sense but legal, he's my nieces godfather and absolutely adores her, he takes her camping every few months, took her with him to Oshkosh the first year after he got his pilots license, bought her a rifle for Christmas with my sisters consent and once a week would take her out to his mother's property to teach her proper gun safety and how to shoot. Since my sister is on disability he's surprised her occasionally by paying part of her bills without being asked. He's never once asked for anything in return except spending time with her his dad adores her and his mother loved her. For very convoluted (and extremely messed up reasons involving the fact that my sisters dad is a delusional, an idiot, and a dick) my sister is currently homeless as her choices were live in a house that was held together more by mold than nails or spending a few days with a another friend before moving in with Horsie once he got moved to his mother's place, he intends to give her the in-law house on the property.   Horsie's mother passed away about 6 months ago do to a stroke. In addition to a massive emotional hole she left a will that arranged for her life insurance (about $70,000) to go to his step father but she willed all her physical property to her son (Horsie). The problem is that Horsie's mom and stepdad have been living in this house for the last 15 years. He was asked politely to move out about 4 months ago and said he would, about 2 months ago Horsie asked him when he'd be moving out and stepdad said he couldn't afford it. Frustrated Horsie offered to pay his moving expenses, stepdad said he would look for a place. Still not hearing anything Horsie checked in last month and was informed that he couldn't find a place he liked and had decided not to move. He's run out of patience and is trying to find a way to get him to leave. As the lease for his apartment is up at the end of the month.  So for important info: this is in Columbus, Ohio, the property was in her name only however Horsie's stepdad is trying to claim right of surviorship. Does he have any way to get his step dad out of the house without burning through money? The step dad was a problem long before his mom passed to such a degree that to avoid fights he only visited his mom when he wasn't home and in the three days she spent in comma after her stroke his step dad never visited.

Post: Hi reddit,  Got an issue here with a (currently suspended) employee in my place of work, we have not yet hired a legal rep IRL as I would like to get some advice first before we decide to make the investment.  Issue is below:  Employee declared that they had resigned from their previous place of work when we interviewed them. Been employed for a year (passed probation) and due to a tip off (came from outside the business we believe, somebody from their previous place of work), we have now discovered that they were actually dismissed for fraud from the last employer (when they told us they resigned).   Reference check was done before being offered the position (as per usual), but reason for leaving was not disclosed by the references (we always try and get the reason for leaving if possible). We have no signed documents from the employee confirming their reason for leaving; only written information is interview notes when we interviewed them, but obviously they would not have signed this (and new employees do not normally see their interview notes).  As stated, employee has passed probation so we cannot simply dismiss that easily. Currently suspended employee and waiting for a meeting date, but unsure if we have a case hereâ€¦ he's suspended with pay so I doubt he's worried, probably just got his feet up at home.  Management does not want this employee working for us any longer given what he was dismissed for in the last company and intentionally did not declare it in this one (and as we are an insurance-based company, something like fraud is obviously going to raise warning flags. As stated he is currently suspended (with pay) and is waiting for a meeting date with his manager and HR. He has no previous warnings or anything as such on his record, he mostly keeps to himself and doesn't socialise that much (which can go either way to be honest, if he is up to something with our company then it would make sense to keep to yourself).  Thanks to all that read / give advice!  - Catherine (Assistant HR manager)

Post: I'm a 14 year old girl in Mississippi. My parents have been divorced all my life and family for a long time have had a good friendly relationship. The custody agreement was that I would stay with my mom on weekdays, and I would stay at my dads on weekends, but it has always been very, very loose. The past year or so my mother has become more and more touchy, and she yells at me quite often. She gets mad over the tiniest things and starts yelling, and then I start crying, and then she'll yell at me for crying, and then I cry harder, and then it kinda keeps going from there. Usually after that I go hide in my room and cry for at least another hour thinking about how much I hate her and stuff like that. My father is literally the perfect parent. He actually has a job(Mom doesn't), gets stuff done(Mom doesn't), is actually responsible, gets me to school on time, volunteers for all of my band stuff, etc.  and most importantly he never ever yells. Not once in my life have I been yelled at. I practically idolize him and I respect him, whereas I lost respect for my mother a long time ago. About a year ago, I was practically suicidal because of her yelling at me. For the past year, but especially this last week, I've been thinking about going over to dad's and simply telling him that I'm not going back. Today for the first time I actually said something when my dad told me to pack up, and he really does want to help in any way he can. What would happen if I refused to go over to my moms? With the fact that she has yelled at me this much, is a pretty bad parent in general, and that I'm an older kid who has a clear opinion, would there be any chance of changing custody to primarily if not completely my father? Are there any other paths we could take? Can someone help me please?
