Hello all,  Basically embroiled in a dispute with landlord asking for more rent. We have documented proof of all payments made which are in exact accordance with the lease.   The amount they are claiming is 2.8k unpaid rent and they still have our deposit of 1.7k.  All attorneys that pop up are for landlords (not tenants), how would I go about finding an attorney to represent myself (the tenant) ?	Yes
My roommate and I moved out of a townhouse this march at the end of our lease. We received an invoice from our previous landlord indicating we would be getting a large portion if our security deposit back and we were then sent a Chase quick pay transaction for the amount via email. Upon clicking the link and choosing the bank the website showed no transaction was available, therefore we could not access the funds. We contacted the both Chase and the bank about the issue which they were unable to resolve. We have emailed the previous landlord about the issue multiple times with no response and called multiple times, leaving voicemails, with no answer. I've thought about sending a demand letter to the landlords, however the issue isn't a lack of returned deposit so much as it was returned in a form we cannot access the funds with. Should we send a demand letter? And if so and it  goes unanswered, should we lawyer up?	Yes
I have been living in my apartment for nearly 2 years now. Shortly after I moved in there was a leak in my ceiling that damaged my mattress beyond repair. My landlord grudgingly paid for me to replace it though angrily told me I could replace it for 50$. He is an angry cheapskate but told me it was fixed and we had no issues.  Fast forward to yesterday when the Same pipe burst. Soaking my mattress monitors and keyboard. I am looking at 500-600$ to replace them. Luckily for all products I have either receipts or amazon history for each purchase.   My landlord has been apologetic so far but is already talking about just giving me one of his used monitors when I fully intend for equal replacements.   As far as I know my landlord is responsible for the damages correct? I am comtemplating finding asking a lawyer or if it would even be worth going to court should this turn ugly.  I have taken pictures of all the damages and the burst pipe. Thoughts/advice?	Yes
As the title states, I am currently moving into a new apartment in San Jose, California and have a pet snake that I would like to bring. Due to the bad stigma surrounding snakes, I did not mention anything about it during my tour/agreement. The snake is a Jungle Carpet Python, Non Venomous and stays under 6ft in size. I was hoping someone here could help me understand California Laws regarding Snakes in terms of housing it at apartments, whether or not it is acceptable and do I need to identify the presence of a pet snake to the owner. The apartment is Pet Friendly, but they only list Cats and Dogs.  With all that being said, I have a backup location where my pet snake can live/ I can still care for in case this situation isn't acceptable.	Yes
Hey Legal Advice! First time poster... This advice isn't for me but for my Sister in Law.   She and her friend rented an apartment. Leased it for a year. Both of their names are on the lease.  Her friend ended up losing her job and could not afford her end of the rent. So my very wise SIL decided she wouldn't pay her half and they just agreed to live it out until they got evicted.   Now they have finally been evicted and both have moved home.   My question is what kind of legal issues will my SIL run into? She seems to think that once she is evicted that's the end of that and life moves on. Front what i've heard from a Co-worker is that the Landlord can sue for the rent owed and potentially get wages garnished.   In all honesty this is for mostly my curiosity, however if there is any actual good advice I will pass it on. I just like to sit back and watch the show  This is in Alberta, Canada.	Yes
Our landlord was a super friendly guy, until we told him we were buying a house and not continuing to rent his condo. He doesn't live in our state, had his brother show us the condo prior to our moving in. We asked about damages and the brother said that the damages were previously addressed but couldn't be resolved without pulling up carpet. We wanted the condo so decided it wasn't a big deal. We have rugs. Bought a house. Moved in. As of last week landlord, who happens to be in town, is saying these carpet issues were due to us. Also saying that we smoked in the unit. That is blatantly clear and the unit smells like smoke. Neither of us are smokers. Claims I told him my SO was a smoker and I was trying to get him to quit. That conversation never happened...becuase neither of us smoke! Wants to keep over half of the deposit due to smoking in unit and carpet damage. He also never gave 24 hr notice of when he would enter condo. Also doesn't have designed person in our state to deal with legality, said brother was just helping out by showing....	Yes
I moved to Houston in May for an internship. I moved into a place I found on Craigslist. I didn't realize how crazy the landlord was though; he was awful.  At one point he asked me to move my car that was legally parked on the street. I did, but he said he didn't like my attitude, and he didn't want me there come June. (We were in a month-to-month basis, which was outlined in PDF contract he emailed me and I agreed to.)  I didn't mind moving because I couldn't stand this guy, but he didn't pay back my deposit money. He said he'd pay back at the beginning of the next month. I went back in July and again today, and he has refused to pay me each time.  Tomorrow I'll be looking into small claims court, but is there anything else I can do?  By the way, I don't need the money. I just really don't like the guy and I get the feeling that he tried to take advantage of everyone he rents to.  Another note: he has all his tenants pay in cash so that he can avoid taxes.	Yes
"Typical preface of, if this isn't in the right subreddit please let me know:  We have asked the Leasing Manager at our apartment if we could talk about some sort of compensation/etc. on our rent this month to offset the increased cost of our electric bill this month.(Dehumidifier/Fans/AC) We're told ""we're glad you have renters insurance, they will gladly replace what was damaged"". In response we said ""renters insurance isn't going to reimburse our increased energy bill, time off work, and general inconvenience of being forced to live in a room for a week."" To that the director said, ""A water heater breaking is not our responsibility. We (the complex) didn't cause it to break, but if you (my husband and I) would like to e-mail a formal request for this I will gladly forward it to the corporate offices."" To add insult to injury, our ceiling collapsing came the day after my husband's car had been broken into for the THIRD time while living here and the same manager saying ""it's not our responsibility"" when I asked for increased security on property to prevent this from happening again.  Now, long story short, we understand if that representative doesn't have the authority to authorize anything like that, but we would still like to plead our case to them the best we can. We would like some advice on how best to word this e-mail to effectively communicate our frustration and show them how awful this entire situation has been, and their lack of empathy hasn't helped at all. *bonus* if possible, advice on how to terminate our lease(without penalty) 2 months early would also be appreciated as we no longer feel safe living in this complex, and the entire thing has left a sour taste in our mouths.  Thank you in advanced."	Yes
