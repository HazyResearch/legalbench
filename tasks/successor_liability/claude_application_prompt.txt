When one company sells its assets to another company, the purchaser is generally not liable for the sellerâ€™s debts and liabilities. There are four exceptions: 

1. the purchaser expressly agrees to be held liable (express agreement)

2. the assets are fraudulently conveyed to the purchaser in order to avoid liability (fraudulent conveyance)

3. there is a de facto merger between the purchaser and seller (de facto merger)

4. the purchaser is a mere continuation of the seller (mere continuation)

For the following fact patterns, determine which exceptions apply.
