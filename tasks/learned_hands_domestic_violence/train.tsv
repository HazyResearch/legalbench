Mom and i recently found out my father (divored) has been molesting my sisters but they hid it for years because they didnt want to lose their dad. We tried to report him but they sent cops and cps to our mom trying to charge her for it  because there's no proof against him. Also, my sisters said they found child porn on his phone but they didnt mention it to cops because they were telling them theyll go to a foster home.  How can we report him for that instead? My sisters dont see him no more	Yes
So, my girlfriend's ex was abusive and manipulative both emotionally and monetarily.  He is now sending her unsolicited text messages and generally harassing her.  She also needs to pick up some things from his apartment.  What is the best course of action for her?	Yes
Hello all. I've been putting off posting this for some time as I fear the social backlash it will likely cause against me, deservedly so.  I have been charged with a DUI and wonton endangerment. This is my first offense with no prior of any wrong doing of any kind on my record, aside from a couple speeding tickets years before. I will share this short story that I believe contributes to my case, but I suspect it will not be relevant to those who make the ultimate decisions:  I was in a physically abusive relationship and couldn't hold a stable job; unable to find work in my field I was a miscellaneous contractor for a couple different positions that I was thoroughly unsatisfied with. I honestly thought I was only a drag to my partner, not worth anything, and unable to contribute to the household; because I couldn't.  Rewind to end of last year: two days prior to my offense, my partner finally hit me hard enough for me to call the police. He went to jail that night which was not my intention at all. I was expecting the police to show up, see me, give him a stern talking to, and leave. Instead, they saw my face and took him to jail.  So, now, I sat in an empty apartment realizing the severe trouble I just caused. I couldn't possibly have made his life any worse at this point. Two days go by I am alone still having heard no word from him at all. Unware of if he was still in jail or what was happening. I didn't want him to be in jail. It was never my intention to make his life worse than I already had.  He finally texts me the night of the incident and that's when I made the poor decision to go pick him up. The worst mistake of my life.  I thank whatever supernatural power you may believe in that I did not kill anybody. I struck three vehicles, none of which caused any serious injury and my insurance company has taken care of them well. I was petrified I may have hurt people trying to rescue the situation I caused with my partner by attempting to pick him up.  I did not press charges against my partner for abuse because I still believe I pushed him to the point of physical violence with my stupidity and inability to contribute to the household.  Since then, on the brighter side of the fence, I am on home incarceration and finally have a very stable job at a very respectable company in the field I love. This job started at the beginning of the year; I got it within a week of having a work release in HIP and in the short time I've been here I have already been promoted.  My lawyer and I talk very little but I'm hearing this is pretty common. I just received a release to visit his office and speak with him. The little I have gathered (and this was only a couple weeks ago) is that the prosecutor wants 7 years of hard prison time.  With as little as I have talked with him, he doesn't sound very confident in the ability to change that. From what I have gathered at my hearings, that is an offer made by the prosecutor but my lawyer has not yet approached me with it.  Is there anything I should be bringing to his attention of the situation? Is there anything I should be pushing for?  Ultimately, I just want to prove that I am still a capable human being and would love to resume being a good, tax paying citizen. I've worked my butt off the past 3 months in an effort to show the world the one mistake I made under duress was a one-time thing, but I suspect it will all be for naught very soon.	Yes
"Basically, my friend is willing to come up with the 4k to break the lease, however, the apartment management requires a signature from both people and her ex is refusing to sign until she ""meets with him alone"".  Which is obviously dangerous.   The apartment complex is looking into if they can do anything on their end, but until then, what are her legal rights?"	Yes
I was involved in a self defense shooting recently. It was a domestic issue. I do not have a lawyer. They took my pistol &amp; the investigation is still open.   The detective arrived on scene shortly after &amp; preceded to ask me questions. I decided to tell my side of the story without a lawyer present. I do not have one.  I took a recorded statement at the precinct &amp; was released. No charges were filed. The aggressor was rushed to intensive care. He did not die.   My questions are: Was it bad for me to speak without a lawyer present, despite the fact that I was released. Do I need to get one? And who do I contact in regards to remaining anonymous with the press?	Yes
So let me preface by saying that I am in no way defending my actions, or the way I behaved. It was completely unacceptable, and I feel horrible and stupid for it.  Saturday night my girlfriend, lets call her Vee, and I went out for a couple of drinks. At the end of the evening we both had gotten a little tipsy, and started having an argument on her porch, which then escalated into the kitchen, with the door still open.  In my drunken idiocy I knocked over a pile of glasses onto the floor.  At this point we both notice a cop car with lights on coming down the street. They say they had a report of a domestic dispute, put me in cuffs, put me in the car. All the while she is saying she does not want me arrested, to release me, and that she is refusing to press charges.  Of course they don't let me go, I spend the night in central bookings. When I go before the judge, he tells me that I have an order of protection against Vee. I am in no way allowed to contact her, to speak to her, to be within 100 feet of her, if I do, and should I be caught, I will be arrested and charged with contempt of court.   The judge let me go on my own recognizance, no bail, and I am scheduled to appear back in court in September with a lawyer of my own - furthermore, I don't even know what I am being charged with?  My question is Vee and I have no absolutely no desire for this order of protection. We get along, love each other, and are planning a future together. This was just a stupid spat that got escalated way further than anyone ever would have thought. We practically live together, and spend all of our free time together.  At this point, how exactly should we proceed? I am at a complete loss of what to do. How do I even find out what I am being charged with, and when I contact a lawyer what should I tell them, will they be able to find out what my charges are?	Yes
currently in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, I'm working on getting out (all without his knowledge) I'm just trying to tie up loose ends. A few months ago I fell asleep in one of the recliners in our living room and when I woke up he had his phone out and showed me ALOT of pictures he took of me with his penis out and on my face in various different places. near and almost in my mouth from what I can remember. he only showed them to me that one time then refused to delete them when I begged him to. be he wouldn't even show them to me again when I asked. he laughed and thought it was funny and never showed them to me again. I feel so violated. what can I do? press charges? ensure somehow they get deleted??	Yes
My ex has filed a domestic violence protection act against me, asserting that I had yelled at her, but nothing further than that in the instant.  While I did yell at her for one sentence in the midst of her yelling at me, this seems rather arbitrary and there was no assertion of violence (and never has there been in the past).  I have only contacted her since to apologize for yelling and to arrange a time for her to come and get her things.  More importantly she also asserted in this that previously I had made her leave the residence which we were staying (for which I was the only one on the lease and the only one paying rent) and she had no where to go during this time.  I can document that this is not true, that I only asked her to leave for one night and that she had her own separate residence to stay in.  Also that I had assaulted her by touching her sexually while she was sleeping and could not give consent (while we were dating and having consensual sex), which is also false but of course there is no way for me to prove this.  Are there any repercussions of this?	Yes
