Dear Reddit,  I really need your help!  A little less than two years ago, I was arrested for Domestic Battery. No charge was filed against me. Worried that the arrest record could come back and haunt me one day, I'm now looking for a lawyer to help me with a factual of innocence motion.  Through my research, which has been mostly on lawyer's websites, I find that it can be a long process with little chance of winning. However, I do want to clean the mess.  I've been asking a few lawyers in LA and none has been very helpful. And their prices are ridiculously high for a student like me. I'm planning to drop out of college and would invest my last bit of money in it and want to make sure that I've invested in a right place. So I'd like to ask you guys a few questions.  How much do you think I should be paying for a lawyer to help me with the case?  How can I make sure that they are really doing their job?  And what are the real chances that I can have this motion granted?  Tbh, I've been really scared of this day. I've been trying to avoid even talking about it but the 2-year limit is ending. I really do need you guys' advices.  Sincerely,	Yes
An ex boyfriend with a violent past of explosive anger and revenge vandalism recently vandalized a property of mine and now has filed a lawsuit against me claiming he is entitled to half of one of my properties simply because we were dating (never lived together) and he facilitated the deal through a friend who was already compensated for his services.  I need to fight this case against me and also get a restraining order - should I be hiring a criminal defense or business litigation lawyer for this case?  Thanks 	Yes
My stbxMIL is suing me, she already sued me for something else and won (mostly because it was considered a martial contract that was violated) but has since agreed to drop it in exchange for me relinquishing my half of ownership on the cars. This suit is for a bunch of stuff, most of it is money she gave to him for various things before we got married and the money never went through my hands. There was one thing that we were married for but there was no agreement attached to it like her first suit and a couple of other things that I probably won't be able to get out of. She is also pursuing almost $1,000 for emotional trauma. Earlier this year she kicked me out, pushed me to my limits and ended up calling the police and filing a protective order. I want to countersue for emotional damages but I'm not sure for how much and all of that. It is small claims. Any advice is much appreciated	Yes

He plead no contest.  I haven't seen him outside of court for 18 months.  He made a lot of false claims on the application. 	Yes
 This is a throwaway account to protect our identities as much as possible but this does take place in the state of California. So a few months ago, my twin sister was raped after our high school graduation party. She's not in a good state of mind right now and is extremely angry at me because I was actually their target. I don't blame her in the slightest because the group of boys said my name a few times during the ordeal.  My grandparents and parents are both extremely traditional people. They hold strong to their traditional Asian values of practically blind worship to the senior generation. My grandparents were extremely against the idea of abortion while my parents were on the fence but leaning towards my grandparents because of that respect towards the elder generation. Eventually, my grandfather found out that I was coordinating with my sister's best friend on how to get my sister to an abortion clinic. That night my grandfather kidnapped my sister and they were missing for almost a month before the police found them. My grandfather was trying to fly her to China.  During that month, we discovered the identities of the rapists and we also have the semen samples from the rape kit as further evidence. I got in a rather heated exchange with several of the perpetrators but now I'm being threatened with both my and my sister's integrity. They realize that we can easily ruin their lives forever and send them to jail which is why they are threatening to release a video of the entire rape to the student body of the university that we will be attending after the summer. The group of boys dragged me into a room and molested me while forcing me to watch the video. I was forced to give one of them oral sex in order to keep them quiet about the video. I tried to keep a semen sample but they took it away. They didn't penetrate me and my hymen is still intact so I don't have any evidence to prove this happened the way that it did. They did video me doing everything and I was forced to say it was consensual. I'm sad I had to do this but I want to help my sister however much I can even if it's just to shut this group of boys up so that event isn't revealed.  The entire incident has been kept very quiet because my parents insist that our momentary desire for vengeance is much less important than the stigma such an incident will cause if it becomes public. My sister hasn't said a single word and I'm very worried about her. She isn't mentally stable right now and while so far not suicidal, I am very worried. My grandfather has since returned but now after realizing that there is a high possibility of the father being black, he is insisting that she abort the baby. We just got back from the abortion clinic a few hours ago but they are refusing to help because my sister won't reply to anything that they say and that she isn't mentally sound.  I don't know what to do and don't know who to talk to. My family wants to keep everything quiet. My sister has not said a single thing. She did yell at me for a few minutes but quickly stopped talking. It's been over a month since I last heard her voice. I don't know what to do! I should be an adult right? I'm already 18 but I don't feel like an adult. This whole thing feels like a guillotine hanging over our necks.  How can I report those boys to the police without everything becoming public? They already said that if we take them down then they will take us down with them. One of them said he will help me if I have sex with him but I don't want to.  What should I do about my family? Right now they are against everything that I think should be done and my sister has not replied to anything that we ask.  I'm so angry! My grandfather kidnapped my sister causing everything to be delayed so long and now he has completely changed his point of view. First he was trying everything to prevent the abortion and now he is trying everything to force her into it. He even threatened me while holding a coat hanger because I pushed him away when he was trying to enter my sister's room. I also can't stop crying every time I hear my mom and dad regret having daughters.  The reason I'm posting here is because I was hoping a lawyer could give me advice on what to do. I feel really alone right now. The group of rapists is threatening me from the front while my family isn't doing anything to help from the back. My sister is completely silent and I'm worried about her committing suicide even though she hasn't shown any intent to.  Am I even in the right place? Can a lawyer even help me? I want to sue my family and get protective custody of my sister but can I even do this? My sister hasn't said a single word and has no response to anything that anyone asks. All she does is sit there. The only person who knows other than the related parties is my sister's best friend. Not even my best friend knows.  Please help me. I don't care if my video goes public. I only want to prevent my sister's video from becoming public. The problem is that we are identical twins so either video becoming public would be bad for my sister. I tried fighting back against the group of boys but they responded by posting a short clip of my sister's video to this website and everybody on that website is showing crazy enthusiasm for it. I tried to use that to my advantage but nobody on that website has an account only a bunch of numbers where their name should be. I've bookmarked the link to that website but I don't even want to look at it anymore because I cry every time I read the replies.  I don't even know if I can ask a lawyer to help me. My family obviously won't pay for it and I only have a few thousand dollars.I read online that there are lawyers who might do this for free but how do I find them?	Yes
Hi all. I really need your help. My sister was put on a 72 hour hold at a psychiatric hospital after she went in there to talk to a doctor about her depression and thoughts of suicide. 72 hours have passed and she wants to go home now but the doctor has put her on another hold. What can I do to get her out of there? This hospital is really horrible and provides no help at all. She is not taking any medications, which tells me that her depression is not that severe. They just want to exploit the patients and insurance companies. I have been trying to contact her doctor but no success so far. Please help!	Yes
I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday.   So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably.   She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony.   Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers.   That sparked a heated argument.   Long story short;   *Sshe got in the car with her kids  * I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers   * She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety  * I stand in front of the car as I call the police  * She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way  * I jumped on the hood  * She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably   * She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me  * Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures    .................  This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed.   Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?  What charges can I have against her?  I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.	Yes
So let me preface by saying that I am in no way defending my actions, or the way I behaved. It was completely unacceptable, and I feel horrible and stupid for it.  Saturday night my girlfriend, lets call her Vee, and I went out for a couple of drinks. At the end of the evening we both had gotten a little tipsy, and started having an argument on her porch, which then escalated into the kitchen, with the door still open.  In my drunken idiocy I knocked over a pile of glasses onto the floor.  At this point we both notice a cop car with lights on coming down the street. They say they had a report of a domestic dispute, put me in cuffs, put me in the car. All the while she is saying she does not want me arrested, to release me, and that she is refusing to press charges.  Of course they don't let me go, I spend the night in central bookings. When I go before the judge, he tells me that I have an order of protection against Vee. I am in no way allowed to contact her, to speak to her, to be within 100 feet of her, if I do, and should I be caught, I will be arrested and charged with contempt of court.   The judge let me go on my own recognizance, no bail, and I am scheduled to appear back in court in September with a lawyer of my own - furthermore, I don't even know what I am being charged with?  My question is Vee and I have no absolutely no desire for this order of protection. We get along, love each other, and are planning a future together. This was just a stupid spat that got escalated way further than anyone ever would have thought. We practically live together, and spend all of our free time together.  At this point, how exactly should we proceed? I am at a complete loss of what to do. How do I even find out what I am being charged with, and when I contact a lawyer what should I tell them, will they be able to find out what my charges are?	Yes
Hi Reddit,  Sorry if this is lengthily there is a lot of background info. I live with my boyfriend and he has a 5yr old from a previous relationship. Last September it was discovered that the bio-mom's boyfriend was beating up the son and the mom was aware of it and also admitted to being complacent in the abuse. The DA refused to press charges saying that these cases are hard to get a convection on. The son was taken away from his mother and my boyfriend had sole physical custody for a period of two months. Then CPS agreed that the mother should get visitation rights and set out other guidelines she needed to follow. Note my boyfriend still has full legal custody.  The mother was told she had to attend parenting classes, attend personal therapy. That the cps agent would be doing monthly home inspections. She still lives with her parents, and that cps would meet with her once a month to check in. They went to court in February and the mother had done nothing. CPS recommended giving my boyfriend sole physical custody and determined she was an unfit mother. The court overruled that and gave her an extension to start the program. My boyfriend was obviously upset and tried to appeal but CPS told him they would follow up and ensure she was doing the things and that there would be home visits.  Since the last court date there is a new CPS worker and she is terrible. The son disclosed to my boyfriend that his mom was still dating his abuser and my boyfriend reported that to cps since it was violating court orders. CPS worker said there was no way to confirm it. A couple weeks ago when I was babysitting the boy he told me how if he doesn't listen his mom will hit him and that his grandpa beats him with a wooden spoon if he doesn't listen. I told this to cps &amp; put her supervisor on the email and never got a response. Also almost fot the whole month of June the mother refused to pick up her son at the scheduled times: while we obviously didn't mind the extra time my boyfriend had his lawyer file a complaint so it would be on the record. In response to this the CPS worker told my boyfriend he needs to take co-parenting classes to learn how to negotiate with his ex better.   They go to court in two weeks for another check in and today his ex sent him part of an email exchange she had with the worker asking some questions but the earlier part of the exchange is the worker and his ex talking about her getting more custody and some tax stuff which is not even in CPS' jurisdiction.   My boyfriend and I are very upset about this, not just that his son could end up spending more time with an abusive parent but simple because the worker has been in communication with the mom while ignoring any communication we've had. So my question is is there someone else to bring this up with outside if cps? Or should we have the lawyer bring it up in court? Also neither of us has dealt with CPS before so is there a way to appeal A decision from them?  Thanks!	Yes
Charges are against my ex. Cops/EMS were called for someone else that my ex assaulted (but they never talked to that person or got a statement). I was caught in the crossfire and they were more interested in what happened to me even though it wasn't anything super serious. I don't want to testify for various reasons. I don't want to deal with it anymore or even think about it, (I have an anxiety disorder and PTSD so would like to avoid having to be around him) and I'm sort of afraid of what ex's girlfriend would do to me if he got locked up because she's made threats before. Ex already has two felony convictions for drugs and served time in prison because of it.  I'm not sure how the process works, but I have to be there tomorrow. Would I get any charges or anything for refusing to testify against him?	Yes
So my sisters husband that tried killing him self confessed in a phone call to his friend that the reason he tried killing himself is because he molested my nephew at age 5 (he's now 15) but my nephew does not remember and does not want to make a statement ... but also in this phone call he he confessed to it being 4 children all together and this was the unmonitored phone call they give u before u r admitted ... I'm wondering how the investigation process for that works and if someone could give me legal advice for direction on getting him prosecuted 	Yes
Greetings everyone.  I am having a hellish time trying to move on / away from my abusive ex fiance of 4 years. It's a complicated situation and it invovles a lot of manipulation, lies, defamation and abuse on her part that I would like to put a stop to, but need help doing so since my own efforts to disuade her have not worked out. I'm in colorado. If you know of any good lawyers that care about mens rights please help me find them because I am afraid being the male and her acting like a victim all the time when I never do anything but raise my voice and demand her to take responsibility for her actions!	Yes
Who is guilty? Two brothers, one 36, one 26, live in their father's home with their mother who is ill with cancer. The two are not amicable. Great deal of bad blood. 26 claims history of violence at hands of 36.  They take turns occupying shared spaces in the home. 36 goes to work to make private income. Family income provided by the father. 26 stays at home caring for ill mother. 36 returns to house in the middle of the day. This is not typical. 26 doesn't want 36 in the house. Feels it's his time to occupy spaces. 36 just want to prepare for business trip. 26 grabs a skillet, stands at the entrance, and blocks 36 from entering house. He warns 36 not to enter. 36 comes in anyway toward 26 punching. 26 weakly swings skillet no injuries. 36 knocks skillet away. 26 jumps on 36 and bites chest and arm. 26 clings to 36s back. Fight pauses, they talk about issues. 36 gets fed up and strangles 26 with hands until he passes out. 26 calls cops. Report filed. 26 leaves home later that night to live on streets. 36 remains at home.	Yes
Recently my sister's friend confronted her ex, and father of her child, and he made claims about wanting to kill my sister, strangling his other children, and made a bunch of other threatening comments. Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney.   Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?	Yes
Hello all. I've been putting off posting this for some time as I fear the social backlash it will likely cause against me, deservedly so.  I have been charged with a DUI and wonton endangerment. This is my first offense with no prior of any wrong doing of any kind on my record, aside from a couple speeding tickets years before. I will share this short story that I believe contributes to my case, but I suspect it will not be relevant to those who make the ultimate decisions:  I was in a physically abusive relationship and couldn't hold a stable job; unable to find work in my field I was a miscellaneous contractor for a couple different positions that I was thoroughly unsatisfied with. I honestly thought I was only a drag to my partner, not worth anything, and unable to contribute to the household; because I couldn't.  Rewind to end of last year: two days prior to my offense, my partner finally hit me hard enough for me to call the police. He went to jail that night which was not my intention at all. I was expecting the police to show up, see me, give him a stern talking to, and leave. Instead, they saw my face and took him to jail.  So, now, I sat in an empty apartment realizing the severe trouble I just caused. I couldn't possibly have made his life any worse at this point. Two days go by I am alone still having heard no word from him at all. Unware of if he was still in jail or what was happening. I didn't want him to be in jail. It was never my intention to make his life worse than I already had.  He finally texts me the night of the incident and that's when I made the poor decision to go pick him up. The worst mistake of my life.  I thank whatever supernatural power you may believe in that I did not kill anybody. I struck three vehicles, none of which caused any serious injury and my insurance company has taken care of them well. I was petrified I may have hurt people trying to rescue the situation I caused with my partner by attempting to pick him up.  I did not press charges against my partner for abuse because I still believe I pushed him to the point of physical violence with my stupidity and inability to contribute to the household.  Since then, on the brighter side of the fence, I am on home incarceration and finally have a very stable job at a very respectable company in the field I love. This job started at the beginning of the year; I got it within a week of having a work release in HIP and in the short time I've been here I have already been promoted.  My lawyer and I talk very little but I'm hearing this is pretty common. I just received a release to visit his office and speak with him. The little I have gathered (and this was only a couple weeks ago) is that the prosecutor wants 7 years of hard prison time.  With as little as I have talked with him, he doesn't sound very confident in the ability to change that. From what I have gathered at my hearings, that is an offer made by the prosecutor but my lawyer has not yet approached me with it.  Is there anything I should be bringing to his attention of the situation? Is there anything I should be pushing for?  Ultimately, I just want to prove that I am still a capable human being and would love to resume being a good, tax paying citizen. I've worked my butt off the past 3 months in an effort to show the world the one mistake I made under duress was a one-time thing, but I suspect it will all be for naught very soon.	Yes
"Hi everyone, thank you in advance for any help you can provide.  My ex and I divorced ten years ago, we have a 14 year old daughter and joint custody, though she spends the school year in SoCal with me, and the summer in Maine with her father. Our divorce was not amicable, but I do everything in my power to keep it from affecting our daughter, and have not told her about my reasons for wanting a divorce, out of an interest of not poisoning her relationship with her father.  She arrived home this morning, and she looked pale, and was shaking and in tears. After asking her what was wrong, she handed me a letter from my ex's mother. Apparently, my daughter was ""acting like a slut"" and ""dressing inappropriately"" in front of her cousins, and her 19 year old cousin sexually assaulted her. The letter was telling *me* how I'm supposed to change how I'm raising my daughter, to prevent ""promiscuity"". She's always been a crazy bible-thumping weirdo, so I ignored it.  I took my daughter home, and immediately called my ex, asking him to send me the forms so that I can have copies of her medical records from being sent to the hospital sent to her doctor, and ask for the name and number of whichever police officer is handling her case. He informed me that he decided not to press charges, because ""[Our daughter] was being a slut and she needs to know she's not going to be rewarded with attention for that kind of behavior.""  I'm livid. It's been four weeks since the event happened, and they didn't permit her to call me that whole time. I wish I had given her the cell phone I had waiting at home before she left, but I'd intended it as a ""you're starting high school"" gift, and thought it best to wait.  I want to press charges, and see the aggressor punished to the fullest extent of the law. I would also like to see about amending our custody agreement so that she doesn't ever have to go see that fucked up side of her family again. I'm so angry right now I cannot think straight, and she's taking a nap. What do I need to do? Who do I need to call?"	Yes
Quebec, Canada. I am the victim along with my younger sister, my father is the abuser. I frankly have no idea where to start legally - I have a few questions I hope someone can help me with. Frankly, I am terrified, this has been kept hushed in my extended family for over 20 years.   The abuse lasted from when I was in diapers to the age of 18. I remember recurring specific instances of abuse clearly, without the memory of specific dates because I was so young. Abuse included numerous and repetitive molestation and forcing me to manually stimulate him.   At the age of 5 years old, my mother was suspicious of abuse but never witnessed anything herself. My mother filed for divorce. An Aunt on my father's side called her one day saying she had witnessed him molesting me while giving me a bath during a family visit at my grandparent's house. However, this aunt was not willing to testify. At the age of 5, I was considered too young to testify in court. Without a witness, all my mother had to go on legally was suspicions. Though she fought tooth and nail, the legal system was not on her side since she had no witnesses willing to testify and no evidence except the memories of a child. The legal system failed me and my mother horrendously. She had no job, no family support and no money, and the appointed lawyer could do little for us. She was advised to try for supervised visitation, and not to try to prosecute as the case would most likely fall through, and the courts might take pity on him if he was not convicted and grant equal custody. My father ended up with supervised visits one Saturday a week. Despite this, the abuse continued. Any time someone's back was turned for one second, he would molest me - this continued at least until the age of 8 where I became more self confident to protect myself and avoided his advances, but subtle abuse and psychological abuse still remained. He remained in contact with me until the age of 18, when I became an adult and felt I had the courage to cut off all contact with him and move away without fear of him tracking me down to hurt me.  Now, 20 years later, I feel I am ready to finally face the ghosts of my past. No-one in my family would talk to me about the abuse as a child or a teenager. Which, in a way, is a good thing as it solidifies the fact that all of the memories I have are from my own experience, not from people telling me that I was abused.   I plan on getting in contact with the Aunt who witnessed the abuse, although I highly doubt she will be willing to testify if she was unwilling to do so when I was a defenseless toddler. I have several recurring, specific memories, that correlate with memories of my younger sister, who suffered the same type of abuse as myself. My older half sister, who was a teenager at the time but lived in the same house, has memories of abuse including him trying to climb into her bed and molest her at night, and showing her hardcore pornography while she was a minor. However, she lives in Malaysia currently and I am not sure she would be willing to testify.  I know it is a very long shot, as the abuse was many years ago and the memories of a young child from that long ago do not hold up well in court. But I know that if I do not do this now, I will regret it for the rest of my life. I want to get in contact with child abuse help, but I have no idea who to contact, and I know nothing about the legal system or how the case would be handled since it was such a very long time ago.   I am considering buying a hidden audio recording device, and interviewing the aunt, as well as my father, for evidence. It is legal in canada to record a conversation between two people without one party's consent, as long as the recording party is aware of it. Is there anything else I can do for evidence or to prepare for this? I want to be as prepared as I possibly can before I present the case.   This monster has molested me and my sisters, probably more family members or neighbors children that I don't even know of, and is walking free hurting more children no doubt. He is unbelievably bold and manipulative, charming, and continued the abuse under the direct supervision of my mother and case workers without anyone knowing. This will be a long, hard fight. Any advice would be welcome.	Yes
"Hello! 21 year old girl here. I was assaulted by my ex-boyfriend at least 4 times in a single night. Went to the police and told them everything. In my ptsd therapy, I'm beginning to remember incidents that built up to the March event.  I've been trying to contact the police officer who documented everything, but sometimes it takes a while to hear back.   In the mean time, we wait for the legal proceedings. Its been months. I will testify to a grand jury, and one thing has been bugging me.   So much happened that night, but there were so much more that happened in the months that built to that. On the spot, I don't think i'll be able to remember all those details. Its been hard enough recalling them after my physical and mental state left the ""survival"" fight-or-flight response mode. Will I be allowed a paper full of notes into the court room? I left out a lot of details in the Restraining Order hearing, simply because i forgot a lot of stuff. The hearing was only a few weeks after the assaults.   I would do much better if I had notes with me, but is that even allowed? I've never been a victim in a criminal case before, much less a victim of domestic violence."	Yes
What actions can she take? I tried looking up resources, but it seems like it's either the family court or calling the police. She's terrified for her life. Her mother doesn't have enough money to leave the situation.	Yes
"GF and I broke up. I confronted her about her affairs and told her I would report her [unrelated] illegal activity. She got an order of protection. She went out of her way to tell me in an email that her police report included that I ""shattered a light switch.""  I have a family court hearing coming up. This is what I plan to include in the memo. (I know you'll tell me to talk to a lawyer but I can't afford one and none of the free legal centers answered their phones today. And the public defender doesn't see my case until the day of.)   &gt;The evening of July 2 I confronted X about her affair while we were in the bedroom. I moved out of the bedroom into the living room. As I was passing through the doorway, walking away from X, I open-palm slapped the wall, and then sat down on the couch. The bottom edge of my right hand hit the top left corner of the light switch and broke the top left corner of the light switch. This left a superficial scar on the bottom edge of my hand. The top edge of the light switch is about two inches below my elbow. I didn't raise my hands and I didn't throw a punch."	Yes
"A few days ago, my dad received a letter from some legal advice company (not an official court summons) that said that they could help with his case of domestic violence and a restraining order against him. We looked up the case number included in the letter, and it indeed did have his name on it, and that he's being sued for domestic violence by some woman that he claims he's never met. I do believe my father 100%, since he's never raised a hand against my mother or my siblings and I for as long as I can remember. (Though I am open to the possibility that he may be lying, but I really doubt that.)  We're not sure if this is a real fraudulent case against my father, or if this is a mistake that this legal advice company made. What we do know is that there's a court hearing a few weeks from now and that this was filed in the city that we live in. As of now, we don't have any official documents from the court letting him know that he's being sued. My hope is that this is all a huge misunderstanding.   Main thing that worries us is that my dad has just started the naturalization process to become a US citizen, and that this ""lawsuit"" could have a negative impact on that.   Regardless, we are going down to the courthouse later this week to make sure."	Yes
My wife got a new fulltime job recently but still is in the probation period. Shes been put on bed rest for few months for reasons. Her work isn't office work so she can't do it from home or anything. Can she get fired? Does she have legal protection against being fired?	Yes
I'm a student who has been working at a Sydney cafe for a few weeks now, and, as the title states, I've been getting underpaid (cash-in-hand), given no payslips, and not given penalty rates. The other workers I have talked to have also been getting the same treatment. Since, there is no payslip there is no evidence except for word of mouth. I don't wish to take them to court because I don't want to make life-long enemies. What will happen to them if I report them to fair work?	Yes
My wife caught my 14 year old nephew molesting my 4 year old daughter last night. They were camping, and the kids were in a tent together.   They were naked and he was on top of her. My daughter said that he has been touching her, and that this is not the first time.   They are on their way to the children's hospital now. My wife said my daughter's labia is red, and that she says it hurts and hurts when she pees.   I am out of the damn country, on business.   I am curious to know what will potentially happen to my nephew. I want him to have consequences, but would prefer he get therapy or something.   I can't find much on a google search, it just looks like he will be charged with sexual assault and face a possibility of 10 years in jail.	Yes
Okay so this situation is fuuuucked up. Like you wouldn't believe.  I was told I might be able to open a case.  [This is what I just wrote up about the situation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zj2qeIFjqzF1rDmku_AO9TjFifz_9i4A4Gx8tyKbQe8/edit?usp=sharing)  ^^basically ^^lots ^^of ^^abuse ^^and ^^children ^^are ^^getting ^^^psychologically ^^^^fucked ^^^^^up.   obviously i know nothing about writing a legal document. names have all been changed.   if anyone could check this out and help advise me, I have no idea what steps to take next. I've never made a legal case.  If it helps I'm in Washington County, Oregon.	Yes
I'm a victim in a domestic violence case. Ex boyfriend punched me in 2013, so an order of protection was placed. He contacted me a few months later via phone. He did 90 days for the assault and criminal contempt 2nd in 2014. 2015 he violated again for calling me and being at my house. He got 1-3 Yrs upstate for aggravated family offense and criminal contempt 1st. He got out on parole last year and is currently still on it. He violated by calling me again in April. This time they charged him with a misdemeanor and RORed him. How is that possible ? He's already had 3 court dates and RORed each one. No d.a contacted me until today, the day before his next court date and told me its because he wasn't in my house this time ? I have a full stay away it doesn't make sense and isk what to do. He's never going to stop :-( help ...btw I have the entire call log as well as texts from that day but I didn't mention the texts in the initial police report.	Yes
"Texas.  Spouse out earns me by double. Just found he has not paid the mortgage in 3 months. Trying to force a short sale (mortgage is not in my name , house has joint deed).   I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about ""taking someone out."" When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality. I am an educated professional and a bit disgusted with myself that I allowed this to happen.  Maybe some of that is not relevant, i'll admit I am not thinking clearly. Fundamentally, what can I do about the house???"	Yes
My boyfriend moved out about a month ago while I was staying with family. Some of the things he moved out were mine, things I paid for and never intended to gift him. Things like my mattress, Keurig, tv stand, sound bar, personal care and cleaning items, groceries, and art supplies. Pretty much anything he wanted that was mine, he took.  In May, he needed money to have his car fixed and I loaned him $5,000. I had him sign a basic contract stating this.  After he moved out and I realized he took my things, I contacted him about returning them. He's claiming he will pay me back for the items along with the loan. I admittedly called and texted him multiple times trying to get him to commit to returning my stuff.   This morning, I received an email that a hearing has been set for a protective order he filed against me. There isn't a protective order in place yet but it could happen. The only evidence he has against me is threatening to have him arrested for stealing my things and asking him to return my stuff. I definitely blew up his phone a couple times but I was trying to get my stuff and panicking about bills.  He always responded to my calls and texts and even texted and called me unprovoked a couple times over the last couple weeks. I want to fight the protective order but don't know how the hearing will go. My ex is currently on probation for a domestic battery against his last girlfriend but I don't know if that will matter.   We're also on a lease together but from what I've heard, I'm pretty much going to have to eat his half of the rent, utilities, etc.   What do I do? How do I go about preparing for the protective order hearing? I don't want to not be able to contact him because I want him to return my stuff. Should I take the $5,000 loan to small claims? He really screwed me over and I feel like he keeps finding ways of avoiding his obligations. Thanks in advance for any advice, I really appreciate it.	Yes
I have recently gone through a really bad breakup and me and my family are being harassed by my ex. She calls from a blocked number, she somehow sees what I post on instagram even though she is blocked and I'm sure she doesn't have a fake account to follow me because I am on private and know who each follower is. I would just change my number but it goes beyond calls.   I don't want to have to do it because her family is cool and her dad works in the prison system but I really don't have a choice. She has physically hit me on multiple occasions, the night we broke up she ripped my shirt off and threw a cup at my head, she once started yelling loudly that I was physically hurting her and to stop hurting her even though we were just arguing (I called my mom and told her what she was doing in case she called the cops and I was arrested), it's just a total nightmare. She is diagnosed bipolar and has been 5150'd. When she was 5150'd I let them know she had been physical otherwise they wouldn't have take her.   Do I need to put all my family on the request for protection? Can I fill out the domestic violence one if I don't have proof of the violence? Also this seems like it should be the last of my worries but I have no time I can use to take off work because I've used it all from all the stress that has caused. Will the court let me request a specific date so I can not miss work?  Any help is appreciated. I can go a week with no calls and then once they start I get so anxious and sick to my stomach. I'm already in treatment for depression and anxiety and her contacting me is the only thing that causes it to flair up.	Yes
(Portland, OR) My transgender partner and I got into an argument. The argument continued to escalate to the point where I made a really horrible comment invalidating her gender. In response to this, she lunged at me and started punching me, pulling me down to the ground and beating me with a broomstick. I managed to constrain her and make my way out of the apartment. I called 911 and they arrested her.  When the police arrived, I made the mistake of talking to police who recorded a statement (I was completely jostled and nearly out of it when he was asking me questions). My apartment management also convinced me to call the DA and give them the case number. I have not yet been contacted by a prosecutor.  I do not wish to follow through with prosecution. While in this one instance she initiated the attack, I believe there has been a mutual pattern of abuse in our relationship. There have been times when I have yelled at her or made physical contact (such as grabbing her and trying to force her out of the room or pushing her when she was in my face). Usually this happens after we have been arguing and it quickly devolves into shouting matches. We are both to blame for raising our voices, talking over one another and escalating these arguments. We both say horrible things to one another. It's just a mutually abusive relationship that I want both of us to be out of because we've tried it for so long and it does neither of us any good.   tldr; me and transgender girlfriend got in fight, she was arrested for domestic assault, I called DA with case number. What can I do to have them drop charges / not continue with case?	Yes
I am a resident of Virginia and am being harassed by my abusive ex who lives in Indiana. When our relationship ended four years ago, I was granted a no contact order and a temporary restraining order; I left the state shortly after and thought that was the end of it. He has recently begun harassing me again via phone calls and texts from various numbers. I have changed my number twice and he managed to get the new number both times. Is there any legal recourse from a different state?	Yes
hello. I live in Wisconsin and own my own home. My boyfriend has lived here for the last 4 years. Things have progressively become more abusive. Never physical but definelty verbal. Today I was in fear it would progress. I had to call the police which required him to leave for the night, but now I am lost. The officer mentioned a 5 or 30 eviction? but any research ive done online does now help. He does not pay me rent. He does pay the electric and cable bill, although only electric is in his name. Can someone please help me because these forms make me believe the 5 and 30 difference is based on rent? he has never paid me rent. Please help. I need to go to the courthouse first thing in the morning and I am so lost.	Yes
(Scranton, PA)I received an email in my university email account about a job offer. This job included getting this man clothes, his mail, sending payments on his behalf, and shopping. In turn he said he would pay me $400 a week, and be sending me checks to do this, as well as send money for me to pay his bills.   I just received a check yesterday, enough to pay me and pay for his other needs. however, the check isn't from the name he told me and the address and name on the label on the envelope has a different name and address then from what I was told it was. The name and address were matched with someone from PR but I was told my employer lived in Boston. Is this fake? Would I get in any legal trouble if I attempted to cash it?	Yes
Some context.  My father and mother split apart five years ago.  I occasionally keep in touch with my father.    My father got arrested last weekend for domestic abuse.  Now I don't know the whole situation but I don't condone domestic violence.  My father spent the weekend in jail, and bailed himself out.  In the meantime his girlfriend took a restraining order out on him so he cannot return to the house to get his belongings.  He has personal artifacts (items he had long before he met this other woman), some jewelry (again he had long before he met this other woman), and his passport.    I want to know what my father can do to retrieve his rightful items.    P.S. My father and the girlfriend just bought the house he has been exiled from.  I would also like to know if this could be taken away from him or what his rights are.	Yes
"Michigan  A friend of mine recently let his sister-in-law stay with him and his wife when she showed up beaten by her to be ex husband. She has been there for a few days now and brought her 9 month old dog with her.  While they do want to help her they also want to be careful as she hasn't been the most trustworthy person in the past.  I've browsed around this sub enough to know that they will need to be careful that she doesn't establish residency. I've already told him not to accept any money from her under any circumstances.   What I can't find online is how long does she have to stay before she can claim residency and he would have to evict her? What other conditions besides length of stay and paying ""rent"" could she potentially use to try to claim residency?"	Yes
As the title says I was pulled over for speeding and found that my license had been suspended due to an unpaid ticket, which I thought I had paid. It had been suspended for quite a while, over a year. I've paid my fines and gotten my license reinstate. Colorado laws says I have to have knowledge of the suspension but I'm not sure how I can prove I was unaware. I can't afford an attorney. I can bring bank records to show I used Uber to get to work from the time I was suspended until it was reinstated. I remember receiving notices in the mail about the ticket but got nothing saying I was suspended, when spoke with the credit agency holding the account for my unpaid ticket they had an incorrect address for me, should I mention this? Any advice would be appreciated, I don't know what to do or what to expect. My court date is Thursday. Thank you ahead of time for any advice or encouragement.	Yes
Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	Yes
"Basically, my friend is willing to come up with the 4k to break the lease, however, the apartment management requires a signature from both people and her ex is refusing to sign until she ""meets with him alone"".  Which is obviously dangerous.   The apartment complex is looking into if they can do anything on their end, but until then, what are her legal rights?"	Yes
My girlfriend and I live together and share a lease in an apartment. I believe I am the primary signature on the lease.   A few days ago my girlfriend and I were arguing, an argument which continued as we entered the bedroom. We were both in bed and I was facing away from her in an attempt to fall asleep, the lights were off and I was trying to end the conflict. The argument was continuing, and I wasn't helping things by telling her to shut up. She eventually started hitting me, which unfortunately has happened before and I told her don't hit me. She hit me again and I turned around in the dark and struck her back, in the chest.   Her immediate response was too cry out and jump from bed, saying she was calling the cops. It all happened very quickly. I got out of bed and got dressed, and waited for the police who arrived extremely quickly. I was fairly shocked at the speed of all this. The police questioned me, and I cooperated fully, explaining to them what I am typing to you now.   At the time I was in a daze. Nothing like this has ever happened to me. I struck my girlfriend out of frustration of her always hitting me. At the time I just wanted her to realize it wasn't fair what she was doing. I know there's no such thing as an excuse especially not in this situation.   Anyways the police cuffed me and took me to jail which I cooperated fully with. I am now being charged with assault. As a stipulation to being released, I was asked to sign a notice to appear, and to agree to fully cut off contact with my (now former) girlfriend. Finally I am not to return to my apartment, where I live and keep all my possessions.   I understand from the information that the police have given me that my ex girlfriend is leaving the apartment. She has a new place to live in the start of August. This means she will be able to start out again on her own, which I am fine with. I really do wish her the best and I look at this incident with sadness and regret.   But now I am under police order to not return to my apartment. Even in a week, once my ex moves out, I am apparently still not to return.   I need advice for, once my apartment has been vacated by my ex, how to regain access to my life and apartment.   I have a court date but it isn't until the 22nd of August. I am staying at a friend's but this whole debacle is weighing heavily on my conscience. I am almost positive that there are no injuries involved. I really hope now that my girlfriend still has compassion for me which I assume she does. I realize my mistake, especially during the moment when I justified my actions as self defense.   But now I am on charges without access to my apartment. Is there something I can do? I plan to, if the charges are not dropped before the 22nd, to lawyer up. I just need some advice about my position.   I am not going to contact my girlfriend because it's part of my release agreement. I just need to get my life back as soon as possible.   Please help!	Yes
OBVIOUSLY THIS IS A THROWAWAY  Long story short, we reconciled after a period of not talking and went out drinking with one of her friends. Me and her went home, both pretty drunk, and during an argument (after a sex/kink scene that went really poorly and I ended up bleeding and in serious pain with no aftercare on her part), she smothered me with a pillow in order to get me to stop talking so she could sleep. I finally stopped fighting and she let up, and we both went to sleep. Later, I woke her up telling her how much she hurt me, and she said if she hurt me so much, then I should just get out and press charges.  I know she wasn't serious about me pressing charges and she was just trying to be mean by saying that (she knows I have a history of being the victim in a violent relationship and being scared about getting legal intervention) but I'm thinking about it now a week later. I remember thinking I was going to die at the hands of someone who said they loved me and how scared I was. Every time I've confronted her about it since then, she's ignored it and I have the screenshots for it (all confrontations were via text).   I don't think I have enough evidence, especially a week out, but I'm really scared that she will do this again to someone else. I know she is seeing someone else and I already warned them anonymously, but I'm still scared that she will do it again to someone unknowing. Should (can I??) press charges, or do I have no power in this situation anymore?	Yes
The title says it all. My sister's probation officer is as negligible as a law enforcement professional can be.   A bit of a back story on how my sister ended up on probation is needed. My sister at 7 months pregnant decided to drive heavily intoxicated with my 2 nieces. She was arrested, charged with 3 counts of child abuse/endangerment and a DUI. Even after being released from a short stay in jail and giving birth to my nephew, she continued to drink. Her PO gave her an option - 3 months mandatory in rehab or 3 months in jail. She decided to go to rehab and things were going pretty well.   Fast forward to today and she has not done any of her mandatory parenting classes or DUI classes and she is continuing to do drugs and drink. And this is not my opinion. If you took one look at my sister, you would know. Her behavior has caused my nephews and nieces assigned social worker to contact her PO and tell him that he needs to take a closer look at what is going on.   To top it all off, she has committed fraud 2 times already. First time she stole a check from a mailbox, went to a cash checking place and cashed it. The business found out what went on and filed a police report. Just today my dad's accountant made him aware of 3 stolen personal checks that my sister cashed. My dad filed a report with police but they stated that they can issue a warrant because it's hear say even though my dad had images of the stolen checks.   My parents called the PO and let him know they are extremely worried about her and his response was that he is aware of what is going on and that  he's going to give her a week to get it together! It's a joke. My parents response was that she could be dead in a week with how fast she is spiraling out of control. Yet she goes to probation today and nothing happens.   Somehow she has managed to pull one over this guy and it's sickening how oblivious to everything this guy is. He is completely negligent. She has somehow passed her drug/alcohol tests for probation (which are scheduled by the way and only a mouth swab) but she has not done any of her mandatory random drug tests for social services because they are random urine tests that she will fail.   My family and I want to file a grievance because the man is not doing his job. To be honest, I think he's sleeping with her. He doesn't know where she lives and she is lying about having a job. It's mind boggling. What do I do? I'm in Orange county, California.	Yes
I met my girlfriend in high school and we've been together for about a year now. Before she dated me she dated somebody else who had problems. They broke up because he physically abused her and cheated on her.  A while back, I want to say about four or five months ago, he began stalking her. Circumstance had it set that while they were dating, he activated some kind of software on her phone and was able to completely bug her. Anyone's voice or location could be visible/audible when in the vicinity of this phone. He used it to track her down and try god-knows-what. He hit her one time while I was at work. There was a police report and all this and that, and an emergency restraining order.   This is really only the spark-notes of it. There was a lot more going on. A lot of nights I went without sleep and jumping at every creek and bump in the night. Since then, however, (As far as we know) this bug as been disabled and we got her a new phone for the time being.  Recently, this phone broke and, after wiping her old phone clean (New iCloud account, all this Apple jargon that I can't decipher being an android man) she switched back to it. We're planning on moving here soon so getting these luxuries aren't primarily on our minds.  Now, since having been switched back to Phone A, this stalking continues. She lives with me now and we're planning to move out of state, so I feel like I have a better grasp on her safety. Still, these texts come and go of this stalker begging to see her, come drop off old memorabilia, just one last talk, etc etc. Through chance(?) he's ran into her while running errands, and threats of macing out of self defense were thrown around. He often texts me trying to get under my skin, but beyond that he's afraid of me and rightly so. My blood is boiling typing this out. Again the long nights of no sleep and investigating every minor sound and dog bark continue. I feel like I'm driving myself nuts. I always keep an ear out for any movement, vibration, whatever in this house. Thankfully she stays with good friends or my mother while I'm at work.  I'm scared and angry. What do we do?  Throwaway, because hey. This stalker scrambles for our social media at every chance.	Yes
"My brother is a horrible sociopath and drug abuser. My mother has been one of those mothers who has been blinded by motherly love in the past, and has enabled him for the past twenty years. But now it has reached a point where she fears for her life. So last year she took out a restraining order against him.  However, whenever the police take him away... they seem to release my brother from custody after a few days. I don't actually know the law, but I'm told that my brother is classified as mentally-ill by the state, and according to the law, they cannot hold mentally-ill in jail. So over the past several years one of three things, happen... they release him to a homeless shelter, or the county hospital, and one time even a church. And from there he is released, and able to come back to my mother's house where he starts the abuse, and the cycles starts all over again.   In the past, she would even bring my brother home herself because, even after physical violence, she would say ""he is still my son and I love him"". But because the type of drugs he abused got harder and harder, and the physical, mental, and financial abuse got worse and worse, she finally was able to get a restraining order against him.  However, my brother has found another loophole to this restraining order law: Police can only remove people violating a restraining order if they are outside the house. What he does is hop the backyard gate and sneak into the house. According to my mother, the police have told her that they can no longer remove my brother if he is already inside the house.  My brother currently has a case against him for violent abuse against my mom, but the next court date is in late September, but I fear she won't last long in her current state.  My questions:  1) Am I misinformed in that mentally-ill persons cannot be kept incarcerated in California? If that is indeed in the case, what options do we have to forcible keep my brother away from my mom at least until the court hearing date?  2) Can the police really do nothing if my brother is already inside the house on the restraining order?  3) Can a restraining order be made null and void if my brother argues that my mother voluntarily took him back?"	Yes
So this is a bit of a shit storm my  gf got me into. As stated above we got into an argument and the cops were called. my gf is an alcoholic, and started to tell the cops about how i hit her in the past even though these were very false allegations. now i wasn't talked to or even approached by the police. she signed a waiver stating she didn't want to have me arrested. we received a letter in the mail yesterday from the local police dept trying to get her to contact a detective to gather evidence against me to get a warrant for a crime i didn't commit. she said she would call them and let them know she didn't want to press charges or anything against me. should i lawyer up? can a case be built against me if i wasn't even talked to that night and my gf doesn't want to pursue it?	Yes
"I am 18 years old and heading to university in September. My mother has always been emotionally unstable, bipolar, bpd, and very manipulative. She never respects my privacy (goes through my things when I'm not here, steals them and won't give them back for no reason, etc) - e.g: a few months ago she stole my girlfriend and I's polaroids and wouldn't give them back because she didn't approve of me dating her (very unjustified considering my girlfriend never showed any reason not to be with her). She never lets me close the door to my room because ""I shouldn't have anything to hide"" and ""there shouldn't be any secrets between us"".  More recently I bought a watch with money I had saved for years, and she just called me to tell me she's going to take the watch and return it (and most likely keep the money). My parents being divorced I left for holidays with my father and left my watch at home.   I don't know what to do anymore: She has been emotionally and sometimes physically abusive with me for YEARS, which has caused me to develop depression, severe insecurity and low self-esteem and anger management issues. Nonetheless, I have never gotten physically agressive with her. This watch I bought is one I hold very dear, and being 18 I don't think she's allowed to steal my things and sell them without my consent.   What should I do?"	Yes
So I was recently jailed on an Domestic Assault charge on a person that I've been friends with for years. The only reason it was classified as Domestic Assault is because we dated years ago. I'm really shaken about the entire court process and I plead not guilty. However I have numerous scratches and contussions from the actual fight, but I was the person that was taken to jail. With a no contact order in place she is on Facebook taking about she beat me up and knew I would to go to jail, she also messaged me an apology and said have a nice life. Her family was there when all this happened and I didn't have any witnesses of my own.  Is this case going to stand up in court or do I need to get an attorney? I also want to get a teaching license and would rather not have anything violent on my background. If you guys could help me out I would definitely appreciate it.	Yes
Long story short when I was younger my mother cheated on my father with a new man who would do drugs together with my mom and abuse her right infront of me. My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway.   What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all.

Colorado. I was assaulted by my (ex)partner last night, him being taken to jail and I to the hospital. He was seen by a judge today and I have a Mandatory Protection Order that specifically mentions the apartment we are both on the lease for.   About an hour ago I received a three day notice to quit for substantial violation. Am I out of luck or is there protection for me since I was the victim?  I will be calling around when offices open tomorrow, but right now I am scared I will have to move on my own in three days. If I left anything out I am very sorry.  TL;DR He broke the lease by assaulting me. Do I have to move or can I fight a notice to quit?	Yes
How long does a restraining order take to get filed? I am accused of cyberstalking and harassing via text message. Theoretically, if my ex girlfriend were to have decided to get a restraining order against me, how long would it take to file? Would the police knock on my door the next day? Would it take weeks? I'm in no accusation of domestic violence or stalking her physically. It's only following her on social media and texting her. How long?	Yes
"My Gf asked me to go to the beach with her dad and his wife, who is not her mother. We were all drinking one night and me and my gf were playing around wrestling which was a bad idea cause she started to get mad when she thought I was getting too aggressive. We stopped, I thought we were just playing around cause she started laughing and lunged at me which caused me to fall back and she hit her head in the ground hard. I immediately asked if she was ok and tried to check on her but she freaked out and said leave me alone, don't talk to me etc. and ran to her room with our 8 month old son who was sleeping. I kind of just layed there and was like what the hell just happened before going inside. Well her dad was in the doorway asking what was wrong and she tells him that I body slammed her to the ground which was not true. She claims she wanted my attention and her emotions always get the best of her when she is drinking. So anyway, her dad starts yelling at me saying all these things like next time I touch her he is gonna beat my ass and all this stuff making me out to be some abusive boyfriend. At this point I am looking him straight in the eyes saying ""I hear you"" ""I understand"" and we are both raising our voices. He then threatens me by saying ""I will go to your house and slap your mother"" this obviously pisses me off and I go on to say ""no the fuck you won't"" etc. next thing I know I'm hit the eye and we are wrestling around in the kitchen. He has me by the hair and is beating me in the side of the head while my gf is trying to break it up and he won't stop. He was also drinking. I can't even say if I hit him or not but I was just trying to defend myself. I eventually get up and say ""you got me, you win"" he calls me a piece of shit and I start packing all our things to leave. Later I find out he told my gf ( his daughter) fuck you and he pushed her out the door and when he did he ended up clipping her on the chin with his first. At this point I have no idea what I should do, I have a huge black eye, bruises over my head and my nose was bleeding. I have pictures of everything after it happened."	Yes
"The title is self explanatory. My ex boyfriend's pre-trial court date is tomorrow regarding violating the order of protection I have. In CT that is a class D felony. I checked online and during his last court date he plead ""not guilty"", so I'm assuming tomorrow the judge either decides if he is found guilty or not. If he is found guilty, is there another date scheduled in the future for sentencing?  I know nobody can 100% predict what the judge will decide, but what are the chances he receives jail time? He was arrested for harassment in the 2nd degree (class C misdemeanor),  conspiracy to harass (class C misdemeanor), and stalking in the 2nd degree (class A misdemeanor). Since it was his first offense, he was allowed to join the Family Violence program and take some counseling. But, during that time he broke the no-contact protective order the court gave me.   I'm really worried if he receives jail time he will try to harm me. I know his family and him own weapons, but I obviously have no proof to show the court. During his court date tomorrow I have to take an exam and there is no way I can change the date. I'm so worried about leaving my baby sister and family alone in the house in case he comes to my house after. I'm not sure if I'm just thinking irrationally because of fear. I already have bad anxiety and OCD, so my thoughts are a mess right now. I keep on having a tick where I'm imagining him hurting my family and I can't get it out of my head no matter how much I try to fight it. I'm really unsure of what to do. Any help is appreciated."	Yes
Six years ago my (now ex) boyfriend and his friend raped me. He had been pouring a flask in my drink all night and when I passed out in his bed he and his friend brought in another girl and tried to get with both of us. She got freaked out and called a taxi and left. My ex and his friend cornered me and his friend had his way with me while my boyfriend held me down.   My ex stormed out the room and called me a whore.   Fast forward to last night, I get a call from his latest girlfriend and after hours on the phone talking about the abuse we both endured with him we found out that he and his friend raped her too in the same fashion.  This guy has a history of sexually abusing women and abusing animals (put a cat in a microwave, gave a small dog a seizure from kicking her across the room, abusing this girls dog to the point where she had to give him up so he'd be safe). He is truly the scum of the earth and there is no end to the carnage he causes anyone in his life, mental and physical abuse.  I may have what constitutes as a confession from him about the sexual assault and his latest gf went to a doctor right after so that may be proof.   Now that I have this girl's experience, I know that it'll happen again and I am wondering if we have a case? There are at least 4 other women I could contact that would potentially testify against him.  Thank you for any advice.	Yes
currently in a verbally and emotionally abusive relationship, I'm working on getting out (all without his knowledge) I'm just trying to tie up loose ends. A few months ago I fell asleep in one of the recliners in our living room and when I woke up he had his phone out and showed me ALOT of pictures he took of me with his penis out and on my face in various different places. near and almost in my mouth from what I can remember. he only showed them to me that one time then refused to delete them when I begged him to. be he wouldn't even show them to me again when I asked. he laughed and thought it was funny and never showed them to me again. I feel so violated. what can I do? press charges? ensure somehow they get deleted??	Yes
So some of you may remember my posts. I'm obv not the best writer so I'll try harder here to make it soft on the eyes. This is a long read but quite interesting. Anyone who can help you may be saving a life. I have no where else to turn and I am miserable ridden with pain and anxiety. Here we go.  My ex was a controlling abuser. Emotionally physically and now sexually she abused me. I was young dumb and in love. When we broke up she was flirting with my step brother heavily, this angered me and I had screen shots of the messaged (she left her insta logged in my phone) and I threatened to show her parents what kinda person she is. She then got a RO against me for the reason of me telling her parents. She lied in the entire thing. Making up abuse and criminal charges against me. i.e. She said I was charged with assault 2 never happened. She said I am a felon( I was a felon about a year ago got in reduced per plea deal, the felony was for selling 2 grams of weed to a friend when I was 18. I live in Oregon too, fuck me right?) anyways the order got granted I tried to fight it, i fucked up and missed court. So I am Unable to fight it.   Before she got the order she mentioned she was going to, so I start to compile evidence, I have so much on her. She would blackmail me with self harm daily, I have a picture where she carved my name into her leg with a knife. I mean it she messed me up with all these games. I find in my google drive a video taken from my phone by her, of her touching me and riding me from a POV style. I am dead asleep obviously in the video. This is rape. This is sexual assault. This isn't the first time She would do this. We would fight and she would try and force sex on to me to make me feel better. I would literally have to fight her off. Cuz I obv didn't want it.   I realize I want to wait till after the restraining order blows over to report the crime. Since it is over due to my incompetence, i feel as if it's a good time to report. I report earlier today to the local PD. No lawyer. No counsel. Just you guys. He says he is going to investigate her for invasion of privacy. I think to my self that this is just the start, and when detectives see the video, they will drop the hammer. The policeman doesn't even wanna see it. He just takes my word and calls her. After his talk with her he's dismissing the case. I swear he probably told her what to say. She even admitted in the video it's her. And when I found the video initially before the RO was served I confronted her about it. I asked why did she have sex with me with no consent you know that's rape right? Or something along the lines. She said I woke up during the video. So it was fine. Which is a lie. The officer told me she said we filmed many of our sexual encounters (not many but some) and we would wake up daily at 2 am to have sex. (Another lie) I was bringing all the money in I needed my sleep.   Another bone in this is that someone is messaging her off a private instagram, telling her that I'm Spreading nude photos of her. (Complete lie and not me doing this I'm not gonna risk violating my RO) I feel it's another ex BF one whom she claimed raped her (she lied about it she went to his house and fucked him a week later while dating me :( ) and he's kinda getting some revenge on her for this. I'm very scared I'm gonna get framed for something I didn't do, I swear the cop was more concerned about this instagram ghost then he was about me. He didn't care to watch my clips, and he hung up on me mid sentence.   I'm shocked everyone. I'm in awe. I have to take Xanax (prescribed) to just sleep. The betrayal is more then I can handle. I'm calling a lawyer Monday morning and seeing what he says. In the meantime any idea from you all? I called just the local PD but I feel the sheriffs will take this much more seriously. After pleading with the officer that I'm a victim and this is rape since it's sex with no consent. He said I shoulda woke up and wasn't on anything. He was just bullshitting me the whole time. From what I remember he said he would leave the case open, and have a detective check it out. Thank god. My light isn't done yet. I wanna get a lawyer asap I am Just low in cash. And since I know I'm not Messaging her, spreading her nudes, or getting anyone else to messaged her, I won't be in trouble I hope. But you never know.   She also says she has some voice recordings from When I found out she was flirting hard with my step bro. I was furious. All I said was that I was gonna ruin her life by telling her parents yadadada I was really angry. Never made threats of violence at all or anything really illegal. Just a little annoyance.   So guys what do I do? Be worried about this instagram ghost? Get a good lawyer? Or get legal aid? Very confused ,scared and alone. The cop treated me like a fucking joke. If the genders were reversed here I'd be rotting in jail as I type this. Any and all comments welcome. I love you all truly. This is a very hard time in my life, and if I don't find the strength I will fall.   PS: if I post something about her, not sexual or anything, on my fb, is that gonna get me in trouble? I really wanna post the pic of my name on her leg. Let everyone see how crazy she is.	Yes
My friend had his parole transferred from another state to VA and is two months out on a 3 year parole after a lengthy prison sentence. His sister was supportive all through his sentence and offered to have him come live with her. Turns out his sister is a raging alcoholic, and her boyfriend who also live with them is an active junkie (my friend found him ODing in the kitchen one night). The sister and her bf fight nonstop keeping my buddy up all night when he has to work the next day (thankfully he found a decent job in the service industry). One night after asking them to keep it down at 4 a.m. the sister pushed my friend, hit him, and threatened to call his PO on him.  Now, the friend obviously wants out, he did not expect to be thrown into this hellhole, nor does he want to violate his parole, yet he is afraid to tell his PO the situation thinking they will throw him in a shelter (I believe the shelter here has a 10pm curfew which would cause him to lose his job). Nor does he want to live in a shelter.   I think he should just tell his PO everything, but will they actually throw him in a shelter, or are they more flexible than that. What does he do when living at the place his parole dictates can violate his parole. If anyone familiar with the system can give their best two cents that would be awesome.	Yes
Family law cases, including domestic violence and child custody, represent the largest category of cases closed by LSC grantees each year. Millions of women, men, and children experience domestic violence in the U.S. every year. Legal aid is essential to protect domestic violence victims and their families and to help them overcome many associated problems that can endanger their safety and stability.   In 2016 LSC grantees closed 115,977 domestic violence cases involving nearly 282,014 victims and their families. This represents nearly 16% of all cases closed by grantees nationwide.  Intimate partner violence accounts for 15% of all violent crime. On average, nearly **20 people per minute are physically abused by an intimate partner in the United States.** During one year, this equates to more than 10 million individuals.   Often survivors face additional legal problems. Ninety-seven percent of low-income households with survivors of recent domestic violence or sexual assault experienced at least one other civil legal problem in the past year, including 67% that have experienced 6+ problems.   A study by the Institute for Policy Integrity found that civil legal aid is more effective than access to shelters or counseling services in reducing domestic violence—by as much as 21%. Increasing a woman’s chances of obtaining a protective order is the most effective way that legal assistance can reduce domestic violence. Survivors of domestic violence rate the filing of a protective order as one of their two most effective tools for stopping domestic violence, second only to leaving the abuser. Representation is critical in these cases as **83% of victims represented by an attorney successfully obtained a protective order, compared to only 32% of victims without an attorney.**  LSC grantees help clients [provide safe, stable environments for their children](http://www.lsc.gov/legal-aid-helps-domestic-violence-survivor-save-her-home), [build violence-free lives](http://www.lsc.gov/protecting-mother-six-domestic-violence-alaska), and [reunite with their families](http://www.lsc.gov/helping-father-reunite-his-children).

I'm in desperate need of some help.  I am a 19 year old male who lives in Australia and I'm in a really bad situation and I don't know what to do.  2 weeks ago my girlfriend came over to my place to hang out for the night. Everything started off ok and I became pretty drunk after a few hours and I remember she helped me into the bedroom. Then all I really remember is waking up to find her on top of me with my arms tied to the headboard. I shoved her off and asked her what the fuck she was doing. That's when she told me if I tell anyone she will report me for raping her.  I don't know what to do, I feel disgusting I feel ashamed I have become so severely depressed I don't want to live anymore.  I want to report, I badly want to report her. But I know she will say I did it.  What do I do?	Yes
"this is a very bad situation but i really just want a very straight-forward answer and not a focus on the situation at large which I am struggling to manage with a therapist.  for many years I have been sexually assaulted by my uncle in law (uncle), since i was a child. I am only now, as an adult, trying to deal with this but I am terrified for my family to know as i fear what could happen on many, many levels.  I just want it to stop. my therapist thinks I should file a restraining order (both my uncle and I are in California, as are my parents and sister) but there are frequent gatherings at my parents house (where he often assaults me late at night) and a restraining order would make all of this public immediately. my uncle in law is married to my father's sister.  these interactions have gone on in waves and sometimes i've managed to avoid him for many months at a time. recently it's gotten more frequent and intense so I decided to try to stop it. I have been avoiding him now for many weeks (he does not live in my city but visits and tries to see me). he is getting frustrated that i refuse to obey him and getting angry. he is verbally and physically abusive and, like many victims of stuff like this, i have consented to much i am ashamed about out of fear and shame. while he can be physically abusive I don't fear he would kill me or something. I know he doesn't want all this to come to light. i have told no one until recently. only my therapist and a close friend (who doesn't live in my city) now know what's happened. I am very alone.  I am afraid i can not avoid him much longer and that he will assault me. I know the answer seems obvious but when you've been abused for 20 years it's not easy to get out from under it, please believe me. this is so difficult that suicide is a constant thought rather than admit what has happened to my family.  what I was thinking was that i could hire a lawyer (I don't have much money but my friend who knows about this can help me to a degree) to deliver a letter to him stating that i have spoken with the lawyer and am prepared to issue a restraining order if he does not stop contacting me. I thought maybe the letter could say that if he ever touches me in any way I will file a police report and if he assaults me i will pursue rape charges. I don't want to go down that road but i'm not sure what else i can do.   would a lawyer do this kind of thing? is this crazy of me? i know I sound cowardly (I feel cowardly) but this is incredibly difficult and i just wnat it all to go away. I don't want to have to break my parents hearts and everything. I'm not even sure I could do it but I know that just telling him I don't ever want to see him again isn't working. he knows how much control he has and he's not afraid to use physical force.  [again, please don't provide advice along the lines of ""why don't you just tell your family"" or something as it's incredibly hurtful. if i could do this, i would. believe me.]  thank you for your advice."

Recently my sister's friend confronted her ex, and father of her child, and he made claims about wanting to kill my sister, strangling his other children, and made a bunch of other threatening comments. Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney.  Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?	Yes
"I have never been arrested or charged with anything in my life, my attacker was my brother who is 70lbs heavier then me and convicted of armed robbery quite a few years ago, was assaulted in my residence.  also, state is NJ  basic gist:  -I live in residence with my mother   -discover ~800$ worth of xbox stuff is missing with the ottoman i stored the items in.   -99% sure my brother who no longer lives at the residence stole them   -Text him to return my objects or i am calling police (have this text still)   -my mom was on the phone with him and he says he is coming to beat me up essentially. -I go to leave but his house is very nearby, he parks behind my car.   - i go back inside with 911 dialed for when he strikes me which i knew was inevitable, but i was hoping to deter him and just tell him to leave.   -tell him to leave, he grabs me by throat, slams my head into a wall which cracks, slams me into opposite side wall twice and tries to throw me down stairs.   - i call 911 just as he grabs me, sometime during the altercation i say ""i am calling 911 you idiot, get off me"" -he lets go after that immediately and paces in front of the front door so he can speak to police first. (i recorded this)   -I'm adopted and not white, my brother is white 70lbs heavier then me, and was once convicted of armed robbery. cops who showed up are white, one had a vendetta against me since i put a couple holes in the wall last year and my mom called the police but decided not to press charges.   -I had scrapes all over my shoulder and back, along with bruising. -he had a cut on his lip, i admitted to probably causing it trying to get him off of me during the altercation by pushing against his face, cops wrote down i punched him. -was in pain in holding cell at the town holding cell, waved to camera for assistance, asked for medical attention and they threatened me. - where do i go from here? I've never been arrested in my life, i can't exactly afford a lawyer, i feel like a lawyer will only help me if they believe there is a lawsuit involved. Which sure, I wouldn't complain, but I'm really mostly worried about my record and future being ruined for calling for help while being attacked in my own home...  do you think the text and him showing up to assault me in the house i live in, he doesn't, literally 10 minutes later would be able to prove anything? or even the fact i was the one who called 911 and had way worse injuries? I even have pictures of bruising on my throat from being strangled. all the way on both sides and underneath."	Yes
"So I met this guy when I was 17 (a couple months away form 18). He essentially groomed me and offered me xanax and alcohol and a place to stay when I was homeless. We got very intoxicated and passed out and when I regained consciousness is when the video takes place. I didn't know that I had this video in my possession and uncovered it when I was trying to clear space off my laptop. The video depicts the following:  &gt; Both of us are naked. We're playing around with my new camera phone and seeing how long it will take video. I am acting like a drunk 17 year old. Both of us are clearly identifiable in the video. There isn't any sexual intercourse in the video however I do reference sex with him and at one point in the video I say ""I am 17 and you are 27. I did not consent to this and you are making child porn."" From the video it looks like I was holding the phone most of the time excepting the couple times he tries to grab it and film me naked. It also appears as though he might be taking pictures or recording simultaneously on his phone.   Later on in our relationship I found a hard drive with a BUNCH of pornographic pictures and highly sexual conversations with people that he had never had relationships with. It was very clear he was suffering from a sexual addiction. Our initial contact led to a two-ish year ""relationship"" that ended in him abandoning me the day before my birthday. During this time he was highly abusive about my appearance and weight. We moved to the outer banks and lived there, away from my family, friends, or any acquaintances. When he abandoned me he managed to pack up all of our valuable possessions while he sent me a couple hours away to get my nails done for my birthday and then moved cross-country to California with his business partner without notice. This included walking out on our recently co-signed car which he purchased using the entirety of my savings. I was left with a large number of animals to care for including reptiles, fish, dogs, and cats. Immediately and with precision he  1. cancelled all our joint accounts 2. blocked me on all social media 3. set up a forwarding address 4. blocked my phone number 5. gave notice to the landlord that *both* of us would be moving out immediately  It was obviously premeditated.  Even after he left he started talking to me again a few months later. He initiated sexual exchanges over skype and email pictures (because he refused to text me). He played games and led me along emotionally and then ask for a bunch of nudes. He would even mention the idea of coming back and ""visiting."" He later went on to get caught masturbating at work (by no intent of mine) while sending it to me and ceased communication after he was fired.  To this day I haven't really been in a position to take any action against him and for years I've been too emotional traumatized to see the situation clearly. When I found the video and watched it I was disgusted by how childish and intoxicated I was and am moved to take action. I feel violated, lied to, and really this event has turned my life upside down. My credit is still destroyed by the repossession and have daily anxiety.  I'm ready to take action against him. I feel like I was a minor who was very intentionally groomed. Where do I start? I currently reside in Oregon and he is located in California (I have a last known address and I can track him down). Can I report him to the police where the video was taken and will they likely take any action? I was 17 and underage (although within a couple months of 18) but clearly was groomed, given substances, and taken advantage of by a much older individual. We are both married now, this isn't a revenge thing. I don't want anything except for him to accept some kind of consequence for his wrongdoings. Thank you."	Yes
She has a psychiatrist, therapist, and will be taken to a mental hospital soon. She wants to know if she can be required to give the name/s of her rapist and if she can be punished for not doing so. She lives in Ohio.	Yes
how can I anonymously report him without him knowing if he finds out he would kill me even with a restraining order. (I know this is a bad relationship and need to get out and I have tried )	Yes
"Not much info beyond the title. There is a history of violence in the home. He is an unrepentant alcoholic and he claims he does not remember anything that happened.   Question is: What are the next steps? I doubt he can afford a lawyer though he likely makes too much for a court appointed attorney. I know the ""right answer"" is lawyer up but I need to know what to do in the meantime. I stopped by the jail but apparently I am not allowed see him. I **will not** bail him out or put up any money for him. I'm just trying to get info to pass on to my mother. I'd let him rot if it were up to me but she's freaking out so thought I'd get some general info to calm her down.   Thanks in advance. "	Yes
A few years ago after my mother's divorce she found a boyfriend, things started out well enough but once he moved in it went over the edge. He physically abused myself, and emotionally and mentally everyone else in the household (Mother, Sister and I). They have since separated and gone their different ways. After the breakup however new details came to light as to his past. Apparently he had innapropiate contact with his children and with other children. This came to us as he had left an Ipod/IPhone when he moved out where he recorded conversations with a counselor at his children's school and a psychologist as he went through his divorce. He currently works as girls soccer coach at a middle school in Durham NC. Both my mother and I fear what he can do as he is a master manipulator. I want to bring this to light for his employer, but I want to get my ducks in a row, by finding the names of his children or ex-wife in Georgia. How would I go about finding this information? I know divorce records are publicly available but as I live across the country in Washington State I don't know if I'll be able to access them. Any advice is appreciated and I apologize for the text wall and any mistakes I may have made wether it be formatting or posting guidelines.	Yes
My mom has been living with her ex-boyfriend for about 6 months. After coming back from the oil rig one week, he broke her arm into half and sent her to the hospital. Now, after posting bail he's changed the locks on the house and has barricaded the driveway with his spare truck while he goes back on the rig. She just wants to collect her and my sisters belongings so they can move on with their lives, is there any legal method of doing this?	Yes
A person I know was hit in the head by her husband in Virginia. If she goes to a doctor, will they have to report it to the police? Everything I could find on the subject seemed to say that mandatory reporting only applied if a weapon was used.	Yes
I witnessed my (Indonesian) wife attempt to murder our daughter (Two YO), forcing her to drink bleach. Daughter recovered.  I told my mother then and wife confessed to her days later also.  Wife has disappeared with daughter now, demanding ransom over the phone ($20k). I have no legal recourse currently there, and no escape path for her.  I want my elderly mother's witness to my wife's confession to her reported legally, ASAP.  It may be useless, however some day I hope at least that my daughter could see the confession, documented at law firm here.   Could you please recommend a service type?	Yes
Mom and i recently found out my father (divored) has been molesting my sisters but they hid it for years because they didnt want to lose their dad. We tried to report him but they sent cops and cps to our mom trying to charge her for it  because there's no proof against him. Also, my sisters said they found child porn on his phone but they didnt mention it to cops because they were telling them theyll go to a foster home.  How can we report him for that instead? My sisters dont see him no more	Yes
I was involved in a self defense shooting recently. It was a domestic issue. I do not have a lawyer. They took my pistol &amp; the investigation is still open.   The detective arrived on scene shortly after &amp; preceded to ask me questions. I decided to tell my side of the story without a lawyer present. I do not have one.  I took a recorded statement at the precinct &amp; was released. No charges were filed. The aggressor was rushed to intensive care. He did not die.   My questions are: Was it bad for me to speak without a lawyer present, despite the fact that I was released. Do I need to get one? And who do I contact in regards to remaining anonymous with the press?	Yes
I have gone 6 days without sleeping. Having trouble even writing this. Help plzzz 	Yes
Ex and I were together for a decade. Ex broke it off two months ago. Fine. Ex says she'll remove her stuff from the apartment and get on with it.  Except the part where she never did. And she stopped paying rent.  We are co-tenants on a lease that ends in approximatemy four months. Out of the eight months we have been here, ex has only paid rent for three.   Because we were together so long, there is only a verbal agreement of splitting the rent in half. Maybe there's a saved text or something but I never got a written contract because love I guess.  The main thing here is I can't stand being around her anymore. We had a domestic violence incident in the last year that I did not report. Staying in this apartment now is mentally and physically destroying me but I don't trust ex to 1) not steal my shit and 2) not wreck the apartment.  The only silver living here is that the landlord allows for leases to be broken with notarized signatures of both co-tenants. I've sent this is ex multiple times and they've yet to complete it. To be fair, I haven't done it either because I've been waiting on her to sign it first.   My main question is: Is there any way I can potentially just get my name off the lease? This leaves ex with the hot potato, as they say, and is the easiest way to dodge. I'm just worried about this coming back to bite me in the ass later either via a small claim or a bad landlord reference. That's probably out of the question, though, considering the early leave.   Thanks for any help you can give.	Yes
"So I'm really lost and in need of help on this, to my ex-girlfriend has had some mental issues for quite a while that she decides to take out on me. To get into the story I have another post that can provide further insight. Me and my EXgirlfriend have had an argument about her talking to other men and her exes, because of her anger issues she goes from 0 to 100 just like that and will cuss and throw things but in our most recent argument she decided to up and move overnight, this was while I was thinking that there was something going on with her and another man. Well sure enough one of her estranged family members and a random guy helped her move out in the process she had stolen a lot of stuff for me but returned some of it. The next day her and that guy came over and we're sitting in their car in front of my driveway until I came out and trying to harass me to give me my cat to her. Now this was a feral cat that was never owned by anybody except I always paid Veterinary bills and for all other living Essentials and also has lived at my house it's whole life. Well recently she decided I have committed domestic violence against her in that argument and that she wants the cat now, even though she has no proof it's her cat. In doing that I had a court order to return the cat and there was a court date in two weeks from now. She is trying to take my cat right now and the other day while I was at work 2 police officers and my ex showed up to get the cat but the cat was outside and I was at work so they had to come back in the next days. I have visual, text, and Witnesses that show she had made a false statement. Also after I was served a temporary restraining order until the next court date where I can provide everything she kept trying to provoke and contact me calling from different numbers until one time I answered and she said right away "" I'm sorry that was the only thing I could say or do to try and get that cat"" I told her to text it to me but of course she knew what she was doing and wouldn't. She has been talking before she moved out about moving out of state and this guy that she met is from one state away but when she told me he was only a friend at the time she said he's moving back to that state soon. I fear for the life and well-being of my cat or that she will send it off.   What happens if I don't give up the cat until the court date so that I can provide my evidence that it is both my cat and she made a false statement?  How is she able to say that another animal is hers with no evidence and be granted the ability to steal someone's property?  Any questions or concerns are appreciated as this stuff is scary, thank you Reddit community."	Yes
"Okay I'm gonna tell you all the details. I am 18 and I was charged with domestic violence and assault. Domestic violence is false because the lady who I have an assault charge on thought for whatever reason that I was choking my girlfriend out, which never happened. My girlfriend and me were arguing and she threw my stuff out the window, so we continued to fuss and I kind of had my hands flailing in the air and I was faced towards my girlfriend in the car, opposite of the windshield. I told her there was a lady coming and I didn't want her to hear us arguing but she didn't care. So the lady ended up running to the car and she yelled get off of my girlfriend. I told her this isn't her business and my girlfriend told her I'm not doing anything to her. The lady then pepper sprayed me and it got all in my eyes and hair and neck.   Me and my girlfriend were both in the car coughing and choking on the lingering spray, so we had to exit the vehicle. I'm panicking because I can't see anything at all so I hurry to grab my stuff and get it back in the  car, then I walked towards the lady (she's in front of our car)  to get around to get in the vehicle and she tried to get her pepper spray again so I covered my face and I tried to grab it from her but, I'm still barely able to see and my face is burning and numb at the same time, and she accidently fell since I got too close to her. I got in the vehicle and my girlfriend noticed someone recording and I got out the car and I ran over to him and slipped, got back up and ran and asked why he was recording. He said because he can and I called him a racist because of the smirk he had on his face looking at me. I didn't do anything wrong to my girlfriend or that lady, yet I have these charges, and my girlfriend has already talked to the state prosecutor, but initially she told them I grabbed her wrists(and that's already considered domestic violence) when police first talked to her, but that's not how it went, we were just arguing like any normal couple, and now she doesn't say that but it's already in the police report so how can we go about her saying that to that we were just getting loud?    I'm about to go to my third court date because they keep stalling,  adding more evidence for themselves and now they're trying to get me for bail violation because I called my girlfriend in jail. She's literally the only person I talk to and the only number I knew by heart. I had to talk to her to get a hold of my dad and that's the only reason I ever got bonded out. They only have two recorded 14 minute conversations and my lawyer said I said something about not caring about staying away from her or some bs like that, and he told me that the way the judge and prosecutor thinks, they just look at the police report and go ""oh this guy choked his girlfriend and hit an old lady yep he's a bad person"" but little do they know I have never even been in trouble before and I am not a violent person whatsoever, me and my girlfriend are happily in love and have been for over 4 years, I'd never lay a hand on her, and I have so much respect for anybody, even people that are mean, because I'm too nice of a person.   Now they're going to have a jury selection and I have to talk about my bail violation in a few days. What can I do to make them not put me in jail for that?"	Yes
I don't want him to go to jail. I didn't think it would result in criminal charges.	Yes
My soon to be ex husband came over and took my tv. (Were separated) I said no and was blocking the tv. He kicked me in the stomach and punched me in the arm to shove me away and grabbed the tv. I grabbed his shirt as he was leaving and it tore. He said great now when you call the cops it will look like you attacked me and you'll be arrested. He did this all in front of our 3 yr old son. What can I do? If anything. I didn't touch him (besides grabbing his shirt). 	Yes
Hello Reddit,   Is it legal for a 16 year old to file a restraining order on a physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive 18 year old sibling?	Yes
"Ok, so I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I recently found out that an ex of mine had called the police on me multiple times during our relationship and after it. He had claimed I was stalking him. I don't know how he convinced the police not to speak to me, or maybe he gave them my incorrect information, who knows.. But I never spoke to an officer. I only found out, well, I found out the first bit one day when I looked at his phone and saw him repeat dialing this number. When I called it, it was a sargents number. I woke him up and confronted him about it. That's when I found out he had called the police on me for accidentally breaking his window. He never set his buzzer up on his apartment, and when I'd come over, since he didn't want me to yell, I'd have to throw something at his window to get his attention to let him know I was there. One time it cracked the very edge of the glass, a tiny hairline fracture. (If I were intentionally breaking his window, I'd probably throw a brick through it, not my set of keys like I always did). Mind you, when he called the police he was texting wiith me saying he wanted to move in with me, etc... And he had called the woman he was cheating on me with.. right before calling the police (lol). Anyway, much later, I come to find out he called and made stalking claims against me when I'd be somehwere he was and I'd almost bust him cheating.. He'd then like.. stop communicating with the police about it, so it would never go anywhere. Anyway, I have printed off the proof that he's full of crap, he told me to do everything he subsquently called the police on me for, and that while telling the police I was ""stalking him and harasassing him"".. he was actually stalking and harassing me because I didn't want to be with him and he wouldn't stop bothering me. I mean, he messaged me on valentines day and I didn't read it for two weeks.. And I find out, recently, in that two weeks in took me to respond he was on here posting about how he ""just wants to be left alone"" and how I ""won't stop stalking him"".. He got meaner and meaner the further time went on and I didn't answer. Crazy ass behavior. Anyway.. is there a law against this? There freaking has to be?"	Yes
My neighborhood has a Facebook group for the residents. Recently, it has come to light that there is an autistic woman who is being abused by her parents. After some initial hubbub, she made a post to Facebook clearing things up and posting her side of the story.  In it, she clarifies that she is being emotionally abused and financially controlled by her parents. She has been hospitalized because of it. She says all the organizations she has contacted (social workers, adult protective services, police, etc.) have been unable to help her.  My heart breaks for her. People were happy to comment about her situation and bemoan everything about it before she said something, but now that she's actually requesting help, of course no one is commenting or offering help or anything. I feel absolutely awful knowing this is going on and we're all hiding behind closed doors and pretending everything is okay.  Is there anything we can do for her? Truth be told, I've never talked to her before, and I only know things from what she has said, so I do not know the full story. But with the information that is available, what can be done?	Yes
Keeping things somewhat obfuscated for safety, if you need finer details, please PM me.  This happened in upstate SC. I am now in FL.  About 4 years ago, I offered to open up my house out of the kindness of my heart to my best friend and their spouse, who have a child. The next several months after that, it became very apparent that there were things I wasn't aware of. My friend's spouse was very abusive towards my friend, mostly verbally. I found out that my friend had been raped by the spouse as well. I confronted my friend about it after witnessing abuse towards the child too, and finally my friend recognized the need to end the relationship and demand a divorce. We filed to have the spouse evicted. My friend did not leave as they did not have anywhere to go.  My friend refused to pursue charges, mostly out of fear of things not going well, potentially some Stockholm Syndrome or something going on. The spouse accused us of cheating, openly vilified myself and my friend, and claimed to be innocent of what we witnessed.  No formal divorce or custody agreement ever entered in due to the previously mentioned fears.  There was peace some time after the split. The spouse seemed to be stabilizing. There was an agreement to allow visitation. The spouse however not only has a child with another person now, but has also kidnapped my friend's child as well, and has made wild baseless accusations.  I have been asked to submit an affidavit to what I witnessed. I am concerned that if my involvement comes forward, that the target will be drawn to me and I may have false allegations filed against me, forcing me to return back to SC, which could potentially have a number of consequences for me outside of legal. However, if I don't submit my affidavit, it could potentially weaken or ruin my friend's case and the chances of my friend's child being returned to the parent who is actually a capable parent.	Yes
Let's say I have friend who is currently in an extremely abusive relationship to the point where it is affecting her work. I am also her supervisor. Would it be possible for me to ask for a restraining order from her boyfriend? Let's say she is in such a bad state the she cannot ask herself, is being forced not to. But me, along with a few other people see how bad it is and want to get her out. Therefore if we have several people that can attest to this, could this make a difference? Like can we make an argument that she has been abused so badly she cannot make this decision for herself? If this is not technically possible, what is my next best course of action?  Thank you for your help.	Yes
"A couple of weeks ago, my best friend was a victim of domestic battery by her boyfriend of two years. I have never liked him, but I will try to be as unbiased as I can.  Basically, she is trying to get a restraining order against him, and I don't think he can contact her. Now he's contacting me and another friend about all kinds of things. One minute he's saying that he has a voicemail of my best friend drunk claiming to ""murder him"" if he is still in contact with a coworker that he had a bit of an affair with during their relationship. He's claiming that he's going to take HER to court over that, claiming to spend all his money to lock her up ""for good"", but at the same time telling me that he loves her and only wants the best for her. That he named a ""star after her"" and doesn't want to ""give up"" on their relationship.  I screenshot some of this conversation, mostly about him trying to ""lock up"" my best friend, but I have no idea how to continue. He's been blowing up my phone with texts for the past 30 minutes. Should I keep all of these texts for evidence? Would it be useful at all? Should I block him, or let him keep sending these texts?"	Yes
Hi my dad is abusive not physically but its enough. I cannot take anymore of this and feel like doing extreme measures just to get away. I wont go into detail to derail the post. The bills of the house (water,electric,ect) come in with his name. My mom and dad share a bank account and he is the holder on it. So he has to make the decisions my mom cant.  I dont think if we ever went to the law if would be in our favor because of this. Hes a good manipulator to others. Im afraid anything will be in favor of him. Is there anything i can do? Do i have to start recording his psychotic episodes for evidence. He does not listen to anything we say ever so talking to him is not an option for he will not listen.	Yes
Someone I know had their daughter falsely accuse them of sexual abuse. She said to her mom that she was just trying to relate with her friend because her friend was talking about being abused. Her friend told the counselor at school, the girl freaked out and stuck to the story of molestation because she was scared. she was not expecting the situation to blow out of proportion. My friend's daughter is 12, she wants to fix this, what can she do?	Yes
Little backstory is important.  We obtained our green card (mom and her son (me)) through marriage with him. He has started drinking last months more and more and he is just gettibg more aggressive. We don't know what to do. This morning he threatened my mother and she was able to record it. He said he is going to her work place and drag her out and that today we will see who he really is. I'm currently in my car couple blocks to where I live and I'm scared I don't know what to do. This isn't the first time he blows up but I just can't keep it. He keeps threatening my mom since we got our greencard from him and we want to stay here ( they've been married for almost 5 years). I'm afraid to escalate but how am I supposed to sleep knowing he is living in the same place as us?    How can I protect my mom's and I's status? He keeps saying he will say the marriage was a sham (it wasn't). How hard is it to win if he does this (we do have photo evidence and many people that can probably testify).   I'm sorry This is probably not the right place to have a meltdown but I can't keep pretending this isn't happening. I know this will make it way harder for us financially(if he leaves) but at least we can sleep fine	Yes
Hi. I'm unsure what to do here. I'll try and make this brief (at work, sorry!).   My mother's boyfriend kicked my mother out of the home they've shared on Wednesday. My mother has many mental health issues (MDD and bipolar disorder). She will not be able to emotionally handle any interaction with him. So I've taken over.  I've moved her into my home and plan on getting the rest of her stuff on Saturday. This includes a washer and dryer. The issue is that the ex is claiming he is keeping it. My mother purchased this with her own money and has receipts. When I told him no, he said we will now need to give him $1,500 to repair his car that he let my mother occasionally drive. I said no.   I wouldn't put it past him to damage the washer and dryer or sue for the cost of the car he thinks she damaged. She did not. What do I do here? I'm very overwhelmed and just trying to get my mom somewhere safe.	Yes
Hello everyone. So basically what has happened is right now I am 16 and my parents honestly hate me. They are abusive and neglect my well being and have caused a lot of mental health issues for me. Anyways I plan on leaving them FOREVER the day I turn 18 and finish school...however after today I do not think that will be possible anymore.    So what happened is that they wont allow me to buy my own car so instead bought the family a truck to use in generally, they told I have to PAY THEM BACK for a fucking 60k truck. They said once I pay them back fully It will be mine to keep however there is no way in hell i will ever be able to pay them back in fucking two years. Which means after i turn 18 i still am gonna be making them payments. I never agreed to this and I need to know   If i run away after i finish school without paying them back for this truck(which i never brough and it isnt legally mine) can they do legal action against me or like take me to court...  As of my location I live in Canada in the province of Alberta.	Yes
My ex has filed a domestic violence protection act against me, asserting that I had yelled at her, but nothing further than that in the instant.  While I did yell at her for one sentence in the midst of her yelling at me, this seems rather arbitrary and there was no assertion of violence (and never has there been in the past).  I have only contacted her since to apologize for yelling and to arrange a time for her to come and get her things.  More importantly she also asserted in this that previously I had made her leave the residence which we were staying (for which I was the only one on the lease and the only one paying rent) and she had no where to go during this time.  I can document that this is not true, that I only asked her to leave for one night and that she had her own separate residence to stay in.  Also that I had assaulted her by touching her sexually while she was sleeping and could not give consent (while we were dating and having consensual sex), which is also false but of course there is no way for me to prove this.  Are there any repercussions of this?	Yes
So, my girlfriend's ex was abusive and manipulative both emotionally and monetarily.  He is now sending her unsolicited text messages and generally harassing her.  She also needs to pick up some things from his apartment.  What is the best course of action for her?	Yes
I just got a phone call from my girlfriend who is currently moving into her apartment with her mother in New York, all the information I have about the situation is through her and the accuracy may not be 100%. She received a phone call from her brother (16), who does not have his license, took their mother's car out on the highway, with multiple passengers, and caused a crash which totaled both his car and another.   From my understanding he is at fault, but all parties involved survived the accident, though I do not know the extent of any injuries.   What should they do? Would it be considered theft that he took the car without permission or supervision, with the owner halfway across the country? Depending on their insurance provider could their mother maintain her rates due to the accident being caused by someone not covered by insurance?  With a single mother putting one child through college and another going into his final year of high school, they don't have much money-mainly what is the best way to minimize financial damages? Thank you.	Yes
A couple months back I subletted a room in my apartment after my roommate needed to move out. Both the original roommate and me are on the lease, which ends August 1st. Because of the short notice, I found someone on a facebook roommate search group (I will refer to him as FR for former roommate). I spoke to the landlord, who requested an application and background check from FR, which was given to him. I asked about writing up my own sublease, but was told not to worry about it, that the landlord would prefer to write one up himself. To my knowledge he never got around to writing up the sublease.   About three weeks back, FR told me he got a temporary job in another city and would need to leave that weekend. He said he would have the rent, but would likely look for a sublet for his sublet. A couple days later he found someone (who I will refer to as NR for new roommate), who started moving in the next day. I asked FR if he had been in contact with the landlord, which he said he had. I talked to the landlord, it turned out he had not. The landlord made it clear that the NR should not have moved in without his consent, but was willing to organize getting the application from him and work it out.  NR was oblivious to all this, but when told of the situation was quick to get all necessary documents to the landlord.   The day before rent was due I organized with FR to drop off rent. I learned from NR that FR had collected rent money from him and was planning to hand it to me, so that I could give it to the landlord. FR claimed to be busy, so we organized for the next day. FR kept pushing the time back for when he’d drop off rent; I offered to pick it up, but he rejected the offer. When the landlord showed up to pick up rent, I apologized that FR had not showed up yet, to which the landlord informed me that FR told him I would be covering the rent in full. We were confused, but figured it could be a miscommunication and scheduled for the next day. At that point, I learned from NR that he had been told that the rent had already been paid. FR did not show up the next day either.   It is about a week later, and FR has made multiple excuses and has not shown up at any time he has told us that he would to drop off rent. I have asked him to send it to me via an app, but he claims that he cannot deposit the money because it is in cash and he does not have a local bank. I learned from NR that FR took $160 more than the cost of rent and insisted he give it to him in cash. It is apparent from the multiple discrepancies that FR does not plan on paying rent or returning the money that NR gave him. Luckily NR, the landlord, and I have been in full cooperation with one another, and have text messages citing the discrepancies in what FR has told us. The landlord suggested NR go to the police to file a report for the money that was taken, but the police informed us they could not do anything and this would need to be settled in civil court.  My question is what can we do about this situation? What rights do FR, NR, the landlord, and I have? I don’t have much hope for myself having any legal footing in terms of my own rights in this situation. I realize as the leaseholder, I am responsible for full rent. Unfortunately I won’t have the funds to cover the full rent until the end of the month, and will likely need to cover this with the deposit. How severely will this affect my ability to rent apartments in the future? Does NR have a case for fraud in civil court? How can the landlord and I support him in this? Also, FR has left some things in the apartment, and has attempted to get them back. What are his rights in terms of the things left behind?	Yes
"So my dad is trying to evict me, he doesn't have anything legal. He wants me to work for him, and is consistently harassing me until I do (I'm in between jobs and I'm looking for one ACTIVELY.) He was harassing me this morning in his room, yelling into mine. I went to his bedroom calmly. I asked why I have to work for him and why he is trying to take my car away (he bought it, pays for everything for the car), when I am actively looking for a job. He got angry. Shouted, charged me, and I backed up. He was pushing my hands away and spitting into my face. I backed up into my room next door, and he was still in my face arguing with me so I threw a punch and it landed. It busted his lip open. He's trying to file a police report. He took my phone and my car away from me.   This is not the first time we have had a fight. Last time I accidentally closed the door on my mom's finger during an argument, so he dragged me out of the bathroom by my hair and stomped on my back - knocking the wind out of me. The police that came searched my room for drugs, and they ultimately told my father he has every right to put his hands on me if I'm ""being disrespectful"".   So the police WILL take his side. They told me if I don't like it, get out.   He IS verbally abusive. EXTREMELY so. But he rarely fist fights with me.   How do I avoid going to jail?"	Yes
(I'm going to apologize for this wall of text, but I really need to get this out there. We need help ,and I can't find anywhere else on reddit to ask these questions.)  I'm in need of some serious help here. I'm 23 and out of the house, but I have sisters back at home. We were all adopted. To give you some back story: I have 2 other sisters, 17 and 18. They live in NJ while I'm in Ohio. Yesterday they visited and while we were alone, my 18 year old sister said she needed to speak with me. Long story short, she had confirmed my long-term suspicion: my father is a creep, and is sexually harassing her, to put it lightly. I've been *slightly* suspicious for a while now, after he made some off-handed remarks to me and a couple incidents of inappropriate touching. I gave him the benefit of the doubt with the touching; I always just assumed it was an accident when it happened. It turns out that he had been making the very same comments to her, only it and the touching has gotten more extreme to the point where she is petrified of being alone with him in the house.   That being said, my obvious first reaction is to get her out of the house. I have an apartment with my SO and we are both willing to have her here. Getting her here isn't too much of an issue. We do have a problem though: her bank account. I don't remember the details, but she said that the *only* way she is able to withdraw money is with our parents present until she's 21. We're afraid that, since dad has control over the account, he will withdraw all of her money. Yes, he would do that to her. Is there any way around that policy? Can we talk to the bank and explain the situation and can they make an exception based off that? Also, since she is 18, there obviously isn't a problem with where she goes. But like I said before, my other sister is 17. If I got her out of the house and dad got angry, could I be arrested for kidnapping? I just want all my bases covered.   And here's a second thing: what do we do about HIM? My sister has done what she can, I think. She has contacted the police on a few ocassions. They brought him in for questioning, but nothing came of it. The problem is that our father uses his clout of being an ex-police officer of 20 years to get him by in this situation. It doesn't help that my sister has had a habit of over reactions and exaggerations (this is obviously not one of them). It seems that local law enforcement will do nothing major for her now. There's also the fact that she's tried to bring this up to our mother. As I said in the title, no one, not even our mother, believes her. Dad is smart, and always makes sure that his creepiness can be masked to look like something completely innocent. Understandably, mom has always given him the benefit of the doubt (along with everyone else), despite warning signs that even she is aware of (ex: dad sometimes watches things like documentaries of crimes of women being raped (seriously dad, what the fuck). Mom tells him repeatedly to turn those things off. She doesn't seem to put 2 and 2 together). That being said...what the hell am I supposed to do about this? Is there nothing that can be done? Will he never be punished for this?  This is how it's starting to look to me, and I can't believe it.   If anyone has any answers, or even just advice, please tell me. I'm coming to my wit's end.	Yes
I am 17. I live in California. I often wear a large butt plug to school because it feels good. A teacher found out I do this, gave me detention, and threatened to call my parents. I did nothing wrong. What do I do?	No
"Hi guys, this is my first time on Reddit but I figure if there's one place that I can get some answers without hiring a lawyer, it'd be here. So to start out I am a small time YouTuber looking to use viral videos in my channel in the context of ""Videos of the Week"". I contacted the publisher of this video 'Jukin Media' in hopes in receiving permission to use a specific viral video. However they told me it would be $1000 just to be able to publish in my video. So the most logical thing is I obviously cannot use it unless I am willing to pay them. However, I have seen this video all over the place, and I know for a fact that these channels did not get permission from Jukin. Also, YouTube has contentid which puts your video through a system that allows publishers to put claims on your work for using certain works in your videos. It also does not allow you to monetize. I would be fine with not being able to monetize and all of that, I just want to use the video. However I do not want to get a copyright strike when I post it or in the future. Am I legally allowed to post this video and just let the ContentId catch it, which would allow Jukin to monetize on my behalf, or am I violating copyright rules? Thank you"	No
Hi I have some confusion regarding a leasing situation. Ill start with some background info before getting into the details. I signed a 1 year lease with an LLC, in 2015 from august 1st to July 31st. I renewed the lease last year for another year ending July 31st 2017. I sent an email with my notice to terminate the lease on May  2017. Now this is were the issue comes in to play. Last night my roommate sent an email to the landlord with a few general questions about deposit and other moving out related things. She replied that she had no idea that we were moving out and has started with demands that we need to pay rent for august and September.  Now some details from this point on I will refer to the landlord as B and my roommate as J. In 2016 B emailed us a lease renewal document on the June 1st, it had 2 options a check box to renew the lease or a box to terminate lease and vacate at end of the contract. It had a due date of June 5th. Because of this i thought that we needed to provide 60 days notice of intent to terminate the lease. Fast forward to May. After discusions with my gf and J I decided that i would not be renewing the lease. To give B plenty of notice, I sent the email stating my intent to terminate the lease on May 10th, 2017. The email was written as follows:  subject re Tractor   Hi B, I was wondering if you had an update on the mower? I would also like to inform you that I will not be renewing the lease. I met a wonderful women and I will be moving in with her. Last I checked J did not have plans to renew please double check with him.   Regards,  Now I know the email was received and opened on the same day because B replied with an update on the mower. So i assumed she read the whole email since it was 4 sentences. I forwarded that email to B showing her that i did provided notice. upon receiving that email B changed her demands from Aug and Sept rent to that the lease states the tenant must provide 90 days notice and that the lease automatically renewed.  this is what the lease states about renewal: 22. LEASE RENEWAL: A. At the end of this Lease Agreement, Tenant shall have the option to renew the Lease for an additional term that is equal to the initial term of this lease (Term of Lease Agreement) pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein.  B. If Tenant or Landlord does not wish to renew the Lease, written notice must be given to the other party at least 90 days before the end of the term (Term of Lease Agreement) to terminate the Lease (including any exercised renewal or extension thereof).  I understand that I only provided 82 days of notice.  Finally to my questions. Does the section of the lease above actually automatically renew? i understand that it gives me the option to renew and states how to go about terminating the lease but never mentions auto renewal. Since she only required 60 days last year and never sent a renewal email this year do I have some kind of case based on confusion and lack of notification from the Landlord? What should i do and expect from here?  Thanks for your time and advise	No
Hi. I am from Northern New Jersey. I am in need of some advice and was wondering if the helpful people of this subreddit can provide some. Throwaway being used for anonymity. A couple of days ago, I received a check from the Federal Trade Commission because they settled with DeVry in a 100 million dollar settlement. After doing hours of research and spending hours on the phone with government student loan help lines I am lost. I want to know a few things. Does cashing this check stop me from filing a lawsuit against DeVry? Also, I still owe around $60,000 in Student Loans, with this settlement anyone with Private Student loans are being refunded but people like me who took out Federal Student Loans are left to seek out other means of refund. One suggestion from the FTC was filing for the  Department of Education's Borrower Defense to Repayment program. Should I do this before seeing an attorney? I am afraid that if Betsy DeVos gets her way she will get rid of this program before it can help me out. Any advice? Please and thank you.	No
I'm a mother of a super awesome three year old girl. I married my husband one year ago.   My daughter's biological father was abusive and an alcoholic throughout our entire relationship.  I have been her sole caregiver since birth, but for nearly a year I did allow supervised visitation 2 days a week.  During that time, he lived with his mother, and by her own admission, she provided care(meals, baths, etc) during his visitation.    He has never held a job longer than 6 months.  Recently, he was arrested for possession of methamphetamine and other various drug related charges.  He is currently in drug court, is unemployed, and seems to be completely spiraling out.  Prior to his meth spiral, all visitation was facilitated through his sister, who is a social worker. I went no contact with him because his verbal abuse persists regardless of our relationship status.  Three months ago, his sister refused to facilitate any type of visitation with our daughter because he insisted we allow him to take her to his girlfriend's house overnight.  His girlfriend is a meth addict, covered in fresh track marks who lost her own children because of drug addiction and neglect.  Even if her bio dad DID beat his addiction issues (he won't, but hypothetically) he will still be inconsistent, verbally abusive and dangerous to my bubbly baby girl if he ever has access to her alone.   I was lucky to marry a man nothing like her bio father. He is absolutely the best thing that has ever happened to us. He's involved in every aspect of her upbringing, responsible, and brings peace and consistency to both our lives.  He and my daughter are the best of friends. She's nuts over him. She's a mommy's girl, but if she cant have me, she chooses my husband (even over her grandparents that spoil her to pieces). She deserves this father. She does not deserve a lifetime of inconsistent, likely very psychologically damaging and physically dangerous situations her bio father will put her in if given the chance.  How do we begin the process of terminating bio dad's rights/step-parent adoption?  What proof is needed in the event bio dad contests termination of rights?	No
"We are currently in an apartment through a rental company in Iowa. A few months ago we decided to move to a larger property through the same company, we decided on a new unit and we excited to move. A few weeks go by and we see there was not much progress on the new unit so we went in and asked if our original move ind date was still okay (August 1st). We had already signed a lease for this property to move in on the 1st, but it simply wasn't going to happen.   We then decided on a new unit that was to be done on August 1st, and signed a lease for that. All was good until we went to set up our utilities like a good tenant would, and we couldn't because the water and the electric company had not had any work orders done to install meters.   We then went into our rental office and asked if we were still able to move in on the 1st (at this time it was late July about a week before we were supposed to move). They had not contacted us and told us anything so we assumed we were good to move on August 1st. We went into the office and they stated ""the property will not be done until the 14th"" so here we are now on the 9th expecting to move there on Monday. We went in AGAIN And they stated we do not have it done and we have no idea when it will be done. You can't move until we get it done. Here is where our issue is, we have a new lease signed for the 1st of August and we still do not live there.   The main guy that runs said company basically told me to stop coming in and asking about it and they will tell us when it is done. They have made no efforts to contact us in any way and the only way we get updates is to go in and ask.  NOW.. what is our standing in this situation. We have a contract stating ""The duration of this Rental Agreement shall be for a term beginning at 12:00 pm on the 08/01/2017, and continuing until 6:00 pm on 07/24/2018.""  They have basically told us to screw off and here we are with new furniture ready to be delivered, a u haul reserved, and everything ready to go. Except the house.   What are our options here? We feel as though we are being taken advantage of."	No
In the U.K. If a minor runs away from home (due to bad parenting) can they face any kind of charges (so long as no laws are broken) and also, if they stop at a friends house and the friend doesn't tell the authorities can they face charges too?	No
"I recently moved out of a house where I lived with the landlord. My other roommate moved out on the same day. The landlord looked over her room, said all was good, and paid her the security deposit in cash.  I had to wait for my landlord to take a phone call before she was able to check me out, which was fine because I wanted to do some last minute spot cleaning (wasn't necessary, but I like to leave things nice). After reviewing my room, she said that everything looked great and asked me for my Paypal information. She said she didn't have anymore cash and asked if Paypal was fine. I agreed.  I asked her if we could go ahead and make the transfer that night so I didn't have to worry about it and she followed up with a strong ""No."" and said she would be waiting for 30-90 days to refund my security deposit. I asked why she was doing that after just paying my other roommate in cash.  Her response was that her Ex's lawyer had contacted her lawyer to inform them that a ""friend of mine"" had contacted them and offered to stand as a witness against her character and also that I engaged in illegal activities in the home making it unsafe for their child to visit.  She currently has supervised visitation of the child and is fighting a kidnapping case (charged with kidnapping her own child). I was completely taken back because besides hearing her vent about the custody battle, I know very little details about the case and did not know she had a pending felony when I moved in.  She told me that she was holding onto my deposit for the maximum legally allowed time to deter me from testifying against her in her custody battle. A friend of mine that was helping clean the house was in the room when she said this, as well as the locksmith she hired to change the locks as we were checking out (I got his information after this happened).  This seems really really crazy to me and I'm not sure what to do. I never got involved in this case, never even thought about getting involved, and don't want to spend any more time dealing with this person, I just want my deposit back. I don't know who the person is that they have to testify that I make the house unfit for visitation, or if that is even a real possibility.  In Texas, the only laws I can see about deposit refunding is that the landlord has 30 days to return it.  What should I do? Just wait out the 30 days and hope it gets refunded?  Thank you for taking the time to read!"	No
"First off, this is in California. Here's the issue: we moved into our current apartment about 6 months ago. There were no signs of bed bugs and we did not have bed bugs. 6 months later we begin to find bed bugs and we contact our property manager. They inform us the owner will not be paying for treatment and it is our responsibility because he replaced carpets before we moved in. I've been doing lots of reading/research and I can't get a definitive answer on who is truly responsible for the treatment cost. Anyways, couple days later the landlord has a exterminator come out to inspect. Before he even looks around, he tells us ""the bugs came from your neighbor next door. She's had them for a long time and doesn't want to pay for treatment. She wants me to look inside but I'm not going it. It's pointless. I know she still has the bugs."" So now we know where they originated. Here's the part where it gets tricky. We signed a bed bug addendum when we moved in basically saying we understand the landlord believes there to be no bugs and we will not hold him financially responsible for treatment. Does that still hold up if we signed it under the impression there were none when the owners knew that there were? I want the place treated either way, but can the landlord hit us with the bill for treatment if it is known that they didn't originate with us? Do we need to go after the neighbor for the cost? Sorry for the long post, just trying to find answers before I start raising serious hell."	No
New York here.   I sublet my apartment to someone for one month, and he signed an addendum on my original lease contract but there'sis no mention of the duration or price for him.  Two weeks into the lease, he tells me he wants to move out early and asked me if he could have the remaining rent back. It's a pretty small amount (Under $300), but still I see no reason why I should refund part of someone's rent just because they changed their mind halfway through the lease.  Anyways, he moved out and I returned his deposit promptly, but decided not to refund his remaining month of rent. According to him, I verbally agreed to refund his rent and now owe him the amount for the time he didn't stay. He says that he will sue me, and has sent me pictures of the small claims file (unfilled). He has repeatedly sent me venmo requests for the rent, telling me I owe him money, and that I agreed to refund his remainder.  Since I have not budged, he has steadily been decreasing the amount of money he is requesting but continues to persist.    There is no written agreement that I will refund him his remaining rent after he moves out. According to him, his girlfriend will back him up on me verbally agreeing to him that I'll refund it after he moves out.  My question is:  If he files to the small claims court, what will be the next steps? I'll have to show up no matter what. I am out of state for the summer and travelling back to NY will be a medium inconvenience, to the point that I'd rather send him the money than to travel back and miss work.  EVEN IF I did verbally agree to refund him his rent, but I didn't sign anything, is that legally binding?  I find this case absolutely ridiculous. Regardless, it'll be him and his girlfriend claiming that I agreed to refund his rent when he moved out early. There is absolutely no incentive for me to do so, since I'd be practically giving him money for service/contract already agreed upon.  Does he have a case here at all? What should be the next steps? I'm not going to get a lawyer for something this small, and I believe that they're not recommended in small claims either.  Thanks in advance.	No
I bought my house with a substantial down payment from my mother. Part of the contingency to that was she was on the deed. So we are joint tenants even though she doesn't live here or even in state. I was not married at the time. I now am and we have two daughters together. My mother is borderline psychotic and I am concerned that if something happens to me before her she will kick out my husband and daughters from our family home.   Can a will override the entire property going to her?  What about her will to her husband if she passes and her will states all her real property pass to him will he inherit half of my home?   What options do I have?	No
About 20 years ago I divorced my husband. Since I was a stay at home mom during our marriage I was awarded the equivalent half of his retirement for the years we were married. The stipulation was I couldn't cash it in until I reached retirement age. Well that age is approaching in 2 weeks, so I would like to start the process, but I have no idea where to start. I no longer live in the same state as he does and cannot find a copy of the original divorce decree.	No
I have a roommate that is not on the lease and has caused damage in the room. I walked into his room the yesterday to take photos because he should be vacating by the 31st of July. I found a large hole in the bathroom and some other minor damage. I took photos and sent them to him asking if he can pay for the damages before leaving. He said he called the cops because my photo proves I was breaking and entering and he will have me arrested if I press for him to pay for damages. He also claims the cops told him he has the right to arrest me and have filed a report if he chooses to press charges.   There is no written agreement that he is part of the lease, and the apartment is solely in my name. I only went in to take photographs. My career is in serious risk if I am arrested for breaking and entering, and I need to know if he is bluffing or serious.  I have agreed to back off since he is essentially blackmailing me because he knows I have a lot to lose if I am arrested.   Thank you for your time and consideration.	No
So my situation is this, my family ( me my wife my 5yr old 3yr old and 10 month old) were renting a house with no signed lease whatsoever. Numerous issues came up with home, downed rain gutters, broken retraining wall off porch and mainly squirrels living in ceiling all of which landlord did not fix. Ssooo I decided to pack up and leave without giving him any notice and now today he showed up at my job demanding to talk to me. Is there any legal recourse he can take???And if he continues to come to my work is that grounds for harassment??	No
Apologies in advance for the lengthy post, this situation has spanned across a number of months now.   I live on a private road in the UK, so it is maintained by the residents not the council. The road's only l wide enough for one car at a time and has a strip of trees/bushes about 3 feet wide on the right hand side as you drive in, which has been maintained by the restidents of my road for 16 years, myself included.   https://imgur.com/a/W7gwi  Here's two pictures from google maps for a visual - the red arrow shows the direction from which the street view photo is taken, the blue zone is the land in question.   Around 9 months ago a man (who I will now refer to as 'Brad') moved into the house on the corner of my road (yellow X) and in March he had ordered a gardening firm to cut down this shrubbery down so he could expand his garden. The firm were promptly shooed away by a member of my road and Brad informed that this is not his to cut down.   A month later at approximately 10am on a Monday, when the majority of the members of my road had already gone to work, one of the mums in the road, dropping her kids to school, returned to find a gardening firm cutting the trees down with only non-electric hand tools in order to avoid unwanted attention. I ran out and half the shrubbery was already gone. A shouting match ensued between myself and other members of my road, the gardening firm, and Brad's mother. Brad was in the house however did not want to come out becasue there was too much confrontation. His mother belonged on a leash however and barked at the gardeners to continue doing their job, in front of us residents, or they would not get paid. The police were called and advised that from a legal perspective the land is unowned and unclaimed at this time. A person must maintain unowned land for a minimum of 12 years until they can make a claim for ownership - we as a road surpassed this minimum 4 years ago, however no claim for ownership was made. Because of this, Brad was within his rights to file a claim with reasoning as to why he should be given ownership, however until this time he is free to make changes to the land as he wishes. The police said there is nothing that can be done at this time, it will have to be handled in a court. We proceeded to watch the gardeners tear down these trees that have been part of our road since before I was born, and home to families of foxes and badgers.   But the fight was not over yet, this was just the beginning!   During the argument when these gardeners were first discovered, Brad's mother had mentioned that they had a fencing firm booked in to fence the land the following day so the trees had to be gone. However the road would not let this happen! Once the trees were gone, myself and the residents of my road parked our cars on the land to prevent any fences being erected and, fortunately for us, one of my neighbours has a good friend that owns a fencing firm. He called in a favour and at 7am the next day, a fence was put up around the land in our name. Signs were placed all across the fence stating 'PROPERTY OF CCFILMFAN, 99 xxxx ROAD' and CCTV installed opposite. Brad called the police - they arrived to tell him that he cant touch the fence because as it was installed as an extension of an already existing fence owned by a member of the road, any damage would now be vandalising someone elses property.   And so the war was seemingly over. Until last night.   Here in the south of the UK we were hit by viscious storms last night, and at 3am during the brutal rain, thunder and lightening, a fencing firm were putting up a metal fence on the INSIDE of our already existing fence, including 'CCTV In operation' signs, and a pole with CCTV cameras. The police were called once more and as far as I am aware at this time, they didn't want any involvement and left with no action.   So here I am now, writing this post - hoping someone out there has knowledge in admittedly very precise domestic law in the UK.   My questions are do I have any grounds to remove this metal fence? What can I do to stop this happening again? Have they broken the law by putting this fence there in the first place? And what are the consequences of this?  Any input on this would be appreciated, or if I've missed anything and you have questions please feel free to ask.  Thanks	No
"My boyfriend and I rent a house directly from the homeowner. He always argues with us about the necessity of any requests we make for repairs or maintenance, so I've started emailing him lists of things we need addressed just to have it documented in writing. In these communications, I have tried to be as cooperative, polite, respectful, reasonable, and understanding as possible. He refuses to respond in writing and will call instead, making promises that he later claims he never said (I suspect this is why he does not respond in writing).   Last week, he sent some employees to replace our broken fridge and remove a broken window unit AC.  The next day, he came to the house with one of those same employees to look at some other problems.   He and I were talking about some of the items in my latest email, and he began getting angry and increasingly loud with me. He is upset that we ""complain about every little thing."" I remained calm and did not raise my voice, but I did respond to some of his accusations and complaints. At one point, I said, ""Please do not yell at me.""   My boyfriend heard the argument (just him yelling, since he wouldn't really let me speak) and came into the room to ask him not to speak to me in that manner. He also said, ""What's the problem here?""  Landlord turned his anger onto my boyfriend in an even louder, more aggressive tone. He accused my boyfriend of being on drugs the day before (something the employees he sent out must have said). Not true at all - he works second shift and had just woken up. The employee present this day came into the room at that point and stood behind my boyfriend. This was in a small, enclosed space, where the landlord and his employee had my boyfriend effectively trapped. The landlord started waving his fists around and threatening to fight my boyfriend.  Boyfriend managed to get out of that room and went to the bedroom in an attempt to walk away from the situation. Both men followed him and also trapped him there, still yelling and threatening.   We are considering filing a police report just in case anything like this were to happen again in the future, but also fear that may make the situation worse. I know he would not be notified unless a warrant was signed, but we live in a small town, so that's not always a guarantee.   I'd really appreciate any advice or feedback you guys may have on whether we ought to pursue this, since we now don't feel particularly safe around him and definitely don't feel as though we can ever mention another maintenance problem. Thank you."	No
"First off, I know that placing a ""No Trespassing"" sign directly facing someone's yard (it's visible from our living room windows) is very passive-aggressive and screams that we've had some sort of neighborly feud. However, we have not. We do not even know who owns the land behind our yard and thus placed the sign.  To give a better picture, the wooded area behind our back yard goes on for about two acres. In winter, when there are no leaves, you can barely see a small house at the top of a hill, if you know where to look. From that house, I imagine, our back yard is pretty clear to see (only in winter; in summer, it's impossible to see 10 feet ahead of you). It seems reasonable that a new neighbor moved into that area beyond the woods and walked through to our backyard to post the sign. However, I know that is not the case.  The woods used to belong to a farmer that I worked for in middle school/high school. He was very kind and as he did not use the land for anything, he did not mind if the neighborhood kids played on it. Anyway, we know he sold the wooded land behind our backyard to someone, (he divided his land into much smaller parcels and sold them to people who wanted to build their own homes) but we do not know who bought the woods that touch our land.  I know that this new neighbor trespassed to place the eyesore of a sign because there is an impossibly deep ravine/creek that divides the woods. It is impossible to cross, both because it is wide and the water is deep. I'm not sure where it begins or ends, but there is nowhere to cross near our backyard or our neighbors' backyards. The person had to have driven to our house, walked through our back yard, and posted the sign. Once again, I'm not sure why they picked our house. There are other yards adjacent to the woods, and we never go in the woods (I stopped going into the woods maybe 5 or 6 years ago), but I suppose they think that we do.  I hate to mention this, but the only possibility I can think of is that it is racially motivated. There are only two black families in my small town, and we are one of them. None of my other neighbors touching the woods got signs in their yards.  My questions are as follows:  1) How do I find out who owns the property now? The farmer moved away and I don't have his contact info, so I can't find out that way. 2) If I cannot find this neighbor and ask them to take the sign down, is there anything else we can do legally?  Thank you in advance."	No
New York here. Ill just state the whole situation, so on July 3rd, officer caught me &amp; friend urinating behind a car by the beach (no bathrooms nearby). We talk to him at the car and asks us for our ID, I stupidly give him my fake ID name as i am under  the legal drinking age. He starts to type in info and i realize how stupid that was so i give him my real info. Officer cuffs me &amp; pats me down (was never read rights?) and driven back to station . I was charged with PL 245.01 (exposure of a person), was told likely an ACD for ~6mo.  Just a few questions, is it recommended to get a lawyer for this or is it something i could handle? i only ask because in my position a lawyer would be hard to afford. Am i entitled to a court appointed defender/lawyer or anything of the sorts? also if the only charge was the exposure of a person is a judge able to see anything reguarding the fake ID.  Any help is appreciated &amp; sorry for the wall of text guys, just bugging out seeing as my court date is the 17th and trying to figure out what the next move is.	No
My ex and I have 50/50 custody. We both have to agree on anything related to education or else take it to mediation. Our kids go to private school. He has remarried and now has 2 step kids. He recently was fired. Our divorce paperwork stipulates that our children will attend X school. He said he cannot afford to send them there since he lost his job. I told him I would pay for X school. He said no and that he intends to enroll them in school in his district regardless of what the court order says. He said he wants both our kids and his step kids in the same school, and since he can't afford tuition for step kids, all of the children will go to the school in his district. Can he be held in contempt? Will a judge allow them to be pulled out of X school to keep our kids in the same school as his step kids? HELP!	No
y friend has been caught driving on a suspended license 7 times so when she got pulled over this time, she gave my name because she didn't mine is suspended as well. They didn't check for an ID so she got me a couple of tickets and now I have to go to court. I don't want to get her in trouble for driving on a suspended and giving false information but I don't want to go to court and have the officer recognize that I'm not the woman he pulled over and get myself in trouble either. I have no idea what to do.	No
Earlier this year, my ex husband stole money from me ($600 to be exact). We were still going through the divorce when he took the money. We ended up going to mediation for the divorce, and the money he stole was put in the mediation papers. Those papers later went into the judgement of divorce. The divorce was finalized a month ago, so now he legally has to pay me back. The agreement in the papers was for him to pay me back within 90 days of the date of mediation, which was back in April. He is refusing to pay. What should I do? Should I go through small claims?	No
My wife and I are planning to move. We have signed a listing agreement with an agent to list our house after it's fixed up for sale, and fixing it up will require us to move to a rental. After it's fixed up, if the market tanks or it doesn't look like we will find anything we like, and we decide not to sell and move back in, what rights does the agent have to some payment or performance? I assume that she would not be able to force us to perform (actually sell the house), but I'm wondering if she could force us to pay her the commission she's not getting (I wouldn't mind giving her something for her trouble, but I wouldn't want to have to pay her the entire commission).	No
"I want to make this short so people will read this and give me advice, cause I've never been in this much trouble before.  I'm a 19 y/o male college student, and I was arrested a week ago while sitting in my car in a neighborhood near my house (I was alone). Cops searched my car and found my mason jar, which contained:  - ~14 grams of marijuana (in two different bags)  - A pea-sized amount of wax (hashish), with a paperclip  - A grinder  - 3 packs of rolling papers  - A small bag of tobacco  - A paintbrush that smelled of marijuana (I used it to clean my grinder)  I stupidly lied to my arresting officer when he initially asked if I had drugs in the car, they searched my car with probable cause, and after that I was cooperative. The cop asked ""why did you lie to me?"" then said ""Nevermind you don't have to answer that"" so I never admitted to having knowledge of the marijuana (not that it matters.. I was my car).  Also, I had not been smoking that day, and the officers knew that (they let me drive my car home after they booked me), so DUI isn't an issue.  I was charged with a misdemeanor. I have already hired a lawyer, and he contacted my arresting officer, and the officer agreed to bring it down to a disorderly conduct. But, my lawyer said I was going to have trouble getting the District Attorney to agree to that due to the amount and the wax/rolling papers.  Any advice or sympathy would be much appreciated, this is my first brush with the law and it's really scary. Thank you in advance!!"	No
A friend of mine recently married a man who had a rather questionable past with the ladies. To my knowledge, he's never had any run-ins with the law, but he has 7 children from 3 or 4 different women.   It genuinely seems that he is maturing and wants to develop a relationship with all of his children.   He has a child from a one-night stand who is 9. A paternity test was done when she was an infant and he has been paying child support since then.   He doesn't have a relationship with the child though. As I have been told (for whatever that's worth), the mother won't allow him to see the child unless it's just the three of them (mother, father, child). She has a history of only wanting him around when he is single. When he is with someone, she won't allow him to see the child unless the 3 of them go out (very reminiscent of a forced date), and she will not allow him to bring any of his other children or his wife.   He doesn't really have a relationship with his daughter, and the mother refuses to let him introduce the girl to her siblings.   For awhile he just threw his hands up, and said whatever. Now that he's married, and really focusing on his family, he's upset that his daughter isn't a part of that, but he is also not sure how to approach this, as he's not had a real presence for the greater part of the 9 years she's been on this earth.   What are his options? What is the best way to proceed? And what obstacles will he likely face, given the lack of relationship?  Thank you in advance. I genuinely appreciate this sub, and all you offer.	No
I'm not actually involved in this, but people from my university are posting online asking questions and for advice.   A new apartment complex has been under construction and was offering tours in the spring. They leased out rooms telling people they would be ready to move in by September 2nd. A friend of mine actually toured the place and asked what would happen if the building wasn't completed yet and was simply told that it would be and was brushed off.   Tenants received an email today stating they won't be ready by the move in date and have two options: they can either delay their lease to December 29 and receive $1500, or cancel their lease outright. Either way the tenants need to suddenly find new housing fast.   This is in Minneapolis, MN, and I was just wondering what the policy on something like this might be. Can the owners really lease out rooms that aren't built yet and fail to provide by the move in date?	No
"I rented a house on the 5th of July, just myself and my 4 year old son. Prior to me moving in, the landlord informed me of a ""bunker"" that is in the middle of the backyard. She locked the door of the bunker with with a pad lock and told me she did that so nobody gets hurt. I never opened the door of the bunker till 3 days later, when my buddy was helping me move in, the other side of the door was broken and he opened it. I seen stairs that go down about 10 feet, and was led to a very creepy room. I was never told about there being a room down there, she (landlord) made it sound like there is just a ""hole"" down there. Apparently they used these things during the war? I don't​ know much about them, and I don't care to learn. My question is, the rental agreement does not state anything about the room in the ground, or the bunker itself. What are my loopholes to getting out of this lease and getting my money back? I paid first months rent and security deposit. I left the house on the 9th of July, cause I was very worried about my son going down there when I'm sleeping or at work. The landlord told me to leave, but she will charge me $55 per day till she rents it out to someone else, then she will give me some money back, and if she don't rent the house out by the first of August, I have to pay another rent, even though I'm not living there. Sorry for the long post. Need help! Thanks."	No
Oklahoma is the place.   So, friends of mine are dealing with their mothers death. She passed last week. They are pretty sure that their parents were not divorced but have been separated only for 20+ years.   The father(or widower) might be married to someone in another state for around the same time of the separation to now. He is also starting to try and call the shots on many things with the estate.   Anyone have any advice on what they should expect? This is confusing me to no end but I'm not a lawyer.	No
Hi everyone! I'm in a apartment building in Massachusetts and hoping to be able to break our lease.   My main question is this - technically the CURRENT lease ends Aug 31, however our unit makes us resign our lease in April (3 months ago) for the following year if we plan on staying. Is it possible that since the active lease ends Aug 31 we have a chance of cancelling the lease we signed that doesn't start until Sep 1st?  Thank you for all of your help!!!	No
So, I am dealing with a wife who is emotionally and physically abusive towards me. She will start yelling about a very minor issue and it can quickly turn to her breaking things, assaulting me, and destroying our personal property. She has gone as far as threatening to kill me at times. Once, it was over me telling her that we had to wait a couple days until I got paid to buy her some new make-up.  If I divorce my wife of less than three years, what generally happens as far as paying her any kind of support? I work and bring in our primary source of income. She receives a little bit of Social Security Disability every month for mental health issues (schizophrenia, paranoia, anxiety, and depression). We have no children together, but she has a twenty year old daughter who has never lived with us. My was previously married for 20 years. This is my first marriage. There is a considerable age gap between us. I am 26 and she is 43. We live in an apartment, have two older vehicles with no payments on them, but we are $18,000 in debt. I have no problem taking on the debt to avoid spousal support.  Is it okay for me to set up a hidden camera in the living room of our apartment that can record video and audio? I want to do this for a couple of reasons. First, I want to be able to press charges if she physically attacks me again and because of the way males are treated differently in domestic violence investigations, I want to have clear cut proof of innocence. Second, a personal protection order seems in order if I can document her threatening my life again. Basically, I need evidence for legal purposes. If I can set up the camera, would I have to tell her about the camera?  Disclaimer: I am not asking these questions to avoid a lawyer or chicken out of a divorce if it looks rough. Rather, I ask them because I want an honest opinion from someone who isn't trying to sell me their services. This will better help me prepare myself financially and mentally.   Extra details: I need to do this, and I know it will hurt, but it has to be done. She has refused all attempts to address the issues as a couple. She even shot down marriage counseling, which is provided completely free by my health insurance. No matter what she does or destroys, it's always my fault according to her. I will feel guilty for kicking her to the curb so to speak, but she refuses to get help. I cannot even spend time with friends or family unless I sneak out to see them because she will lash out at them for seemingly no reason as well. This is not at all healthy. 70% of the time, she is a good wife. Cooks, cleans, and takes care of everything at home. The other 30% is toxic. The problem is, you never know what will make her blow up and when it will happen.	No
I'm asking this question for my boyfriend. Several years ago through a one night stand my boyfriend got a girl pregnant. About two years ago he found out it was his and has been paying child support since, but has not had or wanted any interaction or custody. The mother was fine with this arrangement and would still be. However, it turns out she has a pretty serious drug problem. The child has been taken from her and dcyf is demanding that my boyfriend take custody. He does not have the means or the ability or the inclination to care for this child. If it were up to him he would give the child up for adoption. He works full time and is about to start going back to school. But they say he has to or neglect charges will follow. I'm hoping somebody here can tell me what his options might be from this point and what possible consequences could come from those actions. Should he bother with a lawyer (We don't really have the money, but could probably fit it on a credit card)? The mother is being given a year to get right before having her rights terminated. The child is currently in foster care	No
"I received a citation on Northern Cheyenne tribal land in Montana (WA resident), on US 212. [48 in a 45](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg). I don't want to give these people any money, but I also don't want a mark on my credit.   She claimed I was going 49 in a 40. Then when she came back with the ticket, it was 48 in a 40. I said it was 45 mph zone. She changed the speed zone to 45 (as you can see on [the front](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg)) and said ""there I changed the zone, but it doesn't matter, you were still speeding"" I said the speed zone is what it is, which is 45 and why would she think she can change it on the ticket if she was insisting it was 40. She shrugged. Normally when a cop gives you ""a break"" they lower the observed speed, not raise the zone. Odd.   She then got a big fake smile on her face and said **""you haven't even heard the good news!. Since this is tribal land, this doesn't go on your record, isn't reported to your insurance, and the *fee* is only around $25!""**  I asked ""And how do I pay this fee? Is there a website or something"" After she laughed about how they are in the middle of MT, they don't have online payments, she flipped the paper over and showed me [the back](https://i.imgur.com/7kBRC5h.jpg).   She said **""call this number at the bottom (I covered in black for privacy) and give them your citation number and your name. They will tell you how much the fee is, it should be around $25, and tell you where and how to send it in.""** I asked what happens if I don't pay, and she said they will send it to collections. I said ""I think I know how this will play out, I will end up paying this, and you guys will still send this to collections anyway."" she shrugged and gave me a ""what ya gonna do about it"" look.  She then said, while laughing, ""if you want to fight this, you will have to come all the way back here and im sure you dont want to do that. It's only $25, just pay it. It's not a big deal for you. It doesn't go on your record. Your insurance wont know. Just pay it."" I was about to tell her I will pay her right there and then if she rips it all up and lets me go. But I didn't.   This all seemed very sketchy to me.   I asked for her calibration records and she claimed she could not show them to me as they have personal information in them. She did have me lean into her truck, over passenger seat to see her radar system readout. It did say 48. I asked for the time this reading was taken, she said there is no time. I asked what the consequences are if I do not sign, she said ""nothing"". I told her I can not sign this citation and she wrote ""refuse to sign"".   If you look at the [back of the citation](https://i.imgur.com/7kBRC5h.jpg), it specifically says ""Send a **money order** in **the envelope provided** for the **amount of the fine** listed on the citation."" There was no envelope, which I assume has the address I should send this to, and there is no fee amount listed anywhere on [the front](https://i.imgur.com/0977fSS.jpg). When I see the words ""money order"", it screams scam to me.   From what I have read, tribal police have no jurisdiction over non-tribal people except to detain you for a state or federal officer to arrive. So this citation is pretty odd to me...**does this mean that any person can issue citations to anyone, demand a payment, and if they don't pay, send to collections?** If only a portion of those people pay, you can make a good bit of money...which is what I think is going on here.   I have spent far more than $25 thinking about this and typing this out. *I don't want to give these people a dime for something so shady.* But I also do not want the headache of a collections agency going after me. I am hoping that someone has experience with tickets on this specific tribal land and can tell me if they do in fact send these to collections. I also want future people to be able to search for this story and have something to take away from it, because I could not find anything myself that satisfied me when googling around. This has already been a huge waste of my time and I don't want others to waste theirs. I am leaning towards just paying it so any doubt about it being sent to collections is moot. If I do not pay this, I am not sure how a collections agency would find me. Perhaps they can just search my name at the credit reporting agencies and send a letter to my current address that is on file with them? If they can not find me, perhaps that makes the situation worse and it goes right on my report without having a chance to send a letter demanding proof of debt.   Some additional facts:  * I have not contacted them yet. * They don't have my current address, as my state doesn't require me to get a new license with an address change. And she did not ask me for my current address. * They don't have my phone number  * They DO have the license plate number of my out of state vehicle. Which is registered to me. * I have experience with a small amount of $20 going to collections, where a shady newspaper guy signed me up for a year subscription of the local paper which I never paid the renewal for. This was for $20, and I sent in a certified letter to the collections agency and demanded proof of the valid debt. Nothing came of it. * I do not know when this is due and they would send to collections. But it has been 31 days since the citation and 16 days since the court date. * My dash cam does in fact indicate I was going 48 in 45. I reviewed this footage later. There are no landmarks near the road for me to get a VASCAR-like computation via google maps to check if my camera and her radar system were accurate. But if they are both the same, they are likely correct. My dashcam has the mic disabled, so no audio of the conversation was recorded. * Their [fee schedule](https://i.imgur.com/sOgNziM.png) on their website indicates a civil complaint would be $25   **Are the chances of a mark on my credit low enough that I can get away with not paying this?**   **Can any one just give out citations and demand payment and send to collections?**   https://imgur.com/a/fi7w6"	No
Tl;dr: booked hotel, they upped reservation price after the fact. called bank to reject the charge and now hotel is threatening legal action and am just wondering if they have the right to do that.  I was looking for a place to stay for a few days in NYC and had stumbled on this hotel. Thinking it was okay for the price I had booked a reservation to stay only to find out the price that I had booked it for was later raised and I was charged for it. When i called to try to cancel the reservation they had said there would be a cancellation fee equal to the booking cost, which had already been charged to my card months in advance of the reservation date. I called my bank claiming fraud, that was charged wrongly and today i receive a call from the hotel threatening me with legal action asking for triple damage charges. I don't know what to do and feel entirely wronged. I do see that I had told the bank fraud, where in fact that mag not be the correct way but I was so frustrated and flustered that I didn't know what to do. I really need help on this and need to know what to do to just get this out of my hair.	No
She asked for all original copies so she could bring them to wherever and have them copied. She said I wouldn't have to sign anything and it would be fine, because they just need proof that the person coming here knows a citizen from America.  This seemed really sketchy to me, 1 because I haven't known them THAT long... and 2 - she asked not to tell my mom (who keeps all of those documents for me) and lie to her and say that it was for work purposes.  My question is - is this as sketchy as I think it is? My mom told me it was definitely not OK to give those documents over and not to 'vouch' for anyone coming especially someone I don't know.  What are your thoughts?	No
"I moved into a townhome back in May with my three year old son. The company that owns the property is a nonprofit and the leasing office is responsible for two other properties nearby. The day I signed the lease, I did a move-in inspection with one of the women who worked in the leasing office. I wrote down all the items that needed to be repaired/replaced (weather stripping on the front door, broken porch light, washer/dryer inoperable, bathroom door off the hinges, etc.) and signed that as well. I really needed a place as my son and I were essentially homeless, and rent here is cheap being that the property is owned by a non-profit company. Since, in my opinion, none of the needed repairs made the home uninhabitable, I moved in anyway figuring they would be fixed later.   I've called the maintenance hotline multiple times, and they have come to my apartment to repair a leak so they are aware of what needs doing around here but every time I ask when are they going to fix my washer/dryer I get an arbitrary time frame (""the manufacturer technician will be there soon"" ""some time next week"", etc) but he never comes. I last spoke to maintenance two weeks ago but the last time they were out here was a month ago. At this point it seems they're either completely ignoring my requests or prioritizing other units over mine. Where should I go from here?  tl;dr I need a handful of repairs done on various things throughout my apartment that maintenance hasn't taken care of since I moved in back in May. What do?"	No
Does California have any laws that prevent the landlord from posting text messages/emails between the landlord and tenant? Asking since a family friend has a particularly unruly tenant that has been damaging property, withholding payment, using racial slurs, etc and the landlord (my friend) wants to share this. Thanks.	No
"My friend [early 20s F] lives in the dorms on her job's campus. Monday night, she was at an employee social until early in the morning, but ended up getting a fairly good parking spot near her dorm. She was the designated driver for a few of her coworkers. Later on Tuesday morning (around 11am) she discovered damage to the back corner or her vehicle. Deep scratches and a missing reflector. She was unable to find the reflector anywhere in the lot, and assumed cleaners had picked it up. Of course we were both upset, but there isn't much to do when the parking lot has no cameras.   Cue Saturday morning. At my advisement, she finally tells her mother about the damage to the vehicle since the car is not titled in her name. Her mother is a bit of a hardass, so she told a white lie and said she was unaware of the damage until today (since she had waited so long. Strike one against her).   Saturday afternoon, she's summoned to the local police station and is questioned by officers. She called me right after the questioning, but I have little details as to the tone of the interaction. Whoever had hit her car originally had taken the reflector and given it to the police, stating she caused the accident. STRIKE TWO: she told the police she was unaware of the damage until today so her story would remain straight in the eyes of her mother. I disagree, but I'm currently too far away to take action about it. I believe I can pull text messages from five days ago where she told me she discovered the damage.   While I'm furious with her over that, there isn't much she can do about it at this point. What steps should she take now? My late grandparents were retired police officers when I was growing up, and I wouldn't dream of lying to an officer. I have no advice for her now. I met this girl in college and we have been close for awhile now-I would love to find a solution for her. Is there anyone who knows what to do in this situation?   (There is also not a doubt in my mind that she is innocent. The fact that it took the other person four days to present this ""evidence"" to the officer should also be of credit to her.)  TLDR: Friend is being framed for a hit and run by the actual perpetrator days after the accident. There are no cameras or witnesses. How should she proceed?"	No
http://imgur.com/0oWgPJX  I just learned about these landlords. Apparently they have cameras on the outside of the house...and in common spaces inside (said to be turned off). Landlords also enter the house whenever they want. They left this letter tonight while I was visiting.   We're in Oregon. I had a girlfriend who had to deal with this same thing in college. But, the school had a laser that took care of that. I don't know who to contact now. Can anyone help get us started?	No
I got married on July 2nd. We are a same-sex couple, and so instead of assuming names or hyphenating, we want to create a new last name that combines our two names into one. This is possible within Canada, and we plan on doing so, but this does change my wife's birth certificate, so it's permanent rather than an assumed name.  As a permanent resident in Canada, I am not sure how this will apply to my information in the US. I am a US citizen with a valid US passport.  I know that I need to apply for a new passport - will they accept the Canadian name change form? Do I need to get my name changed on everything in the US as well? I obviously have SS in addition to a student loan account and a bank account, but that's about it. I've been living in Canada for 5 years now, so there isn't much left in the US in my name. I will also be selling my car before we are able to complete the name change officially, so no need to worry there (the title), and I have a Canadian driver's license (already forfeited my US one).  Any advice or information would be appreciated.	No

"I'm sorry if this is mostly a rant as I am sweating my face off and extremely frustrated.   Background: I have lived in this duplex since May of 2013. I enjoy living here, the rent is cheap and the landlord has generally been good about getting things done if needed. In my time here we have had the attic water heater rust through and leak through the walls, resulting in the carpet being ripped out and replaced with wood-look laminate, the breaker box has blown (I'm not sure if I'm correct on the specifically but something to the effect) where we did not have any type of power for less than 24 hours, and a few other things which have always been fixed in a very reasonable amount of time.   The situation: I have been trying to get my air conditioner fixed since July 5th. I originally called my landlord to tell her about the issue, which is that during the day the unit cannot keep my tiny 800 square foot place below 84 degrees. It is Texas and it is hot but I have not had this issue in the years previous.   The landlord sent a repairman out quickly, he basically just blew out the area where the filter is inserted and left. It worked fine as far as I can tell for about a couple of days but was back to hot very quickly after.   I emailed my landlord on July 18th when I had time for a repairman to come in and get it done again, and they sent someone out again the next day. He arrived in the morning before it was hot, did the same thing as the previous guy and said it was working fine. This time there was no result and the temperature was back up to 80+ by 3pm.   I emailed my landlord again same day and specifically requested that someone come out later so that they could observe that the temperature was high. One week ago the man came at about 9pm and observed the heat, climbed up into my attic and said it was pretty cold up there (meaning the duct work likely needed to be replaced) and left within 15 minutes saying that everything was operating fine and he didn't know why there was no cool air in the apartment other than that the insulation was insufficient but they would ""get it fixed.""   I never heard anything further. I emailed my landlord yesterday evening to check on the status and she said she has a call in to the owner and she will let me know the results. It is currently 84 degrees at 5:30pm and will likely continue to be until at least 10pm. I am at my wits end, my air conditioner is running constantly and my bill is $250+ a month to heat this tiny stupid place. I don't want to move and I don't want to sue, but I also don't have the money to get it fixed myself. What in the world am I supposed to do?  Does e-mail count as a method of notification if I have to move forward with a lawsuit or do i need to send a certified letter?  TL;DR my air conditioner doesn't work and it's been 22 days. What now?"	No
I have 50/50 legal and physical shared custody with my ex-wife. We get along fine and co-parent fine.  When we divorced, she worked part time most of our 8 year marriage, even though she has a Bachelors degree and I do not. I was the bread winner. Her income was imputed at minimum wage (although for a brief period she worked full time and made more annually than me). So, I pay her child support every month.  This isn't a huge deal, and I didn't mind, even though it was a financial burden.  Since divorcing, she began a Masters Degree program. She has also re-married.  I understand that the re-marriage has no effect on my child support payment. They're our kids, not the new spouse's responsibility.  However, she has now finished her Masters Degree, and is still working part time. She has acquired several new piercings. She has acquired a new half sleeve (half her arm) tattoo that has grown over what must be several sessions. And she is about to have breast implant surgery.  So, her education has increase, though her income and work hours have not, and she is getting a lot of voluntary and aesthetic work done on her body.  I'm not judging, and I don't care, she's allowed to do whatever she'd like....  But, I'm struggling financially to maintain my home for my children, bills, etc. AND pay a not insignificant amount to her each month.  Would any of this be grounds for CS adjustment in Oklahoma?	No
Hello all!  My boyfriend and I have been struggling with frustration for a while. A few months back, our next door neighboor hired a man to build a fence dividing our backyards. Our front yards, as seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/DKREo), have a joint driveway (with a discoloration between the two sides so you can kind of see where the division is). As he was almost finished building,  my boyfriend pulled out our surveyors certificate of our land lot and we were able to determine that they were building the fence **three feet** in on our property and so we asked them to move it. They complied, and the man rebuilt the fence - only to still have built it about a **foot** in on our property. The fence has been up for about a month now. We've been struggling with how to bring this up (again) and were curious what options we had if, once we do confront him, he says no. We don't exactly get along with our neighbor and he does not seem to be the accommodating (or nice, friendly, happy) type.	No
"I live in Texas first of all. My 5 year-old son just told me that he ""snuggles"" and sometimes co-sleeps (my language, not his) with his stepfather. He also told me this happens nearly every morning after his mom goes to work and that his stepfather is only wearing underwear while they're under the covers. Apparently, they also watch videos or play games on his phone in this state.  He continued to say that he sleeps between them some nights and his mom is ""totally naked"". I'm more than a little disturbed by all of this. He sleeps in his own bed 100% of the time when he's with me, which is 50/50 on a week on week off basis. Clearly he doesn't ""need"" this.   Where does the law/judges/cps stand on this behavior? It seems like alienation at the very least to me."	No
"I apologize for the long ass post. I wanted to try and get all the relevant details in about my predicament.  I moved into my current apartment a little over a year ago, and my current lease is up in November 2017. My boyfriend also lives with me and is a co-tenant on the lease. The complex has been decent so far and has usually been prompt in regards to maintenance requests. My main issue only started a few weeks ago.  A few weekends ago, I came home to find that my sink and dishwasher were backing up with water. It was so bad that water had begun to seep out the front door. We contacted the emergency maintenance around 10:30 that night, and even though someone called to say that the maintenance manager would meet with us that night, no one ever came. For good measure, I also put in an online maintenance request, which seems to be about the only way this complex will take your problems seriously. A maintenance person did come out the next day, and at the time it seemed the issue has been resolved.    The next week, water started to back up in the sink again. The kitchen didn't quite flood like it had the last time, but we were still concerned. My boyfriend called the leasing office a few times directly about the issue, and no one was ever sent out. Then, on June 30th, our air conditioner went out. Texas is having a bought of 100 degree weather right now, so our apartment has been at a constant temperature of about 80 degrees. It's kinda of livable with a fan on, but not really my preference. On June 1st, I put in an online maintenance request for both the air conditioning and the plumbing.   On July 5th, maintenance came by while my boyfriend and I were at work, and a window ac unit was installed in the bedroom. The way it was installed in the window makes it to where our bedroom basically has no privacy. There's not really an room for a curtain to be hung up; we have vertical blinds that were installed by the complex. Because of how long the blinds are and where the unit is placed, the blinds are basically parted so that anyone can peek into the bedroom. For now, I've tacked up a blanket to cover the window just to get some privacy.   That same night, the dishwasher flooded AGAIN. We put in a second pending work order online since the complex seems content to ignore phone calls. We didn't hear back from anyone until July 7th. My boyfriend was home from work that day and a maintenance worker, who supposedly was fixing the AC, came by and asked for access to the breaker box. My boyfriend asked if maintenance had been notified about the second plumbing issue as well, and the worker said that no one had told him anything about it, and that we should call the office (which we've already done!!!)  So right now, I have no central AC, a bedroom with an ac unit and no privacy, an 80 degree living room (because the air from the ac unit doesn't reach in there), I have a plastic tub full of dirty ass water that's leaking from my kitchen fixtures, and another tub full of dirty dishes that we can't wash because doing so will probably cause another flood of biblical proportions.   So getting to the nitty gritty legal stuff. my lease states that the ""unlawful early move-out and reletting charge"" is $600. The lease that we signed just uses the form provided by the Texas Apartment Association, which can be found here: https://www.taa.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/2015_Apartment_Lease_Contract_-_FINAL_1-16.pdf. Paragraph 31 states that they have an obligation to make all reasonable repairs within a reasonable amount of time. I'm wondering how long I'm supposed to play around with these people until I can just get out of this hellhole. I'm posting here to see if there might be any other legal remedies besides just eating the costs and paying to break the lease. If you have any questions for me, I'll try to answer them. Thank you for your time.  TL;DR: Apartment can't get their shit together and fix our maintenance issues. How long do they reasonable have to fix them, and is there a way out if they don't?"	No
Hi, /legaladvice,  About two months ago, I got engaged. We moved in together and did not get along at all and he became very controlling and weird so I ended the relationship and moved back out and am living with my parents at the moment. We both signed a one-year lease for the apartment. I have since contacted him and he has no problem with me removing myself from the lease.  So my question is... what will this do to my credit and will it affect my ability to get another apartment?  I have a 760 score and I am self-employed, if it matters. I know from Credit Karma that the first lease gave me a hard inquiry on my credit. After being removed, would I be able to sign my own lease soon after?  Thanks in advance	No
My landlord has not given me receipts for the last 2 months. This is the last month I will be in the apartment so I am worried that if I don't get them now I never will.	No
"My ex wife and I divorced about a year ago.  We have an 8 year old daughter and live in a suburb of Pittsburgh.  We have no custody arrangement for our daughter, as we both work full time jobs and rely on each other for childcare.  Personally, this has benefited me because I get the majority of time with my daughter.  However, lately, I feel like my ex has been really reckless with taking care of my daughter.  Examples:  - During the school year, it was my ex's job to pick our girl up from school at 2:50, at the latest.  She neglected to pick her up often and I would have to leave my 9-to-5 job downtown and drive against traffic for 30-40 minutes to go pick up my daughter, if her aunt or grandmother could not go pick her up.  This happened so many times over the two years she attended school that the school sent us both letters saying if it happened again, they would be forced to report it to child protective services and present this to the magistrate.  My ex's defense is ""I work nights and my alarm doesn't wake me up.""  - She recently moved to a new house in a different neighborhood.  Evidently, based on my child's explanations to me, once I drop her off with her mom in the morning, she basically spends all day taking care of herself while mom sleeps.  This includes running around the neighborhood with a neighbor child or playing at their house.  Often when I come to pick up my daughter in the evenings, I have to then turn around and walk over to this other person's house just to get my kid.  My ex's excuse:  ""I tell her she has to check in every two hours.""  When asked what happens if she doesn't check in, would she even wake up to notice? ""I set an alarm on my phone to wake me up"" (nevermind the above point of an alarm not waking her to pick up her own child from school...)  - I have reason to believe that she occasionally abuses prescription medication.  She worked at a hospital in the ER in the past and now currently works for a nursing home.  In the past, when we were still living together and were on the skids, I was doing laundry one night and a loose valium fell out of her scrub pocket.  This is coupled with the fact that she has admitted to having some drinking problems in the past, while we were separated but not divorced.  This is in addition to a really weird interaction we had this last Saturday where she arrived at my house, unannounced at 2pm, claiming she was there to pick up our daughter. (1. she rarely if EVER picks up my daughter from my house. 2. I always have my daughter on the weekend)  She mumbled a bit about being there to pick up our daughter, forgot and thought it was Tuesday (1. It's Saturday 2. She's literally never picked up our kid from my house on a weekday, I come home from work on weekdays and pick her up from HER house) and then she mumbled an apology and drove off...  I'm not terribly familiar with substance abuse, but that seemed extremely weird.  My Ex's excuse: ""I had been working all day and was really tired and just totally exhausted and out of my mind.""  When I told her it would be easily confused with being stoned, she simply said ""I'm not on drugs""  - She recently decided, against my wishes, to take in her 17 year old cousin who is currently being tried along with her boyfriend for selling pills, stealing her sister's gun, shoplifting from a department store and then getting pulled over by the police.  She is currently on house arrest (I guess?  I'm hardly an expert.  She's to stay there under 24/7 supervision until her court appearance and not to be left alone or see her boyfriend until after the trial.)  Anyway, I expressed my opinion that I did not want my daughter to be there with her and that I thought it was a dumb decision to allow her cousin to stay there and that it was her immediate family's responsibility.  She then told me that I could pay for childcare while I was at work, since I was the one that had a problem with the arrangement.  (I make 38k a year.  I just can't afford to do that for a month, a majority of my income would go to just paying for daycare.  I will be starting a job in a few days where I'll start making about 20% more, but it won't be in time to help with this.)  I was sort of coerced into moving here against my will when we were still married, and I can't lean on family for support, as my closest family is 6 hours away.  She currently is spending her days at my ex's house and I pick her up every night to spend the night with me.  - Today, the reason that drove me to make this post -- I went to pick up my daughter from her house at 6:20 like I always do, and my ex's housebound criminal cousin answers the door, tells me my ex isn't there and that my daughter is across the street with the neighbors.  I check with the neighbors and she's not there, hasn't been all afternoon.  I go back to the house and her cousin says she doesn't know where my ex or my daughter went off to.  I haven't heard from my ex all day.  She's not answering anyone's phone calls or text messages.  I call her family, no one knows where they are, but all basically have something to say along the line of ""I don't know what the hell her problem is, I never hear from her and I don't approve of what's going on with your daughter.""  About an hour later my ex finally responds to my calls and calls me back.  She took my daughter an hour and a half away to go out on a boat on the lake with her new boyfriend.  After about 10 minutes of me (embarrassingly) losing my shit, she finally admits ""I dropped the ball"".  Like it wasn't a big deal.  So, this is basically what's been going on.  And to be honest, I don't want to do it at all, but I'm thinking it may be time to look into filing for custody.  I didn't do it when we were filing for a no contest divorce because 1. It seemed unfair to my daughter and I didn't want to make things more stressful. 2. Her family is well to do and there's a lot of rumors about her dad being mobbed up.  In some of our more fiery arguments in the past, if I brought up custody, she threatened that her dad's lawyers would bury me and I'd never see my daughter.  3. If I got sole custody, I don't know if I have the support in this city to be a single dad and I'm pretty sure I'd have to move back home to the midwest, about 6 hours away until I could figure out what to do.  I'm really upset right now and I don't know what else to do.  Hell, I don't even really know what questions to ask.  This really isn't something that's in my wheelhouse and I have no experience with this sort of thing.  Do I have a case if I was to file for custody?  I know courts tend to favor the mothers in these scenarios, and I don't want to run the risk of losing my daughter.  How much would this cost?  At my new position with the raise, I think I could put away about $400-$500/month, currently, I don't have any savings, really.  I've been wiped out with some bad car stuff and it's zeroed my savings.  Is there any sort of evidence I could be compiling or a case I could be making at this time?  I have a lot of people and friends who know what's been going on and they have all said that they would be happy to help in any way possible, but my friends and family are all low class working schlubs and I couldn't ask them for money.  I don't know /r/legalhelp...  I just need help, or at least a direction to be pointed in."	No
So I'm renting a room and it really makes me uneasy knowing theyre recording everything I do when I'm outside my room. Theres two cameras, one pointing down the hall where my room and bathroom is and the other pointing into the kitchen. It is something they didn't even bring up to me I just came home and they were there. They are app controlled as far as I can tell and might be night vision. Any advice?	No
My renter neighbors are incapable of following multiple HOA rules. I've tried talking to them, they just spurt a million excuses. The biggie is with vehicles. 24/7 they would work on their cars (fluid changes, brakes, you name it) and park in the street. We've been woken up multiple times by them working on loud cars in the middle of the night.    I finally snapped, took a photo of multiple infringements, and sent it to the HOA. First time filing a complaint, our HOA claims reports are anonymous. The HOA apparently forwarded my photo to the home owner, who then gave it to the renters.   A little about the photo: The people in the photo are in the (public) street, profile view, and too far away to get a proper ID. Their house is in the photo with it's house number legible. They of course have no way of proving specifically who took the photo, simply that it likely came from my house.   So anyway, renters come over furious and start spurting nonsense about having a police officer in the family and they said taking a photo like that was illegal and they could sue me, on and on. I told them to go ahead and do whatever they thought was necessary.   Now I'm second guessing myself. My understanding of photo/video/etc taking legality in Colorado, USA is that if that unless it's somewhere that privacy should be expected (ie a bathroom, changing room, etc) it's perfectly legal to take a photo of them without their consent. It is of course best to err on the side of caution, like definitely don't go taking photos through an open window, etc. A public street is clearly uh public, right?  Good news is they've ceased working on vehicles in the street.   Tl;dr Took a photo of my neighbors violating HOA regulations in the street, neighbors got ahold of the photo, and threatened to sue me.  And sorry, on mobile.	No
Tucson,AZ.  So, last Friday I got a notice that my complex was under new ownership. The note stated that we could pay our rent on the 5th because of the holiday and they were closed. The pay location also changed to dropping off rent at their office across town during their office hours. I worked on the 5th so I wouldn't have been able to bring them the payment. Tried to call them, no answer. A neighbor informed me that for this last month we could still use the drop box. However due to bad luck, and having no car, the places I normally got my rent money order from were closed or their machines weren't working, I got the MO the next day for my rent plus 1 day late fee in the amount on my lease, $6 fee. Today I got a note on my door stating my rent was late, it had over $100 in fees. As well, they got my rent amount wrong. It was lower than my actual rent but it proves they didn't even review my lease. My lease is a 1 year lease starting on June 1st 2017. They never reviewed any possible fees nor have I signed any  agreement with them yet for any of their policies.  So what am I looking at, am I liable to pay the fees, or are they essentially violating my lease agreement.	No
My grandfather died about 6 months ago and left all of his assets to his recent wife and made her the executor of his will. The one exception to this was my grandparent's house which he left her in a life estate.  Before his death he and his wife co-signed on a loan for several tens of thousands of dollars against the house. This past week I started getting calls from a debt recovery company asking about his finances. I know from my research that my family and I can't be chased down for his debts as we haven't received anything from and have no control over his estate, so I am not concerned about that.  Ideally we would like to sell the house ourselves and pay off the loan or take over the loan and rent out the house so it is not foreclosed on. I checked with my family and the deed was never updated to indicate the remaindermen he had described in his will so the first thing I am doing now is making sure that happens ASAP.  What are our best steps forward after that? Since she was on the loan can they even come after the house as part of the estate? We were thinking of calling the debt collection company and seeing if we could work with them directly, although we are not the executors so they may not even talk to us.	No
"Hey there.  Last weekend I was at the ""Adventure Park"" at SkiBowl near Mt Hood in Oregon. I went on one of those trampolines with bungees that attach to a harness. One of those that make it easy to jump higher and go backflips etc.   Anyway, long story short I did about 3/4 of a backflip and slammed both shins on the edge of the trampoline. I sustained a very deep, serious laceration on my left shin and a nasty scrape and bruise on my right shin. A trip to urgent care and 7 stitches later here I am.  My question is, do I have a leg to stand on to ask that they pay my medical bills? Or anything more? Furthermore, is it a good idea to hire an injury lawyer? Is it a thing still where they don't get paid unless you win?  Possibly important details include:   This occurred in Oregon and that I live in Washington State.  The operator of the attraction is the one who strapped me in. They weighed me first and confirmed my weight.  I have witnesses.  I never signed anything; in fact, the tickets into the park were purchased for a group which I was a part of.   Let me know if there's any more info that would help."	No
So my partner and I have bought a street front block which was one of the three lots subdivided from an original corner block. It's 324m2 and in an old residential area.  We were not told when purchasing the block that the water mains for the street runs through the verge and would need to be lowered to allow for a crossover to be added to the block once construction was complete. We actually found out about this when a bobcat drove over it and burst it because it was only buried by 10cm of sand. We aren't able to increase the level of the verge because it would make the driveway far too steep so our only option is to pay to have the mains dropped. The estimated cost is $5000, although they can charge more once works are completed if necessary.  This is obviously a huge financial blow for us. This is our first home and we really don't want to sink our savings for furniture, fencing, landscaping etc into this pipe.  We know that when the conditions for subdivision were given to the land owner there was no mention of the water pipe so even though they probably should have mentioned something when we bought it, I don't think there is anything we can do about that. My question is, is the water corporation at fault for not recommending to the land developer that the pipe had to be lowered. My understanding of subdivision approval is to ensure all lots are able to be built on and ours currently can't. So many people I've spoken to have said they believe the water corp is at fault for not making this a condition of approval but the water corp of course admits no fault and just wants us to pay. Does anyone know anything about property law? If it's any help, I'm in Western Australia.  Thanks in advance.	No
"A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him.   I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers.   The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on.   Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon.   A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design.   Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success.   We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.   We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either).   Would love some advice! Thank you in advance."	No
"Last fall I moved into my apartment complex and everything was going smoothly. A couple months in, I was offered to attach on another year to my lease, at $50 dollars less a month on the new term.    Now my complex is offering the same apartment type for $100 less than my ""discount"" I got.   Is there anything I'm able to do about this? I live in Missouri if it helps."	No
My roommates and I finished the lease of our rental the 1st of june 2017. During the inspection of the place, the agent mentioned that he didn't expect the security deposit to fully cover the damages (so did we)... Later on, he sent us an e-mail asking for a forwarding address and stating again that the security deposit would not cover the cost of all the damages.   However, we haven't heard a thing from them since. Our online account was closed (even though we still had to pay ~350$). One of my roommates even went back to check out the house to find it fully renovated.  My question here is: How much time does the landlord have to request more money for the damages? it will be a month and a half at the end of this week and it seems like the damages have already been taken care of...	No
"I'm still pretty upset. So yesterday my landlord texted me and asked if he can bring someone over for a walk through. My lease is up August 31st. We set up for 4pm because I was supposed to work but another guy wanted hours so I let him pick up my shift. About an hour ago I get a knock at the door and as I'm getting up from my bed (butt ass naked) he opens up the door and has the new tenant with him. I was so embarrassed and ran back to the room as quickly as possible. He then yelled ""we'll give you a minute!"" And laughed and his tone was like ""oh this guy is so dumb"" as soon as I opened my room door they walk in and it was so awkward. I was just cleaning as we went and kept apologizing, it wasn't filthy but embarrassing like I had my weed jar out (yes I have my med card) and underwear in the bathroom floor, plates on he counter, I was planning on doing a quick clean up before they came.  They actually got done quick and then he came back and talked to me like I was a kid telling me I need to keep the place clean and stuff. Also questioning why I told him I would be at work. I told him I don't owe him an explanation and that we had an agreed time and he got upset and was like ""ok whatever I know what we talked about"". I have texts as well so I don't know why he even went there.  This isn't the first incident though. In March I come home to him leaving my unit and he said it was a leak they found during the inspection and he came to fix it. He then said he needed to grab some tools and will be back in 30. After working a 12 hour shift I was just ready to go to bed and after about an hour I said fuck it and assumed he's not coming and feel asleep and wake up to my bedroom door opening up and him telling me he was back. He then began looking in closets and shit saying he was trying to find the leak. (But he got the tools already to fix the kitchen sink) also they found it during the inspection so what was he looking for?   This feels extremely invasive and annoying. Is there anything I can do legally? It just upsets me because I'm wondering how many times he's came when I'm not here, and he brought the girl over to view the place when I told him I would be at work.   I've also found long blonde hairs around my place and no one with blonde hair comes over. At first I thought I was going crazy until if felt like every other day people at work were telling me I had a long hair hanging from my beard I blew it off months ago but now I'm starting to think that he may bring people over during the day, as I work mostly during the day and I work from sun up to sun down most days.   Also I noticed its times that my living room tv would be on( I'm not even in the living room unless company is over) or I had 2 less packs of ramen. Things that are big enough that I noticed but small enough where I don't look into at all. I know I can't prove any of this, but what options do I have? I have the neighbor looking out and she told me he does similar stuff to her but with her it's just him popping up and not having stuff out of place.   Is he within his rights?"	No
We have a family member that is threatening to bulldoze a home down that we have on our family owned land, we are owners as well as written on the deed, the land was is in my grandpas name who is now deceased. We are full owners and so is she, The land went to the heirs which included my father who is also now deceased, Wouldnt we be owners of the land if we are descendants of our father who was written as an heir to the land on the deed?  she has no respect for our property that is on a part of her land she is living on currently. We already called our courthouse and they just told us to get a lawyer but we dont have the money to hire a lawyer.   My question is can she legally tear down a home that belongs to us and others? Does she have to ask the other owners and family before she does this?  If she decides to tear down the home can we press charges?  Keep in mind the deed says that every family member owns all the land thats on the deed so its all family owned. but she is the only current resident on the specific part of the land but we have a home sitting on it.	No
A little while ago I had a fire in a condo that was my fault. It caused enough damage to have to replace everything in the unit.   Good news is that I had tenant insurance with $1,000,000 in liability. Bad news is that the landlords didn't have insurance for themselves.   They have been harassing me with emails saying that my insurance isn't giving them enough ($5000 short), and that I need to pay them the difference. They are threatening to sue if I don't.   I spoke with my insurance and they said too bad for them. The amount they are getting represents depreciation of what was lost (appliances and cabinets). They should have had their own insurance.  I initially told them to contact my insurer as they are handling the liability of the claim, but they continue to come at me. I've decided to cease responding to them until they decide to contact with a lawyer.   I'm pretty sure my insurance will take care of me if they want to sue, but I want to make sure with you guys. Do I have anything to worry about here? Would the $5000 even be worth it for them to hire someone?  Thanks	No
I live in an older part of Colorado springs in Cheyenne canyon. We have about 7 known houses that tie in our sewage line. My neighbor found a collapse in my driveway when getting her lines flushed. She and all these other houses tie in. So far everyone has been working together to fix it but my fear is that someone pulls out.   The project is going to cost about 17000 to fix. I need advice on if I should just run my own sewage line due to liability concerns and easement concerns on my property. My house is very close to the city street and could likely run my own line and abandon the current one.	No
"This happened last Friday. I want to believe that I'm worrying over nothing, but just to be sure I thought I should ask for some advice here.   **Background:** I am a university student and have lived in this apartment for 1 year with three roommates. The three roommates also lived there the year before that (I took the place of someone who moved out). We have had cockroaches for the past year at varying degrees of disgusting. Two years ago, my three roommates said that there were some but they made efforts to be clean to keep the bugs to a minimum. I moved in last summer and the heat brought them back at full force. The landlord had my apartment fumigated (as well as several others) before school started and that helped with some of the problem. Now as you can imagine, since the exterminators only locally treated several apartments, the cockroaches were gone for a bit but came back soon enough. I believe that she would have had to tent the whole place to really fix the problem. As a poor college student I decided to just keep the place clean and not move out and break my lease and deal with the bugs as they came, and this worked for most of the year. The landlord also fumigated the place at the end of the school year (this past June) but again, that only solved the problem temporarily and we still see bugs occasionally.   **The problem:** My apartment was being shown to potential new tenants and the landlord was there with them. At the end of the trip this dialogue occurred:  Me: ""Are you guys looking at this apartment?""  Them: ""No, not this one.""   Me: ""Well just to let you know, but the first floor has cockroaches.""   The landlord came back with someone after they had gone (a higher up?). The higher up (HU) told me that what I did was illegal because the entire first floor does not have cockroaches, only this place. I disagree with this because I did not say the entire first floor has bugs, I just said there were bugs. It would be foolish to assume bugs are localized to my apartment only because that's not how bugs work. I know that other places were treated for the bugs and I have a friend on the fourth floor who also says he has bugs. In any case, the HU told me to not do that again, and that they would come into my apartment on Monday to check for ""cleanliness.""   **My question:** Am I going to get sued? Are they going to try to say that my apartment is the only one with the problem and they're going to take away my security deposit? I truly think I didn't say anything patently false and I know that CA residents have a lot of rights as renters, but I just want to know what I'm up against for the rental company. Also, if it helps I'm moving out at the end of August for other reasons, so I won't have to deal with this landlord ever again soon."	No
Hi all, so I'd appreciate it if I could get some advice on this situation. Some context, my grandmother has had three husbands. The first one died when my mother was 3 months old. The second was found to be cheating, was kicked out, and divorced. Her third husband, however, took serious advantage of her being a single mother so he could sexually assault my mother. Unfortunately, this wasn't a one-time thing. He was charged in the early '80s for it. There was a condition for him not to go near anyone under the age of 16 unless they were accompanied by an adult, and a restraining order put on him to not go near my mother. In '85 he built a brand new house, and he wanted my grandmother, uncle and mother to move into this new house that he built, but they all refused because the house they were living in (which is the same house my grandma still resides in), was built by her first husband - their father. So he (her 3rd husband, not her 1st) got drunk one day and sold the house he had built, for pretty much nothing, in an attempt to gain permission to move in to my grandmas house (he still had the restraining order on him at this point), which was successful.  After he moved in, he sexually assualted my mom continuously right up until '96, then he proposed that same year to my grandma, which gave my mother a 6 month respite. What was really odd though, was that he married my grandmother on the same day that is my mother and fathers wedding anniversary. He started sexually assaulting my mother again in '97, right up until 2 years ago. It's a real long, unpleasant story. Nevertheless, he's in jail as I'm typing this, and my grandmother is actively seeking a lawyer to remove him off her house title.   My question is; could she get this marriage anulled in order to make the separation easier? She is willing to let him have all of his belongings, including his boat and the only vehicle they have, as long as she gets to keep her house. She see's how twisted this man is now, and wants nothing more to do with him. She wants him and his children off her will, and she wants her relationship restored with us. This man, only last year had another 'peace bond' applied to him, stating that he must remain at least 100m away from my mother and sister at all times. Oh yea, did I forget mention he had done this to my sister ever since she was 4? But that's another long, uncomfortable story. Any help would be appreciated. Please help.	No
I'm 16, 17 in October. I want to leave my house as soon as possible possible after school starts in August. I will have my driver's license and possibly a vehicle then.

So back in January I decided to sign a lease at an apartment that was going under construction. Come today, I get an email saying that the apartment wont be ready for me to move in, and the move in date has been pushed back three months and I have no place to live for a while. They gave us two options; Option 1: Move out, cancel our lease and collect our security deposit like nothing ever happend. Option 2: delay the move in date, and then upon moving in in December, collect $1500 dollars as compensation for the three months of waiting about. I'm saying that option 2 is a no go just because we can't find a place to live for 3 months. I also think that we would still have a clime to some money because of the inconvenience that they are causing us, it is getting very hard to find a place here on the university this late in the game. I'm wondering if we can claim something as an inconvenience. No where in the lease does it say that they can cancel our lease. What do you think?	No
hey, so to make this a short long story, my father has never paid child support even though my mother had got it in writing what he was supposed to pay (the amount slips my mind as I was 3 when this all happened and I have lost all the paperwork). but as of now I am of age of majority and still wondering if i have any entitlement to that money. I'm also in Canada, British Columbia. So I guess what I'm asking is where I stand with all this in a legal level, what my options are, what kind of lawyer to look into. Thanks in advance to anyone who reads this. Will update with any info as needed.	No

I live in Cook County Illinois in an owner occupied building, 3 bedroom unit, outside of Chicago. The landlord is a rather unpleasant person who has been dishonest from the start.  I've been here for approximately 7 years and recently discovered that the common area hallway light is running on my meter. I also suspect that there is a storage area that is also connected to my meter, but have no way of confirming this on my own. The lease doesn't say anything about my having to pay for common area power.  I am due for a new lease in a couple of weeks and my fiance is moving in with me. My landlord is not pleased with this and is requesting that he fill out an application, provide credit history, etc, as well as increase our rent.  I am worried that my fiance won't get approved due to his terrible credit history. In the meantime I have this electricity problem with which I am very upset. My electric bills are always very high and I never understood why. My electric was even turned off on two occasions due to my inability to pay. Had I not been paying for someone else's power, I wouldn't have been living in the dark those two times. It was rather stressful.  My goal is to have my fiance move in and establish residency here, then take up the electricity issue.  How would I go about this?  I believe that this landlord knows about the electric being wired to my place as he's been the owner for over 20 years. That light is a newer addition as the cord is ran on the outside of the wall and routed to my place through a drilled hole.  Other issues:  -When I came to sign lease I asked who lived in the building, landlord said 'older couple', but failed to say that it was him and his wife. I found out after moving in.  -Mice are entering my apartment, but landlord is disregarding my friendly complaints. Gave me two mouse traps and called it a day. Mice are still here and he knows.  -Lease says no pets, no visiting pets, did not make an exception when I got a doctor's recommendation for an emotional support animal or when I needed to dogsit my brothers pup while he was hospitalized, but recently saw that landlord has cats himself in this building.  -Took almost a year to replace broken fridge.   Please advise. I wouldn't mind getting my money back. At least for the electricity bill and for having to clean mouse shit from my counter tops on a daily basis.	No
I had a dispute with a previous landlord which was brought to the lower court and now needs to be brought before Small Claims. I was told that the limit for filing a written contract (lease) case was within four years. When does that limit start and end i.e. is the four year limit four years after my last rental period or four years after I received the security deposit?  Secondly, do I have to file within the four years or does the case have to be heard within the four years? That is, if I file within the term but the case cannot be scheduled within the term, does it get thrown out?	No

I told her my realtor and I were coming to the property on Wednesday to inspect/assess the condo as it is going for sale. She changed the date because according to her she is traveling.

Title says most of it, but I just moved in here and I'm going to try my best to stick it out (cheap rent) but just in case I need to get out of here early, what are my options? I've attached the redacted lease below and I've read it several times and cannot find a part about how to get out before 12 months is up. When I first signed the lease, I had a verbal option of month-to-month for 275, 3-month for 260, 6-month for 240, or 12-month for 225.  Obviously I chose the 12-month scenario because he also verbally told me if I needed to break the contract, he would work with me best he could.   What are my options to get out?  https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9FtrqVLcjBjbGY5VjBuU1hLV3c/view?usp=sharing	No
"September of last year my roommate and I signed a lease for an apartment in Bloomfield. Communication with the landlord up to this time has been sparse to nonexistent (he has NEVER responded to a maintenance request and I still do not have a key to my mailbox after sending multiple inquiries), and additionally the apartment was damaged when we moved in (stains on carpet, peeling wallpaper, holes in window screen). Our lease runs until 1PM on August 30th.  In March he asked if we would be renewing our lease and, since we were both deeply dissatisfied with the overall experience, we told him we would be seeking housing elsewhere for the following year, and he began listing and showing the apartment.  We did not hear from him again until May 15th. He told us that he had sold the apartment to renters ""would like to get in earlier, perhaps as much as a month earlier"" (I'm quoting his email to me and my roommate directly). Neither of us had settled on housing yet (we were both actively looking for apartments, but, you know. It's Pittsburgh.) so both told him we couldn't give him a concrete move-out date and would let him know ASAP.  On June 6th, he talked to me in person and I gave him the same answer. He claims he also talked to my roommate, although my roommate cannot recall if this happened for sure. Late last month, my roommate and I had both signed leases for new apartments - the earliest possible move-in date for his August 3rd, mine August 5th. I emailed our landlord with these dates and asked if we could pay only a portion of the rent for August since we would be out in the first week. Much like every other email either of us has sent to him, we never heard a response.  Last week (July 6th), he sent an email demanding that we vacate the apartment entirely by August 1st, as the new renters would be moving in. Obviously this came as a shock to both of us. One of my family members is a lawyer, so I sent her a copy of my lease and screencaps of all relevant email communications with the landlord. She agreed that this was illegal, and sent my landlord an email telling him as much (but in formal legalese). I also got in touch with the renters and explained the situation - they told me they were as shocked as I was, because they didn't want to move in early; rather, the apartment had been *advertised* as being open August 1st, and they had not yet signed a lease. Lawyer relative advised me and my roommate not to have any further communication without her input.  Landlord calls me today angrily demanding an explanation. (As I said my lawyer relative advised I stop communicating, but) I told him what I'd already told him - that I couldn't be out any earlier than August 5th. He gave me the same ultimatum - that I had to be out by August 1st, or he would cut power and service to the apartment. Additionally he says he will keep our security deposit if we are not out.  tl;dr Shitty landlord is trying to force me and my roommate out 30 days before my lease ends; lawyer has confirmed this is illegal and told landlord so, but landlord persists.  These are my questions:  1. Should I be preparing to go to court? Lawyer is family, so she wrote the email to my landlord for free. Should I look into hiring a lawyer?  2. Is it legal for a landlord to retain a security deposit for reasons other than damage to the apartment?  3. If it is illegal for him to retain the deposit (as I said, there was damage to the apartment before we moved in, and I have no doubt he will blame us for it if he can), can I demand receipts from the landlord as proof that the security deposit went toward repairing the apartment?  (edited for formatting)"	No
I live in WA state for reference.  Suppose that I vacate my apartment, and the landlord sends me an itemized list of charges from my security deposit within the 21 days, along with a small refund check.  Is there a deadline to dispute the charges? Also, does cashing the check imply that I accept the charges?	No
Today I found out that my company didn't contribute to my 401k for 3 years ever since I started working there. Even though I elected to have it maxed out and Fidelity has that on record, my employer simply has never carried out the contributions. When I asked HR about it they only said that there is nothing they can do. Is this true or am I legally entitled to some compense or solution to catch up on what I missed?	No

The housing market in the city I go to school in is very competitive this time of year and landlords tend to accept multiple applications for a single rental before determining who they're going to rent to. I have good rental history, but every year I still need to put in several applications on 'available' rentals in order to find a place because of this. I understand taking 2 or 3 applications because students might not have the best credit/rental history and you want to make sure you find someone, but I've heard of the property management company I just tried renting from taking 40+ applications for a single apartment. This seems like kind of a racket to me because that's $1600 in just applications. I had another experience recently where I paid the $80 (2 people) background check/application fee with a property management company for a rental and when I did I was told by their office lady that I was sure to get it but that it would take a few days to do the background check. After a week I called them back for an update and they said the address I put in the application for had just been rented to someone else, and I'm pretty sure they didn't even do a 'background check' on me because the references/landlord I put on the application never heard from them. They didn't even seem to remember who I was. If it's legal to accept multiple applications and deny people without reason what's stopping someone from just 'renting' a house for the application fees with no intention of actually renting the property to anyone.	No
Hi I'm really sorry if this is a stupid question, I have just never had to deal with court or legal things and I figured I would give this a shot. I am trying to find out exactly what sort of paperwork may be needed or what can be done.  A little background, I have a 17 month old child with a man. He is not in the picture. My son is on Medicaid so now the state has said they want to go after him for money. When I was filling out the paperwork, there was an option for medical assistance only so I checked that. I don't want or need child support from this man but I understand the state wanting to go after him for the medicaid.  I have court later this week but I believe it is just a paternity establishment case since paternity has not been established and the father is not on the birth certificate. I am just wondering what to expect so any advice would be appreciated. Again, sorry if this is a stupid post. I am just stressing out over this whole situation even though I probably shouldn't be.	No
I just received the lease for my first apartment in NYC and was wondering if someone could review the lease for me to make sure everything checks out/there's nothing sketchy.  Thanks!	No
Last thursday August 3rd my ex boyfriend/roommate(we were both unable to move out due to financial reasons) was arrested for a violent crime. As he was being arrested, he asked the officer to tell me to log in and use his account to make sure rent was paid for the month. It was. I had already given him a person check of $930 for the rent and utilities and such and it had already been cashed.  Today I arrived home to find a notice on my door saying rent payment bounced and rent is still due plus nearly $200 of fees. If I don't pay by the end of the day tomorrow there will be a dispossessory warrant and an additional $200 will be added. His family already came into the apartment with a police escort to collect his things but in the process, they ripped my internet box out of the wall destroying the cables and kept the internet box refusing to give it back even though i told them it was mine and the bill is in my name. (so there's another $200 fee). They demanded to keep the couch claiming it was his, I didn't bother to fight it because it was a gift to the both of us for him. They took the couch outside my apartment door and shredded it and left it there (Hello another$300 fee to have it removed).  So currently I have to pay full rent plus these fees by tomorrow afternoon when I've already paid him for his portion of rent.  I am planning on calling my bank and the complex first thing in the morning but I don't think any of this can be done in the deadline.  Should I contact the police and report stolen money/items?   Do I need to contact his family and demand the items/money?  I don't know what to do.	No
So I worked for this company and left after 5 months but they are asking for £200 for training me. Is this legal? 	No
"I've done coke once with a friend (and their other friend, who brought it) and ever since then that friend has grown very cold about it in front of me and said they were pressured into doing it by their friend who was present. Even though I know they're just saying that to hide it. Cuz I asked them to bring some one day after that and referred to it as ""❄️"" (snowflake emoji) over text and they flipped out on me. I was later told that's dangerous because she could get in trouble for supplying. But I don't get it, it's not like someone's spying on our conversation? (WhatsApp is secure)   Anyway I'm not looking to sell drugs, I just wanted to do it with this friend while we hang out. For recreational purposes. I was thinking of asking them again this time (6 months later) and refer to it as something like ""🔌"" (plug emoji which is common for this) . Basically something like ""hey can u hook up the 🔌"". Could that get someone in trouble?"	No
"My roommate and I rent an apartment and we currently have black mold spreading across our ceiling. I sent pictures of it to her and she dismissed it as ""mildew."" It was pretty nasty and definitely not mildew.  She had someone come in to ""repair it,"" but all that was done was covered up and textured to look like part of the ceiling. You can still see the dark mold right underneath that thin think piece.   But I'm scared of what they can turn around and get on me...

Im designing a prototype for a friend who will be producing a larger unit (using my prototype as a controller) and selling it on the open market. I will be paid for this, but I'm getting cold feet. I want to make sure that I'm protected should anything occur with the end unit and the user of said unit would want to sue. Is there any documentation or processes I should do to ensure that I'm not at fault and this whole thing come crashing down on me should anything happen?	No
"So this is my first ever speeding ticket - I honestly have no idea how to approach this. I got the ticket about a week ago in Bishop, CA while driving on a road trip. From about a mile away, I saw a black SUV and knowing my brother was nearby, I sped up to see if it was him. Once I got close enough to realize it was actually a patrol SUV with the words ""highway patrol"" on the rear, I immediately slowed down. But by then, I'm assuming, the cop had already matched my speed. He pulled to the side, allowing me to get ahead of him - then he proceeded to pull me over.   The court appearance that I have is about 300 miles away from my house. I'm willing to show up if it means I can get out of the ticket - but is there anything at all that I can do or say to make this ticket go away? I know it's a long shot, but I have to try!"	No
My soon to be ex-wife and I are trying mediation, but she has already been very difficult and I don't have high hopes.  We have two kids and I expect her to fight me hard for an equal share of custody.  I left the mediator a message on Friday, but he never responded.  For mediators or those who have gone through mediation before, what can I expect in the first meeting?  How should I prepare?	No
"I'm in MD, currently kids are visiting their dad in FL.     To make a long story short (and less identifying) there is an INSANE amount of inappropriate stuff going on at the fathers house where my 2 young children are staying, where they are currently on their court ordered visitation for the next few weeks.  I understand different houses have different rules, and I can't ""make"" their father do anything.  But in light of gathering some actual evidence of how out of control this is, am I legally allowed to record a conversation with my kid if they know they are recorded?  My guess is as minors the answer is I would need permission from their legal guardian, but since that's me I don't see it being an issue?  Or would their father have to consent?      Custody order is in MD, I have legal tie breaking authority.  Basically I have the final say over the kids well being education, health, etc wise."	No
I am about to close on a condo and am wondering whether to shell out $2,500 for title insurance. The condo is less than 10 years old and has had the same owner since it was built. These factors make me think it's not necessary. Title research also came back clean.  I have a legal plan through work that should cover the cost of any negotiation or litigation arising from title or boundary disputes. So I'm not worried about legal fees, only settlement/judgment fees.  Also, the bank is not requiring title insurance.  Would appreciate everyone's thoughts on getting the insurance in light of these factors!	No
I'm in Arkansas.   Living in a triplex I guess. It's a house split into 3 separate places for rent. All the water is connected but on separate bills and stuff.  Turns out there is a leak in a pipe underground and it's been running our meter. The neighbor in one of the other spaces said he asked the guy how much it leaked and he said 17,000 gallons i think  and it would probably be a $450 bill in water alone. That's like 4 times our water and electric bill alone.  The neighbor said to make sure the landlords don't try to stick us with the bill, but I was thinking what could we legally do if they tried? We probably can't afford that but if they say it's our problem, would they technically be right? Or because it's all connected should they be liable for it? Our neighbor even said he told the landlord that there was a leak because he had somebody look under the house but the landlord said it was just rainwater so it would be ok. And this was months ago.   Thanks for any help	No
I'm planning to ask my HOA for permission to install solar panels. The Declaration doesn't to mention solar panels. Can the HOA use its general power to disallow solar panels when the Declaration doesn't to mention solar panels on the back side of my roof? My house is on the edge of the neighborhood.  It is two stories high so no one will even be able to see the roof when standing in the neighborhood. I've heard the HOA has previously rejected proposals to install solar panels. But I can't think of a reason they could conjure up to reject me because they won't be visible. It seems such a decision would be arbitrary and capricious. Do it's decisions have to have a rational basis?	No
"Im being asked to sign a custody agreement. Im being told that I can bring this matter back to the court in a year. However, in big bold letters and a lager font than the rest of the document it reads ""THIS AGREEMENT IS NOT SUBJECT TO REVOCATION"" under that it says As part of the consideration herein, tge parties acknowledge that this agreement is binding and not subject to revocation.   My ex whom im having a hard time trusting said that was put in for me, so visitation can never be withheld.  can someone please help me understand if i sign this agreement, would I be able to change it in 12 mos?"	No
"I know someone who complains about their situation a bit, but I do not think they have actually gone to a lawyer about it, so I thought I would google a bit. I can see why they feel hopeless. I have no background in law or ethics, so I thought I would ask your advice. I am hoping that people can educate me so I do not voice stupid brainstorming ideas when it comes up in conversation. It seems like SURELY something can be done, but I ask dumb questions like ""Did you ever consider ___"" and I feel bad. For what it is worth they have owned the property for 10+ years and each live in one half. With a recent career change, it is impossible to pay the mortgage not to mention maintain the 100 year old property.  Advice I saw online: *Convert duplex to condos (not sure the point of this, plus how?). *Convert to tenants in common (how exactly? by converting to a condo?). *Stop paying the mortgage and either the other party will be more interested in buying him out for $0 or it will go into foreclosure. This just sounds like the natural course of things when you do not have enough money to pay your bills. *Even if the other party were willing to buy out for $0, they do not want to and they may not qualify for the mortgage on their own. *Call mortgage company directly and ask what options are, maybe the other person will not need to refinance making it more appealing (but it does not sound like it matters because they do not want to give up on their failed plans). *File a Petition to Partition (which requires talking to a lawyer). *Bankruptcy (sounds like it might ruin both lives). *One of them dies.  Of all these hoping for a tornado sounds best, or maybe a strong fracking earthquake. I know I have hoped for those when dealing with an upside down mortgage in probate.  Thank you for your opinions in advance."	No
"I divorced my spouse July of last year and part of the settlement involved being awarded a portion of their 401k. The 401k was operated by the local chapter of their union.   In December of last year the provider of the 401k merged with the international chapter's 401k provider and since then noone seems willing or able to help me.  I've been told to basically stop calling/emailing the international chapter's investment department as ""we've not received the final calculations from the previous provider and cannot give you an update""  What, if anything, can I do to compel them to follow the court order?"
