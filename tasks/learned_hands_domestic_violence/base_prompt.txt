Does the post discuss dealing with domestic violence and abuse, including getting protective orders, enforcing them, understanding abuse, reporting abuse, and getting resources and status if there is abuse?

Post: Long story short when I was younger my mother cheated on my father with a new man who would do drugs together with my mom and abuse her right infront of me. My mother would never press charges and always go to court to get custody to see me, this happened around when I was 10 or so and when I lived in PA. I am 18 now and live in NY. I have not contacted her in a long time, she has always mailed letters but I never respond neither do my 11 or 16 year old siblings. Recently in the mail we got a summons saying we must speak to her at certain times during certain days with a video call. I know she has tried to do this in the past and she would lie and say that my biological father (the one my siblings and I live with in NY) would either not give us the letters as he is required to do, or say he is saying bad things about her ( he never talks about her) I feel like she is going to do that again, but I know I am 18 and legally dont have to talk to her, I feel she will pin some junk on me anyway.   What I am asking is, is there anyway for me to I dont know the term really, sue? counter suit? anyway is there anyway for me to get financial compensation for the mental abuse she has caused me and the damages it has done to my life. I am 18, and I recently started therapy again ( I have always been scared to do therapy ) and so far it is great, unfortunately I was diagnosed with PTSD and depression from the trauma she has put me though. One year ago I tried to work a full time job and I could not mentally handle it and had to leave, the following fall into winter I was accepted into a 4 year Civil Engineering study at college but same story, my PTSD got the best of me and I had to leave. These are just 2 of the many many many marks she has left one me . She has destroyed my life. Is there anything I can do to get her off my back and end this once and for all. Like get some sort of financial compensation, and move far away.

Post: Recently my sister's friend confronted her ex, and father of her child, and he made claims about wanting to kill my sister, strangling his other children, and made a bunch of other threatening comments. Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney.  Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?

Post: Texas.  Spouse out earns me by double. Just found he has not paid the mortgage in 3 months. Trying to force a short sale (mortgage is not in my name , house has joint deed).   I have been living in the master closet with a dresser barricading the door for several weeks, after he broke the lock on the master and removed the door. He had been living in a room on the first floor. we had been trying to finish renovations on the house. Half of the second floor is subflooring at this time. Tile and carpet are onsite, but not installed. I have been trying to find someone to do the work cash at closing, but have been unsuccessful. The realtor tells me this is a $40,000 difference in listing price. I have $400 left to my name as the rest was earmarked for our daughter and in   a joint account, which he not only drained, but overdrafted 400 yesterday. BOA let him take the money from the ATM knowing it would overdraft.   He has left the state for business, will be gone at least 4 weeks. I stupidly resisted calling the police despite escalating violence and clear indicators of eroding sanity (hears voices, claims I caused a stroke from 2000 miles away) for a number of reasons. We have been married 24 years, I didn't think it could get this bad. When I suggested help he threatened any EMS or police and started making paranoid comments about "taking someone out." When I tried to reach out to a divorce lawyer and filled out  the form online, I did not hear from the law firm, but did get an email from an address I didn't recognize with the information I had sent attached and a threat that I should not pursue this avenue.   He has broken bones, threatened me, choked me, and calmly explained that I caused it. Even to the point of saying I broke my own hand. He tried to get me to help him cut his own jugular or to call the police so they would shoot him. I refused. I did finally file a report with the police, and will be at the courthouse Monday for a protection order.  My mother died recently, my dad is dying, I don't have anyone to turn to. I took out a loan from my 401k several months ago and sold my car, the proceeds went into the renovations. If he forces the short sale I don't know how I will get a divorce, a car, a place, or back on my feet. My job is fulltime, project based. currently no job for the next few weeks. $925 every 2 weeks from unemployment. I have no access to his funds. I am continuing to work on the house and am working on continuing education as I have an expired teaching licence. Until recently spouse traveled for work about 11 months a year, I was sole parent to a high maintenance child, and caring for my mom. Child is a recent high school graduate and lives elsewhere for the moment. The point is, I am working to fix the financial reality. I am an educated professional and a bit disgusted with myself that I allowed this to happen.  Maybe some of that is not relevant, i'll admit I am not thinking clearly. Fundamentally, what can I do about the house???

Post: We have had water damage in our bathroom ceiling for over two weeks and I have contacted the landlord once via text and once via a letter. when we texted she said she would send someone but never did, and she has not responded to my letter yet, although its only been two days. We have been planning to move soon (which the landlord knows), but now we are considering leaving at the end of the month and forfeiting our security deposit.the problem is that seems wrong to me because it feels like we are legally in the right. I have looked at the RTA but I still do not know the legality of leaving or how long she has to fix something like water damage. any legal help is appreciated as I do not know how to proceed and I am worried she will come after us for rent if we bail without giving a months notice.

Post: Hi r/legaladvice,  I was helping my grandparents organize their finances and 1 item that stuck out was that my grandmother has a credit card exclusively in her name with a balance of about $5K. She has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and a lot of this balance is due to recurring payments/bills that never got cancelled along with the interest that goes to that. At the time she was diagnosed the balance was around $2K or so. We plan on paying this off in some way as this is a valid debt in the grand scheme of things.  I want to point out again that this credit car was only in my grandmother's name - not my grandfather's - until a month ago. A few months prior my grandfather pointed out to the bank that she has had Alzheimer's for 6 years and that the card was in her name exclusively. Shortly after this communication they put the debt on his credit report (it wasn't on there prior).  Is this legal for them to do that? If not, what should we do? I want to complain to the regulators (i.e. OCC, CFPB, and the State Attorney General)- if I say that I will complain about them to regulators if they don't fix this is it blackmail? I haven't had an issue like this before and want to do things the right way here.  Thanks!

Post: **Background:** I am a 27 year old female. I have been with my now ex boyfriend for about 6 years. I was a stay at home mom to his special needs child from another marriage for about 4 of thous years. Very unexpectedly 4 days ago he decided that when he returned from deployment we would no longer be together. Since then I made a post on /r/personal finance discussing my financial status and asking for advice on how to get on my own two feet again. Many responses urged me to seek legal advice and try to get my ex boyfriend to pay me more than what he is offering me. **I do not wish to take him to court. I am happy with what he is offering.** However, due to the nature of him being deployed and me still living in his home until he returns I am seeking advice on how to cover my ass legally so to speak.   **Details:**    - Location: Virginia Beach, VA    - He and his ex wife and her new husband are all active duty Navy     - He bought the home himself I am not legally tied to it in any way    - The only account of his that my name is on is our cell phone bill, and I have a solid plan on how to exit that smoothly    - He has offered to let me stay in the house until he returns from deployment in September    - Neither one of us are petty, spiteful, nor hateful people- but shit happens and we are trying to deal with it maturely     - There has been no talk of taking legal action and I don't think there will be but I'd rather be protected rather than naive     - Due to a job offer I may be out of the house sooner than he would like (by about 4-6 weeks depending on his return date) and will find proper temporary housing for our.. well now his dog.      - If at all possible I would like to never have to see him face to face again.    **My Current Plan**    - Make an itemized list of what I am taking from the house    - Have a witness present when I remove items from the house    - Have witness do a walk through of the condition of the house     - record walk through on video and send it to him before he returns    - ask his ex wife to take the dog temporarily until he returns    - discuss prior to me leaving landscaping plans with my ex       - I will surrender the keys to his ex wife with his written permission. **My Questions**    - Will the ex wife be a reliable choice as a witness or do I require someone less bias (she loves me and has a healthy amount of hate for him)? Or should I ask the next door neighbor? (we're not close and sharing something so personal with him seems very odd but he is someone we both would trust to stay impartial)    - speaking of written proof, do emails and facebook messages count?    -  is there anything else I should be thinking of to make sure I am protected in this situation?    **THANK YOU** Thank you so much for your advice, help, and support in advance.
