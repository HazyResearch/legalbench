0	"Context: Editorial: The structure of the present school calendar was established to satisfy the requirements of early-twentieth-century agricultural life. In those days, farmers needed their children to have long breaks during which they could remain at home and help with the harvest. The contemporary school year is thus made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. But agricultural life no longer occupies most of our citizens, so we can now make changes that serve the interests of children. Therefore, long breaks should be removed from the school calendar. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends? 
 (0) During long breaks children have a tendency to forget what they have learned. (1) Children of farmers need to continue observing a school calendar made up of periods of study interspersed with long breaks. (2) Long breaks in the school calendar should be replaced with breaks that are no longer than workers' average vacations. (3) A change in the present school calendar that shortened breaks would serve the interests of agricultural life. (4) A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks. 
 Answer:"	(4) A school calendar made up of periods of study without long breaks would serve the interests of children more than a school calendar with long breaks.
1	"Context: Leatherbacks, the largest of the sea turtles, when subjected to the conditions of captivity, are susceptible to a wide variety of fatal diseases with which they would never come in contact if they lived in the wild. It is surprising, therefore, that the likelihood that a leatherback will reach its theoretical maximum life expectancy is about the same whether that animal is living in captivity or in the wild. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy? 
 (0) Fewer diseases attach leatherbacks than attack other large aquatic reptiles. (1) The average life expectancy of sea turtles in general is longer than that of almost all other marine animals. (2) Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators. (3) Few zoologists have sufficient knowledge to establish an artificial environment that is conducive to the well-being of captive leatherbacks. (4) The size of a leatherback is an untrustworthy indicator of its age. 
 Answer:"	(2) Most leatherbacks that perish in the wild are killed by predators.
2	"Context: Chairperson: The board of directors of our corporation should not allow the incentives being offered by two foreign governments to entice us to expand our operations into their countries without further consideration of the issue. Although there is an opportunity to increase our profits by expanding our operations there, neither of these countries is politically stable. 
 Question: The chairperson's reasoning most closely conforms to which one of the following principles? 
 (0) A corporation should never expand operations into countries that are politically unstable. (1) Corporations should expand operations into countries when there is a chance of increasing profits. (2) Political stability is the most important consideration in deciding whether to expand operations into a country. (3) Corporations should always be cautious about expanding operations into politically unstable countries. (4) Boards of directors should always disregard governmental incentives when considering where to expand corporate operations. 
 Answer:"	(3) Corporations should always be cautious about expanding operations into politically unstable countries.
3	"Context: Maria: Thomas Edison was one of the most productive inventors of his time, perhaps of all time. His contributions significantly shaped the development of modern lighting and communication systems. Yet he had only a few months of formal schooling. Therefore, you do not need a formal education to make crucial contributions to technological advancement. Frank: That is definitely not true anymore. Since Edison's day there have been many new developments in technology; to make crucial contributions today you need much more extensive technical knowledge than was needed then. 
 Question: Frank's reasoning in his response to Maria is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) fails to address the possibility that technical knowledge may be acquired without formal education (1) does not consider whether there have been improvements in formal education since Edison's day (2) relies on using the term ""crucial"" differently from the way Maria used it (3) presumes that no other inventor of Edison's time could have been as productive as Edison (4) fails to criticize or question any of Maria's statements about Edison 
 Answer:"	(0) fails to address the possibility that technical knowledge may be acquired without formal education
4	"Context: In some countries, there is a free flow of information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, whereas in other countries, this information is controlled by a small elite. In the latter countries, the vast majority of the population is denied vital information about factors that determine their welfare. Thus, these countries are likely to experience more frequent economic crises than other countries do. 
 Question: The conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) It is more likely that people without political power will suffer from economic crises than it is that people in power will. (1) Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases. (2) In nations in which the government controls access to information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry, economic crises are common. (3) The higher the percentage of the population that participates in economic decisions, the better those decisions are. (4) A small elite that controls information about infrastructure, agriculture, and industry is likely to manipulate that information for its own benefit. 
 Answer:"	(1) Economic crises become more frequent as the amount of information available to the population about factors determining its welfare decreases.
5	"Context: Hana said she was not going to invite her brothers to her birthday party. However, among the gifts Hana received at her party was a recording in which she had expressed an interest. Since her brothers had planned to give her that recording, at least some of Hana's brothers must have been among the guests at Hana's birthday party after all. 
 Question: A reasoning error in the argument is that the argument 
 (0) disregards the possibility that a change of mind might be justified by a change in circumstances (1) treats the fact of someone's presence at a given event as a guarantee that that person had a legitimate reason to be at that event (2) uses a term that is intrinsically evaluative as though that term was purely descriptive (3) fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people (4) overlooks the possibility that a person's interest in one kind of thing is compatible with that person's interest in a different kind of thing 
 Answer:"	(3) fails to establish that something true of some people is true of only those people

 (0) If you have some keyboarding skills, you will be able to write your essays using a word processing program. (1) If you are not able to write your essays using a word processing program, you have no keyboarding skills. (2) If you are able to write your essays using a word processing program, you have at least some keyboarding skills. (3) If you are able to use a computer, you will probably be able to write your essays using a word processing program. (4) If you are not able to write your essays using a word processing program, you are not able to use a computer. 
 Answer:"	(2) If you are able to write your essays using a word processing program, you have at least some keyboarding skills.
7	"Context: Rossi: It is undemocratic for people to live under a government in which their interests are not represented. So children should have the right to vote, since sometimes the interests of children are different from those of their parents. Smith: Granted, children's interests are not always the same as their parents'; governmental deficits incurred by their parents' generation will later affect their own generation's standard of living. But even if children are told about the issues affecting them, which is not generally the case, their conceptions of what can or should be done are too simple, and their time horizons are radically different from those of adults, so we cannot give them the responsibility of voting. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes Rossi's argument? 
 (0) It makes an appeal to a general principle. (1) It denies the good faith of an opponent. (2) It relies on evaluating the predictable consequences of a proposal. (3) It substitutes description for giving a rationale for a policy. (4) It employs a term on two different occasions in different senses. 
 Answer:"	(0) It makes an appeal to a general principle.

 Question: Smith's statements can most directly be used as part of an argument for which one of the following views? 
 (0) A democratic government does not infringe on the rights of any of its citizens. (1) Children have rights that must be respected by any political authority that rules over them. (2) News programs for children would give them enough information to enable them to vote in an informed way. (3) If there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted. (4) If parents do not adequately represent their children's interests in the political sphere, those interests will be adequately represented by someone else. 
 Answer:"	(3) If there are any limitations on full democracy that result from denying the vote to children, such limitations must be accepted.
9	"Context: To accommodate the personal automobile, houses are built on widely scattered lots far from places of work and shopping malls are equipped with immense parking lots that leave little room for wooded areas. Hence, had people generally not used personal automobiles, the result would have to have been a geography of modern cities quite different from the one we have now. 
 Question: The argument's reasoning is questionable because the argument 
 (0) infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause (1) infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that other facets of modern life resulted from that cause (2) overlooks the fact that many technological innovations other than the personal automobile have had some effect on the way people live (3) takes for granted that shopping malls do not need large parking lots even given the use of the personal automobile (4) takes for granted that people ultimately want to live without personal automobiles 
 Answer:"	(0) infers from the idea that the current geography of modern cities resulted from a particular cause that it could only have resulted from that cause
10	"Context: Many of the presidents and prime ministers who have had the most successful foreign policies had no prior experience in foreign affairs when they assumed office. Although scholars and diplomats in the sacrosanct inner circle of international affairs would have us think otherwise, anyone with an acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information can quickly learn to conduct a successful foreign policy. In fact, prior experience alone will be of little value to a foreign policymaker who lacks all three of these traits. 
 Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true? 
 (0) Scholars and diplomats have more experience in foreign affairs than most presidents and prime ministers bring to office. (1) Prior experience in foreign affairs is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy. (2) Prior experience in foreign affairs is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy. (3) An acute political sense, a disciplined temperament, and a highly developed ability to absorb and retain information are each necessary conditions for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy. (4) A president or prime minister with years of experience in foreign affairs will have a more successful foreign policy than one who does not have experience in foreign affairs. 
 Answer:"	(1) Prior experience in foreign affairs is neither a sufficient nor a necessary condition for a president or prime minister to have a successful foreign policy.
11	"Context: Navigation in animals is defined as the animal's ability to find its way from unfamiliar territory to points familiar to the animal but beyond the immediate range of the animal's senses. Some naturalists claim that polar bears can navigate over considerable distances. As evidence, they cite an instance of a polar bear that returned to its home territory after being released over 500 kilometers (300 miles) away. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the validity of the evidence offered in support of the naturalists' claim? 
 (0) The polar bear stopped and changed course several times as it moved toward its home territory. (1) The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route. (2) The route along which the polar bear traveled consisted primarily of snow and drifting ice. (3) Polar bears are only one of many species of mammal whose members have been known to find their way home from considerable distances. (4) Polar bears often rely on their extreme sensitivity to smell in order to scent out familiar territory. 
 Answer:"	(1) The site at which the polar bear was released was on the bear's annual migration route.
12	"Context: City council member: Despite the city's desperate need to exploit any available source of revenue, the mayor has repeatedly blocked council members' attempts to pass legislation imposing real estate development fees. It is clear that in doing so the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests. The mayor cites figures to show that, in the current market, fees of the size proposed would significantly reduce the number of building starts and thus, on balance, result in a revenue loss to the city. But the important point is that the mayor's family is heavily involved in real estate development and thus has a strong financial interest in the matter. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately and completely expresses the main conclusion of the city council member's argument? 
 (0) Imposing real estate development fees is the best way for the city to exploit the available sources of revenue. (1) The city would benefit financially from the passage of legislation imposing real estate development fees. (2) In blocking council members' attempts to impose real estate development fees, the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests. (3) Significantly reducing the number of building starts would not, on balance, result in revenue loss to the city. (4) The mayor's family has a strong financial interest in preventing the passage of legislation that would impose real estate development fees. 
 Answer:"	(2) In blocking council members' attempts to impose real estate development fees, the mayor is sacrificing the city's interests to personal interests.

But the important point is that the mayor's family is heavily involved in real estate development and thus has a strong financial interest in the matter. 
 Question: The reasoning in the city council member's argument is flawed because 
 (0) the issue of the mayor's personal interest in the proposed legislation is irrelevant to any assessment of the mayor's action with respect to that legislation (1) the mayor's course of action being personally advantageous is not inconsistent with the mayor's action being advantageous for the city (2) the council member's own absence of personal interest in the proposed legislation has not been established (3) that a person or a municipality has a need for something does not, in itself, establish that that person or that municipality has a right to that thing (4) the possibility remains open that the mayor's need to avoid loss of family revenue is as desperate as the city's need to increase municipal revenue 
 Answer:"	(1) the mayor's course of action being personally advantageous is not inconsistent with the mayor's action being advantageous for the city
14	"Context: Seemingly inconsequential changes in sea temperature due to global warming eventually result in declines in fish and seabird populations. A rise of just two degrees prevents the vertical mixing of seawater from different strata. This restricts the availability of upwelling nutrients to phytoplankton. Since zooplankton, which feed upon phytoplankton, feed the rest of the food chain, the declines are inevitable. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the statement that zooplankton feed upon phytoplankton? 
 (0) It is a hypothesis supported by the fact that phytoplankton feed on upwelling nutrients. (1) It is intended to provide an example of the ways in which the vertical mixing of seawater affects feeding habits. (2) It helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly. (3) It is offered as one reason that global warming must be curtailed. (4) It is offered in support of the idea that global warming poses a threat to all organisms. 
 Answer:"	(2) It helps show how global temperature changes affect larger sea animals indirectly.
15	"Context: Retailers that excel in neither convenience nor variety of merchandise tend not to be very successful. Yet many successful retailers excel in just one of the areas and meet competitors' standards for the other. Hence, a retailer's success need not depend on excellence in both areas. 
 Question: The structure of the reasoning in the argument above is most parallel to that in which one of the following? 
 (0) Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win long-distance races. Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary. (1) Bicyclists who have only average speed are unlikely to win short races, but in a long-distance race such bicyclists can win if they have better-built bicycles than average and better endurance than average. Therefore, most bicycle races are not won by bicyclists with above-average speed. (2) Excellence in a particular swimming stroke is not always necessary in order for a swimmer to win a race that requires each swimmer to use several different strokes in sequence, and many swimmers win these races without being the best at any of the strokes. Therefore, anyone who does excel at all the strokes is almost certain to win. (3) Apples that are neither especially firm nor especially flavorful are unsuitable for baking; yet while flavor is essential for both baking and eating, many flavorful apples that are soft are suitable for eating. Hence, the apples that are best for eating need not be both firm and flavorful. (4) Most plants that are neither ornamental nor edible are useless and are thus classified as weeds; yet many such plants are useful for purposes other than food or ornamentation, and are thus not classified as weeds. Hence, not all inedible and non-ornamental plants are weeds. 
 Answer:"	(0) Runners who have only average speed and endurance are unlikely to win long-distance races. Some long-distance champions, however, win by being above average in speed or endurance only; therefore, being above average in both speed and endurance is not necessary.
16	"Context: Detective: Because the embezzler must have had specialized knowledge and access to internal financial records, we can presume that the embezzler worked for XYZ Corporation as either an accountant or an actuary. But an accountant would probably not make the kind of mistakes in ledger entries that led to the discovery of the embezzlement. Thus it is likely that the embezzler is one of the actuaries. 
 Question: Each of the following weakens the detective's argument EXCEPT: 
 (0) The actuaries' activities while working for XYZ Corporation were more closely scrutinized by supervisors than were the activities of the accountants. (1) There is evidence of breaches in computer security at the time of the embezzlement that could have given persons outside XYZ Corporation access to internal financial records. (2) XYZ Corporation employs eight accountants, whereas it has only two actuaries on its staff. (3) An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement. (4) Certain security measures at XYZ Corporation made it more difficult for the actuaries to have access to internal financial records than for the accountants. 
 Answer:"	(3) An independent report released before the crime took place concluded that XYZ Corporation was vulnerable to embezzlement.
17	"Context: Until 1985 all commercial airlines completely replenished the cabin air in planes in flight once every 30 minutes. Since then the rate has been once every hour. The less frequently cabin air is replenished in a plane in flight, the higher the level of carbon dioxide in that plane and the easier it is for airborne illnesses to be spread. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) In 1985 there was a loosening of regulations concerning cabin air in commercial airline flights. (1) People who fly today are more likely to contract airborne illnesses than were people who flew prior to 1985. (2) Low levels of carbon dioxide in cabin air make it impossible for airborne illnesses to spread. (3) In 1980 the rate at which the cabin air was replenished in commercial airliners was sufficient to protect passengers from the effects of carbon dioxide buildup. (4) In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight. 
 Answer:"	(4) In 1980 the level of carbon dioxide in the cabin air on a two-hour commercial airline flight was lower than it is today on a similar flight.
18	"Context: There is no genuinely altruistic behavior. Everyone needs to have sufficient amount of self-esteem, which crucially depends on believing oneself to be useful and needed. Behavior that appears to be altruistic can be understood as being motivated by the desire to reinforce that belief, a clearly self-interested motivation. 
 Question: A flaw in the argument is that it 
 (0) presupposes that anyone who is acting out of self-interest is being altruistic (1) illicitly infers that behavior is altruistic merely because it seems altruistic (2) fails to consider that self-esteem also depends on maintaining an awareness of one's own value (3) presumes, without providing justification, that if one does not hold oneself in sufficient self-esteem one cannot be useful or needed (4) takes for granted that any behavior that can be interpreted as self-interested is in fact self-interested 
 Answer:"	(4) takes for granted that any behavior that can be interpreted as self-interested is in fact self-interested
19	"Context: Current maps showing the North American regions where different types of garden plants will flourish are based on weather data gathered 60 years ago from a few hundred primitive weather stations. New maps are now being compiled using computerized data from several thousand modern weather stations and input from home gardeners across North America. These maps will be far more useful. 
 Question: Each of the following, if true, helps to support the claim that the new maps will be more useful EXCEPT: 
 (0) Home gardeners can provide information on plant flourishing not available from weather stations. (1) Some of the weather stations currently in use are more than 60 years old. (2) Weather patterns can be described more accurately when more information is available. (3) Weather conditions are the most important factor in determining where plants will grow. (4) Weather patterns have changed in the past 60 years. 
 Answer:"	(1) Some of the weather stations currently in use are more than 60 years old.
20	"Context: A smoker trying to quit is more likely to succeed if his or her doctor greatly exaggerates the dangers of smoking. Similar strategies can be used to break other habits. But since such strategies involve deception, individuals cannot easily adopt them unless a doctor or some other third party provides the warning. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
 (0) People tend to believe whatever doctors tell them. (1) Most of the techniques that help people quit smoking can also help people break other habits. (2) The more the relevant danger is exaggerated, the more likely one is to break one's habit. (3) People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves. (4) A doctor is justified in deceiving a patient whenever doing so is likely to make the patient healthier. 
 Answer:"	(3) People generally do not find it easy to deceive themselves.
21	"Context: Most people who shop for groceries no more than three times a month buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. In Hallstown most people shop for groceries no more than three times a month. Therefore, in Hallstown most people buy prepared frozen dinners regularly. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments has a flawed pattern of reasoning most like the flawed reasoning in the argument above? 
 (0) It is clear that most drivers in West Ansland are safe drivers since there are very few driving accidents in West Ansland and most accidents there are not serious. (1) It is clear that John cannot drive, since he does not own a car and no one in his family who does not own a car can drive. (2) It is clear that Fernando's friends usually drive to school, since all of his friends can drive and all of his friends go to school. (3) It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work. (4) It is clear that most of Janine's friends are good drivers, since she accepts rides only from good drivers and she accepts rides from most of her friends. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is clear that most people in Highland County drive sedans, since most people who commute to work drive sedans and most people in Highland County commute to work.
22	"Context: Editorial: This political party has repeatedly expressed the view that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal. On other occasions, however, the same party has claimed that the government should not increase spending on education. So this party's policy is clearly inconsistent. 
 Question: The argument in the editorial depends on assuming which one of the following? 
 (0) It is inconsistent for a legislator both to claim that increasing spending on education is a worthy goal and to vote against increasing spending on education. (1) A consistent course of action in educational policy is usually the course of action that will reduce spending on education in the long run. (2) Even if a goal is a morally good one, one should not necessarily try to achieve it. (3) A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed. (4) Members of one political party never have inconsistent views on how to best approach a political issue. 
 Answer:"	(3) A consistent political policy does not hold that an action that comprises a worthy goal should not be performed.
23	"Context: Science journalist: Brown dwarfs are celestial objects with more mass than planets but less mass than stars. They are identified by their mass and whether or not lithium is present in their atmospheres. Stars at least as massive as the Sun have lithium remaining in their atmospheres because the mixing of elements in their internal nuclear furnaces is incomplete. Stars with less mass than the Sun have no lithium because the element has been fully mixed into their nuclear furnaces and consumed. A brown dwarf does not have a fully functional nuclear furnace and so its lithium cannot be consumed. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the science journalist's statements? 
 (0) Any celestial object without lithium in its atmosphere is a star with less mass than the Sun. (1) Any celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has a nuclear furnace that has incompletely mixed the object's elements. (2) No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf. (3) No celestial object with lithium in its atmosphere has less mass than the Sun. (4) No celestial object less massive than a brown dwarf has lithium in its atmosphere. 
 Answer:"	(2) No celestial object that has no lithium in its atmosphere is a brown dwarf.
24	"Context: Native speakers perceive sentences of their own language as sequences of separate words. But this perception is an illusion. This is shown by the fact that travelers who do not know a local language hear an unintelligible, uninterrupted stream of sound, not sentences with distinct words. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
 (0) It is impossible to understand sentences if they are in fact uninterrupted streams of sound. (1) Those who do not know a language cannot hear the way speech in that language actually sounds. (2) People pay less close attention to the way their own language sounds than they do to the way an unfamiliar language sounds. (3) Accomplished non-native speakers of a language do not perceive sentences as streams of sound. (4) Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language. 
 Answer:"	(4) Native speakers' perceptions of their own language are not more accurate than are the perceptions of persons who do not know that language.
25	"Context: Yuriko: Our city's campaign to persuade parents to have their children vaccinated ought to be imitated by your city. In the 16 months since the enactment of legislation authorizing the campaign, vaccinations in our city have increased by 30 percent. Susan: But the major part of that increase occurred in the first 6 months after that legislation was enacted, right after your city's free neighborhood health clinics opened, and before the vaccination campaign really got going. 
 Question: In responding to Yuriko, Susan does which one of the following? 
 (0) She denies Yuriko's assumption that Susan's city wants to increase the vaccination rate for children. (1) She cites facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation. (2) She introduces evidence to show that the campaign Yuriko advocates is only effective for a short period to time. (3) She advances the claim that a campaign such as Yuriko recommends is not necessary because most parents already choose to have their children vaccinated. (4) She presents evidence to suggest that vaccination campaigns are usually ineffective. 
 Answer:"	(1) She cites facts that tend to weaken the force of the evidence with which Yuriko supports her recommendation.
26	"Context: The process by which nylon is manufactured releases large amounts of the gas nitrous oxide, which is harmful to the environment. Since the processing of cotton fiber does not release environmentally harmful gases, there would be less environmental damage done if cotton fiber rather than nylon were used to make products such as thread and rope. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would weaken the argument? 
 (0) Even if the quantity of nitrous oxide released into the environment decreased, many environmental problems would remain unsolved. (1) Even if only some of the thread and rope that is currently being made from nylon were instead made from cotton fiber, some environmental damage would be avoided. (2) If cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, there would be a resulting increase in the amount of nylon used in other manufactured products. (3) If the quantity of nylon manufactured annually decreased substantially, the volume of several pollutants that are released into the environment during its manufacture would be reduced. (4) If thread and rope continue to be made from nylon, the production of cotton fiber will not increase as rapidly as it would if all thread and rope were to be made from cotton fiber. 
 Answer:"	(2) If cotton fiber replaced nylon in the production of thread and rope, there would be a resulting increase in the amount of nylon used in other manufactured products.
27	"Context: John: It was wrong of you to blame me for that traffic accident. You know full well that the accident was due to my poor vision, and I certainly cannot be held responsible for the fact that my vision has deteriorated. Michiko: But I can hold you responsible for your hazardous driving, because you know how poor your vision is. People are responsible for the consequences of actions that they voluntarily undertake, if they know that those actions risk such consequences. 
 Question: The principle that Michiko invokes, if established, would justify which one of the following judgments? 
 (0) Colleen was responsible for missing her flight home from Paris, because she decided to take one more trip to the Eiffel Tower even though she knew she might not have sufficient time to get to the airport if she did so. (1) Colleen was responsible for having offended her brother when she reported to him an offensive comment made about his colleague, although she did not know her brother would mistakenly understand the comment to be about himself. (2) Colleen was responsible for her automobile's having been stolen two weeks ago, because she did not take any of the precautions that the town police recommended in the antitheft manual they published last week. (3) Colleen was responsible for her cat's being frightened, because, even though it was her brother who allowed the door to slam shut, she knew that cats are often frightened by loud noises. (4) Colleen was not responsible for losing her job, because, knowing that her position was in danger of being eliminated, she did everything possible to preserve it. 
 Answer:"	(0) Colleen was responsible for missing her flight home from Paris, because she decided to take one more trip to the Eiffel Tower even though she knew she might not have sufficient time to get to the airport if she did so.
28	"Context: Psychiatrist: Take any visceral emotion you care to consider. There are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express that emotion. So, there are always situations in which it is healthy to try to express one's anger. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Anger is always expressible. (1) Anger is a visceral emotion. (2) Some kinds of emotions are unhealthy to express. (3) All emotions that are healthy to express are visceral. (4) An emotion is visceral only if it is healthy to express. 
 Answer:"	(1) Anger is a visceral emotion.
29	"Context: Cigarette companies claim that manufacturing both low-and high-nicotine cigarettes allows smokers to choose how much nicotine they want. However, a recent study has shown that the levels of nicotine found in the blood of smokers who smoke one pack of cigarettes per day are identical at the end of a day's worth of smoking, whatever the level of nicotine in the cigarettes they smoke. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the finding of the nicotine study? 
 (0) Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available. (1) Smokers of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available generally smoke more cigarettes per day than smokers of high-nicotine cigarettes. (2) Most nicotine is absorbed into the blood of a smoker even if it is delivered in smaller quantities. (3) The level of tar in cigarettes is higher in low-nicotine cigarettes than it is in some high-nicotine cigarettes. (4) When taking in nicotine by smoking cigarettes is discontinued, the level of nicotine in the blood decreases steadily. 
 Answer:"	(0) Blood cannot absorb more nicotine per day than that found in the smoke from a package of the lowest-nicotine cigarettes available.
30	"Context: Editorial: The premier's economic advisor assures her that with the elimination of wasteful spending the goal of reducing taxes while not significantly decreasing government services can be met. But the premier should not listen to this advisor, who in his youth was convicted of embezzlement. Surely his economic advice is as untrustworthy as he is himself, and so the premier should discard any hope of reducing taxes without a significant decrease in government services. 
 Question: Which one of the following is a questionable argumentative strategy employed in the editorial's argument? 
 (0) rejecting a proposal on the grounds that a particular implementation of the proposal is likely to fail (1) trying to win support for a proposal by playing on people's fears of what could happen otherwise (2) criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself (3) taking lack of evidence for a claim as evidence undermining that claim (4) presupposing what it sets out to establish 
 Answer:"	(2) criticizing the source of a claim rather than examining the claim itself
31	"Context: Figorian Wildlife Commission: The development of wetlands in industrialized nations for residential and commercial uses has endangered many species. To protect wildlife we must regulate such development in Figoria: future wetland development must be offset by the construction of replacement wetland habitats. Thus, development would cause no net reduction of wetlands and pose no threat to the species that inhabit them. Figorian Development Commission: Other nations have flagrantly developed wetlands at the expense of wildlife. We have conserved. Since Figorian wetland development might not affect wildlife and is necessary for growth, we should allow development. We have as much right to govern our own resources as countries that have already put their natural resources to commercial use. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument advanced by the Figorian Wildlife Commission depends? 
 (0) More species have been endangered by the development of wetlands than have been endangered by any other type of development. (1) The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands. (2) In nations that are primarily agricultural, wetland development does not need to be regulated. (3) Figorian regulation of development has in the past protected and preserved wildlife. (4) The species that inhabit Figorian wetlands are among the most severely threatened of the designated endangered species. 
 Answer:"	(1) The species indigenous to natural wetland habitats will survive in specially constructed replacement wetlands.

 Question: Which one of the following principles, if accepted, would most strongly support the Figorian Development Commission's position against the Figorian Wildlife Commission's position? 
 (0) National resources should be regulated by international agreement when wildlife is endangered. (1) The right of future generations to have wildlife preserved supersedes the economic needs of individual nations. (2) Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage. (3) Environment regulation must aim at preventing any further environmental damage and cannot allow for the different degrees to which different nations have already harmed the environment. (4) It is imprudent to allow further depletion of natural resources. 
 Answer:"	(2) Only when a reduction of populations of endangered species by commercial development has been found should regulation be implemented to prevent further damage.
33	"Context: High blood cholesterol levels are bad for the heart. Like meat, eggs, and poultry, shellfish contains cholesterol. But shellfish is not necessarily bad for the heart; it is very low in saturated fat, which affects blood cholesterol levels much more than dietary cholesterol does. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) Meat and eggs are high in saturated fat. (1) Small quantities of foods high in saturated fat are not bad for the heart (2) Shellfish has less cholesterol per gram than meat, eggs, and poultry do. (3) Foods low in saturated fat promote low blood cholesterol. (4) A serving of meat or poultry is typically larger than a serving of shellfish. 
 Answer:"	(3) Foods low in saturated fat promote low blood cholesterol.
34	"Context: Every moral theory developed in the Western tradition purports to tell us what a good life is. However, most people would judge someone who perfectly embodied the ideals of any one of these theories not to be living a good life—the kind of life they would want for themselves and their children. 
 Question: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? 
 (0) Most people desire a life for themselves and their children that is better than a merely good life. (1) A person who fits the ideals of one moral theory in the Western tradition would not necessarily fit the ideals of another. (2) Most people have a conception of a good life that does not match that of any moral theory in the Western tradition. (3) A good life as described by moral theories in the Western tradition cannot be realized. (4) It is impossible to develop a theory that accurately describes what a good life is. 
 Answer:"	(2) Most people have a conception of a good life that does not match that of any moral theory in the Western tradition.
35	"Context: Biologist: Humans have five fingers because we descended from a fish with five phalanges in its fins. Despite our prejudices to the contrary, our configuration of fingers is no more or less useful than several other possible configurations, e.g., six per hand. So, if humans had descended from a fish with six phalanges in its fins and had six fingers on each hand, then we would be just as content with that configuration. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the biologist's argument? 
 (0) Everyone is equally content with our present configuration of fingers. (1) Humans are never equally content with two things of unequal usefulness. (2) Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness. (3) The perceived usefulness of our configuration of fingers is an illusory result of our prejudices. (4) At least one species of fish had six phalanges in its fins. 
 Answer:"	(2) Humans are always equally content with two things of equal usefulness.
36	"Context: Surrealist: Many artists mistakenly think that models need be taken only from outside the psyche. Although human sensibility can confer beauty upon even the most vulgar external objects, using the power of artistic representation solely to preserve and reinforce objects that would exist even without artists is an ironic waste. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion of the surrealist's argument? 
 (0) An artist's work should not merely represent objects from outside the psyche. (1) Artistic representation is used solely to preserve and reinforce objects. (2) Artists should not base all their work on mere representation. (3) Great art can confer beauty even upon very vulgar external objects. (4) True works of art rarely represent objects from outside the psyche. 
 Answer:"	(0) An artist's work should not merely represent objects from outside the psyche.
37	"Context: Harrold Foods is attempting to dominate the soft-drink market by promoting ""Hero,"" its most popular carbonated drink product, with a costly new advertising campaign. But survey results show that, in the opinion of 72 percent of all consumers, ""Hero"" already dominates the market. Since any product with more than 50 percent of the sales in a market is, by definition, dominant in that market, Harrold Foods dominates the market now and need only maintain its current market share in order to continue to do so. 
 Question: The argument commits which one of the following errors in reasoning? 
 (0) failing to exclude the possibility that what appears to be the result of a given market condition may in fact be the cause of that condition (1) mistaking a condition required if a certain result is to obtain for a condition that by itself is sufficient to guarantee that result (2) treating the failure to establish that a certain claim is false as equivalent to a demonstration that that claim is true (3) taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true (4) describing survey results that were obtained in the past as if they are bound to obtain in the future as well 
 Answer:"	(3) taking evidence that a claim is believed to be true to constitute evidence that the claim is in fact true
38	"Context: Theoretically, analog systems are superior to digital systems. A signal in a pure analog system can be infinitely detailed, while digital systems cannot produce signals that are more precise than their digital units. With this theoretical advantage there is a practical disadvantage, however. Since there is no limit on the potential detail of the signal, the duplication of an analog representation allows tiny variations from the original, which are errors. These errors tend to accumulate as signals are duplicated, until this ""noise"" obliterates the information embodied in the original signal. 
 Question: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? 
 (0) Many ideas that work well in theory do not work well in practice. (1) Analog representation of information is impractical because we do not need infinitely detailed information. (2) Digital systems are the best information systems because error cannot occur in the emission of digital signals. (3) Analog systems are inferior to digital systems for most practical purposes. (4) Digital systems are preferable to analog systems when the signal must be reproduced many times. 
 Answer:"	(4) Digital systems are preferable to analog systems when the signal must be reproduced many times.
39	"Context: Psychologist: Doctors should never prescribe sedatives for people with insomnia. Most cases of insomnia that psychologists treat are known to be caused by psychological stress. This suggests that insomniacs do not need drugs that alter their biochemistry, but rather need psychotherapy to help them alleviate the stress causing their insomnia. 
 Question: Each of the following describes a flaw in the psychologist's reasoning EXCEPT: 
 (0) It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress. (1) It fails to consider the possibility that sedatives are the only treatment known to be effective for cases of insomnia not caused by stress. (2) It neglects the possibility that for some people psychotherapy is a completely ineffective treatment for stress. (3) It overlooks the possibility that sedatives could help insomniacs cope with stress. (4) It presumes, without providing justification, that the cases of insomnia psychologists treat are representative of all cases of insomnia. 
 Answer:"	(0) It presumes, without providing warrant, that insomnia contributes to an inability to cope with stress.
40	"Context: Numerous paintings and engravings representing warfare can be found in remains of all civilizations going back to and including the Neolithic period, when agriculture was first developed. However, no paintings or engravings of warfare are found dating from before the Neolithic period. Therefore, warfare must have first developed as a result of the transition to an agricultural society. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) Paintings and engravings were the dominant forms of artistic expression during the Neolithic period. (1) Warfare in the Neolithic period was always motivated by territorial disputes over agricultural land. (2) There was no warfare prior to the period in which paintings and engravings of warfare were first created. (3) Warfare is the inevitable result of the development of a civilization. (4) Paintings and engravings of agricultural life began to be made at the same time as paintings and engravings of warfare. 
 Answer:"	(2) There was no warfare prior to the period in which paintings and engravings of warfare were first created.
41	"Context: An antidote for chicken pox has been developed, but researchers warn that its widespread use could be dangerous, despite the fact that this drug has no serious side effects and is currently very effective at limiting the duration and severity of chicken pox. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, helps most to reconcile the apparent discrepancy indicated above? 
 (0) The drug is extremely expensive and would be difficult to make widely available. (1) The drug has to be administered several times a day, so patient compliance is likely to be low. (2) The drug does not prevent the spread of chicken pox from one person to another, even when the drug eventually cures the disease in the first person. (3) When misused by taking larger-than-prescribed doses, the drug can be fatal. (4) Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug. 
 Answer:"	(4) Use of the drug contributes to the development of deadlier forms of chicken pox that are resistant to the drug.
42	"Context: The tendency toward overspecialization in the study of artifacts is unfortunate. Scholars can enhance their understanding of a certain artistic period by studying art from earlier periods that had a significant influence on it. For instance, because of its influence on Spanish artisans, a proper understanding of Arabic porcelain is indispensable for a proper understanding of Spanish porcelain. 
 Question: Of the following, which one most closely conforms to the principle that the passage as a whole illustrates? 
 (0) To understand completely the major trends in research on aging, one must understand the influences these trends exert on society's view of aging. (1) To understand fully the historical events of this century, a historian must have an understanding of similar events in earlier centuries. (2) To appreciate fully the French language, one must understand the other languages that share its linguistic ancestry. (3) To understand properly any academic discipline, one must have at least a superficial acquaintance with the practices of the wider academic community. (4) To understand completely Aristotle's philosophy, one must be well acquainted with the philosophy of his intellectual mentor, Plato. 
 Answer:"	(4) To understand completely Aristotle's philosophy, one must be well acquainted with the philosophy of his intellectual mentor, Plato.
43	"Context: Editorial: Medical schools spend one hour teaching preventive medicine for every ten hours spent teaching curative medicine, even though doctors' use of the techniques of preventive medicine cuts down medical costs greatly. Therefore, if their goal is to make medicine more cost-effective, medical schools spend insufficient time teaching preventive medicine. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the editorial's argument depends? 
 (0) Preventive medicine makes use of technologies that are lower in initial cost than the technologies used within the practice of curative medicine. (1) Every hour devoted to the teaching of preventive medicine reduces medical costs by 10 percent or more. (2) Medical schools could increase their total number of teaching hours. (3) Improvements in doctors' use of the techniques of curative medicine would only increase overall medical costs. (4) The time required to teach preventive medicine thoroughly is greater than one hour for every ten that are now spent teaching curative medicine. 
 Answer:"	(4) The time required to teach preventive medicine thoroughly is greater than one hour for every ten that are now spent teaching curative medicine.
44	"Context: Dana: It is wrong to think that the same educational methods should be used with all children. Many children have been raised in more communal environments than others and would therefore learn better through group, rather than individual, activities. A child's accustomed style of learning should always dictate what method is used. Pat: No, not always. The flexibility of being able to work either on one's own or in a group is invaluable in a world where both skills are in demand. 
 Question: The conversation lends the most support to the claim that Dana and Pat disagree on which one of the following? 
 (0) All children can learn valuable skills from individual activities. (1) All children should learn to adapt to various educational methods. (2) Many children would learn better through group, rather than individual, activities. (3) The main purpose of education is to prepare children to meet the demands of the job market as adults. (4) It is sometimes desirable to tailor educational methods to the way a child learns best. 
 Answer:"	(1) All children should learn to adapt to various educational methods.
45	"Context: Experimental psychology requires the application of statistics to interpret empirical data and assess their significance. A person will not be able to understand such applications without training in statistics. Therefore, the more training one has in statistics, the better one will be at research in experimental psychology. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments exhibits a flawed pattern of reasoning most similar to that exhibited by the argument above? 
 (0) Most people need the love and support of others; without it, they become depressed and unhappy. Therefore, in most instances, the more love and support a person receives, the happier that person will be. (1) Since in most jobs there are annual wage or salary increases, the longer one has worked, the more raises one will have received. Therefore, in a typical job, the longer one has worked, the greater one's income will be. (2) The main cause of heart attacks is arteriosclerosis, the buildup of plaque on the interior wall of the coronary arteries. It develops over an extended period of time. Therefore, if one is at risk for arteriosclerosis, one becomes more likely to suffer a heart attack as one gets older. (3) Since many disease processes are biochemical in nature, unless one understands chemistry one will not be able to understand the explanations for many diseases. Therefore, if one has no training in chemistry, one will not be able to master medicine. (4) Since most disease processes are biochemical in nature, an understanding of chemistry will enable one to understand most diseases. Therefore, one needs little more than training in chemistry to be able to master medicine. 
 Answer:"	(0) Most people need the love and support of others; without it, they become depressed and unhappy. Therefore, in most instances, the more love and support a person receives, the happier that person will be.
46	"Context: In 1988 the government of Country X began using a new computer program to determine the number of people employed in that country. The program simply tallied the number of paychecks per pay period issued by employers in X, and used that figure as its estimate of employment. The government reported that, compared with the immediately preceding quarter, there was a large increase in the number of people employed for the first quarter for which the program was used. 
 Question: Which one of the following can be properly concluded from the information above, together with the fact that in the first quarter for which the program was used, some employers in X issued separate paychecks for the regular hours an employee worked, for the employee's overtime, and for bonuses and commissions? 
 (0) The government's estimate of growth in the number of people employed was less accurate after the government began using the new program than it had been before. (1) The people who designed the new program were unaware of the fact that some workers in X receive more than one paycheck per pay period. (2) The government had not reported strong growth in the number of people employed for the quarters just before the new program was used. (3) The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used. (4) Contrary to the claims of the government of Country X, there was no growth in the number of people employed in X in the first quarter for which the program was used. 
 Answer:"	(3) The government overestimated the total number of people employed in X for the first quarter for which the program was used.
47	"Context: Some vegetarians have argued that there are two individually sufficient reasons for not eating meat— one based on health considerations, and the other based on the aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures. But suppose that eating meat were essential to good health for humans. Then it would be less clear that an aversion to living at the expense of other conscious creatures is enough of a reason to stop eating meat. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the supposition that eating meat is essential to good health? 
 (0) It is used to disprove the vegetarian position that we should not eat meat. (1) It is used to show that the two types of reasons cited in favor of vegetarianism are independent. (2) It is used to disprove the claim that a vegetarian diet is healthy. (3) It is used to weaken the claim that the consciousness of animals is a sufficient reason for not eating meat. (4) It is used to show that there is no sufficient reason for not eating meat. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is used to weaken the claim that the consciousness of animals is a sufficient reason for not eating meat.
48	"Context: The increasing complexity of scientific inquiry has led to a proliferation of multiauthored technical articles. Reports of clinical trials involving patients from several hospitals are usually coauthored by physicians from each participating hospital. Likewise, physics papers reporting results from experiments using subsystems developed at various laboratories generally have authors from each laboratory. 
 Question: If all the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true? 
 (0) Clinical trials involving patients from several hospitals are never conducted solely by physicians from just one hospital. (1) Most reports of clinical trials involving patients from several hospitals have multiple authors. (2) When a technical article has multiple authors, they are usually from several different institutions. (3) Physics papers authored by researchers from multiple laboratories usually report results from experiments using subsystems developed at each laboratory. (4) Most technical articles are authored solely by the researchers who conducted the experiments these articles report. 
 Answer:"	(1) Most reports of clinical trials involving patients from several hospitals have multiple authors.
49	"Context: Helena: Extroversion, or sociability, is not biologically determined. Children whose biological parents are introverted, when adopted by extroverts, tend to be more sociable than children of introverted parents who are not adopted. Jay: Your conclusion does not follow. Some of these children adopted by extroverts remain introverted no matter how young they are when adopted. 
 Question: Jay's response suggests that he interpreted Helena's remarks to mean that 
 (0) biological factors play only a partial role in a child being extroverted (1) most but not all children whose biological parents are introverted become extroverted when adopted by extroverts (2) children whose biological parents are introverted, when adopted by extroverts, tend not to be more sociable than children of introverted parents who are not adopted (3) biological factors do not play any role in a child being extroverted (4) environmental factors can sometimes be more influential than biological factors in determining extroversion 
 Answer:"	(3) biological factors do not play any role in a child being extroverted
50	"Context: Carl is clearly an incompetent detective. He has solved a smaller percentage of the cases assigned to him in the last 3 years—only 1 out of 25—than any other detective on the police force. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above? 
 (0) Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve. (1) Before he became a detective, Carl was a neighborhood police officer and was highly respected by the residents of the neighborhood he patrolled. (2) Detectives on the police force on which Carl serves are provided with extensive resources, including the use of a large computer database, to help them solve crimes. (3) Carl was previously a detective in a police department in another city, and in the 4 years he spent there, he solved only 1 out of 30 crimes. (4) Many of the officers in the police department in which Carl serves were hired or promoted within the last 5 years. 
 Answer:"	(0) Because the police chief regards Carl as the most capable detective, she assigns him only the most difficult cases, ones that others have failed to solve.
51	"Context: It is well documented that people have positive responses to some words, such as ""kind"" and ""wonderful,"" and negative responses to others, such as ""evil"" and ""nausea."" Recently, psychological experiments have revealed that people also have positive or negative responses to many nonsense words. This shows that people's responses to words are conditioned not only by what the words mean, but also by how they sound. 
 Question: The claim that people have positive or negative responses to many nonsense words plays which one of the following roles in the argument? 
 (0) It is a premise offered in support of the conclusion that people have either a positive or a negative response to any word. (1) It is a conclusion for which the only support provided is the claim that people's responses to words are conditioned both by what the words mean and by how they sound. (2) It is a generalization partially supported by the claim that meaningful words can trigger positive or negative responses in people. (3) It is a premise offered in support of the conclusion that people's responses to words are engendered not only by what the words mean, but also by how they sound. (4) It is a conclusion supported by the claim that people's responses under experimental conditions are essentially different from their responses in ordinary situations. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is a premise offered in support of the conclusion that people's responses to words are engendered not only by what the words mean, but also by how they sound.
52	"Context: People with high blood pressure are generally more nervous and anxious than are people who do not have high blood pressure. This fact shows that this particular combination of personality traits—the so-called hypertensive personality—is likely to cause a person with these traits to develop high blood pressure. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the ground that the argument 
 (0) fails to define the term ""hypertensive personality"" (1) presupposes that people have permanent personality traits (2) simply restates the claim that there is a ""hypertensive personality"" without providing evidence to support that claim (3) takes a correlation between personality traits and high blood pressure as proof that the traits cause high blood pressure (4) focuses on nervousness and anxiety only, ignoring other personality traits that people with high blood pressure might have 
 Answer:"	(3) takes a correlation between personality traits and high blood pressure as proof that the traits cause high blood pressure
53	"Context: In his book, published in 1892, Grey used the same metaphor that Jordan used in her book, which was published in 1885. The metaphor is so unusual that there is little chance that two different people independently created it. Therefore, it is highly likely that Grey read Jordan's book. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument? 
 (0) A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor. (1) The passage in Grey's book that employs the unusual metaphor expresses an idea that bears little relation to any ideas expressed in Jordan's book. (2) Both Grey's book and Jordan's book were written for the same audience. (3) Jordan used the same metaphor in a work that she wrote in 1894 and published in 1895. (4) According to most scholars, Grey was generally a more inventive writer than Jordan and developed many original metaphors. 
 Answer:"	(0) A text that was probably known to both Jordan and Grey was published in 1860 and also contained the same unusual metaphor.
54	"Context: Medical specialists report that patients with back muscle injuries who receive a combination of drugs and physical therapy do only as well as those who receive physical therapy alone. Yet the specialists state that drugs are a necessary part of the treatment of all patients who receive them for back muscle injuries. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to reconcile the medical specialists' two claims? 
 (0) Medical specialists treat all patients who have serious back muscle injuries with either physical therapy alone or a combination of drugs and physical therapy. (1) Medical specialists who prescribe these treatments make accurate judgments about who needs both drugs and physical therapy and who needs physical therapy alone. (2) Some back muscle injuries have been completely healed by a combination of drugs and physical therapy. (3) Some back muscle injuries that have been aggravated by improper attempts at physical therapy, such as home massage, have been successfully treated with drugs. (4) Patients with injuries to other muscles show more improvement when treated with both drugs and physical therapy than when treated with physical therapy alone. 
 Answer:"	(1) Medical specialists who prescribe these treatments make accurate judgments about who needs both drugs and physical therapy and who needs physical therapy alone.
55	"Context: Commentator: In many countries the influence of fringe movements is increasing. The great centrifugal engine of modern culture turns faster and faster, spinning off fashions, ideologies, religions, artistic movements, economic theories, cults, and dogmas in fabulous profusion. Hence, modern culture threatens the national identities that now exist in the world. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the commentator's argument? 
 (0) New national identities are often forged out of conflicts among diverse groups. (1) A stable national identity is typically a composite of a staggering number of subcultures. (2) The rate of cultural change in most countries will soon change drastically. (3) It is preferable to have a pluralistic rather than a monolithic national culture. (4) A culture with a solidified national identity tends to have more social problems than one without such an identity. 
 Answer:"	(1) A stable national identity is typically a composite of a staggering number of subcultures.
56	"Context: Packaging is vital to a product's commercial success. For example, the maker of a popular drink introduced a ""new, improved"" version which succeeded in blind taste tests. However, customers did not buy the product when marketed, mainly because the can, almost identical to that used for the earlier version of the beverage, made consumers expect that the new product would share certain features of the old, an expectation not satisfied by the new product. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) Proper product packaging is more important than the quality of the product. (1) Products generally succeed in the market if they are packaged in a manner that accurately reflects their nature. (2) Changing the packaging of a product will not improve the product's sales unless the product is also changed. (3) To succeed in the market, a new product should not be packaged in a way that creates expectations that it does not meet. (4) An improved version of an existing product will sell better than the earlier version unless the improved version is packaged like the earlier one. 
 Answer:"	(3) To succeed in the market, a new product should not be packaged in a way that creates expectations that it does not meet.
57	"Context: Larew: People in the lowest income quintile had a much higher percentage increase in average income over the last ten years than did those in the highest quintile. So their economic prosperity increased relative to the highest quintile's. Mendota: I disagree. The average income for the lowest quintile may have increased by a greater percentage, but the absolute amount of the increase in average income was surely greater for the highest quintile. 
 Question: Larew and Mendota disagree about whether 
 (0) change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income (1) change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile is more accurately measured in terms relative to the highest income quintile than in terms relative only to the lowest income quintile (2) changes in the average income of people in the lowest quintile should ever be compared to changes in the average income of people in the highest quintile (3) there were any improvements at all in the economic situation of those in the lowest income quintile during the ten years being considered (4) the average income of people in the lowest quintile increased by a greater percentage over the last decade than did that of people in the highest quintile 
 Answer:"	(0) change in the economic prosperity of the lowest income quintile relative to the highest is accurately measured by comparing their percentage changes in average income
58	"Context: Challenge can be an important source of self-knowledge, since those who pay attention to how they react, both emotionally and physically, to challenge can gain useful insights into their own weaknesses. 
 Question: Which one of the following most closely conforms to the principle above? 
 (0) A concert pianist should not have an entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance. By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances. (1) A salesperson should understand that the commission earned is not the only reward of making a sale. Salespeople should also take satisfaction from the fact that successful sales reflect well on their personalities. (2) Compassion is valuable not only for the wonderful feelings it brings, but also for the opportunities it affords to enrich the lives of other people. (3) While some of the value of competition comes from the pleasure of winning, the primary reward of competition is competition itself. (4) Even people who dread public speaking should accept invitations to speak before large groups. People will admire their courage and they will experience the fulfillment of having attempted something that is difficult for them. 
 Answer:"	(0) A concert pianist should not have an entirely negative view of a memory lapse during a difficult performance. By understanding why the memory lapse occurred, the pianist can better prepare for future performances.
59	"Context: In some countries, national planners have attempted to address the problems resulting from increasing urbanization by reducing migration from rural areas. But some economists have suggested an alternative approach. These economists assert that planners could solve these problems effectively by trading goods or services produced by a predominantly urban population in order to obtain the agricultural products that were previously produced domestically. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide the most support for the economists' assertion? 
 (0) Government subsidies to urban manufacturers can ease the problems caused by the migration of people from rural to urban areas. (1) All problems that have economic causes must have economic solutions. (2) A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization. (3) Problems associated with migration to cities from rural areas are primarily due to trade imbalances between countries. (4) Free trade policies can exacerbate the problems caused by increasing urbanization. 
 Answer:"	(2) A scarcity of agricultural products is a central element of many problems created by urbanization.
60	"Context: Inez: The book we are reading, The Nature of Matter, is mistitled. A title should summarize the content of the whole book, but nearly half of this book is devoted to discussing a different, albeit closely related subject: energy. Antonio: I do not think that the author erred; according to modern physics, matter and energy are two facets of the same phenomenon. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the conversation above? 
 (0) Inez believes that the book should be called The Nature of Energy. (1) Antonio believes that there are no differences between matter and energy. (2) Inez and Antonio disagree on whether matter and energy are related. (3) Inez and Antonio disagree about the overall value of the book. (4) Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy. 
 Answer:"	(4) Inez believes that the book's title should not mention matter without mentioning energy.
61	"Context: Politician:Those economists who claim that consumer price increases have averaged less than 3 percent over the last year are mistaken. They clearly have not shopped anywhere recently. Gasoline is up 10 percent over the last year; my auto insurance, 12 percent; newspapers, 15 percent; propane, 13 percent; bread, 50 percent. 
 Question: The reasoning in the politician's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) impugns the character of the economists rather than addressing their arguments (1) fails to show that the economists mentioned are not experts in the area of consumer prices (2) mistakenly infers that something is not true from the claim that it has not been shown to be so (3) uses evidence drawn from a small sample that may well be unrepresentative (4) attempts to persuade by making an emotional appeal 
 Answer:"	(3) uses evidence drawn from a small sample that may well be unrepresentative
62	"Context: Sherrie: Scientists now agree that nicotine in tobacco is addictive inasmuch as smokers who try to stop smoking suffer withdrawal symptoms. For this reason alone, tobacco should be treated the same way as other dangerous drugs. Governments worldwide have a duty to restrict the manufacture and sale of tobacco. Fran: By your own admission, ""addictive"" is broad enough to include other commonly consumed products, such as coffee and soft drinks containing caffeine. But of course the manufacture and sale of these products should not be restricted. 
 Question: The dialogue above lends the most support to the claim that Sherrie and Fran disagree with each other about which one of the following statements? 
 (0) The manufacture and sale of all drugs should be regulated by governments. (1) Coffee and soft drinks that contain caffeine should not be regulated by governments. (2) Agreement by scientists that a substance is addictive justifies government restrictions on products containing that substance. (3) Scientists are not proper authorities with respect to the question of whether a given substance is addictive. (4) Scientists and governments have a duty to cooperate in regulating drugs to protect the public health. 
 Answer:"	(2) Agreement by scientists that a substance is addictive justifies government restrictions on products containing that substance.
63	"Context: In 1963, a young macaque monkey was observed venturing into a hot spring to retrieve food which had fallen in. Soon, other macaques began to enter the spring, and over a few years this behavior was adopted by the entire troop. Prior to 1963, no macaques had ever been observed in the hot spring; by 1990, the troop was regularly spending time there during the winters. Thus, these macaques are able to adopt and pass on new patterns of social behavior, and are not complete captives of their genetic heritage. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument above? 
 (0) Mutations in the genetic heritage of a certain variety of macaques can occur over a time span as short as a few years or decades. (1) New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined. (2) Only when behaviors become typical among an animal population can we conclude that a genetic alteration has occurred in that variety or species. (3) The social behaviors of macaques are completely independent of their genetic heritage. (4) The macaques' new pattern of behavior will persist over several generations. 
 Answer:"	(1) New patterns of behavior that emerge in macaque populations over the course of a few years or decades are not necessarily genetically predetermined.
64	"Context: Technological innovation rarely serves the interests of society as a whole. This can be seen from the fact that those responsible for technological advances are almost without exception motivated by considerations of personal gain rather than societal benefit in that they strive to develop commercially viable technology. 
 Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) contains a premise that cannot possibly be true (1) takes for granted that technology beneficial to society as a whole cannot be commercially viable (2) fails to consider the possibility that actions motivated by a desire for personal gain often do not result in personal gain (3) takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome (4) draws a conclusion about the practical consequences of people's actions on the basis of theoretical views about what people should or should not do 
 Answer:"	(3) takes for granted that an action is unlikely to produce a certain outcome unless it is motivated by a desire to produce that outcome
65	"Context: There are two kinds of horror stories: those that describe a mad scientist's experiments and those that describe a monstrous beast. In some horror stories about monstrous beasts, the monster symbolizes a psychological disturbance in the protagonist. Horror stories about mad scientists, on the other hand, typically express the author's feeling that scientific knowledge alone is not enough to guide human endeavor. However, despite these differences, both kinds of horror stories share two features: they describe violations of the laws of nature and they are intended to produce dread in the reader. 
 Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following would also have to be true? 
 (0) All descriptions of monstrous beasts describe violations of the laws of nature. (1) Any story that describes a violation of a law of nature is intended to invoke dread in the reader. (2) Horror stories of any kind usually describe characters who are psychologically disturbed. (3) Most stories about mad scientists express the author's antiscientific views. (4) Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature. 
 Answer:"	(4) Some stories that employ symbolism describe violations of the laws of nature.
66	"Context: Politician: Some of my opponents have argued on theoretical grounds in favor of reducing social spending. Instead of arguing that there is excessive public expenditure on social programs, my opponents should focus on the main cause of deficit spending: the fact that government is bloated with bureaucrats and self-aggrandizing politicians. It is unwarranted, therefore, to reduce social expenditure. 
 Question: A reasoning flaw in the politician's argument is that the argument 
 (0) does not address the arguments advanced by the politician's opponents (1) makes an attack on the character of opponents (2) takes for granted that deficit spending has just one cause (3) portrays opponents' views as more extreme than they really are (4) fails to make clear what counts as excessive spending 
 Answer:"	(0) does not address the arguments advanced by the politician's opponents
67	"Context: While it is true that bees' vision is well suited to the task of identifying flowers by their colors, it is probable that flowers developed in response to the type of vision that bees have, rather than bees' vision developing in response to flower color. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strongly supports the statement above? 
 (0) Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color. (1) Some flowers rely on insects other than bees. (2) The number of different species of flowers is greater than the number of different species of bees. (3) Many nonflowering plants rely on bees. (4) Present-day bees rely exclusively on flowers for their food. 
 Answer:"	(0) Many insects that have vision very similar to that of bees do not depend on perceiving an object's color.
68	"Context: Professor: It has been argued that freedom of thought is a precondition for intellectual progress, because freedom of thought allows thinkers to pursue their ideas, regardless of whom these ideas offend, in whatever direction they lead. However, it is clear that one must mine the full implications of interrelated ideas to make intellectual progress, and for this, thinkers need intellectual discipline. Therefore, this argument for freedom of thought fails. 
 Question: The conclusion drawn by the professor follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Thinkers who limit their line of thought to a particular orthodoxy are hindered in their intellectual progress. (1) Thinkers can mine the full implications of interrelated ideas only in the context of a society that values intellectual progress. (2) In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline. (3) Freedom of thought engenders creativity, which aids the discovery of truth. (4) Without intellectual discipline, thinkers can have no freedom of thought. 
 Answer:"	(2) In societies that protect freedom of thought, thinkers invariably lack intellectual discipline.
69	"Context: People who have specialized knowledge about a scientific or technical issue are systematically excluded from juries for trials where that issue is relevant. Thus, trial by jury is not a fair means of settling disputes involving such issues. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
 (0) The more complicated the issue being litigated, the less likely it is that a juror without specialized knowledge of the field involved will be able to comprehend the testimony being given. (1) The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins. (2) Appointing an impartial arbitrator is not a fair means of settling disputes involving scientific or technical issues, because arbitrators tend to favor settlements in which both parties compromise on the issues. (3) Experts who give testimony on scientific or technical issues tend to hedge their conclusions by discussing the possibility of error. (4) Expert witnesses in specialized fields often command fees that are so high that many people involved in litigation cannot afford their services. 
 Answer:"	(1) The more a juror knows about a particular scientific or technical issue involved in a trial, the more likely it is that the juror will be prejudiced in favor of one of the litigating parties before the trial begins.
70	"Context: If one has evidence that an act will benefit other people and performs that act to benefit them, then one will generally succeed in benefiting them. 
 Question: Which one of the following best illustrates the proposition above? 
 (0) A country's leaders realized that fostering diplomatic ties with antagonistic nations reduces the chances of war with those nations. Because those leaders worried that war would harm their chances of being reelected, they engaged in diplomatic discussions with a hostile country, and the two countries avoided a confrontation. (1) A government study concluded that a proposed bureaucratic procedure would allow people to register their cars without waiting in line. The government adopted the procedure for this reason, and, as with most bureaucratic procedures, it was not successful. (2) Betsy overheard a heating contractor say that regularly changing the filter in a furnace helps to keep the furnace efficient. So Betsy has regularly changed the furnace filter in her daughter's house. As a result, the furnace has never required maintenance due to becoming clogged with dust or dirt. (3) Sejal learned in a psychology class that the best way to help someone overcome an addiction is to confront that person. So she confronted her friend Bob, who was struggling with a chemical dependency. (4) Zachary hoped that psychotherapy could help his parents overcome their marital difficulties. He persuaded his parents to call a psychotherapist, and eventually their problems were resolved. 
 Answer:"	(2) Betsy overheard a heating contractor say that regularly changing the filter in a furnace helps to keep the furnace efficient. So Betsy has regularly changed the furnace filter in her daughter's house. As a result, the furnace has never required maintenance due to becoming clogged with dust or dirt.
71	"Context: Radio airplay restrictions are nationally imposed regulations. The City Club has compiled a guide to all nationally imposed regulations except those related to taxation or to labor law. Radio airplay restrictions are related neither to taxation nor to labor law, so the City Club's guide covers radio airplay restrictions. 
 Question: Which one of the following exhibits a pattern of reasoning most similar to that exhibited by the argument above? 
 (0) All prepackaged desserts pose a risk of tooth decay. The Nutrition Foundation recommends avoiding all prepackaged desserts that are not high in vitamins or protein. Many prepackaged snack foods are low in vitamins or protein, so the Nutrition Foundation recommends avoiding prepackaged snack foods as well. (1) Coreopsis is a perennial. The Garden Club awards a prize each year for each perennial except those that are shrubs or not native to North America. Coreopsis is native to North America and is not a shrub. So the Garden Club awards a prize each year for coreopsis. (2) The Windsor Coalition is an example of a community organizing to discourage overdevelopment. The Neighborhood Association is in favor of this sort of community organizing, except when it poses a threat to regional economic growth. Therefore, the Neighborhood Association is in favor of the Windsor Coalition. (3) Compact discs are a kind of data storage device. Leotol Corporation does not produce data storage devices that use analog storage methods. Compact discs do not use analog storage methods, so it follows that Leotol Corporation produces compact discs. (4) Traffic laws are a type of government regulation. The association supports traffic laws that are in the public interest, even if they have not been shown to reduce the accident rate. Thus, the association should support all government regulations that are in the public interest. 
 Answer:"	(1) Coreopsis is a perennial. The Garden Club awards a prize each year for each perennial except those that are shrubs or not native to North America. Coreopsis is native to North America and is not a shrub. So the Garden Club awards a prize each year for coreopsis.
72	"Context: Physics professor: Some scientists claim that superheated plasma in which electrical resistance fails is a factor in causing so-called ""ball lightning."" If this were so, then such lightning would emit intense light and, since plasma has gaslike properties, would rise in the air. However, the instances of ball lightning that I observed were of low intensity and floated horizontally before vanishing. Thus, superheated plasma with failed electrical resistance is never a factor in causing ball lightning. 
 Question: The physics professor's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Superheated plasma in which electrical resistance fails does not cause types of lightning other than ball lightning. (1) The phenomena observed by the physics professor were each observed by at least one other person. (2) Ball lightning can occur as the result of several different factors. (3) Superheating of gaslike substances causes bright light to be emitted. (4) All types of ball lightning have the same cause. 
 Answer:"	(4) All types of ball lightning have the same cause.
73	"Context: Advertisement: Our oat bran cereal is the only one that has printed right on its package all of its claimed health benefits. And really health-conscious consumers have demonstrated that these health claims are true by buying our cereal since they would not have bought our cereal unless the claims were true. How do we know these consumers are really health-conscious? No really health-conscious consumer would buy food in a package that did not have accurate information about the food's health benefits printed on it. 
 Question: Which one of the following employs a flawed argumentative strategy that is most closely parallel to the flawed argumentative strategy in the advertisement above? 
 (0) Greeting one's coworkers must be a polite thing to do, because people who are considered polite always greet their coworkers. The proof that these people really are polite is that they are consistently polite in their daily lives. (1) This card game must be intellectually challenging, because it is played by highly intelligent people, who play only intellectually challenging card games. In fact, these players' intelligence is demonstrated by the fact that they play this game. (2) When coffee is being chosen, Brand Z is the coffee chosen by people with highly developed taste in coffee. These people showed their highly developed taste in coffee by correctly distinguishing eight brands of coffee from each other in a taste test. (3) That jacket must have been made for a very short person, because only very short people were able to fit into it. We know that they were very short because we saw them before they tried on the jacket. (4) This painting is a poor imitation, because only people with poor eyesight mistook it for the original. That these people have poor eyesight is demonstrated by the fact that they also mistook a vase of flowers in the painting for a peacock. 
 Answer:"	(1) This card game must be intellectually challenging, because it is played by highly intelligent people, who play only intellectually challenging card games. In fact, these players' intelligence is demonstrated by the fact that they play this game.
74	"Context: A study of 86 patients, all of whom suffered from disease T and received the same standard medical treatment, divided the patients into 2 equal groups. One group's members all attended weekly support group meetings, but no one from the other group attended support group meetings. After 10 years, 41 patients from each group had died. Clearly, support group meetings do not help patients with disease T live longer. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
 (0) Of the 4 patients who survived more than 10 years, the 2 who had attended weekly support group meetings lived longer than the 2 who had not. (1) For many diseases, attending weekly support group meetings is part of the standard medical treatment. (2) The members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group. (3) Some physicians have argued that attending weekly support group meetings gives patients less faith in the standard treatment for disease T. (4) Everyone in the group whose members attended weekly support group meetings reported after 1 year that those meetings had helped them to cope with the disease. 
 Answer:"	(2) The members of the group that attended weekly support group meetings lived 2 years longer, on average, than the members of the other group.
75	"Context: Astronomer: I have asserted that our solar system does not contain enough meteoroids and other cosmic debris to have caused the extensive cratering on the far side of the moon. My opponents have repeatedly failed to demonstrate the falsity of this thesis. Their evidence is simply inconclusive; thus they should admit that my thesis is correct. 
 Question: The reasoning in the astronomer's argument is flawed because this argument 
 (0) criticizes the astronomer's opponents rather than their arguments (1) infers the truth of the astronomer's thesis from the mere claim that it has not been proven false (2) ignores the possibility that alternative explanations may exist for the cratering (3) presumes that the astronomer's thesis should not be subject to rational discussion and criticism (4) fails to precisely define the key word ""meteoroids"" 
 Answer:"	(1) infers the truth of the astronomer's thesis from the mere claim that it has not been proven false
76	"Context: Many newborn babies have a yellowish tinge to their skin because their blood contains a high level of the pigment bilirubin. One group of doctors treats newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, since bilirubin, if it enters the brain, might cause the tetanus that sometimes occurs in newborns. However, a second group of doctors argues for allowing bilirubin levels in newborn babies to remain high, since the brain's own natural defenses normally prevent bilirubin from entering. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the position of the second group of doctors? 
 (0) The treatment that most effectively reduces high levels of bilirubin in newborns has no known negative side effects. (1) Some diseases that occur in newborns can weaken the brain's natural defenses and allow bilirubin to enter. (2) In newborns the pigment bilirubin, like other pigments, occurs not only in the blood but also in fluids involved in digestion. (3) Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth. (4) Among doctors who recommend treating newborns to reduce high levels of bilirubin, there is general agreement about what levels should be considered excessively high. 
 Answer:"	(3) Bilirubin neutralizes certain potentially damaging substances to which newborns are exposed at birth.
77	"Context: Economist:Some sociologists argue that because capitalism intrinsically involves competition, it weakens the ties between the people of a community. Although this may formerly have been true, modern capitalism requires that there be large corporations. Thus, modern capitalism promotes, rather than weakens, communal ties. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the economist's argument depends? 
 (0) Few economic systems are more successful than modern capitalism in fostering communal ties between citizens. (1) Modern capitalism is designed primarily to distribute goods and services, not to create communal ties between people. (2) Corporations that compete with each other must develop some ties to each other in order to reach agreement on the rules of the competition. (3) Having large corporations in a modern capitalist system promotes the strength of communal ties. (4) An economic system that does not encourage large corporations will be less successful economically than one that does. 
 Answer:"	(3) Having large corporations in a modern capitalist system promotes the strength of communal ties.
78	"Context: Teacher: Participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination. As critics point out, however, it also instills in those children who are not already well developed in these respects a feeling of inferiority that never really disappears. Yet, since research has shown that adults with feelings of inferiority become more successful than those free of such anxieties, funding for children's athletic programs should not be eliminated. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the teacher's argument by the assertion that participating in organized competitive athletics may increase a child's strength and coordination? 
 (0) It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason. (1) It is a claim that the teacher attempts to refute with counterarguments. (2) It is a hypothesis for which the teacher offers additional evidence. (3) It is cited as an insufficient reason for eliminating funding for children's athletic programs. (4) It is cited as an objection that has been raised to the position that the teacher is supporting. 
 Answer:"	(0) It is mentioned as one possible reason for adopting a policy for which the teacher suggests an additional reason.
79	"Context: Columnist: Donating items to charity may be a sign of generosity, but any generosity it may demonstrate is rarely a permanent virtue, since most donors make donations only intermittently. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the columnist's argument? 
 (0) The argument takes for granted that truly generous people are the most virtuous. (1) The argument attacks the character of those whose values are different from those of the columnist. (2) The argument takes for granted that a character trait is present only when manifested. (3) The argument generalizes from too small a sample of cases. (4) The argument takes for granted that most people donate out of generosity. 
 Answer:"	(2) The argument takes for granted that a character trait is present only when manifested.
80	"Context: Researchers have found that, hours after birth, infants are able to distinguish faces from other images. Infants stare at drawings of faces for longer periods of time than they do at blank ovals or drawings in which facial features are scrambled. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the ability of newborn infants described above? 
 (0) Certain abilities of facial pattern recognition are innate in humans, rather than learned. (1) The longer an infant stares at an object, the more interesting the infant finds that object. (2) Infants learn to associate human faces with the necessities of comfort and nourishment. (3) The less an infant stares at an object, the weaker the preference the infant has for that object. (4) Infants learn to associate the sound of human voices with the images of human faces. 
 Answer:"	(0) Certain abilities of facial pattern recognition are innate in humans, rather than learned.
81	"Context: Violent crime in this town is becoming a serious problem. Compared to last year, local law enforcement agencies have responded to 17 percent more calls involving violent crimes, showing that the average citizen of this town is more likely than ever to become a victim of a violent crime. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
 (0) The town's overall crime rate appears to have risen slightly this year compared to the same period last year. (1) In general, persons under the age of 65 are less likely to be victims of violent crimes than persons over the age of 65. (2) As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities. (3) In response to worries about violent crime, the town has recently opened a community center providing supervised activities for teenagers. (4) Community officials have shown that a relatively small number of repeat offenders commit the majority of violent crimes in the town. 
 Answer:"	(2) As a result of the town's community outreach programs, more people than ever are willing to report violent crimes to the proper authorities.
82	"Context: Two different dates have been offered as the approximate end point of the last ice age in North America. The first date was established by testing insect fragments found in samples of sediments to determine when warmth-adapted open-ground beetles replaced cold-adapted arctic beetles. The second date was established by testing pollen grains in those same samples to determine when ice masses yielded to spruce forests. The first date is more than 500 years earlier than the second. 
 Question: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following conclusions about the last ice age and its aftermath in North America? 
 (0) Toward the end of the ice age, warmth-adapted open-ground beetles ceased to inhabit areas where the predominant tree cover consisted of spruce forests. (1) Among those sediments deposited toward the end of the ice age, those found to contain cold-adapted arctic beetle fragments can also be expected to contain spruce-pollen grains. (2) Ice masses continued to advance through North America for several hundred years after the end of the ice age. (3) The species of cold-adapted arctic beetle that inhabited areas covered by ice masses died out toward the end of the last ice age. (4) Toward the end of the ice age, warmth-adapted open-ground beetles colonized the new terrain opened to them faster than soil changes and seed dispersion established new spruce forests. 
 Answer:"	(4) Toward the end of the ice age, warmth-adapted open-ground beetles colonized the new terrain opened to them faster than soil changes and seed dispersion established new spruce forests.
83	"Context: When presented with the evidence against him, Ellison freely admitted to engaging in illegal transactions using company facilities. However, the company obtained the evidence by illegally recording Ellison's conversations. Therefore, although the company may demand that he immediately cease, it cannot justifiably take any punitive measures against him. 
 Question: Which one of the following judgments best illustrates the principle illustrated by the argument above? 
 (0) After Price confessed to having stolen money from Long over a period of several years, Long began stealing from Price. Despite Price's guilt, Long was not justified in taking illegal action against him. (1) Shakila's secretary has admitted that he is illegally receiving cable television without paying for it. Shakila would not be justified in reporting him, though, since she once did the same thing. (2) After Takashi told Sarah's parents that he had seen her at the movies on Tuesday, Sarah confessed to sneaking out that day. On Monday, however, Takashi had violated the local curfew for minors. Hence Sarah's parents cannot justifiably punish her in this case. (3) After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case. (4) Ramirez was forced by the discovery of new evidence to admit that she lied about her role in managing the chief of staff's financial affairs. Nevertheless, the board of directors cannot justifiably take action against Ramirez, because in past instances it has pardoned others guilty of similar improprieties. 
 Answer:"	(3) After a conservation officer discovered them, Kuttner admitted that he had set the illegal animal traps on his land. But, because she was trespassing at the time, the conservation officer cannot justifiably punish Kuttner in this case.
84	"Context: In a recent study, each member of two groups of people, Group A (composed of persons sixty-five to seventy-five years old) and Group B (composed of college students), was required to make a telephone call to a certain number at a specified time. The time when each call was initiated was recorded electronically. Group A proved far better at remembering to make a telephone call precisely at a specified time than did Group B. There were fourteen lapses in Group B but only one lapse in Group A. Clearly, at least one type of memory does not suffer as a person ages. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if all of them are true, is LEAST helpful in establishing that the conclusion above is properly drawn? 
 (0) There was the same number of people in each group. (1) The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups. (2) Among the college students there were no persons more than forty years old. (3) Both groups had unrestricted access to telephones for making the required calls. (4) The members of the two groups received their instructions approximately the same amount of time before they were to make their telephone calls. 
 Answer:"	(1) The same group of researchers answered the calls made by the callers in both study groups.
85	"Context: Prediction, the hallmark of the natural sciences, appears to have been made possible by reducing phenomena to mathematical expressions. Some social scientists also want the power to predict accurately and assume they ought to perform the same reduction. But this would be a mistake; it would neglect data that are not easily mathematized and thereby would only distort the social phenomena. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the argument? 
 (0) The social sciences do not have as much predictive power as the natural sciences. (1) Mathematics plays a more important role in the natural sciences than it does in the social sciences. (2) There is a need in the social sciences to improve the ability to predict. (3) Phenomena in the social sciences should not be reduced to mathematical formulas. (4) Prediction is responsible for the success of the natural sciences. 
 Answer:"	(3) Phenomena in the social sciences should not be reduced to mathematical formulas.
86	"Context: Studies have shown that the more high-stress points a bridge has, the more likely it is to fracture eventually. This might lead one to expect fractures to develop at high-stress points. Surprisingly, however, fractures develop not at high-stress points but elsewhere on the bridge. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, contributes most to an explanation of why bridges fracture elsewhere than at high-stress points? 
 (0) In many structures other than bridges, such as ship hulls and airplane bodies, fractures do not develop at high-stress points. (1) Fractures do not develop at high-stress points, because bridges are reinforced at those points; however, stress is transferred to other points on the bridge where it causes fractures. (2) In many structures, the process of fracturing often causes high-stress points to develop. (3) Structures with no high-stress points can nonetheless have a high probability of fracturing. (4) Improper bridge construction, e.g., low-quality welding or the use of inferior steel, often leads both to the development of high-stress points and to an increased probability of fracturing. 
 Answer:"	(1) Fractures do not develop at high-stress points, because bridges are reinforced at those points; however, stress is transferred to other points on the bridge where it causes fractures.
87	"Context: Many people say that the press should not pry into the personal lives of private individuals. But the press has the right to publish any story of interest to the public unless that story is libelous. So, if a story about a private individual is not libelous, the press has an obligation to publish it, for such information is clearly of interest to the public. 
 Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument presumes, without giving warrant, that 
 (0) the press can publish nonlibelous stories about private individuals without prying into their personal lives (1) one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it (2) the publishing of information about the personal lives of private individuals cannot be libelous (3) if one has an obligation to do something then one has a right to do it (4) the press's right to publish always outweighs the individual's right not to be libeled 
 Answer:"	(1) one's having a right to do something entails one's having an obligation to do it
88	"Context: Consumer advocate: A recent study concluded that top-loading washing machines are superior overall to front-loaders. But front-loaders have the controls and access in front. This is more convenient for wheelchair users, some of whom find it highly inconvenient to remove laundry from top-loaders. So for some consumers front-loaders are superior. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption upon which the consumer advocate's argument depends? 
 (0) For some consumers the convenience of front-loaders outweighs the advantages of top-loaders in assessing which is superior. (1) Washing machines of a given type should be compared only with washing machines of that type. (2) Convenience is the only important factor in determining which type of washing machine is superior. (3) Retrieving clothes from a top-loader is convenient for people who do not use wheelchairs. (4) Retrieving clothes from front-loaders is inconvenient for people who are not wheelchair users. 
 Answer:"	(0) For some consumers the convenience of front-loaders outweighs the advantages of top-loaders in assessing which is superior.
89	"Context: Over 90 percent of the human brain currently serves no purpose, as is evident from the fact that many people with significant brain damage show no discernible adverse effects. So once humans begin to tap into this tremendous source of creativity and innovation, many problems that today seem insurmountable will be within our ability to solve. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the argument? 
 (0) The argument presumes, without providing justification, that the effects of brain damage are always easily detectable. (1) The argument presumes, without providing justification, that the only reason that any problem remains unsolved is a lack of creativity and innovation. (2) The argument infers that certain parts of the brain do nothing merely on the basis of the assertion that we do not know what they do. (3) The argument infers that problems will be solved merely on the basis of the claim that they will be within our ability to solve. (4) The argument presumes, without providing justification, that the currently unused parts of the brain are a potential source of tremendous creativity and innovation. 
 Answer:"	(4) The argument presumes, without providing justification, that the currently unused parts of the brain are a potential source of tremendous creativity and innovation.
90	"Context: Some scientists have expressed reservations about quantum theory because of its counterintuitive consequences. But despite rigorous attempts to show that quantum theory's predictions were inaccurate, they were shown to be accurate within the generally accepted statistical margin of error. These results, which have not been equaled by quantum theory's competitors, warrant acceptance of quantum theory. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning above? 
 (0) A scientific theory should be accepted if it has fewer counterintuitive consequences than do its competitors. (1) A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them. (2) The consequences of a scientific theory should not be considered counterintuitive if the theory's predictions have been found to be accurate. (3) A theory should not be rejected until it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it. (4) A theory should be accepted only if its predictions have not been disproved by experiment. 
 Answer:"	(1) A scientific theory should be accepted if it has been subjected to serious attempts to disprove it and has withstood all of them.
91	"Context: Psychologist: The obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously. However much society may have changed over the centuries, human psychology is still driven primarily by personal interaction. Thus, the important social function of positively reinforcing those behaviors that have beneficial consequences for others can be served only if the benefactor knows the source of the gratitude. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the psychologist's argument by the claim that the obligation to express gratitude cannot be fulfilled anonymously? 
 (0) It is an illustration of a premise that is used to support the argument's conclusion. (1) It is used to counter a consideration that might be taken to undermine the argument's conclusion. (2) It is used to support indirectly a claim that the argument in turn uses to support directly the conclusion. (3) It is used to identify the social benefit with which the argument is concerned. (4) It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support. 
 Answer:"	(4) It is the conclusion that the argument is intended to support.
92	"Context: Curator: Our museum displays only twentieth-century works, which are either on loan from private collectors or in the museum's permanent collection. Prints of all of the latter works are available in the museum store. The museum store also sells prints of some works that are not part of the museum's permanent collection, such as Hopper's Nighthawks. 
 Question: If the curator's statements are true, which one of the following must be true? 
 (0) Every print in the museum store is of a work that is either on loan to the museum from a private collector or part of the museum's permanent collection. (1) Every print that is sold in the museum store is a copy of a twentieth-century work. (2) There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector. (3) Hopper's Nighthawks is both a twentieth-century work and a work on loan to the museum from a private collector. (4) Hopper's Nighthawks is not displayed in the museum. 
 Answer:"	(2) There are prints in the museum store of every work that is displayed in the museum and not on loan from a private collector.
93	"Context: Nutritionist:Because humans have evolved very little since the development of agriculture, it is clear that humans are still biologically adapted to a diet of wild foods, consisting mainly of raw fruits and vegetables, nuts and seeds, lean meat, and seafood. Straying from this diet has often resulted in chronic illness and other physical problems. Thus, the more our diet consists of wild foods, the healthier we will be. 
 Question: The claim that humans are still biologically adapted to a diet of wild foods plays which one of the following roles in the nutritionist's argument? 
 (0) It is a conclusion for which the only support offered is the claim that straying from a diet of wild foods has often resulted in chronic illness and other physical problems. (1) It is a premise for which no justification is provided, but which is used to support the argument's main conclusion. (2) It is a phenomenon for which the main conclusion of the nutritionist's argument is cited as an explanation. (3) It is an intermediate conclusion for which one claim is offered as support, and which is used in turn to support the argument's main conclusion. (4) It is a premise offered in support of the claim that humans have evolved very little since the development of agriculture. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is an intermediate conclusion for which one claim is offered as support, and which is used in turn to support the argument's main conclusion.
94	"Context: Editorialist:Some people argue that we have an obligation not to cut down trees. However, there can be no obligation to an entity unless that entity has a corresponding right. So if we have an obligation toward trees, then trees have rights. But trees are not the sort of things that can have rights. Therefore, we have no obligation not to cut down trees. 
 Question: The editorialist's argument depends on assuming which one of the following? 
 (0) If an entity has a right to certain treatment, we have an obligation to treat it that way. (1) Any entity that has rights also has obligations. (2) Only conscious entities are the sort of things that can have rights. (3) Avoiding cutting down trees is not an obligation owed to some entity other than trees. (4) One does not always have the right to cut down the trees on one's own property. 
 Answer:"	(3) Avoiding cutting down trees is not an obligation owed to some entity other than trees.
95	"Context: A recent study suggests that consuming three glasses of wine daily substantially decreases the risk of stroke. Critics of the study, defending earlier research recommending one glass of wine daily, claim that binge drinkers (who drink once a week or less, but drink three or more drinks when they do drink) are the people most likely to drink three glasses of wine in one day and are more likely to die from sudden heart attacks than are other drinkers. According to these critics, drinking three glasses of wine daily would not benefit health overall, since the decrease in the risk of stroke associated with that level of consumption is negated by its associated increased risk of sudden heart attack. 
 Question: The critics' argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) inappropriately attributes the consequences of binge drinking to persons whose regular consumption of wine is three glasses a day (1) confuses the risk of sudden alcohol-induced heart attacks with other health risks (2) presumes, without providing justification, that there is no significant difference between wine and other alcoholic beverages in terms of health benefits and risks (3) fails to address specifically the reduction in risk of stroke conferred by the level of consumption in the recent study (4) overlooks the difference between strokes that result in death and less severe strokes 
 Answer:"	(0) inappropriately attributes the consequences of binge drinking to persons whose regular consumption of wine is three glasses a day
96	"Context: Scientist: Isaac Newton's Principia, the seventeenth-century work that served as the cornerstone of physics for over two centuries, could at first be understood by only a handful of people, but a basic understanding of Newton's ideas eventually spread throughout the world. This shows that the barriers to communication between scientists and the public are not impermeable. Thus recent scientific research, most of which also can be described only in language that seems esoteric to most contemporary readers, may also become part of everyone's intellectual heritage. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the scientist's argument by the claim that recent scientific research can often be described only in language that seems esoteric to most contemporary readers? 
 (0) It is raised as a potential objection to the argument's main conclusion, but its truth is called into doubt by the preceding statements. (1) It is a premise that supports the argument's main conclusion by suggesting that the results of recent scientific research are only superficially different from claims made in Newton's Principia. (2) It is cited as further evidence for the conclusion that the barriers to communication between scientists and the public are not impermeable. (3) It is a claim that serves mainly to help establish the relevance of the preceding statements to the argument's final conclusion. (4) It serves to cast doubt on an alleged similarity between Newton's Principia and recent scientific research. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is a claim that serves mainly to help establish the relevance of the preceding statements to the argument's final conclusion.
97	"Context: Only a minority of those who engage in political action do so out of a sense of social justice. Therefore, some people who have a sense of social justice do not engage in political action. 
 Question: Which one of the following uses flawed reasoning most similar to that used in the argument above? 
 (0) Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars. (1) Only foolish politicians disregard the wishes of most voters. Thus, most voters deserve to be represented by foolish politicians. (2) Some corporations only feign a concern for the environment when they advertise a product as environmentally friendly. Thus, no corporation has a genuine concern for the environment. (3) Some parents show no interest in the curricula used in the schools that their children attend. Thus, some of the decisions regarding school curricula should be made without regard for the wishes of the children's parents. (4) Only a small percentage of the profits that companies make are directly attributable to good management decisions. Thus, even companies that are managed badly will usually turn a profit. 
 Answer:"	(0) Most scholars are not motivated by a desire to win prestigious academic prizes. Thus, some of those who want to win prestigious academic prizes are not scholars.
98	"Context: Columnist: Even if the primary purpose of university education is to make students employable, such education should emphasize the liberal arts rather than the more narrow kind of technical training that prepares one for a particular sort of job. This is because the reasoning skills one acquires from a liberal arts education allow one to adapt to new intellectual challenges and thus to perform jobs for which one has received no specialized training. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the columnist's argument? 
 (0) It is better for people to have good educations than good jobs. (1) Many people with narrow technical training manage to find jobs. (2) Having a series of different jobs is more interesting than having only one job. (3) Having a general understanding of life is more important than possessing practical skills. (4) Technical training does not help students acquire reasoning skills. 
 Answer:"	(4) Technical training does not help students acquire reasoning skills.
99	"Context: Provinces and states with stringent car safety requirements, including required use of seat belts and annual safety inspections, have on average higher rates of accidents per kilometer driven than do provinces and states with less stringent requirements. Nevertheless, most highway safety experts agree that more stringent requirements do reduce accident rates. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to reconcile the safety experts' belief with the apparently contrary evidence described above? 
 (0) Annual safety inspections ensure that car tires are replaced before they grow old. (1) Drivers often become overconfident after their cars have passed a thorough safety inspection. (2) The roads in provinces and states with stringent car safety requirements are far more congested and therefore dangerous than in other provinces and states. (3) Psychological studies show that drivers who regularly wear seat belts often come to think of themselves as serious drivers, which for a few people discourages reckless driving. (4) Provinces and states with stringent car safety requirements have, on average, many more kilometers of roads than do other provinces and states. 
 Answer:"	(2) The roads in provinces and states with stringent car safety requirements are far more congested and therefore dangerous than in other provinces and states.
100	"Context: It is difficult to grow cacti in a humid climate. It is difficult to raise orange trees in a cold climate. In most parts of a certain country, it is either easy to grow cacti or easy to raise orange trees. 
 Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must be false? 
 (0) Half of the country is both humid and cold. (1) Most of the country is hot. (2) Some parts of the country are neither cold nor humid. (3) It is not possible to raise cacti in the country. (4) Most parts of the country are humid. 
 Answer:"	(0) Half of the country is both humid and cold.
101	"Context: Essayist: Common sense, which is always progressing, is nothing but a collection of theories that have been tested over time and found useful. When alternative theories that prove even more useful are developed, they gradually take the place of theories already embodied in common sense. This causes common sense to progress, but, because it absorbs new theories slowly, it always contains some obsolete theories. 
 Question: If all of the essayist's statements are true, then which one of the following must be true? 
 (0) At least some new theories that have not yet been found to be more useful than any theory currently part of common sense will never be absorbed into the body of common sense. (1) Of the useful theories within the body of common sense, the older ones are generally less useful than the newer ones. (2) The frequency with which new theories are generated prevents their rapid absorption into the body of common sense. (3) Each theory within the body of common sense is eventually replaced with a new theory that is more useful. (4) At least some theories that have been tested over time and found useful are less useful than some other theories that have not been fully absorbed into the body of common sense. 
 Answer:"	(4) At least some theories that have been tested over time and found useful are less useful than some other theories that have not been fully absorbed into the body of common sense.
102	"Context: Sometimes it is advisable for a medical patient to seek a second opinion. But this process can be awkward for both the patient and the physicians, since the patient often worries that the first physician will be alienated. In addition, for the first physician there is the issue of pride: a second opinion tacitly highlights a physician's fallibility. And the second physician is in the position of evaluating not only a patient's health, but also, inevitably and uncomfortably, a colleague's work. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately states the conclusion of the argument as a whole? 
 (0) Because of the awkwardness involved, it is best for patients not to seek second opinions unless it is absolutely necessary. (1) In cases in which second opinions are necessary, the first physician often feels that his or her professional judgment is called into question. (2) The process of obtaining a second medical opinion can be awkward for those involved. (3) Physicians who are called upon to offer second opinions are always uncomfortable about evaluating the work of colleagues. (4) In many cases in which medical patients seek second opinions, they are concerned about offending the first physician. 
 Answer:"	(2) The process of obtaining a second medical opinion can be awkward for those involved.
103	"Context: There are 70 to 100 Florida panthers alive today. This represents a very large increase over their numbers in the 1970s, but their population must reach at least 250 if it is to be self-sustaining. Their current habitat is not large enough to support any more of these animals, however. 
 Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true? 
 (0) Some part of the panthers' current habitat is only of marginal quality. (1) If the population of Florida panthers ever exceeds 250, it will be self-sustaining. (2) Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining. (3) The population of Florida panthers will never increase much beyond its current level. (4) Today, Florida panthers occupy a larger habitat than they did in the 1970s. 
 Answer:"	(2) Unless Florida panthers acquire a larger habitat, their population will not be self-sustaining.
104	"Context: Political scientist: Efforts to create a more egalitarian society are often wrongly criticized on the grounds that total equality would necessarily force everyone into a common mold. Equality is presumed by such critics to require unacceptably bland uniformity. But this is not so. By promoting complementary human interests, a society can achieve a greater and more prosperous equality while enhancing rather than minimizing diversity. 
 Question: The political scientist's argument proceeds by 
 (0) undermining a view by showing that its general acceptance would lead to undesirable consequences (1) rebutting an objection by attacking the assumption on which it is said to be based (2) attacking a view by claiming that those who propose it are motivated only by self-interest (3) claiming that whatever is true of a group must be true of each of the members of the group (4) undermining an apparent counterexample to a universal claim 
 Answer:"	(1) rebutting an objection by attacking the assumption on which it is said to be based
105	"Context: Physician: In an experiment, 50 patients with chronic back pain were divided into two groups. Small magnets were applied to the backs of one group; the other group received no treatment. Most of the patients in the first group, but very few in the second group, reported a significant reduction in pain. This shows that magnetic fields are probably effective at relieving some back pain. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, constitutes the logically strongest counter to the physician's argument? 
 (0) A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition. (1) Most physicians believe that medication relieves chronic back pain more effectively than magnets do. (2) No other experiments have been done showing that magnetic fields reduce pain in any area other than the back. (3) Some of the scientists who helped design the experiment believed even before the experiment that magnetic fields relieve back pain, but they were not directly involved in conducting the experiment. (4) There was wide variation in the specific causes of the chronic back pain suffered by the patients in the experiment. 
 Answer:"	(0) A patient's merely knowing that a treatment has been applied can lead to improvement in his or her condition.
106	"Context: Kennel club members who frequently discipline their dogs report a higher incidence of misbehavior than do members who rarely or never discipline their dogs. We can conclude from this that discipline does not improve dogs' behavior; on the contrary, it encourages misbehavior. 
 Question: The argument is flawed in that it fails to consider the possibility that 
 (0) dogs' misbehavior is the cause of, rather than the result of, frequent discipline (1) dogs learn from past experience how their owners are likely to react to misbehavior (2) discipline does not cause misbehavior on the part of animals other than dogs (3) kennel club members tend to be more skilled at raising dogs than are other dog owners (4) kennel club members are more likely to use discipline than are other dog owners 
 Answer:"	(0) dogs' misbehavior is the cause of, rather than the result of, frequent discipline
107	"Context: The number of tornadoes recorded annually in North America has more than tripled since 1953. Yet meteorologists insist that the climatic factors affecting the creation of tornadoes are unchanged. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above? 
 (0) The factors affecting the creation of tornadoes were not well known to meteorologists before 1953. (1) The intensity of the average tornado is greater now than it was in 1953. (2) The number of tornadoes recorded annually has increased only slightly in the last five years. (3) The amount of property damage done by tornadoes has grown substantially since 1953. (4) Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953. 
 Answer:"	(4) Many more citizens are helping authorities detect tornadoes now than in 1953.
108	"Context: Recently, a report commissioned by a confectioners trade association noted that chocolate, formerly considered a health scourge, is an effective antioxidant and so has health benefits. Another earlier claim was that oily foods clog arteries, leading to heart disease, yet reports now state that olive oil has a positive influence on the circulatory system. From these examples, it is clear that if you wait long enough, almost any food will be reported to be healthful. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument 
 (0) relies on the truth of a claim by a source that is likely to be biased (1) applies a general rule to specific cases to which it does not pertain (2) bases an overly broad generalization on just a few instances (3) takes for granted that all results of nutritional research are eventually reported (4) fails to consider that there are many foods that are reported to be unhealthful 
 Answer:"	(2) bases an overly broad generalization on just a few instances
109	"Context: According to the ""bottom-up"" theory of how ecosystems are structured, the availability of edible plants is what primarily determines an ecosystem's characteristics since it determines how many herbivores the ecosystem can support, which in turn determines how many predators it can support. This theory also holds that a reduction in the number of predators will have little impact on the rest of the ecosystem. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would provide evidence against the bottom-up theory? 
 (0) In an effort to build up the population of a rare species of monkey on Vahique Island, monkeys were bred in zoos and released into the wild. However, the effort failed because the trees on which the monkeys fed were also nearly extinct. (1) After hunting virtually eliminated predators on Rigu Island, the population of many herbivore species increased more than tenfold, causing the density of plants to be dramatically reduced. (2) After many of the trees on Jaevix Island were cleared, the island's leaf-cutter ants, which require a forested ecosystem, experienced a substantial decrease in population, as did the island's anteaters. (3) After a new species of fern was introduced to Lisdok Island, native ferns were almost eliminated. However, this did not affect the population of the herbivores that had eaten the native ferns, since they also thrived on a diet of the new fern. (4) Plants that are a dietary staple of wild pigs on Sedif Island have flourished over the last three decades, and the population of the pigs has not changed much in spite of extensive hunting. 
 Answer:"	(1) After hunting virtually eliminated predators on Rigu Island, the population of many herbivore species increased more than tenfold, causing the density of plants to be dramatically reduced.
110	"Context: If a child is to develop healthy bones, the child's diet must include sufficient calcium. It therefore follows that the diets of children who do not develop healthy bones do not include sufficient calcium. 
 Question: Flawed reasoning in which one of the following most closely parallels the flawed reasoning in the argument above? 
 (0) If bread is to have a firm crust, it must be baked at the right temperature. It therefore follows that bread that is not baked at the right temperature will not have a firm crust. (1) A cake must contain the right amount of flour in order to taste good. It therefore follows that cakes that do not taste good do not contain the right amount of flour. (2) The Bake-a-Thon, which is open to contestants of all ages, has never been won by a person under the age of 30. It therefore follows that the winner of this year's Bake-a-Thon will not be under the age of 30. (3) Both yeast and baking powder can cause sweet rolls to rise. It therefore follows that yeast can always be substituted for baking powder in a recipe for sweet rolls. (4) In recipe contests, there are always more contestants in the pie category than there are in the cake category. It therefore follows that contestants generally have a better chance of winning in the cake category than in the pie category. 
 Answer:"	(1) A cake must contain the right amount of flour in order to taste good. It therefore follows that cakes that do not taste good do not contain the right amount of flour.
111	"Context: History provides many examples of technological innovations being strongly resisted by people whose working conditions without those innovations were miserable. This shows that social inertia is a more powerful determinant of human behavior than is the desire for comfort or safety. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the reasoning in the argument? 
 (0) People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss. (1) People are often reluctant to take on new challenges. (2) Some examples of technological innovation have been embraced by workers. (3) People tend to adapt easily to gradually implemented technological innovations. (4) People correctly believe that technological innovations almost always increase workers' productivity. 
 Answer:"	(0) People correctly believe that technological innovations often cause job loss.
112	"Context: In considering the fact that many people believe that promotions are often given to undeserving employees because the employees successfully flatter their supervisors, a psychologist argued that although many people who flatter their supervisors are subsequently promoted, flattery generally is not the reason for their success, because almost all flattery is so blatant that it is obvious even to those toward whom it is directed. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the psychologist's conclusion to be properly drawn? 
 (0) People in positions of responsibility expect to be flattered. (1) Official guidelines for granting promotion tend to focus on merit. (2) Flattery that is not noticed by the person being flattered is ineffective. (3) Many people interpret insincere flattery as sincere admiration. (4) Supervisors are almost never influenced by flattery when they notice it. 
 Answer:"	(4) Supervisors are almost never influenced by flattery when they notice it.
113	"Context: The government is being urged to prevent organizations devoted to certain views on human nutrition from advocating a diet that includes large portions of uncooked meat, because eating uncooked meat can be very dangerous. However, this purported fact does not justify the government's silencing the groups, for surely the government would not be justified in silencing a purely political group merely on the grounds that the policies the group advocates could be harmful to some members of society. The same should be true for silencing groups with certain views on human nutrition. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument? 
 (0) The government should not silence any group for advocating a position that a significant proportion of society believes to be beneficial. (1) The government ought to do whatever is in the best interest of society. (2) One ought to advocate a position only if one believes that it is true or would be beneficial. (3) The government ought not to silence an opinion merely on the grounds that it could be harmful to disseminate the opinion. (4) One ought to urge the government to do only those things the government is justified in doing. 
 Answer:"	(3) The government ought not to silence an opinion merely on the grounds that it could be harmful to disseminate the opinion.
114	"Context: Medical researcher: Scientists compared a large group of joggers who habitually stretch before jogging to an equal number of joggers who do not stretch before jogging. Both groups of joggers incurred roughly the same number of injuries. This indicates that stretching before jogging does not help to prevent injuries. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the medical researcher's argument? 
 (0) For both groups of joggers compared by the scientists, the rate of jogging injuries during the study was lower than the overall rate of jogging injuries. (1) Among the joggers in the groups compared by the scientists, many of those previously injured while jogging experienced difficulty in their efforts to perform stretches. (2) Most jogging injuries result from falls, collisions, and other mishaps on which the flexibility resulting from stretching would have little if any effect. (3) The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging. (4) Studies have found that, for certain forms of exercise, stretching beforehand can reduce the severity of injuries resulting from that exercise. 
 Answer:"	(3) The more prone a jogger is to jogging injuries, the more likely he or she is to develop the habit of performing stretches before jogging.
115	"Context: Superconductor development will enable energy to be transported farther with less energy lost in transit. This will probably improve industrial productivity, for a similar improvement resulted when oil and natural gas replaced coal as the primary fossil fuels used in North America. Shipping costs, a function of the distance fossil fuels are shipped and the losses of material in transit, decreased for factory owners at that time. 
 Question: The claim that superconductor development will probably improve industrial productivity plays which one of the following roles in the argument? 
 (0) It is a conclusion for which the claim that shipping costs for fossil fuels are partly a function of the losses of material in transit is offered as partial support. (1) It is a generalization for which the claim that superconductor development will enable energy to be transported farther with less energy lost in transit is offered as an illustration. (2) It is an assumption supporting the conclusion that superconductor development will enable energy to be transported farther with less energy lost in transit. (3) It is a premise offered to support the claim that oil and natural gas have replaced coal as the primary fossil fuels used in North America. (4) It is cited as evidence that shipping costs are a function of the distances fossil fuels are shipped and the losses of material in transit. 
 Answer:"	(0) It is a conclusion for which the claim that shipping costs for fossil fuels are partly a function of the losses of material in transit is offered as partial support.
116	"Context: The French novelist Colette (1873–1954) has been widely praised for the vividness of her language. But many critics complain that her novels are indifferent to important moral questions. This charge is unfair. Each of her novels is a poetic condensation of a major emotional crisis in the life of an ordinary person of her time. Such emotional crises almost invariably raise important moral questions. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
 (0) Critics who suggest that Colette's novels are indifferent to great moral questions of her time greatly underestimate her literary achievements. (1) A novel that poetically condenses a major emotional crisis does not have to be indifferent to the important moral questions raised by that crisis. (2) To deserve the level of praise that Colette has received, a novelist's work must concern itself with important moral questions. (3) The vividness of Colette's language was not itself the result of poetic condensation. (4) Colette's purpose in poetically condensing emotional crises in the lives of characters in her novels was to explore some of the important moral questions of her time. 
 Answer:"	(1) A novel that poetically condenses a major emotional crisis does not have to be indifferent to the important moral questions raised by that crisis.
117	"Context: The view that every person is concerned exclusively with her or his own self-interest implies that government by consent is impossible. Thus, social theorists who believe that people are concerned only with their self-interest evidently believe that aspiring to democracy is futile, since democracy is not possible in the absence of government by consent. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument 
 (0) infers merely from the fact of someone's holding a belief that he or she believes an implication of that belief (1) infers that because something is true of a group of people, it is true of each individual member of the group (2) infers that because something is true of each individual person belonging to a group, it is true of the group as a whole (3) attempts to discredit a theory by discrediting those who espouse that theory (4) fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true 
 Answer:"	(0) infers merely from the fact of someone's holding a belief that he or she believes an implication of that belief
118	"Context: Archaeologist: The mosaics that were removed from Zeugma, the ancient city now flooded by the runoff from Turkey's Birecik Dam, should have been left there. We had all the information about them that we needed to draw archaeological conclusions, and future archaeologists studying the site, who may not have access to our records, might be misled by their absence. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the reasoning in the archaeologist's argument? 
 (0) The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological. (1) Archaeologists studying a site can tell whether or not that site had been flooded at some time. (2) The materials used in the construction of a mosaic are readily apparent when the mosaic is examined in its original location. (3) Archaeological sites from which artifacts have been removed rarely mislead archaeologists who later study the site. (4) The removal of artifacts from archaeological sites rarely has any environmental impact. 
 Answer:"	(0) The only considerations that bear upon the question of whether the mosaics should have been removed are archaeological.
119	"Context: Traffic engineers have increased the capacity of the Krakkenbak Bridge to handle rush-hour traffic flow. The resultant increase in rush-hour traffic flow would not have occurred had the city not invested in computer modeling technology last year at the request of the city's mayor, and the city's financial predicament would not have been resolved if the traffic flow across the bridge during rush hour had not been increased. 
 Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the information above? 
 (0) The city's financial predicament would not have been resolved had the city chosen a competing computer modeling software package. (1) The city's financial predicament would not have been resolved had the city not invested in computer modeling technology. (2) On an average day, more traffic crosses the Krakkenbak Bridge this year as compared to last year. (3) Traffic flow across the Krakkenbak Bridge during rush hour would not have increased had the city's mayor not made investing in computer modeling technology the highest budgetary priority last year. (4) The city's mayor was a proponent of investing in computer modeling technology because of the city's need to increase traffic flow across the Krakkenbak Bridge during rush hour. 
 Answer:"	(1) The city's financial predicament would not have been resolved had the city not invested in computer modeling technology.
120	"Context: Court analyst: Courts should not allow the use of DNA tests in criminal cases. There exists considerable controversy among scientific experts about how reliable these tests are. Unless there is widespread agreement in the scientific community about how reliable a certain test is, it is unreasonable for the courts to allow evidence based on that test. 
 Question: The court analyst's reasoning is flawed because it fails to take into account that 
 (0) courts have the authority to admit or exclude any evidence irrespective of what experts have to say about its reliability (1) the standard against which evidence in a criminal case is measured should not be absolute certainty (2) experts may agree that the tests are highly reliable while disagreeing about exactly how reliable they are (3) data should not be admitted as evidence in a court of law without scientific witnesses having agreed about how reliable they are (4) there are also controversies about reliability of evidence in noncriminal cases 
 Answer:"	(2) experts may agree that the tests are highly reliable while disagreeing about exactly how reliable they are
121	"Context: Members of the VideoKing Frequent Viewers club can now receive a special discount coupon. Members of the club who have rented more than ten videos in the past month can receive the discount coupon only at the VideoKing location from which the member last rented a movie. Members of the Frequent Viewers club who have not rented more than ten videos in the past month can receive the coupon only at the Main Street location. Pat, who has not rented more than ten videos in the past month, can receive the special discount coupon at the Walnut Lane location of VideoKing. 
 Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true? 
 (0) The only people who can receive the special discount coupon at the Main Street location are Frequent Viewers club members who have not rented more than ten videos. (1) Some members of the Frequent Viewers club have not rented more than ten videos. (2) Some members of the Frequent Viewers club can receive the special discount coupon at more than one location of VideoKing. (3) Some people who are not members of the Frequent Viewers club can receive the special discount coupon. (4) If Pat rents a movie from the Main Street location, then she will not receive the special discount coupon. 
 Answer:"	(3) Some people who are not members of the Frequent Viewers club can receive the special discount coupon.
122	"Context: Game show winners choosing between two equally desirable prizes will choose either the one that is more expensive or the one with which they are more familiar. Today's winner, Ed, is choosing between two equally desirable and equally unfamiliar prizes, A and B. He will thus choose A, which is more expensive. 
 Question: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning above? 
 (0) With a book contract, an academic writer receives either an advance or a guarantee of royalties. Professor al-Sofi received an advance for a book contract, so al-Sofi did not receive a guarantee of royalties. (1) When entering this amusement park, children always choose to take their first ride on either the Rocket or the Mouse. Janine insisted on the Rocket for her first ride. Thus, Janine would not have been standing near the Mouse during her first half hour in the amusement park. (2) The elliptical orbit of an asteroid is only slightly eccentric unless it is affected by the gravitational pull of a planet. Asteroid Y is affected by Jupiter's gravitational pull and asteroid X is not. Thus, the orbit of asteroid Y is the more eccentric of the two. (3) New students in this program must choose either a physics class or an art class. Miyoko has no desire to take a class in either of those fields, so Miyoko will probably not enter this program. (4) To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox. 
 Answer:"	(4) To avoid predators, rabbits will either double back on their pursuers or flee for nearby cover. The rabbit being pursued by a fox in this wildlife film is in a field that offers no opportunity for nearby cover, so it will try to double back on the fox.
123	"Context: Microbiologist: Because heavy metals are normally concentrated in sewage sludge during the sewage treatment process, the bacteria that survive in the sludge have evolved the unusual ability to resist heavy-metal poisoning. The same bacteria also show a strong resistance to antibiotics. This suggests that the bacteria's exposure to the heavy metals in the sewage sludge has somehow promoted their resistance to antibiotics. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the microbiologist's argument? 
 (0) Most bacteria that are not resistant to antibiotics are not resistant to heavy-metal poisoning either. (1) Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics. (2) Antibiotic resistance of bacteria that survive in sewage sludge in which heavy metals are concentrated contributes to their resistance to heavy-metal poisoning. (3) Sewage sludge that contains high concentrations of heavy metals almost always contains significant concentrations of antibiotics. (4) Many kinds of bacteria that do not live in sewage sludge are resistant to both heavy-metal poisoning and antibiotics. 
 Answer:"	(1) Bacteria that live in sewage sludge that is free of heavy metals, but is in other respects similar to normal sewage, are generally resistant to neither heavy-metal poisoning nor antibiotics.
124	"Context: Ethicist: Marital vows often contain the promise to love ""until death do us part."" If ""love"" here refers to a feeling, then this promise makes no sense, for feelings are not within one's control, and a promise to do something not within one's control makes no sense. Thus, no one—including those making marital vows—should take ""love"" in this context to be referring to feelings. 
 Question: The ethicist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) None of our feelings are within our control. (1) People should not make promises to do something that is not within their control. (2) ""Love"" can legitimately be taken to refer to something other than feelings. (3) Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense. (4) Promises that cannot be kept do not make any sense. 
 Answer:"	(3) Promises should not be interpreted in such a way that they make no sense.
125	"Context: Principle: If a food product contains ingredients whose presence most consumers of that product would be upset to discover in it, then the food should be labeled as containing those ingredients. Application: Crackly Crisps need not be labeled as containing genetically engineered ingredients, since most consumers of Crackly Crisps would not care if they discovered that fact. 
 Question: The application of the principle is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) fails to address the possibility that consumers of a specific food may not be representative of consumers of food in general (1) fails to address the possibility that the genetically engineered ingredients in Crackly Crisps may have been proven safe for human consumption (2) implicitly makes use of a value judgment that is incompatible with the principle being applied (3) takes for granted that if most consumers of a product would buy it even if they knew several of the ingredients in it, then they would buy the product even if they knew all the ingredients in it (4) confuses a claim that under certain conditions a certain action should be taken with a claim that the action need not be taken in the absence of those conditions 
 Answer:"	(4) confuses a claim that under certain conditions a certain action should be taken with a claim that the action need not be taken in the absence of those conditions
126	"Context: Editorial: The town would not need to spend as much as it does on removing trash if all town residents sorted their household garbage. However, while telling residents that they must sort their garbage would get some of them to do so, many would resent the order and refuse to comply. The current voluntary system, then, is to be preferred, because it costs about as much as a nonvoluntary system would and it does not engender nearly as much resentment. 
 Question: The contention that the town would not have to spend as much as it does on removing trash if all town residents sorted their garbage plays which one of the following roles in the editorial's argument? 
 (0) It is a claim that the editorial is trying to show is false. (1) It is a fact granted by the editorial that lends some support to an alternative to the practice that the editorial defends as preferable. (2) It is an example of a difficulty facing the claim that the editorial is attempting to refute. (3) It is a premise that the editorial's argument relies on in reaching its conclusion. (4) It is the conclusion that the editorial's argument purports to establish. 
 Answer:"	(1) It is a fact granted by the editorial that lends some support to an alternative to the practice that the editorial defends as preferable.
127	"Context: ""Hot spot"" is a term that ecologists use to describe those habitats with the greatest concentrations of species found only in one place—so-called ""endemic"" species. Many of these hot spots are vulnerable to habitat loss due to commercial development. Furthermore, loss of endemic species accounts for most modern-day extinctions. Thus, given that only a limited number of environmental battles can be waged, it would be reasonable for organizations dedicated to preserving species to ____. 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the argument? 
 (0) try to help only those species who are threatened with extinction because of habitat loss (1) concentrate their resources on protecting hot spot habitats (2) treat all endemic species as equally valuable and equally in need of preservation (3) accept that most endemic species will become extinct (4) expand the definition of ""hot spot"" to include vulnerable habitats that are not currently home to many endangered species 
 Answer:"	(1) concentrate their resources on protecting hot spot habitats
128	"Context: Principle: If you sell an item that you know to be defective, telling the buyer that the item is sound, you thereby commit fraud. Application: Wilton sold a used bicycle to Harris, knowing very little about its condition. Wilton told Harris that the bicycle was in good working condition, but Harris soon learned that the brakes were defective. Wilton was therefore guilty of fraud. 
 Question: The application of the principle is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that 
 (0) the application fails to establish whether Wilton was given the opportunity to repair the brakes (1) the application fails to indicate how much money Wilton received for the bicycle (2) the application uses the word ""defective"" in a sense that is crucially different from how it is used in the statement of the principle (3) Harris might not have believed Wilton's statement about the bicycle's condition (4) asserting something without justification is not the same as asserting something one knows to be false 
 Answer:"	(4) asserting something without justification is not the same as asserting something one knows to be false
129	"Context: Engine noise from boats travelling through killer whales' habitats ranges in frequency from 100 hertz to 3,000 hertz, an acoustical range that overlaps that in which the whales communicate through screams and squeals. Though killer whales do not seem to behave differently around running boat engines, engine noise from boats can be loud enough to damage their hearing over time. Therefore, ____. 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the argument? 
 (0) younger killer whales are better able to tolerate engine noise from boats than older whales are (1) killer whales are less likely to attempt to communicate with one another when boat engines are operating nearby (2) noise from boat engines may impair killer whales' ability to communicate (3) killer whales are most likely to prefer areas where boat traffic is present, but light (4) killer whales would probably be more successful in finding food if boats did not travel through their habitats 
 Answer:"	(2) noise from boat engines may impair killer whales' ability to communicate
130	"Context: Journalist: A manufacturers' trade group that has long kept its membership list secret inadvertently sent me a document listing hundreds of manufacturing companies. A representative of the trade group later confirmed that every company listed in the document does indeed belong to the trade group. Because Bruch Industries is not listed on the document, it is evidently not a member of the trade group. 
 Question: The journalist's reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the journalist 
 (0) gives no reason to think that Bruch Industries would want to belong to the trade group (1) does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group (2) does not explain how it is that the trade group could have inadvertently sent out a secret document (3) presents no reason why Bruch Industries would not want its membership in the trade group to be known (4) takes for granted the accuracy of a statement by a representative who had a reason to withhold information 
 Answer:"	(1) does not present any evidence that the document names every member of the trade group
131	"Context: Peter: Unlike in the past, most children's stories nowadays don't have clearly immoral characters in them. They should, though. Children need to learn the consequences of being bad. Yoko: Children's stories still tend to have clearly immoral characters in them, but now these characters tend not to be the sort that frighten children. Surely that's an improvement. 
 Question: Peter and Yoko disagree over whether today's children's stories 
 (0) should be less frightening than they are (1) tend to be less frightening than earlier children's stories were (2) differ significantly in overall quality from earlier children's stories (3) tend to have clearly immoral characters in them (4) should help children learn the consequences of being bad 
 Answer:"	(3) tend to have clearly immoral characters in them
132	"Context: Local resident: An overabundance of algae must be harmful to the smaller fish in this pond. During the fifteen or so years that I have lived here, the few times that I have seen large numbers of dead small fish wash ashore in late summer coincide exactly with the times that I have noticed abnormally large amounts of algae in the water. 
 Question: The local resident's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) presumes, without providing justification, that smaller fish are somehow more susceptible to harm as a result of overabundant algae than are larger fish (1) fails to consider that the effects on smaller fish of overabundant algae may be less severe in larger bodies of water with more diverse ecosystems (2) ignores the possibility that the same cause might have different effects on fish of different sizes (3) ignores the possibility that the overabundance of algae and the deaths of smaller fish are independent effects of a common cause (4) ignores the possibility that below-normal amounts of algae are detrimental to the pond's smaller fish 
 Answer:"	(3) ignores the possibility that the overabundance of algae and the deaths of smaller fish are independent effects of a common cause
133	"Context: Tanner: The public should demand political debates before any election. Voters are better able to choose the candidate best suited for office if they watch the candidates seriously debate one another. Saldana: Political debates almost always benefit the candidate who has the better debating skills. Thus, they don't really help voters determine which candidate is most qualified for office. 
 Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Tanner and Saldana disagree over which one of the following? 
 (0) Political candidates with strong debating skills are more likely to win elections than those with weak debating skills. (1) A voter who watches a political debate will likely be better able, as a result, to determine which candidate is more qualified for office. (2) Debating skills are of little use to politicians in doing their jobs once they are elected to office. (3) The candidates with the best debating skills are the ones who are most qualified for the political offices for which they are running. (4) Political debates tend to have a major effect on which candidate among those participating in a debate will win the election. 
 Answer:"	(1) A voter who watches a political debate will likely be better able, as a result, to determine which candidate is more qualified for office.
134	"Context: A recent study shows that those highways that carry the most traffic, and thus tend to be the most congested, have the lowest rate of fatal traffic accidents. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the phenomenon described above? 
 (0) Drivers have more accidents when they become distracted. (1) The highways that have the highest rate of fatal accidents have moderate volumes of traffic. (2) Most of the motorists on very heavily traveled highways tend to be commuting to or from work. (3) Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed. (4) Heavily traveled highways do not always carry a higher proportion of large trucks. 
 Answer:"	(3) Most serious accidents occur when vehicles are moving at a high rate of speed.
135	"Context: In some jurisdictions, lawmakers have instituted sentencing guidelines that mandate a penalty for theft that is identical to the one they have mandated for bribery. Hence, lawmakers in those jurisdictions evidently consider the harm resulting from theft to be equal to the harm resulting from bribery. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument? 
 (0) In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes. (1) In most cases, lawmakers assess the level of harm resulting from an act in determining whether to make that act illegal. (2) Often, in response to the unusually great harm resulting from a particular instance of a crime, lawmakers will mandate an increased penalty for that crime. (3) In most cases, a victim of theft is harmed no more than a victim of bribery is harmed. (4) If lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm resulting from those crimes, crime in those lawmakers' jurisdictions will be effectively deterred. 
 Answer:"	(0) In general, lawmakers mandate penalties for crimes that are proportional to the harm they believe to result from those crimes.
136	"Context: People often admonish us to learn the lessons of history, but, even if it were easy to discover what the past was really like, it is nearly impossible to discover its lessons. We are supposed, for example, to learn the lessons of World War I. But what are they? And were we ever to discover what they are, it is not clear that we could ever apply them, for we shall never again have a situation just like World War I. 
 Question: That we should learn the lessons of history figures in the argument in which one of the following ways? 
 (0) It sets out a problem the argument as a whole is designed to resolve. (1) It is compatible with accepting the argument's conclusion and with denying it. (2) It is a position that the argument simply takes for granted is false. (3) It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting. (4) It is an assumption that is required in order to establish the argument's conclusion. 
 Answer:"	(3) It expresses the position the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting.
137	"Context: Sigerson argues that the city should adopt ethical guidelines that preclude its politicians from accepting campaign contributions from companies that do business with the city. Sigerson's proposal is dishonest, however, because he has taken contributions from such companies throughout his career in city politics. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) confuses a sufficient condition for adopting ethical guidelines for politicians with a necessary condition for adopting such guidelines (1) rejects a proposal on the grounds that an inadequate argument has been given for it (2) fails to adequately address the possibility that other city politicians would resist Sigerson's proposal (3) rejects a proposal on the grounds that the person offering it is unfamiliar with the issues it raises (4) overlooks the fact that Sigerson's proposal would apply only to the future conduct of city politicians 
 Answer:"	(4) overlooks the fact that Sigerson's proposal would apply only to the future conduct of city politicians
138	"Context: Some gardening books published by Garden Path Press recommend tilling the soil and adding compost before starting a new garden on a site, but they do not explain the difference between hot and cold composting. Since any gardening book that recommends adding compost is flawed if it does not explain at least the basics of composting, some books published by Garden Path are flawed. 
 Question: The argument requires the assumption that 
 (0) some gardening books that recommend tilling the soil and adding compost before starting a new garden are not flawed (1) gardeners should not add compost to the soil unless they have a thorough understanding of composting (2) an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting (3) everyone who understands the difference between hot and cold composting understands at least the basics of composting (4) no gardening book that includes an explanation of at least the basics of composting is flawed 
 Answer:"	(2) an explanation of the basics of composting must include an explanation of the difference between hot and cold composting
139	"Context: Astronomers have found new evidence that the number of galaxies in the universe is not 10 billion, as previously believed, but 50 billion. This discovery will have an important effect on theories about how galaxies are formed. But even though astronomers now believe 40 billion more galaxies exist, many astronomers' estimates of the universe's total mass remain virtually unchanged. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain why the estimates remain virtually unchanged? 
 (0) The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass. (1) The overwhelming majority of galaxies are so far from Earth that their mass can be only roughly estimated. (2) The number of galaxies that astronomers believe exist tends to grow as the instruments used to detect galaxies become more sophisticated. (3) Theories about how galaxies are formed are rarely affected by estimates of the universe's total mass. (4) There is no consensus among astronomers on the proper procedures for estimating the universe's total mass. 
 Answer:"	(0) The mass of galaxies is thought to make up only a tiny percentage of the universe's total mass.
140	"Context: Newspaper subscriber: Arnot's editorial argues that by making certain fundamental changes in government we would virtually eliminate our most vexing social ills. But clearly this conclusion is false. After all, the argument Arnot makes for this claim depends on the dubious assumption that government can be trusted to act in the interest of the public. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses a flaw in the argument's reasoning? 
 (0) it repudiates a claim merely on the grounds that an inadequate argument has been given for it (1) it treats a change that is required for virtual elimination of society's most vexing social ills as a change that will guarantee the virtual elimination of those ills (2) it fails to consider that, even if an argument's conclusion is false, some of the assumptions used to justify that conclusion may nonetheless be true (3) it distorts the opponent's argument and then attacks this distorted argument (4) it uses the key term ""government"" in one sense in a premise and in another sense in the conclusion 
 Answer:"	(0) it repudiates a claim merely on the grounds that an inadequate argument has been given for it
141	"Context: Columnist: Shortsighted motorists learn the hard way about the wisdom of preventive auto maintenance; such maintenance almost always pays off in the long run. Our usually shortsighted city council should be praised for using similar wisdom when they hired a long-term economic development adviser. In hiring this adviser, the council made an investment that is likely to have a big payoff in several years. Other cities in this region that have devoted resources to economic development planning have earned large returns on such an investment. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the columnist's argument? 
 (0) Even some cars that receive regular preventive maintenance break down, requiring costly repairs. (1) The columnist's city has a much smaller population and economy than the other cities did when they began devoting resources to economic development planning. (2) Most motorists who fail to perform preventive maintenance on their cars do so for nonfinancial reasons. (3) Qualified economic development advisers generally demand higher salaries than many city councils are willing to spend. (4) Cities that have earned large returns due to hiring economic development advisers did not earn any returns at all in the advisers' first few years of employment. 
 Answer:"	(1) The columnist's city has a much smaller population and economy than the other cities did when they began devoting resources to economic development planning.
142	"Context: Editorial: Cell-phone usage on buses and trains is annoying to other passengers. This suggests that recent proposals to allow use of cell phones on airplanes are ill-advised. Cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains. Airline passengers are usually packed in tightly. And if airline passengers are offended by the cell-phone excesses of their seatmates, they often cannot move to another seat. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the editorial's argument by the statement that cell-phone use would be far more upsetting on airplanes than it is on buses and trains? 
 (0) It is the main conclusion of the argument. (1) It is a claim that the argument tries to rebut. (2) It is a premise that indirectly supports the main conclusion of the argument by supporting a premise for that conclusion. (3) It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion. (4) It provides background information that plays no role in the reasoning in the argument. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is a conclusion for which support is provided and that itself is used in turn to directly support the argument's main conclusion.
143	"Context: Science writer: The deterioration of cognitive faculties associated with Alzheimer's disease is evidently caused by the activities of microglia—the brain's own immune cells. For one thing, this deterioration can be slowed by some anti-inflammatory drugs, such as acetylsalicylic acid. Furthermore, patients with Alzheimer's are unable to eliminate the protein BA from the brain, where it accumulates and forms deposits. The microglia attack these protein deposits by releasing poisons that destroy surrounding healthy brain cells, thereby impairing the brain's cognitive functions. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the science writer's argument? 
 (0) The inability of Alzheimer's patients to eliminate the protein BA from the brain is due to a deficiency in the brain's immune system. (1) Acetylsalicylic acid reduces the production of immune cells in the brain. (2) The activity of microglia results in a decrease in the buildup of protein deposits in the brain. (3) The protein BA directly interferes with the cognitive functions of the brain. (4) Immune reactions by microglia occur in certain diseases of the brain other than Alzheimer's. 
 Answer:"	(1) Acetylsalicylic acid reduces the production of immune cells in the brain.
144	"Context: Lawyer: One is justified in accessing information in computer files without securing authorization from the computer's owner only if the computer is typically used in the operation of a business. If, in addition, there exist reasonable grounds for believing that such a computer contains data usable as evidence in a legal proceeding against the computer's owner, then accessing the data in those computer files without the owner's authorization is justified. 
 Question: The principles stated by the lawyer most strongly support which one of the following judgments? 
 (0) Rey gave his friend Sunok a key to the store where he worked and asked her to use the store owners' computer to look up their friend Jim's phone number, which Rey kept on the computer. Because Sunok had Rey's permission, her action was justified. (1) Police department investigators accessed the electronic accounting files of the central computer owned by a consulting firm that was on trial for fraudulent business practices without seeking permission from the firm's owners. Contrary to the investigators' reasonable beliefs, however, the files ultimately provided no evidence of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, the investigators' action was justified. (2) A police officer accessed, without Natalie's permission, files on the computer that Natalie owned and used exclusively in the operation of her small business. Since the police officer's search of the files on Natalie's computer produced no evidence usable in any legal proceeding against Natalie, the police officer's action was clearly not justified. (3) Customs officials examined all of the files stored on a laptop computer confiscated from an importer whom they suspected of smuggling. Because there were reasonable grounds for believing that the computer had typically been used in the operation of the importer's legitimate business, the customs officials' action was justified. (4) Against the company owner's wishes, a police officer accessed some of the files on one of the company's computers. Although the computer was typically used in the operation of the company's business, the particular files accessed by the police officer were personal letters written by one of the company's employees. Thus, the police officer's unauthorized use of the computer was not justified. 
 Answer:"	(1) Police department investigators accessed the electronic accounting files of the central computer owned by a consulting firm that was on trial for fraudulent business practices without seeking permission from the firm's owners. Contrary to the investigators' reasonable beliefs, however, the files ultimately provided no evidence of wrongdoing. Nevertheless, the investigators' action was justified.
145	"Context: The conventional process for tanning leather uses large amounts of calcium oxide and sodium sulfide. Tanning leather using biological catalysts costs about the same as using these conventional chemicals if the cost of waste disposal is left out of the comparison. However, nearly 20 percent less waste is produced with biological catalysts, and waste disposal is a substantial part of the overall cost of tanning. It is therefore less costly to tan leather if biological catalysts are used instead. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) Leather tanned using the conventional process is not lower in quality than is leather tanned using biological catalysts. (1) The biological catalysts that can be used in the tanning process are less costly by weight than are calcium oxide and sodium sulfide. (2) New technological innovations have recently made the use of biological catalysts in the tanning process much more cost effective. (3) Disposal of tanning waste produced with biological catalysts does not cost significantly more than disposal of the same amount of waste produced with the conventional process. (4) The labor costs associated with tanning leather using biological catalysts are not any greater than the labor costs associated with the conventional tanning process. 
 Answer:"	(3) Disposal of tanning waste produced with biological catalysts does not cost significantly more than disposal of the same amount of waste produced with the conventional process.
146	"Context: One should not play a practical joke on someone if it shows contempt for that person or if one believes it might bring significant harm to that person. 
 Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments? 
 (0) I should not have played that practical joke on you yesterday. Even if it was not contemptuous, I should have realized that it would bring significant harm to someone. (1) I have no reason to think that the practical joke I want to play would harm anyone. So, since the joke would show no contempt for the person the joke is played on, it would not be wrong for me to play it. (2) Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm. (3) It would have been wrong for me to play the practical joke that I had intended to play on you. Even though I did not have reason to think that it would significantly harm anyone, I did think that it would show contempt for someone. (4) Someone was harmed as a result of my practical joke. Thus, even though it did not show contempt for the person I played the joke on, I should not have played it. 
 Answer:"	(2) Because of the circumstances, it would be wrong for me to play the practical joke I had intended to play on you. Even though it would not show contempt for anyone, it could easily bring you significant harm.
147	"Context: Economics professor: Marty's Pizza and Checkers Pizza are the two major pizza parlors in our town. Marty's sold coupon books including coupons good for one large plain pizza at any local pizza parlor, at Marty's expense. But Checkers refused to accept these coupons, even though they were redeemed by all other local pizza parlors. Accepting them would have cost Checkers nothing and would have satisfied those of its potential customers who had purchased the coupon books. This shows that Checkers's motive in refusing to accept the coupons was simply to hurt Marty's Pizza. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the economics professor's conclusion to be properly drawn? 
 (0) Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor. (1) Any company that wishes to hurt a competitor by refusing to accept coupons issued by that competitor will refuse to accept them even when accepting them would cost nothing and would satisfy its potential customers. (2) At least one company has refused to accept coupons issued by its major local competitor simply in order to hurt that competitor, even though those coupons were accepted by all other local competitors. (3) Any company that accepts its major competitor's coupons helps its competitor by doing so, even if it also satisfies its own actual or potential customers. (4) If accepting coupons issued by a competitor would not enable a company to satisfy its actual or potential customers, then that company's refusal to accept the coupons is motivated by the desire to satisfy customers. 
 Answer:"	(0) Any company that refuses to accept coupons issued by a competitor when doing so would satisfy some of the company's potential customers is motivated solely by the desire to hurt that competitor.
148	"Context: Science writer: Scientists' astounding success rate with research problems they have been called upon to solve causes the public to believe falsely that science can solve any problem. In fact, the problems scientists are called upon to solve are typically selected by scientists themselves. When the problems are instead selected by politicians or business leaders, their formulation is nevertheless guided by scientists in such a way as to make scientific solutions feasible. Scientists are almost never asked to solve problems that are not subject to such formulation. 
 Question: The science writer's statements, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? 
 (0) If a problem can be formulated in such a way as to make a scientific solution feasible, scientists will usually be called upon to solve that problem. (1) Any problem a scientist can solve can be formulated in such a way as to make a scientific solution feasible. (2) Scientists would probably have a lower success rate with research problems if their grounds for selecting such problems were less narrow. (3) Most of the problems scientists are called upon to solve are problems that politicians and business leaders want solved, but whose formulation the scientists have helped to guide. (4) The only reason for the astounding success rate of science is that the problems scientists are called upon to solve are usually selected by the scientists themselves. 
 Answer:"	(2) Scientists would probably have a lower success rate with research problems if their grounds for selecting such problems were less narrow.
149	"Context: Most auto mechanics have extensive experience. Furthermore, most mechanics with extensive experience understand electronic circuits. Thus, most auto mechanics understand electronic circuits. 
 Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above? 
 (0) During times of the year when automobile traffic increases, gas prices also increase. Increases in gas prices lead to increases in consumer complaints. Thus, increased automobile traffic causes increased consumer complaints. (1) The most common species of birds in this region are migratory. Moreover, most migratory birds have left this region by the end of November. Hence, few birds remain in this region during the winter. (2) It is not surprising that most speeding tickets in this region are issued to drivers of sports cars. After all, most drivers who are not interested in driving fast do not buy sports cars. (3) Most nature photographers find portrait photography boring. Moreover, most portrait photographers especially enjoy photographing dignitaries. Thus, most nature photographers find photographing dignitaries especially boring. (4) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer. 
 Answer:"	(4) Most snow-removal companies run lawn-care services during the summer. Also, most companies that run lawn-care services during the summer hire additional workers in the summer. Thus, most snow-removal companies hire additional workers in the summer.
150	"Context: If one wants to succeed, then one should act as though one were genuinely confident about one's abilities, even if one actually distrusts one's skills. Success is much more easily obtained by those who genuinely believe themselves capable of succeeding than by those filled with self-doubts. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) Those who convince others that they are capable of succeeding usually have few self-doubts. (1) Genuine confidence is often a by-product of pretended self-confidence. (2) Success is usually more a matter of luck or determination than of skill. (3) Many people who behave in a self-confident manner are genuinely confident about their abilities. (4) Self-doubt can hamper as well as aid the development of the skills necessary for success. 
 Answer:"	(1) Genuine confidence is often a by-product of pretended self-confidence.
151	"Context: Journalist: The trade union members at AutoFaber Inc. are planning to go on strike. Independent arbitration would avert a strike, but only if both sides agree to accept the arbitrator's recommendations as binding. However, based on past experience, the union is quite unlikely to agree to this, so a strike is likely. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments exhibits a pattern of reasoning most similar to that exhibited by the journalist's argument? 
 (0) The company will downsize unless more stock is issued. Furthermore, if the company downsizes, the shareholders will demand a change. Since no more stock is being issued, we can be sure that the shareholders will demand a change. (1) Rodriguez will donate her paintings to the museum only if the new wing is named after her. The only other person the new wing could be named after is the museum's founder, Wu. But it was decided yesterday that the gardens, not the new wing, would be named after Wu. So Rodriguez will donate her paintings to the museum. (2) Reynolds and Khripkova would not make suitable business partners, since they are constantly squabbling, whereas good business partners know how to get along with each other most of the time and, if they quarrel, know how to resolve their differences. (3) Lopez will run in tomorrow's marathon. Lopez will win the marathon only if his sponsors do a good job of keeping him hydrated. But his sponsors are known to be poor at keeping their athletes hydrated. So it is probable that Lopez will not win the marathon. (4) The new course in microeconomics is offered either in the fall or in the spring. The new course will be offered in the spring if there is a qualified instructor available. Since the economics department currently lacks a qualified instructor for such courses, however, the course will not be offered in the spring. 
 Answer:"	(3) Lopez will run in tomorrow's marathon. Lopez will win the marathon only if his sponsors do a good job of keeping him hydrated. But his sponsors are known to be poor at keeping their athletes hydrated. So it is probable that Lopez will not win the marathon.
152	"Context: Acquiring complete detailed information about all the pros and cons of a product one might purchase would clearly be difficult and expensive. It is rational not to acquire such information unless one expects that the benefits of doing so will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. Therefore, consumers who do not bother to acquire such information are thereby behaving rationally. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Rational consumers who do not expect that the benefits outweigh the cost and difficulty of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase usually do not bother to acquire such information. (1) Whenever it is rational not to acquire detailed information about a product, it would be irrational to bother to acquire such information. (2) The benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product one might purchase usually do not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. (3) Rational consumers usually expect that the benefits of acquiring detailed information about a product they might purchase would not outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. (4) Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so. 
 Answer:"	(4) Consumers who do not bother to acquire complete detailed information about a product they might purchase do not expect that the benefits of acquiring such information will outweigh the cost and difficulty of doing so.
153	"Context: Mayor: There has been a long debate in city council about how to accommodate projected increases in automobile traffic. Today, our choice is clear: either we adopt my plan to build a new expressway, or we do nothing. Doing nothing is not a viable option because our existing system of roads would be in gridlock within ten years given even a conservative estimate of future traffic levels. City council should therefore adopt my plan. 
 Question: The reasoning in the mayor's argument is most vulnerable to which one of the following criticisms? 
 (0) It bases a projection only on conservative estimates rather than considering a wider range of estimates. (1) It takes for granted that the options it considers are mutually exclusive. (2) It fails to consider the possibility that the rate of increase in traffic will start to diminish after ten years. (3) It fails to address the issue of the cost of traffic gridlock to the city's economy. (4) It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options 
 Answer:"	(4) It presents a choice that is limited to two options, without giving reasons for not considering any other options
154	"Context: Museum curakor: Our ancient Egyptian collection includes an earthenware hippopotamus that resembles a child's roy. It was discovered in a tomb, upside down, with its legs broken off. We know that the ancient Egyptians believed the dead had to wage eternal war with beasts. Breaking the legs off a representation of an animal was thought to help a deceased person in this war. We conclude that, far from being a roy, this hippopotamus was a religious object. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the curator's argument? 
 (0) The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not the tomb of a child. (1) Earthenware figures were never used as children's roys in ancient Egypt. (2) The tomb in which the hippopotamus was found was not reentered from the time of burial until archaeologists opened it. (3) The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb. (4) The hippopotamus was originally placed upside down in the tomb. 
 Answer:"	(3) The hippopotamus' legs were not broken 1hrough some natural occurrence after it was placed in the tomb.
155	"Context: Lawyer: Juries are traditionally given their instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. The verbiage is intended to make the instructions more precise, but greater precision is of little use if most jurors have difficulty understanding the instructions. Since it is more important for jurors to have a basic but adequate understanding of their role than it is for the details of that role to be precisely specified, jury instructions should be formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language. 
 Question: Each of the following, if true, strengthens the lawyer's argumoot EXCEPT: 
 (0) Most jurors are less likely to understand instructions given in convoluted, legalistic language than instructions given in simple, easily comprehensible language. (1) Most jurors do not have an adequate understanding of their role after being given jury instructions in convoluted, legalistic language. (2) Jury instructions formulated in simple, easily comprehensible language can adequately descrthe the role of the jurors. (3) The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language. (4) Jurors do not need to know the precise details of their role in order to have an adequate understanding of that role. 
 Answer:"	(3) The details of the role of the jurors cannot be specified with complete precision in simple, easily comprehensible language.
156	"Context: Traditional ""talk"" therapy, in which a patient with a psychological disorder discusses it with a trained therapist, produces chemical changes in the brain. These changes seem to correspond to improvements in certain aspects of the patient's behavior. Thus, physicians will eventually be able to treat such patients as effectively through pharmacological intervention in the brain's neurochemistry as through the lengthy intermediary of traditional ""talk"" methods. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argumoot depends? 
 (0) All neurochemical changes produce corresponding psychological changes. (1) improvements in a patient's behavior produced by ""talk"" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry. (2) Talk therapy has not been effective at bringing about psychological change. (3) If chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry correspond to improvemeots in patient behavior, then psychology and neuroscience will eventually be indistinguishable. (4) Direct intervention in the brain's neurochemistry is likely to become a less expensive way of treating psychological disorders than is ""talk"" therapy. 
 Answer:"	"(1) improvements in a patient's behavior produced by ""talk"" therapy occur only through chemical changes in the brain's neurochemistry."
157	"Context: Bacteria that benefit human beings whoo they are present in the body are called commensals. The bacterium Helicobacter pylori plays a primary role in the development of stomach ulcers. But since stomach ulcers occur in less than 10 percent of those harboring H pylori, and since it allegedly strengthens immune response, many scientists now consider it a commensal. But this is surely misguided. Only about 10 percent of the people who harbor Mycobacter tuberculosis-a bacterium that can cause tuberculosis-get sick from it, yet no one would call M tuberculosis a commensal. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument's reasoning? 
 (0) Stomach ulcers caused by H pylori and tuberculosis can both be effectively treated with antibiotics. (1) Cases of tuberculosis usually last longer than ulcers caused by H pylori. (2) People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence. (3) There are more people who harbor M tuberculosis than people who harbor H pylori. (4) There are more people who harbor H pylori than people who harbor M tuberculosis. 
 Answer:"	(2) People who harbor M tuberculosis derive no benefit from its presence.
158	"Context: Most apartments on the upper floors of The VIsta Anns apartment building have scenic views. So there is in the building at least one studio apartment with scenic views 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) All of the apartments on the lower floors of the building have scenic views. (1) All of the apartments in the building have scenic views. (2) Most of the apartments in the building are studio apartments. (3) Most of the apartments with scenic views are on the upper floors of the building. (4) Most of the apartments on the upper floors of the building are studio apartments. 
 Answer:"	(4) Most of the apartments on the upper floors of the building are studio apartments.
159	"Context: Mike: Tom did not tell me that I could use his computer, but it would not be wrong for me to use it anyway. Last week Tom used Mary's bicycle even though she had not told him he could use it. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justif Y Mike's reasoning? 
 (0) Using the possessions of others without their permission is not always theft. (1) Generally one should tell the truth, but there are cases in which it is permissible not to. (2) If people have used your property without your permission, it is not wrong for you to use their property without their permission. (3) It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others. (4) Using another person's property is wrong if the person is harmed by that use. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is permissible to treat people in a way that is siruilar to the way in which they have treated others.
160	"Context: Robinson: Wexell says that the museum wasted its money in purchasing props and costumes from famous stage productions, because such items have no artistic significance outside the context of a performance. But many of the props and costumes are too old and fragile for use in a performance. So clearly, the museum did not waste its money, for displaying these items is the only way of making them available to the public. 
 Question: The reasoning in Robinson's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) offers anecdotal evidence insufficient to support a general claim (1) gives reasons that do not address the point made in Wexell's argmnent (2) attacks the person making the argument rather than the substance of the argument (3) concludes that a claim is tilise merely on the grounds that the evidence for it is insufficient (4) takes a condition that is sufficient for the conclusion to be true as one that is necessary for the conclusion to be true 
 Answer:"	(1) gives reasons that do not address the point made in Wexell's argmnent
161	"Context: In a party game, one person leaves the room with the understanding that someone else will relate a recent dream to the remaining group. The person then returns and tries to reconstruct the dream by asking only yes-or-no questions. In fact, no dream has been related: the group simply answers the questions according to some arbitrary rule. Surprisingly, the person usually constructs a dream narrative that is both coherent and ingenious. 
 Question: The example presented above most closely conforms to which one of the following propositions? 
 (0) The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to irubue it with order and coherence. (1) One is less apt to reach a false understanding of what someone says than to make no sense out of it at all. (2) Dreams are often just collections ofiruages and ideas without coherent structures. (3) Interpreting another person's dream requires that one understand the dream as a coherent narrative. (4) People often invent clever and coherent stories to explain their behavior to other people. 
 Answer:"	(0) The presumption that something has order and coherence can lead one to irubue it with order and coherence.
162	"Context: Computer manufacturers have sought to make computer chips ever smaller, since decreasing the size of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) chip-without making that CPU chip any less sophisticated-will proportionally increase the speed of the CPU chip and the computer containing it. But since CPU chips cannot be made significantly smaller without decreasing their sophistication, computers cannot currently be made significantly taster. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
 (0) Computers cannot currently be made taster unless their CPU chips are made smaller. (1) Even if CPU chips are made slightly less sophisticated, they cannot currently be made much smaller. (2) If both the size and the sophistication of a CPU chip are decreased, the speed of that chip will decrease. (3) Few, if any, computer manufacturers believe that computers can be made significantly faster. (4) Increasing the sophistication of a CPU chip without increasing its size will proportionally increase its speed. 
 Answer:"	(0) Computers cannot currently be made taster unless their CPU chips are made smaller.
163	"Context: In the last year, biologists have learned that there are many more species of amphibians in existence than had previously been known. This definitely undermines environmentalists' claim that pollution is eliminating many of these species every year. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument above is most vulnerable to criticism. on the grOl.mds that it involves a confusion between 
 (0) kinds of things and the things that are ofthose kinds (1) a condition necessary for a phenomenon and one that is sufficient for it (2) a cause and an effect (3) a correlation between two phenomena and a causal relationship between them (4) changes in our knowledge of objects and changes in the objects themselves 
 Answer:"	(4) changes in our knowledge of objects and changes in the objects themselves
164	"Context: Because dried peat moss, which is derived from sphagnum moss, contains no chemical additives and is a renewable resource, many gardeners use large amounts of it as a soil conditioner in the belief that the practice is environmentally sound. They are mistaken. The millions of acres of sphagnum moss in the world contribute more oxygen to the atmosphere than do all of the world's rain forests combined, and the garden soil industry is depleting these areas much faster than they can renew themselves. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the argwnent's reasoning? 
 (0) Using a product may be environmentally unsound even if the product is a renewable resource and contains no chemical additive. (1) A practice is not environmentally sound if it significantly reduces the amount of oxygen entering the atmosphere. (2) A practice is environmentally sound if it helps to protect rain forests that contribute large amounts of oxygen to the atmosphere. (3) If the environmental benefits ofa practice outweigh the environmental costs, that practice can be legitimately considered environmentally sound. (4) If the practices of an industry threaten a vital resource, those practices should be banned. 
 Answer:"	(1) A practice is not environmentally sound if it significantly reduces the amount of oxygen entering the atmosphere.
165	"Context: Brooks: I'm unhappy in my job, but I don't know whether I can accept the risks involved in quitting my job. Morgenstern: The only risk in quitting is that of not finding another job. If you don't find one, you're going to be pretty unhappy. But you're already unhappy, so you might as well just quit. 
 Question: Morgenstern's argument is flawed in that it 
 (0) fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance (1) relies on an assumption that is tantamount to assuming that the conclusion is true (2) mischaracterize what Brooks says (3) conllates two different types of risk (4) reaches a generalization on the basis of a single case 
 Answer:"	(0) fails to take into account that unhappiness can vary in intensity or significance
166	"Context: Only Canadian films are shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. This year, most of the films that won prizes at that festival also won prizes at international film festivals.

(1) Most of the Canadian Films produced this year were shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. (2) Some of the films that won prizes at international film festivals this year were Canadian films. (3) This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival. (4) This year, at least one Film that won a prize at an international Film festival was not shown at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival. 
 Answer:"	(3) This year, not every film that won a prize at the Lac Nichoutec Film Festival was also shown at an international film festival.
167	"Context: Commentator: Many social critics claim that contemporary journalists' cynical tendency to look for selfish motives behind the seemingly altruistic actions of powerful people undermines our society's well-being by convincing people that success is invariably associated with greed and mendacity. But the critics' claim is absurd. The cynicism of contemporary journalists cannot be a contributing factor to the undermining of our society's well-being, for journalists have always been cynics. Today's journalists are, if anything, more restrained than their predecessors. 
 Question: The reasoning in the commentator's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it overlooks the possibility that 
 (0) widespread cynicism is beneficial to the wellbeing of society (1) cynicism about the motives of powerful people increases with the am01mt of information one has about them (2) the work of contemporary journalists reflects a cynicism that is not really genuine (3) any accurate description of human bebavior portrays it as selfish (4) cynicism of this type on the part of journalists has always had a negative effect on the well-being of society 
 Answer:"	(3) any accurate description of human bebavior portrays it as selfish
168	"Context: The owners of Uptown Apartments are leaning toward not improving the apartment complex; they believe that the increased rents they could charge for improved apartments would not cover the costs of the improvements. But the improvements would make the surrounding housing, which they also own, more valuable and rentable for higher rents. So the owners should make the improvements. 
 Question: The reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to the reasoning in the argument above? 
 (0) John's injured knee does not cause him a lot of pain, so he does not want to undergo the pain of surgery to heal it. But the surgery would enable him to exercise regularly again. Thus John should have the surgery. (1) Since its fishing season lasts only six months, Laketown Fishing Company prefers renting boats to buying its own. But since boats can be used for other purposes during the fishing season, it has made the wrong decision. (2) Max's mechanic thinks there is a crack in the left cylinder head of Max's car and wants to remove the engine to check. Such a diagnostic engine removal would cost about $175, even if the cylinder head does not need replacement But if the cylinder head is cracked and is not replaced, the engine will be ruined. So Max should have the mechanic check for the crack. (3) Because of dental problems, Leona cut her consumption of candy. Consequently, she learned to enjoy fruit more. Thus, dental problems, which can lead to other health problems, led in her case to an improved diet and better health overall. (4) Bulk Fruit Company is deciding whether to market a new hybrid fruit. It is enthusiastic about the idea, since research suggests that people will come to like this fruit. therefore, it is in the long-term interest of the company to market the hybrid fruit. 
 Answer:"	(0) John's injured knee does not cause him a lot of pain, so he does not want to undergo the pain of surgery to heal it. But the surgery would enable him to exercise regularly again. Thus John should have the surgery.
169	"Context: Ditalgame Corporation's computer video games are subject to widespread illegal copying. To combat this piracy, Ditalgame will begin using a new copy protection feature on its games. Ditalgame's president predicts a substantial increase in sales of the company's games once the new copy protection feature is implemented. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the president's prediction? 
 (0) Ditalgame has spent millions of dollars developing the new copy protection feature , and the company can recoup these costs only if its sales increase substantially. (1) Over the last several years, the market for computer games has grown steadily, but Ditalgame's share of that market has shrunk considerably. (2) The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it. (3) Game Review Monthly, the most commonly read magazine among people who frequently copy computer games, generally gives favorable reviews to Ditalgame games. (4) Computer games produced by Ditalgame are copied more frequently than computer games 
 Answer:"	(2) The copy protection feature causes a copied game to be playable just long enough for most people to come to enjoy it so much that they decide they have to have it.
170	"Context: Columnist: It may soon be possible for an economy to function without paper money. Instead, the government would electronically record all transactions as they take place. However, while this may be technologically feasible it would never be willingly accepted by a society, for it gives the government too much power. People are rightly distrustful of governments with 100 much power. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion of the columnist's argument? 
 (0) A society would never willingly accept a system in which, in lieu of paper money, the government keeps track of every transaction electronically. (1) it is reasonable for people to distrust a government that has too much power. (2) New technology may soon make it possible for an economy to operate without paper money. (3) People are right to be unwilling to give the government the power it would need to operate an economy without paper money. (4) Even though it may be technologically feasible, no government will be able to operate an economy without the use of paper money. 
 Answer:"	(0) A society would never willingly accept a system in which, in lieu of paper money, the government keeps track of every transaction electronically.
171	"Context: Social scientist: Since the body of thought known as Marxism claims to descrthe rigorously an inexorable historical movement toward the socialization of the means of production, it should be regarded as a scientific theory. Thus, certain interpreters, in taking Marxism as a political program aimed at radically transforming society, have misconstrued it. 
 Question: The social scientist's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) The description that Marxism gives of certain historical phenomena in the economic sphere is as rigorous as it is claimed to be. (1) The aims of science are incompatlble with the aims of those who would seek to transform society by political means. (2) Only bodies of thought consisting purely of rigorous description are scientific theories. (3) Scientific theories cannot be correctly interpreted to be, or to imply, political programs. (4) The means of production will inevitably become socialized regardless of any political programs designed to make that occur. 
 Answer:"	(3) Scientific theories cannot be correctly interpreted to be, or to imply, political programs.
172	"Context: Daniel: There are certain actions that moral duty obliges us to perform regardless of their consequences. However, an action is not morally good simply because it fulfills a moral obligation. No action can be morally good unless it is performed with the right motivations. Carrie: Our motivations for our actions are not subject to our conscious control. Therefore, the only thing that can be required for an action to be morally good is that it fulfill a moral obligation. 
 Question: The dialogue most supports the claim that Daniel and Carrie are committed to disagreeing with each other about the truth of which one of the following statements? 
 (0) No one can be morally required to do something that is impossible to do. (1) Some actions that are performed with the right motivations are not morally good. (2) All actions that fulfill moral obligations are performed in order to fulfill moral obligations. (3) An action performed with the wrong motivations cannot be morally good. (4) If a person's motivations for acting are based on a sense of duty, then that person's action is morally good. 
 Answer:"	(3) An action performed with the wrong motivations cannot be morally good.
173	"Context: The mayor was not telling the truth when he said that the bridge renovation did not waste taxpayers' money. The very commission he set up to look into government waste reported that the Southern Tier Project, of which the bridge renovation was a part, was egregiously wasteful. 
 Question: The reasoning io the argument is flawed io that the argument 
 (0) infers that a part has a certain quality merely on the grounds that the whole to which it belongs has that quality (1) draws a general conclusion about government waste on the basis of a single instance of such waste (2) attacks the mayor's character rather than assessing the strength of the evidence supporting the mayor's claim (3) puts forward evidence that presupposes an important part of the claim that the argument attempts to support (4) rejects a position on the grounds that the motives of the person who has advanced the position were not disinterested 
 Answer:"	(0) infers that a part has a certain quality merely on the grounds that the whole to which it belongs has that quality
174	"Context: The airport's runways are too close to each other to allow simultaneous use of adjacent runways when visibility is poor, so the airport allows only 30 planes an hour to land in poor weather; in good weather 60 planes an hour are allowed to land. Because airline schedules assume good weather, bad weather creates serious delays. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) In poor weather, only half as many planes are allowed to land each hour on any one runway at the airport as are allowed to land on it io good weather. (1) When the weather at the airport is good it is likely that there are planes landing on two adjacent runways at any given time. (2) If any two of the airport's runways are used simultaneously, serious delays result. (3) Airlines using the airport base their schedules on the assumption that more than 30 planes an hour will be allowed to land at the airport (4) In good weather, there are few if any seriously delayed flights at the airport. 
 Answer:"	(3) Airlines using the airport base their schedules on the assumption that more than 30 planes an hour will be allowed to land at the airport
175	"Context: As a general rule, the larger a social group of primates, the more time its members spend grooming one another. The maio purpose of this social grooming is the maintenance of social cohesion. Furthermore, group size among primates tends to increase proportionally with the size of the neocortex, the seat of higher thought in the brain. Extrapolating upon the relationship between group size and neocortex size, we can infer that early human groups were quite large. But unexpectedly, there is strong evidence that, apart from parents grooming their children, these humans spent virtually no time grooming one another. 
 Question: Which one of the followiog, if true, would do most to resolve the apparent discrepancy descrthed above? 
 (0) Early humans were much more likely to groom themselves than are the members of other primate species. (1) Early humans developed languages, which provided a more effective way of maintaining social cohesion than social grooming. (2) Early humans were not as extensively covered with hair as are other primates, and consequently they had less need for social grooming. (3) While early humans probably lived io large groups, there is strong evidence that they hunted io small groups. (4) Many types of primates other than humans have fairly large neocortex regions and display frequent social grooming. 
 Answer:"	(1) Early humans developed languages, which provided a more effective way of maintaining social cohesion than social grooming.
176	"Context: Had the party's economic theories been sound and had it succeeded in implementing its program, the inflation rate would have lessened considerably. But because the inflation rate actually increased, the party's economic theories were fur off the mark. 
 Question: The flawed reasoning in which one oflbe following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above? 
 (0) If the people who inhabited the valley for so long had been invaded, or iflbere had been a dramatic climatic change, there would have been chaoges in the valley's architecture. But architecture in the valley remained the same throughout their stay. Thus, the valley people must not have been invaded at any time during their stay. (1) Many people fear that iflbe opposition party wins the election and keeps its promise to cut wages dramatically, workers in key industries will strike. But because the workers have promised not to strike, these workers must think the party will not keep its promise of a dramatic wage cut. (2) If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries. (3) City residents were expected to show a great deal of support for the rebels iflbe battle was won and the jailed rebel leaders freed. Residents have shown a great deal of support or the rebels for the last three days. Therefore, the rebels must have won the battle. (4) Iflbe television station's new wealber forecasting equipment had been worth the investment, the accuracy of its forecasts would have risen, along wilb its ratings. But the station's ratings actually decreased. Thus, the new equipment is no improvement on the old. 
 Answer:"	(2) If the company had succeeded in selling its subsidiaries and used the cash to purchase the new patent, its stock price would have doubled in the last two years. But the price oflbe stock did not increase in that time. Thus, the company must have failed to sell its subsidiaries.
177	"Context: When a group is unable to reach a consensus, group members are often accused of being stubborn, bullheaded, or unyielding. Such epithets often seem abusive, are difficult to prove, and rarely help the group reach a resolution. Those who wish to make such an accusation stick, however, should choose ""unyielding,"" because one can always appeal to the fact that the accused has not yielded; obviously if one acknowledges that a person has not yielded, then one cannot deny that the person is unyielding, at least on this issue. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes the argumentative technique employed above? 
 (0) rejecting a factic on the grounds that it constitutes an attack on the character of a person and has no substance in :fact (1) rejecting a factic on the grounds that the factic makes it virtually imposSlble for the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question (2) conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an accusation that is less offensive than the alternatives (3) conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument that would help the group to reach a consensus on the issue in question (4) conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion 
 Answer:"	(4) conditionally advocating a factic on the grounds that it results in an argument for which one could not consistently accept the premise but deny the conclusion
178	"Context: According the official results of last week's national referendum, 80 percent voted in favor of the proposal. But those results must be rigged. Everyone I know voted against the proposal, which is clear evidence that most people voted against it 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately descrthes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument? 
 (0) The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population. (1) The argument presumes the truth of the conclusion that it sets out to prove. (2) The argument rejects a claim by attacking the proponents of the claim rather than addressing the claim itself. (3) The argument fails to make a needed distinction between how people should have voted and how they actually voted. (4) The argument defends a claim solely on the grounds that most people believe it. 
 Answer:"	(0) The argument uses evidence drawn from a sample that is unlikely to be representative of the general population.
179	"Context: Editorial: It is usually desirable for people to have access to unregulated information, such as is found on the Internet. But a vast array of misinformation will always show up on the Internet, and it is difficult to determine which information is accurate. Accurate information is useless unless it can easily be distinguished from misinformation; thus, the information on the Internet should somehow be regulated. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justiJY the editorial's argument? 
 (0) It is never possible to regulate misinformation without restricting people's access to accurate information. (1) Even if information is regulated, accurate information is often indistinguishable from misinfonnation. (2) Regulation of information makes it easy for people to distinguish between accurate information and misinformation. (3) It is acceptable for people to have access to a vast array of misinformation only if accurate information is never overlooked as a result (4) It is usually more desirable for people to have access to useless, unregulated misinformation than it is for them to have access only to accurate but regulated information. 
 Answer:"	(2) Regulation of information makes it easy for people to distinguish between accurate information and misinformation.
180	"Context: Some members have criticized the club's president for inviting Dr. Hines to speak at the annual awards banquet without consulting other club members beforehand. But a few years ago the previous club president hired a tax accountant even though he had not discussed it with club members beforehand. So the current president acted appropriately in the way in which she invited Dr. Hines. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument relies? 
 (0) The previous club president had also invited speakers without first consulting other club members. (1) At the time the previous club president hired the tax accountant, most club members did not expect to be consulted about such matters. (2) Dr. Hines accepted the president's invitation to speak at the club's annual awards banquet. (3) The club president has more discretion in hiring an accountant than in hiring a speaker. (4) The club's previous president acted appropriately in hiring the tax accountant without first consulting other club members.

181	"Context: Company spokesperson: Household Products magazine claims that our Filterator X water filter does not remove chemical contaminants in significant amounts. This attack on the quality of our product is undermined by the experience of the millions of Filterator X owners who are satisfied with the product's performance. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the company spokesperson's argument? 
 (0) Household Products did not evaluate whether the Filterator X water filter significantly improved the taste of drinking water. (1) Most Filterator X owners have no way to determine how effectively the product removes chemical contaminants from water. (2) People whose household water contsins chemical contsminants are more likely than other people to buy a Filterator X water filter. (3) Very few people who own a Filterator X read Household Products on a consistent basis. (4) Household Products' evaluations of Filterator X water ::tilters have been consistently negative 
 Answer:"	(1) Most Filterator X owners have no way to determine how effectively the product removes chemical contaminants from water.
182	"Context: A famous artist once claimed that all great art imitates nature. If this claim is correct, then any music that is great art would imitate nature. But while some music may imitate ocean waves or the galloping of horses, for example, most great music imitates nothing at all. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main point of the argument? 
 (0) Music is inferior to the other arts. (1) Either the artist's claim is incorrect, or most great music is not great art. (2) Like some great music, some great painting and sculpture may fail to imitate nature. (3) Some elements of nature cannot be represented adequately by great art. (4) Sounds that do not imitate nature are not great music. 
 Answer:"	(1) Either the artist's claim is incorrect, or most great music is not great art.
183	"Context: Patricia: During Japan's Tokugawa period, martial arts experts known as ninjas were trained for the purposes of espionage and assassination. Yet at that time there was actually very little ninja activity in Japan, and most Japanese did not fear ninjas. Tamara: That is not true. Many wealthy Japanese during the Tokugawa period had their houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors so that they would receive warning if a ninja were in the house. 
 Question: Of the following, which one, if true, is the strongest counter Patricia can make to Tamara's objection? 
 (0) Many poor Japanese during the Tokugawa period also had houses constructed with intentionally squeaky floors. (1) As part of their secret training, ninjas learned to walk on squeaky floors without making a sound. (2) The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.

 Answer:"	(2) The wealthy made up a small portion of Japan's population during the Tokugawa period.
184	"Context: Philosopher: Both the consequences and the motives of human actions have bearing on the moral worth of those actions. Nonetheless, to be a moral agent one must have :free will, because one cannot be a moral agent without desiring to conform to a principle. 
 Question: The philosopher's argument requires the assumption that 
 (0) one cannot be a moral agent if one lacks a concern for the consequences of actions (1) desiring to conform to a principle requires free will (2) nobody who acts without taking the consequences of the action into consideration is free (3) it is impossible to have desires without also being a moral agent (4) it is impossible to perform morally worthy actions without at some time conforming to a principle 
 Answer:"	(1) desiring to conform to a principle requires free will
185	"Context: A significant amount of the acquisition budget of a typical university library is spent on subscriptions to scholarly journals. Over the last several years, the average subscription rate a library pays for such a journal has increased dramatically, even though the costs of publishing a scholarly journal have remained fairly constant Obviously, then, in most cases publishing a scholarly journal must be much more profitable now than it was several years ago. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
 (0) Many university libraries have begun to charge higher and higher fines for overdue books and periodicals as a way of passing on increased journal subscription costs to library users. (1) A university library's acquisition budget usually represents only a small fraction of its total operating budget. (2) Publishing a scholarly journal is an expensive enterprise, and publishers of such journals cannot survive financially if they consistently lose money. (3) Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years. (4) The majority of scholarly journals are published no more than four times a year. 
 Answer:"	(3) Most subscnbers to scholarly journals are individuals, not hbraries, and the subscription rates for individuals have generally remained unchanged for the past several years.
186	"Context: Terrence Gurney suggests that because his books appeal to a wide audience, he is not given due credit for his literary achievements. Surely he is mistaken. Gurney's books tell interesting stories, but the writing is flat, leaving no lasting impression on the reader. This is likely the reason that Gurney has not received praise for literary achievement 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately states the argument's overall conclusion? 
 (0) Terrence Gurney is mistaken when he suggests that the wide appeal of his bocks has prevented him from being given due credit for his literIII)' achievements. (1) Terrence Gurney's books are not significant literary achievements. (2) Even though Terrence Gurney's books tell interesting stories, his writing is flat and leaves no lasting impression on the reader. (3) Terrence Gurney has not been given due credit for his literary achievements because his books appeal to such a wide audience. (4) Terrence Gurney should have received some praise for his literary achievements despite the fact that his writing is flat and leaves no lasting impression on the reader. 
 Answer:"	(0) Terrence Gurney is mistaken when he suggests that the wide appeal of his bocks has prevented him from being given due credit for his literIII)' achievements.
187	"Context: In an experiment designed to show how life may have begun on Earth, scientists demonstrated that an electrical spark-or ligh1ning-could produce amino acids, the building blocks of Earth's life. However, unless the spark occurs in a ""reducing"" atmosphere, that is, onc rich in hydrogen and lean in oxygen, amino acids do not form readily and tend to break apart when they do form. Scientists now believe that Earth's atmosphere was actually rich in oxygen and lean in nitrogen at the time life began. 
 Question: Assuming that the scientists' current belief about Earth's atmosphere at the time life began is correct, which one of the following, if true, would most help to explain how ligh1ning could have produced the first nino acids on Earth? 
 (0) Meteorite impacts at the time life began on Earth temporarily created a reducing atmosphere around the impact site. (1) A single amino acid could have been sufficient to begin the formation of life on Earth. (2) Earth's atmosphere has changed significantly since life first began. (3) Ligh1ning was less common on Earth at the time life began than it is now. (4) Asteroids contain amino acids, and some of these amino acids could survive an asteroid's impact with Earth. 
 Answer:"	(0) Meteorite impacts at the time life began on Earth temporarily created a reducing atmosphere around the impact site.
188	"Context: Art critic: The Woerner Journalism Award for criticism was given to Nan Paulsen for her reviews of automobiles. This is inappropriate. The criticism award should be given for criticism, which Paulsen's reviews clearly were not. After alL cars are utilitarian things, not works of art. And objects that are not works of art do not reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justiJY the reasoning in the art critic's argument? 
 (0) The Woemer Journalism Award for criticism should not be given to a writer who portrays utilitarian objects as works of art. (1) Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them. (2) Unless a review is written for the purpose of revealing important truths about the writer's culture, that review should not be considered to be criticism. (3) The Woerner JournalismAward for criticism should not be given to writers who do not consider themselves to be critics. (4) All writing that reveals important truths about a culture should be considered to be criticism. 
 Answer:"	(1) Reviews of objects cannot appropriately be considered to be criticism unless the objects reveal important truths about the culture that produced them.
189	"Context: Manager: Our company's mail-order sales have recently increased 25 percent This increase started around the time we started offering unlimited free shipping, rather than just free shipping on orders over $50. Thus, our change in policy probably caused the increase. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the manager's argument? 
 (0) Mail-order sales have been decreasing for companies that do not offer unlimited free shipping. (1) The company did not widely advertise its change in poliey. (2) The company's profits frOIn mail-order sales have increased since the change in poliey. (3) The company's change in poliey occurred well after its competitors started offering unlimited free shipping. (4) Most companies offer free shipping only on mailorder purehases over $50. 
 Answer:"	(0) Mail-order sales have been decreasing for companies that do not offer unlimited free shipping.
190	"Context: Proponents of nuclear power point out that new nuclear plants are so technologically sophisticated that the chances of a meltdown are extremely small. This is true, but it would still be unwise to build nuclear power plants, since the consequences of a meltdown are absolutely catastrophic. 
 Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above? 
 (0) Many mountain climbers claim that their sport is safe because mishaps, though often fatal, are rare. However, mountain climbing is very risky: although the number of mishaps is small, so is the number of mountain climbers. Hence, the chance of a fatal mishap during mountain climbing is not as slim as it may seem. (1) Eating a serving of vegetables just once will not improve your health. It is nonetheless prudent to do so, for eating vegetables every day will make you much healthier over time. (2) Skydivers always use two parachutes: a main chute and an auxiliary one in case the main chute malfunctions. Thus, the risk of a fatal mishap is low. Nonetheless, it is foolish to skydive, for though the risk is small, the rewards from skydiving are also small. (3) The risk of serious injury when bungee jumping is quite low. Nonetheless, it is reckless to engage in that activity, for the injuries that would result in the case of an accident are so extreme that it is not worth the risk. (4) People complain about having to wear seat belts because they believe the chances of traffic accidents are slim. This is true; on any given trip it is unlikely that a collision will occur. However, it is till unwise to ride in a car without a seat belt, for the effort it takes to put one on is minimal. 
 Answer:"	(3) The risk of serious injury when bungee jumping is quite low. Nonetheless, it is reckless to engage in that activity, for the injuries that would result in the case of an accident are so extreme that it is not worth the risk.
191	"Context: University president: Research institutions have an obligation to promote research in any field of theoretical investigation if that research shows some promise of yielding insights into the causes of practical problems that affect people's quality of life. 
 Question: The principle stated by the university president, ifvalid, most helps to justitY which one of the following actions? 
 (0) A university denies a grant application from a fucuity member for work on a solurion to a tiunous mathematical puzzle that has no relation to practical concerns. (1) A government agency funds a research project in astrophysics designed to determine whether there are theoretical limits on the magnitude of planets in distant solar systems. (2) A university funds a research position in the pbysics department that involves no teaching but has the responsibility for managing all the grant applications by members of the physics fucuity. (3) A foundation decides not to fund a research proposal in applied mathematics that sought to model certain poorly understood aspects of economic behavior. (4) A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties offolded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease. 
 Answer:"	(4) A research institute funds an investigation into the mathematical properties offolded structures that is likely to aid in understanding the structure of proteins that cause disease.
192	"Context: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a nerve disorder that affects the hands and wrists, is often caused by repetitive motions such as typing on a keyboard. A recent study of office workers found that, among those who do similar amounts of typing, workers reporting the least control over their own work had almost three times the risk of developing carpal tunnel syndrome as did those who reported the most control. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the study's findiogs? 
 (0) Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to do significantly less typing than do those who have the least control over their own work. (1) Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders. (2) The keyboards on which office workers type teod to put typists' arms and hands in positions that promote the development of carpal tunnel syndrome. (3) Among office workers who rarely use keyboards, the rate of carpal tunnel syndrome is much higher for those who feel that they lack control over their own work. (4) Office workers who have the most control over their own work tend to perform repetitive motions other than typing more often than do office workers with the least control over their own work. 
 Answer:"	(1) Feeling a lack of control over one's own work teods to put one under emotional stress that makes one more susceptible to nerve disorders.
193	"Context: Principle: Employees of telemarketing agencies should never do anything that predisposes people to dislike the agencies' clients.

 Question: Which one of the following, if true, justifies the given application of the principle above? 
 (0) Any employee of a telemarketing agency is likely to be able to detennine whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will likely engender nimosity toward the client. (1) Some employees oftelemarketing agencies are unlikely to be certain about whether trying to talk someone into buying the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will likely engenderanimosity toward the client. (2) Any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client. (3) Some people that an employee of a telemarketing agency calls to ask them to buy the product of a client of the agency will refuse to do so even though they are not predisposed to dislike the client. (4) People who are already predisposed to dislike the client of a te1emarketiug agency are more likely to refuse to buy the product of that client than are people who are predisposed to like the client. 
 Answer:"	(2) Any employee of a telemarketing agency who tries to get someone to buy the product of a client of the agency after the person has said that he or she does not want to will engender animosity toward the client.
194	"Context: Although Pluto has an atmosphere and is much larger than any asteroid, Pluto is not a true planet. Pluto formed in orbit around the planet Neptune and was then ejected from orbit around Neptune when Triton, Neptune's largest moon, was captured by Neptune's gravity. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) No celestial body can simultaneously be a moon and a planet. (1) Not all celestial bodies that have an atmosphere and orbit the sun are true planets. (2) If Pluto had not been ejected from its orbit around Neptune, Pluto would not have its current orbit around the sun and would still be a moon. (3) The size of a celestial body in orbit around the sun is not relevant to determining whether or not it is a true planet. (4) For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively. 
 Answer:"	(4) For a celestial body to be a true planet it must have formed in orbit around the sun exclusively.
195	"Context: A high-calorie diet providing adequate fats was a crucial requirement for the evolution of the anatomically modem human brain, a process that began among our early human ancestors. Food resources that could support such a diet were most abundant and reliable in the shore environments that were available to early humans. Nevertheless, the human brain's evolution took place almost exclusively in savanna and woodland areas. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent conflict presented above? 
 (0) Early humans had a significantly lower metabolic rate than anatomically modem humans,allowing them to expend their fat reserves more efficiently. (1) The brains of the earliest known humans were 30 percent smaller than the anatomically modem human brain. (2) Prehistoric savanna and woodland areas offered more reliable and abundant resources than they do today. (3) The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed. (4) Gathering food in shore enviromnents required a significantly greater expenditure of calories by early humans than did gathering food in other environments. 
 Answer:"	(3) The techniques used to explore the archaeology of prehistoric shore sites have only recently been developed.

 Question: The editors' dialogue provides the most support for the claim that they disagree with each other about whether 
 (0) a photograph's composition should be related to a statement that it makes (1) a photograph that is not attractive can still be a good photograph (2) a photograph that makes no statement can still be attractive (3) attractiveness by itself can make a photograph a good photograph (4) attractive composition and prettiness are the same feature 
 Answer:"	(3) attractiveness by itself can make a photograph a good photograph
197	"Context: University president We will be forced to reduce spending next year if we do not increase our enrollment. So, if we are to maintain the quality of the education we provide, we must market our programs more aggressively. Without such marketing we will be unable to increase our enrollment.

 Answer:"	(3) The university will not maintain the quality of the education it provides if it reduces spending next year.
198	"Context: If the city starts requiring residents to sort the materials that they put out for recycling, then many residents will put more recyclables in with their regular garbage. This will result in more recyclables being buried in the city's landfill. However, because of the cost of having city workers do the sorting, the sanitation department will not stay within its budget unless the sorting requirement for residents is implemented. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements logically follows from the information above? 
 (0) Most of the city's residents will continue to recycle even if a sorting requirement is implemented. (1) If the city starts requiring residents to sort their recyclables, then all of the residents who continue to recycle will sort their recyclables. (2) Implementing the sorting requirement would not cause the city's annual cost of sending garbage to its landfill to exceed its current annual cost of sorting recyclables. (3) The amount of recyclables going to the city's landfill will increase if the sanitation department stays within its budget. (4) If the city implements the sorting requirement, the sanitation department will stay within its budget. 
 Answer:"	(3) The amount of recyclables going to the city's landfill will increase if the sanitation department stays within its budget.
199	"Context: Meerkat ""sentinels,"" so-called because they watch for predators while other meerkat group members forage, almost never fall victim to those predators, yet the foragers often do. This advantage accruing to the sentinel does not mean that its watchful behavior is entirely self-interested. On the contrary, the sentinel's behavior is an example of animal behavior motivated at least in part by altruism. The loud bark emitted by the sentinel as it dashes for the cover of the nearest hole alerts other group members to the presence of danger. 
 Question: Which one of the following is a questionable reasoning technique employed in the argument? 
 (0) appealing to evidence that tends to undermine rather than support the argument's conclusion (1) appealing to evidence that presupposes the truth of the argument's conclusion (2) inferting solely from an effeet produeed by an action that a purpose of the action is to produce that effect (3) inferting solely from the claim that the behavior of a meerut sentinel is not entirely selfish that this behavior is entirely altruistic (4) concluding that a claim is false on the grounds that insufficient evidence has been offi:red to support it 
 Answer:"	(2) inferting solely from an effeet produeed by an action that a purpose of the action is to produce that effect
200	"Context: Alex: Shrimp farming results in damage to the environment, because investors make quick profits from such farming and then abandon the farms. Jolene: I disagree. Although some shrimp farms have proved unsustainable and have been quickly abandoned, properly built shrimp farms take a long time to construct and are costly to operate. Most owners try to make sure that their farms are productive for many years. 
 Question: Their dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Alex and Jolene disagree with each other over whether 
 (0) most owners ofshrirnp farms eventually abandon their farms (1) shrimp farming often yields a quick, easy profit (2) shrimp farming hardly ever damages the environment (3) abandonment of a shrimp farm results in damage to the environment (4) some shrimp farmers are environmentally irrespousible 
 Answer:"	(1) shrimp farming often yields a quick, easy profit
201	"Context: No one who works at Leila's Electronics has received both a poor performance evaluation and a raise. Lester has not received a raise, so it must be that he has received a poor performance evaluation. 
 Question: The flawed reasoning in the argument above is most similar to the reasoning in which one of the following arguments? 
 (0) No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it So, since my next-door neighbors pay rent on their house, it must be that they do not own it. (1) No one who lives in a house both owns it and pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors own their house. Therefore, it must be that they do not pay rent on it. (2) My neighbors have not paid any rent on their house. Since anyone who lives in a house but does not rent it owns it, it must be that they own it. (3) My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Since no one who lives in a house both O'WIlS it and pays rent on it, it must be that my next-door neighbors pay rent on their heuse. (4) Anyone who lives in a house but does not own it pays rent on it. My next-door neighbors do not own their house. Therefore, it must be that they pay rent on it.

202	"Context: Numerous studies have demonstrated a pronounced negative correlation between high-fther diets and the incidence of colon cancer. For example, the colon cancer rate in Western countries is much higher than in many non-Western countries where people eat more fther-rich foods, such as fruits aod vegetables. Furthermore, in Scandinavia it has been conclusively shown that the higher the colon cancer rate in a given area, the lower the consumption in that area of cereals, which, like fruits and vegetables, are high in fther. All of this shows that insufficient consumption of fther causes colon cancer, and sufficient consumption of fther prevents it. 
 Question: The argument's reasoning is vulnerable to criticism because the argument overlooks the possibility that 
 (0) the consumption of fther in many countries is rising appreciably (1) the risk of many types of cancer is reduced by high-fther diets (2) fther is difficult for many people to include in their diets (3) the fther in fruits and vegetables and the fther in cereals have cancer-fighting properties to different degrees (4) foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer 
 Answer:"	(4) foods containing fther also contain other substances that, when consumed, tend to prevent colon cancer
203	"Context: Anthropologist: many people think that if human language evolved, then something like it must be present in those species most closely related to humans, such as chimpanzees. They reason that since new traits evolve gradually, something like human language, albeit cruder, must exist in some species from which humans evolved. This general line of argument may be reasonable, but it simply does not follow that chimpanzees have anything like human language, because humans did not evolve from chimpanzees. While chimpanzees are indeed closely related to humans, this is because both evolved from a common ancestor. The evolution of human language might easily have begun after the extinction of that common ancestor. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the anthropologist's argument? 
 (0) Humans did not evolve from chimpanzees, but rather from some extinct species. (1) The assumption that something like human language must exist in some species from which humans evolved has no clearcut linguistic implications for chimpanzees. (2) The communicative systems of chimpanzees are cruder than human language. (3) Human language is a by-product of human intelligence, which chimpanzees lack. (4) The evolution of human language began after the disappearance of an extinct species from which both humans aod chimpanzees evolved. 
 Answer:"	(1) The assumption that something like human language must exist in some species from which humans evolved has no clearcut linguistic implications for chimpanzees.

Moreover, the reliability of research using animals is diminished if those animals are not in an environment that is normal for them. 
 Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the technician's statements? 
 (0) The conditions under which laboratory mice are kept are not likely to change in the near future. (1) If laboratory mice were kept under better conditions, it would be appropriate to use them for research aimed at improving human health. (2) Research using laboratory mice that is aimed at improving human health is compromised by the conditions under which the mice are kept. (3) Those who conduct research aimed at improving human health will develop new research techniques. (4) Laboratory mice that are used for research that is not directly related to human health are not usually kept in small cages. 
 Answer:"	(2) Research using laboratory mice that is aimed at improving human health is compromised by the conditions under which the mice are kept.
205	"Context: ""Dumping"" is defined as selling a product in another country for less than production cost. Shrimp producers from Country F are selling shrimp in Country G below the cost of producing shrimp in Country G. So Country F's producers are dumping shrimp. 
 Question: In order to evaluate the argument above, it is necessary to determine whether 
 (0) ""production cost"" in the definition of dumping refers to the cost of producing the product in the country where it originates or in the country where it is sold (1) there is agreement among experts about whether dumping is harmful to the economy of the country in which products are sold for less than production cost (2) shrimp producers from Country F charge more for shrimp that they sell within their own country than for shrimp that they sell in Country G (3) shrimp producers from Country F will eventually go out of business if they continue to sell shrimp in Country G for less than production cost (4) shrimp producers from Country F are selling shrimp in Country G for considerably less than production cost or just slightly less 
 Answer:"	"(0) ""production cost"" in the definition of dumping refers to the cost of producing the product in the country where it originates or in the country where it is sold"
206	"Context: Scientist: Venus contains a hot molten core, like that of Earth. Also like Earth, Venus must expel the excess heat the core generates. On Earth, this occurs entirely through active volcanos and fissures created when tectonic plates separate. Yet Venus has neither active volcanos nor fissures caused by the movement of tectonic plates. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, does the most to resolve the apparent discrepancy described by the scientist? 
 (0) Rock on the surface of Venus remains solid at much higher temperatures than does rock on Earth. (1) The surface of Venus is relatively thin, allowing internally produced heat to radiate into space. (2) The interior of Venus undergoes greater fluctuations in temperature than does that of Earth. (3) Though Venus lacks active volcanoes and heat-diffusing fissures, it has surface movement somewhat like that of Earth. (4) The atmosphere of Venus is significantly hotter than that of Earth. 
 Answer:"	(1) The surface of Venus is relatively thin, allowing internally produced heat to radiate into space.
207	"Context: Columnist: The managers of some companies routinely donate a certain percentage of their companies' profits each year to charity. Although this practice may seem totally justified and even admirable, it is not. After all, corporate profits are not the property of the managers, but of the companies' owners. The legendary Robin Hood may have stolen from the rich to give to the poor, but he was nevertheless stealing. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the analogy used in the argument? 
 (0) The profits that a company makes in a given year are, in part, returned to the owners of the company. (1) Managers who routinely donate a certain percentage of corporate profits to charity do so with the owners' tacit consent. (2) Company managers often donate part of their own income to charities or other philanthropic organizations. (3) Any charity that accepts corporate donations needs to be able to account for how that money is spent. (4) Charities often solicit contributions from companies as well as private individuals. 
 Answer:"	(1) Managers who routinely donate a certain percentage of corporate profits to charity do so with the owners' tacit consent.
208	"Context: Principle: A law whose purpose is to protect wild animal populations should not be enforced against those whose actions do not threaten wild animal populations. Application: Even though there is a law against capturing wild snakes, which was enacted to protect wild snake populations, snake charmers who violate this law should not be prosecuted. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most justifies the above application of the principle? 
 (0) Since there are relatively few snake charmers and they each capture relatively few snakes per year, snake charmers have a minimal effect on wild populations. (1) Many attempts to prosecute snake charmers under this law have failed because prosecutors lacked adequate knowledge of the procedures used to capture snakes. (2) Very few, if any, snake charmers are aware that there is a law that prohibits the capture of wild snakes. (3) Snake populations are much less threatened than the populations of several other species for which capture is legal. (4) Snake charmers capture wild snakes only because they believe they would be unable to earn a living otherwise. 
 Answer:"	(0) Since there are relatively few snake charmers and they each capture relatively few snakes per year, snake charmers have a minimal effect on wild populations.
209	"Context: A film makes a profit if the number of people who see it is sufficient to generate revenues from ticket sales greater than the amount spent to make it. Hence, the primary goal of movie executives is to maximize the number of people who see a film. However, it is not the primary goal of television executives to maximize the number of viewers for their shows. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the difference between the goals of movie executives and those of television executives? 
 (0) More people are willing to see a film more than once than are willing to watch a television show more than once. (1) There is no analog in television to the large profits that owners of movie theaters make by selling refreshments to their customers. (2) The average cost of producing an hour of film is much greater than the average cost of producing an hour of television. (3) Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show. (4) Over half of the most popular television shows are shows that viewers do not have to pay to watch. 
 Answer:"	(3) Television shows make their profits from sponsors, who are chiefly concerned with the purchasing power of the people who watch a television show.
210	"Context: Several companies that make herbal teas containing ginseng assert in their marketing that ginseng counteracts the effects of stress. As a result, many people buy these products hoping to improve their health. Yet no definitive scientific study links ginseng with the relief of stress. Thus, these marketing campaigns make false claims. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument 
 (0) rejects an argument because of its source without evaluating the argument's logical strength (1) concludes that a claim is false merely on the grounds that it has not been shown to be true (2) draws an inference on the basis of a sample that is likely to be unrepresentative (3) fails to address the possibility that many people buy herbal teas containing ginseng because they enjoy drinking the tea (4) fails to address the possibility that some ingredients other than ginseng in the herbal teas containing ginseng counteract the effects of stress 
 Answer:"	(1) concludes that a claim is false merely on the grounds that it has not been shown to be true
211	"Context: Scientists conjecture that certain microbes consume organic molecules in exposed shale and similar sediments. In so doing, the microbes remove oxygen from the atmosphere and generate carbon dioxide, a gas that, evidence indicates, promotes global warming. They also conjecture that these microbes reproduce more quickly at higher temperatures. 
 Question: The scientists' conjectures, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following statements? 
 (0) The microbes' activity will soon diminish as the organic molecules in exposed sediments are depleted. (1) Every organism that generates carbon dioxide reproduces more quickly at high temperatures. (2) If global warming occurs, it will be exacerbated by the activity of the microbes. (3) The microbes do not remove any element other than oxygen from the atmosphere. (4) A significant portion of the carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere was produced by the microbes. 
 Answer:"	(2) If global warming occurs, it will be exacerbated by the activity of the microbes.
212	"Context: A diet whose protein comes from fish is much healthier than one whose protein comes from red meat. Yet if everyone were to adopt this healthier diet, most of the marine species on which it is based would become extinct, making it impossible. Hence, we should not recommend the universal adoption of such a diet. 
 Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles that in the argument above? 
 (0) Some studies have provided evidence that taking a vitamin E supplement every day reduces one's risk of heart attack. However, it has not been conclusively established that vitamin E supplements are safe for all people. So we should not recommend that everyone take vitamin E supplements every day. (1) Governments are within their rights to tax tobacco heavily and spend this tax revenue on education. If these taxes become too high, however, people might smoke less, thereby reducing the funding thus generated for education. So such taxes might eventually have to be supplemented by other sources of revenue. (2) A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone. (3) If legislators spent less time campaigning, they would have more time to do the jobs for which they were elected. But if they did not spend so much time campaigning, they probably would not get reelected. So it is not surprising that legislators spend so much time campaigning. (4) If we restrict land development in wilderness areas, we help preserve many of the species that now inhabit these areas. But we also thereby reduce the proliferation of the admittedly smaller number of species, such as deer, that flourish in developed areas. So it is not always clear which areas should be designated as wilderness areas. 
 Answer:"	(2) A consumer is better off when limiting purchases to what he or she truly needs and saving or investing any remaining income. If everyone did this, however, the economy would be thrown into a severe recession, thereby making saving and investing impossible for most people. So we should not recommend this spending pattern to everyone.
213	"Context: People who are allergic to cats are actually allergic to certain proteins found in the animals' skin secretions and saliva; which particular proteins are responsible, however, varies from allergy sufferer to allergy sufferer. Since all cats shed skin and spread saliva around their environment, there is no such thing as a cat incapable of provoking allergic reactions, although it is common for a given cat to cause an allergic reaction in some-but not all-people who are allergic to cats. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) Any particular individual will be allergic to some breeds of cat but not to others. (1) No cat is capable of causing an allergic reaction in all types of allergy sufferers. (2) Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva. (3) The allergic reactions of some people who are allergic to cats are more intense than the allergic reactions of other allergy sufferers. (4) There is no way to predict whether a given cat will produce an allergic reaction in a particular allergy sufferer. 
 Answer:"	(2) Not all cats are identical with respect to the proteins contained in their skin secretions and saliva.
214	"Context: Cartographer: Maps are like language: they can be manipulated in order to mislead. That most people are not generally misled by words, however, should not lead us to think that most people are not susceptible to being misled by maps. Most people are taught to be cautious interpreters of language, but education in the sophisticated use of maps is almost nonexistent. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes how the statement that most people are taught to be cautious interpreters of language functions in the cartographer's argument? 
 (0) It is offered as an analogical case that helps to clarify the meaning of the argument's conclusion. (1) It is a conclusion drawn from the claim that education in the sophisticated use of maps is almost nonexistent. (2) It is part of a distinction drawn in order to support the argument's conclusion. (3) It is offered as support for the contention that maps have certain relevant similarities to language. (4) It is the conclusion drawn in the argument. 
 Answer:"	(2) It is part of a distinction drawn in order to support the argument's conclusion.
215	"Context: Journalist: A book claiming that a new drug has dangerous side effects has recently been criticized by a prominent physician. However, the physician is employed by the company that manufactures that drug, and hence probably has personal reasons to deny that the drug is dangerous. Therefore, the critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject the book's claims about the drug's side effects. 
 Question: The reasoning in the journalist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds? 
 (0) It fails to address adequately the possibility that the critique of the book called into question other claims made in the book in addition to the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects. (1) It takes for granted that anyone even remotely associated with a company that manufactures a drug is unable to fairly weigh evidence concerning possible dangerous side effects of that drug. (2) It overlooks the possibility that the author of the book was biased for personal reasons in favor of the claim that the drug has dangerous side effects. (3) It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim. (4) It overlooks the possibility that even if a critique does not provide legitimate grounds to reject a claim, this failure need not be the result of any personal biases of the author. 
 Answer:"	(3) It fails to address adequately the possibility that someone who has personal reasons to deny a claim may nonetheless provide legitimate grounds for denying that claim.
216	"Context: A computer game publisher has recently released its latest adventure game. The game's inventive puzzles and compelling plot induce even casual players to become preoccupied with completing it. The game can be purchased from retail outlets or rented for two-day intervals. The publisher offers a rebate equal to the cost of one rental for renters who go on to purchase the game, saving them a significant portion of the purchase price. Since the rate of sales now meets expectations and rentals are exceeding expectations, the publisher predicts that soon sales of the game will also exceed expectations. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the publisher's prediction? 
 (0) The game can be purchased directly from the publisher as well as from retailers. (1) It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game. (2) The publisher's games are among the most popular computer games on the market. (3) Most people who complete the game do not play it extensively afterward. (4) Some people buy and complete the game and then give it away to a friend. 
 Answer:"	(1) It takes several weeks for most players to complete the game.
217	"Context: City dog licensing records show that more cocker spaniels are registered to addresses in the Flynn Heights neighborhood than to addresses in all other neighborhoods combined. So if an animal control officer finds a stray cocker spaniel anywhere near Flynn Heights, it is likely that the dog belongs to someone in Flynn Heights. 
 Question: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument? 
 (0) whether cocker spaniels are more likely than dogs of other breeds to stray from their owners (1) whether there are more cocker spaniels registered to addresses in Flynn Heights than any other breed of dog (2) whether the city's animal control officers find more stray dogs in and around Flynn Heights than in any other part of the city (3) whether the number of pets owned, per capita, is greater for residents of Flynn Heights than for residents of any other neighborhood (4) whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are 
 Answer:"	(4) whether residents of Flynn Heights are more likely to license their dogs than residents of other neighborhoods are
218	"Context: Psychologists recently conducted a study in which people from widely disparate cultures were asked to examine five photographs. Each photograph depicted the face of a person expressing one of five basic human emotions- fear, happiness, disgust, anger, and sadness. The people in the study were asked to identify the emotion being expressed in each photograph. For each photograph, everyone identified the same emotion. This shows that people are genetically predisposed to associate certain facial expressions with certain basic emotions. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
 (0) For each photograph, the emotion that the subjects agreed was being expressed was the emotion that the person photographed was, in fact, feeling. (1) One's emotional disposition is not influenced by one's culture. (2) Some behaviors that are present in people from widely disparate cultures are nonetheless culturally influenced. (3) If there is a behavior common to people of widely disparate cultures, then there is probably a genetic predisposition to that behavior. (4) The people whose faces were depicted in the photographs were not all from the same culture. 
 Answer:"	(3) If there is a behavior common to people of widely disparate cultures, then there is probably a genetic predisposition to that behavior.
219	"Context: Judge: The defendant admits noncompliance with national building codes but asks that penalties not be imposed because he was confused as to whether national or local building codes applied to the area in which he was building. This excuse might be acceptable had he been charged with noncompliance with local codes, but since he is charged with noncompliance with national codes, his excuse is unacceptable. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the judge's reasoning? 
 (0) Local codes and national codes must not overlap with each other. (1) Local codes may be less strict, but not more strict, than national codes. (2) Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes. (3) Ignorance of the difference between two codes is not an adequate excuse for noncompliance. (4) A behavior that is in compliance with one law is not necessarily in compliance with another. 
 Answer:"	(2) Any behavior required by national codes is also required by local codes.
220	"Context: Brianna: It would have been better to buy a tree last summer rather than this summer. The one we bought this summer is struggling to survive this summer's drought. If we had bought one last summer, it would have been able to survive this summer's drought, because last summer's normal rainfall would have enabled it to develop established roots. Trees with established roots can better withstand droughts. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in Brianna's argument? 
 (0) It would have been better to buy a tree last summer rather than this summer. (1) The tree purchased this summer is struggling to survive this summer's drought. (2) If a tree had been purchased last summer, it would be better able to survive this summer's drought. (3) A tree purchased last summer would have established roots. (4) Trees with established roots can better withstand droughts. 
 Answer:"	(0) It would have been better to buy a tree last summer rather than this summer.
221	"Context: Every delegate to the convention is a party member. Some delegates to the convention are government officials, and each government official who is at the convention is a speaker at the convention, as well. 
 Question: If the statements above are true, then which one of the following statements must be true? 
 (0) Every party member at the convention is a delegate to the convention. (1) At least some speakers at the convention are neither delegates nor party members. (2) At least some speakers at the convention are delegates to the convention. (3) All speakers at the convention are government officials. (4) Every government official at the convention is a party member. 
 Answer:"	(2) At least some speakers at the convention are delegates to the convention.
222	"Context: Research into artificial intelligence will fail to produce truly intelligent machines unless the focus of the discipline is radically changed. Progress has been made in creating devices of tremendous computational sophistication, but the present focus on computational ability to the exclusion of other abilities will produce devices only as capable of displaying true intelligence as a human being would be who was completely devoid of emotional and other noncognitive responses. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion argued for above? 
 (0) The current focus of research into artificial intelligence will produce devices no more capable of displaying true intelligence than a person would be who lacked emotions and other noncognitive responses. (1) If the current focus of research into artificial intelligence is not radically changed, this research will not be able to produce machines capable of true intelligence. (2) Despite progress in creating machines of great computational sophistication, current research into artificial intelligence has failed to fulfill its objectives. (3) The capacity to express noncognitive responses such as emotion is at least as important for true intelligence as is computational sophistication. (4) If a machine is not capable of producing humanlike noncognitive responses, then it cannot be regarded as truly intelligent. 
 Answer:"	(1) If the current focus of research into artificial intelligence is not radically changed, this research will not be able to produce machines capable of true intelligence.
223	"Context: A study found that when rating the educational value of specific children's television shows parents tend to base their judgments primarily on how much they themselves enjoyed the shows, and rarely took into account the views of educational psychologists as to the shows' educational value. Accordingly, if the psychologists' views are sound, parents have little reason to trust their own ratings of the educational value of children's television shows. 
 Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) relies on a sample that is likely to be unrepresentative of the population with which the conclusion is concerned (1) takes for granted that parents do not enjoy the same sort of children's television shows that children themselves enjoy (2) takes for granted that the educational value of a television show should be the only consideration for a parent trying to decide whether a child should watch the show (3) fails to rule out the possibility that parents' ratings of the shows based on their own enjoyment coincide closely with the educational psychologists' views of the shows' educational values (4) takes for granted that educational psychologists are the only people who can judge the educational value of children's television shows with a high degree of accuracy 
 Answer:"	(3) fails to rule out the possibility that parents' ratings of the shows based on their own enjoyment coincide closely with the educational psychologists' views of the shows' educational values
224	"Context: Justine: Pellman, Inc. settled the lawsuit out of court by paying $1 million. That Pellman settled instead of going to trial indicates their corporate leaders expected to lose in court. Simon: It's unclear whether Pellman's leaders expected to lose in court. But I think they expected that, whether they won or lost the case, the legal fees involved in going to trial would have been more costly than the settlement. So settling the lawsuit seemed the most cost-effective solution. 
 Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Justine and Simon disagree with each other about which one of the following? 
 (0) If the lawsuit against Pellman had gone to trial, it is likely that Pellman would have lost in court. (1) Pellman's corporate leaders were able to accurately estimate their chances of winning in court. (2) If Pellman's legal fees for going to trial would have been more costly than the settlement, then settling the lawsuit was the most cost-effective solution for the corporation. (3) If Pellman's corporate leaders had expected that the legal fees for going to trial would have been less costly than the settlement, they would have taken the lawsuit to trial. (4) If Pellman's corporate leaders had expected to win in court, then they would not have settled the lawsuit out of court for $1 million. 
 Answer:"	(4) If Pellman's corporate leaders had expected to win in court, then they would not have settled the lawsuit out of court for $1 million.
225	"Context: Astrologer: Although some scientists have claimed that there is no correlation between people's astrological signs and their personality types, this claim is scientifically unjustified. Since science does not have precise criteria for distinguishing one personality type from another, scientific studies cannot be used to disprove a correlation between personality type and any other phenomenon. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the astrologer's argument by the statement that scientific studies cannot be used to disprove a correlation between personality type and any other phenomenon? 
 (0) It is a claim offered as support for a conclusion that is in turn offered as support for the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. (1) It is a conclusion for which support is offered and that in turn is offered as support for the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. (2) It is the overall conclusion drawn in the argument. (3) It summarizes a position that the argument as a whole is directed toward discrediting. (4) It provides a specific instance of the general principle that the argument as a whole is directed toward establishing. 
 Answer:"	(1) It is a conclusion for which support is offered and that in turn is offered as support for the overall conclusion drawn in the argument.
226	"Context: Ethicist: Only when we know a lot about the events that led to an action are we justified in praising or blaming a person for that action—as we sometimes are. We must therefore reject Tolstoy's rash claim that if we knew a lot about the events leading up to any action, we would cease to regard that action as freely performed. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, enables the conclusion of the ethicist's argument to be properly drawn? 
 (0) People should not be regarded as subject to praise or blame for actions that were caused by conditions beyond their control. (1) Whether an act is one for which the person doing it is genuinely responsible is not determined by how much information others possess about that act. (2) We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed. (3) The responsibility a person bears for an action is not a matter of degree; however, our inclination to blame or praise whoever performed the action varies with the amount of information available. (4) If we do not know much about the events leading up to any given action, we will regard that action as freely performed. 
 Answer:"	(2) We can be justified in praising or blaming a person for an action only when we regard that action as freely performed.
227	"Context: Studies have found that human tears contain many of the same hormones that the human body produces in times of emotional stress. Hence, shedding tears removes significant quantities of these hormones from the body. Therefore, crying must have the effect of reducing emotional stress. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) overlooks the possibility that if crying has a tendency to reduce emotional stress, this tendency might arise because of something other than the shedding of tears (1) confuses a condition that is required for the production of a given phenomenon with a condition that in itself would be sufficient to cause the production of that phenomenon (2) fails to adequately address the possibility that, even if one phenomenon causally contributes to a second phenomenon, the second phenomenon may causally influence the first as well (3) fails to adequately distinguish between two distinct factors that are jointly responsible for causing a given phenomenon (4) takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition 
 Answer:"	(4) takes for granted that because certain substances are present whenever a condition occurs, those substances are a cause of that condition
228	"Context: If squirrels eat from a bird feeder, it will not attract many birds. However, squirrels eat from a bird feeder only if it lacks a protective cover. So a bird feeder will not attract many birds if it does not have a protective cover. 
 Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments? 
 (0) If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely, and if a tire wears out prematurely, a likely cause is that the pressure was too low. So if a car owner checks the tire pressure regularly, the tires will not wear out prematurely. (1) If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. (2) Tires wear out prematurely if car owners neglect to check the tire pressure regularly. Unless car owners are unaware of this fact, they check the tire pressure regularly. So car owners need to be made aware of the consequences of neglecting to check the tire pressure. (3) If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. Therefore, if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly, a tire will wear out prematurely. (4) If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But it will also wear out prematurely if it is often driven on gravel roads. Therefore, if a tire is often driven on gravel roads, keeping its pressure from becoming too low will not help it to last longer. 
 Answer:"	(1) If a tire's pressure is too low, the tire will wear out prematurely. But tire pressure will become too low only if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly. So a tire will wear out prematurely if the car owner neglects to check the pressure regularly.
229	"Context: Sarah: When commercial fishing boats with permits to fish for certain species accidentally catch a type of fish for which they have no permit, the latter must be thrown back. This is a very wasteful practice because many, if not most, of the rejected fish do not survive. Fishing permits should therefore be altered so that fishers can keep fish caught accidentally. Amar: Making it legal to keep those fish would probably lead to a lot more ""accidents."" 
 Question: The technique Amar uses in responding to Sarah's argument is to 
 (0) question whether Sarah's recommendation can be put into practice (1) point out that Sarah used a crucial term in two distinct senses (2) allude to a factor that supposedly strengthens the case for Sarah's recommendation (3) contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence (4) maintain that Sarah overlooks important lessons from past policies 
 Answer:"	(3) contend that Sarah's recommendation has an important negative consequence
230	"Context: Curator: Critics have rightly claimed that removing the centuries-old grime from the frescoes of Michelangelo will expose them to acids formed by the combination of water vapor in human breath with pollutants in the air. Notwithstanding this fact, the restoration should continue, for the frescoes in their present condition cannot be seen as they appeared when painted by Michelangelo. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the curator's reasoning? 
 (0) The decision as to whether an artwork merits restoration or not should depend on its greatness as judged by aesthetic standards alone. (1) An artwork possesses aesthetic value only if there are people who observe and appreciate it. (2) It is acceptable to risk future damage to an artwork if the purpose is to enable it to be appreciated in its original form. (3) It is right to spend large amounts of money on the restoration of an old artwork if this restoration makes the artwork accessible to large numbers of people. (4) A picture that has become encrusted with grime over a long period can no longer be regarded as the same work of art as that painted by the artist. 
 Answer:"	(2) It is acceptable to risk future damage to an artwork if the purpose is to enable it to be appreciated in its original form.
231	"Context: Forest fragmentation occurs when development severs a continuous area of forest, breaking it down into small patches. Some animals, such as white-footed mice, thrive in conditions of forest fragmentation, reaching their highest population densities in small forest patches. These mice are the main carrier of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, a debilitating illness that is often transmitted from white-footed mice to humans by deer ticks. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) White-footed mice are very rarely found in unfragmented forests. (1) The population density for most species of small animals increases when a continuous area of forest becomes fragmented. (2) Forest fragmentation reduces the number and variety of animal species that an area can support. (3) Efforts to stop the fragmentation of forests can have a beneficial effect on human health. (4) Deer ticks reach their highest population densities in small forest patches 
 Answer:"	(3) Efforts to stop the fragmentation of forests can have a beneficial effect on human health.
232	"Context: Statistics reveal that more collisions between bicycles and motor vehicles occur on roads having specifically designated bicycle lanes than on roads having no such lanes. Hence, adding such lanes to existing roads is unlikely to enhance the safety of bicyclists. 
 Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) overlooks the possibility that injuries sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads with bicycle lanes are as serious, on average, as those sustained by bicyclists in accidents on roads without such lanes (1) fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes (2) takes for granted that any road alteration that enhances the safety of bicyclists also enhances the safety of motorists (3) concludes that adding bicycle lanes to roads will fail to enhance the safety of bicyclists on the grounds that only some roads that currently have such lanes are safe (4) takes statistical evidence that fails to support a conclusion concerning the safety of bicyclists as evidence that proves the opposite conclusion 
 Answer:"	(1) fails to address the possibility that there are more bicyclists riding on roads with bicycle lanes than there are riding on roads without such lanes
233	"Context: Over the last few decades, public outcries against pollution have brought about stricter regulations of emissions. The cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago now have greatly improved air quality. This would not have happened without these stricter regulations. 
 Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above? 
 (0) In the city with the worst air pollution today, the air quality is better than it was 30 years ago. (1) No city has worse air pollution today than it did 30 years ago. (2) Most of the public outcries against pollution came from people in the cities that had the most polluted air. (3) The most polluted cities today are not the cities that were the most polluted 30 years ago. (4) Public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago. 
 Answer:"	(4) Public criticism led to an improvement in the air quality of the cities that had the most polluted air 30 years ago.
234	"Context: Editorialist: Many professional musicians claim that unauthorized music-sharing services, which allow listeners to obtain music for free, rob musicians of royalties. While it is true that musicians are deprived of royalties they deserve, music-sharing services are not to blame since record companies, publishers, managers, and other intermediaries take an inequitably large cut of the revenues from music sales. 
 Question: The reasoning in the editorialist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) concludes that one party is not blameworthy merely because another party is blameworthy (1) attempts to promote a particular behavior simply by showing that many people engage in that behavior (2) attacks a position based solely on the character of the people who hold that position (3) tries to show that a position is false simply by pointing out an undesirable consequence of holding that position (4) treats a necessary condition for blameworthiness as though it were a sufficient condition for blameworthiness 
 Answer:"	(0) concludes that one party is not blameworthy merely because another party is blameworthy
235	"Context: Medical columnist: Some doctors recommend taking vitamin C to help maintain overall health because vitamin C is an antioxidant, a substance that protects the body from certain types of oxygen particles that can trigger disease. People suffering from various ailments are encouraged to take vitamin C to guard against developing other health problems. However, doctors are now discouraging some cancer patients from taking vitamin C, even when they are undergoing therapies with side effects that are detrimental to their overall health. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why the doctors' recommendation to some cancer patients differs from the general recommendation regarding vitamin C? 
 (0) Some kinds of cancer cells absorb large amounts of vitamin C, which interferes with the oxidation mechanism by which many cancer therapies kill cancer cells. (1) Vitamin C has not been shown to reduce people's risk of developing cancer, even at the very high dosage levels recommended by some doctors. (2) Cancer cells that are susceptible to certain types of cancer therapies are not likely to be affected by the presence of vitamin C. (3) The better the overall health of cancer patients while undergoing therapy, the more likely they are to experience a full recovery. (4) Certain side effects of cancer therapies that are detrimental to patients' overall health are not affected by vitamin C. 
 Answer:"	(0) Some kinds of cancer cells absorb large amounts of vitamin C, which interferes with the oxidation mechanism by which many cancer therapies kill cancer cells.
236	"Context: Researcher: Accurate readings of air pollution are expensive to obtain. Lichens are complex plantlike organisms that absorb airborne pollutants and so may offer a cheaper way to monitor air quality. To investigate this, I harvested lichens at sites plagued by airborne copper pollution, determined the lichens' copper concentration, and compared the results with those acquired using mechanical monitoring devices. The lichens were as accurate as the best equipment available. Thus, lichens can effectively replace expensive pollution-monitoring devices without loss of information. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the researcher's argument? 
 (0) Mechanical monitoring devices have not already been installed in areas where air pollution is a serious problem. (1) Copper particles are a component of air pollution in several locales. (2) Experiments have shown that lichens thrive in areas where air pollution is minimal. (3) Lichens can easily be grown in laboratories. (4) Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper. 
 Answer:"	(4) Lichens absorb all other significant air pollutants in a manner similar to their absorption of copper.
237	"Context: Some claim that migratory birds have an innate homing sense that allows them to return to the same areas year after year. However, there is little evidence to support this belief, since the studies testing whether the accuracy of birds' migratory patterns is due to such an innate ability are inconclusive. After all, birds may simply navigate using landmarks, just as humans do, and we do not say that humans have an innate sense of direction simply because they find their way home time after time. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument? 
 (0) Neither migratory birds nor humans have an innate homing sense. (1) There is as yet little reason to accept that birds have an innate homing sense. (2) Studies testing whether the accuracy of birds' migratory patterns is due to an innate homing sense are inconclusive. (3) The ability to use landmarks to find one's way home is probably not an innate ability in birds. (4) It is as false to claim that humans have an innate sense of direction as it is to claim that birds have an innate homing sense. 
 Answer:"	(1) There is as yet little reason to accept that birds have an innate homing sense.
238	"Context: All laundry detergents contain surfactants, which can harm aquatic life. However, the environmental effects of most ingredients in laundry detergents, including most of those in so-called ""ecologically friendly"" detergents, are unknown. Therefore, there is no reason to suppose that laundry detergents advertised as ecologically friendly are less damaging to the environment than other laundry detergents are. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument? 
 (0) Laundry detergents that are advertised as ecologically friendly contain much lower amounts of surfactants, on average, than do other laundry detergents. (1) There is no reason to suppose that most of the ingredients in laundry detergents not advertised as ecologically friendly harm the environment significantly. (2) Different kinds of laundry detergents contain different kinds of surfactants, which differ in the degree to which they could potentially harm aquatic life. (3) There is reason to suppose that ingredients in laundry detergents other than surfactants harm the environment more than surfactants do. (4) Laundry detergents advertised as environmentally friendly are typically less effective than other detergents, so that larger amounts must be used. 
 Answer:"	(0) Laundry detergents that are advertised as ecologically friendly contain much lower amounts of surfactants, on average, than do other laundry detergents.
239	"Context: Fishery officials are still considering options for eliminating Lake Davis's population of razor-toothed northern pike, a fierce game fish that could threaten salmon and trout populations if it slips into the adjoining river system. Introducing pike-specific diseases and draining the lake have been ruled out. Four years ago, poison was added to the lake in order to eliminate the pike. This outraged local residents, because the water remained tainted for months and the region's tourism economy suffered. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) Draining the lake would not cause the region's tourism economy to suffer. (1) Four years ago was the only time that poison was used against the pike in the lake. (2) The poison added to the lake four years ago was not successful in ridding the lake of the pike. (3) Four years ago, fishery officials did not consider any options other than using poison. (4) Salmon and trout populations in the Lake Davis area are essential to the region's economy. 
 Answer:"	(2) The poison added to the lake four years ago was not successful in ridding the lake of the pike.
240	"Context: Counselor: Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable, but that assumption is just not so. Personal conflicts arise primarily because people are being irrational. For instance, people often find it easier to ascribe bad qualities to a person than good ones-even when there is more evidence of the latter. If someone suspects that a friend is unreliable, for example, a single instance may turn this suspicion into a feeling of certainty, whereas a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion drawn in the argument? 
 (0) Many people assume that personal conflicts are inevitable. (1) Even when there is more evidence of good qualities than of bad ones, people find it easier to ascribe bad qualities than good ones. (2) It is irrational to allow a single instance to turn one's suspicion that a friend is unreliable into a feeling of certainty. (3) Personal conflicts are not inevitable. (4) Unlike a suspicion that a friend is unreliable, a belief that someone is reliable is normally built up only after many years of personal interaction. 
 Answer:"	(3) Personal conflicts are not inevitable.
241	"Context: Dried parsley should never be used in cooking, for it is far less tasty and healthful than fresh parsley is. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most clearly helps to justify the argument above? 
 (0) Fresh ingredients should be used in cooking whenever possible. (1) Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking. (2) Ingredients that should never be used in cooking are generally neither tasty nor healthful. (3) Parsley that is not both tasty and healthful should never be used in cooking. (4) In cooking, dried ingredients are inferior to fresh ingredients. 
 Answer:"	(1) Only the tastiest ingredients should ever be used in cooking.
242	"Context: The size of northern fur seals provides a reliable indication of their population levels—the smaller the average body size of seals in a population, the larger the population. Archaeologists studied seal fossils covering an 800-year period when the seals were hunted for food by Native peoples in North America and found that the average body size of the seals did not vary significantly. 
 Question: The statements above, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following? 
 (0) During the 800-year period studied, seal hunting practices did not vary substantially between different groups of Native peoples in North America. (1) The body size of northern fur seals is not strongly correlated with the overall health of the seals. (2) Before the 800-year period studied, the average body size of northern fur seals fluctuated dramatically. (3) Native peoples in North America made an effort to limit their hunting of northern fur seals in order to prevent depletion of seal populations. (4) Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied. 
 Answer:"	(4) Hunting by Native peoples in North America did not significantly reduce the northern fur seal population over the 800-year period studied.
243	"Context: Mayor: Our city faces a difficult environmental problem caused by the enormous amount of garbage that we must dispose of. Although new recycling projects could greatly reduce this amount, these projects would actually be counterproductive to the goal of minimizing the overall amount of environmental damage. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent inconsistency in the mayor's claims about new recycling projects? 
 (0) The vehicles that pick up materials for recycling create less pollution than would be caused by incinerating those materials. (1) The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken. (2) The mayor's city has nearly exhausted its landfill space and therefore must incinerate much of its garbage. (3) More recycling would give industries in the mayor's city a greater incentive to use recycled materials in their manufacturing processes. (4) People who recycle feel less justified in consuming more than they need than do people who do not recycle. 
 Answer:"	(1) The great costs of new recycling projects would prevent other pollution-reducing projects from being undertaken.
244	"Context: Anyone who knows Ellsworth knows that he is bursting with self-righteousness, touting the idealism of his generation over the greed of the previous generation. So no one who knows him will be surprised that Ellsworth is offended by the suggestions in the media that he has engaged in unethical business practices. 
 Question: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Everyone suspects self-righteous people of being, in actuality, unethical. (1) Ellsworth has been accused of unethical business practices before. (2) Hypocrites often hide behind righteous indignation. (3) Ellsworth is in fact innocent of all wrongdoing. (4) Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended. 
 Answer:"	(4) Everyone expects self-righteous people to be easily offended.
245	"Context: Political scientist: People become unenthusiastic about voting if they believe that important problems can be addressed only by large numbers of people drastically changing their attitudes and that such attitudinal changes generally do not result from government action. The decreasing voter turnout is thus entirely due to a growing conviction that politicians cannot solve the most important problems. 
 Question: The reasoning in the political scientist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action (1) presumes, without providing justification, that there are no political solutions to the most important problems (2) infers that important problems can be seriously addressed if people's attitudes do change from the premise that these problems cannot be addressed if people's attitudes do not change (3) undermines its claim that people no longer believe there are political solutions to important problems by suggesting that people are dissatisfied with politicians (4) presumes, without providing justification, that voter apathy prevents the attitudinal changes that result in finding solutions to important problems 
 Answer:"	(0) presumes, without providing justification, that there is no cause of decreasing voter turnout other than the belief that few important problems can be solved by government action
246	"Context: The conventional view is that asteroids strike the earth at random locations, thereby randomly affecting various aspects of the earth's evolution. One iconoclastic geophysicist claims instead that asteroids have struck the earth through a highly organized natural process. Cited as evidence is the unusual pattern of impact craters that form a halo-like swath across the Northern Hemisphere. There is a consensus that these craters appeared at the end of the Cretaceous period, followed by a mass extinction of much land and ocean life. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to support the iconoclastic geophysicist's claim? 
 (0) Several asteroid strikes within a short period could produce both volcanic activity that warms the oceans and atmospheric debris that blocks sunlight, and such changes could cause mass extinctions. (1) If asteroids repeatedly pummel the same spots, the beating may affect the flow of molten rock inside the earth, which would affect the degree to which continents drift around the earth's surface. (2) The impact craters that form a halo-like swath across the Northern Hemisphere were the result of a single cluster of meteors striking the earth. (3) Lumpy masses within the earth cause gravitational interactions with approaching asteroids that force them into specific orbits before impact. (4) No similar pattern of impact craters was created during any other period of the earth's history. 
 Answer:"	(3) Lumpy masses within the earth cause gravitational interactions with approaching asteroids that force them into specific orbits before impact.
247	"Context: The chairperson of Acme Corporation has decided to move the company from its current location in Milltown to Ocean View. Most Acme employees cannot afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Ocean View. So once the company has moved, most Acme employees will have a commute of more than 30 minutes. 
 Question: The argument requires assuming which one of the following? 
 (0) All Acme employees can afford housing within a 30-minute commute of Milltown. (1) The chairperson of Acme has good financial reasons for wanting to move the company to Ocean View. (2) None of Acme's employees except the chairperson are in favor of moving the company to Ocean View. (3) Currently, most Acme employees have a commute of less than 30 minutes. (4) Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees. 
 Answer:"	(4) Acme's move to Ocean View will not be accompanied by a significant pay raise for Acme employees.
248	"Context: Editorial: Painting involves a sequential application of layers, each of which adheres satisfactorily only if the underlying layer has been properly applied. Education is, in this respect, like the craft of painting. Since the most important steps in painting are preparation of the surface to be painted and application of the primer coat, it makes sense to suppose that . 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the editorial's argument? 
 (0) in the educator's initial contact with a student, the educator should be as undemanding as possible (1) students who have a secure grasp of the fundamentals of a subject are likely to make progress in that subject (2) educators who are not achieving the goals they intended should revise their teaching methods (3) teaching new students is rewarding but much more difficult than teaching more advanced students (4) the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience 
 Answer:"	(4) the success of a student's overall educational experience depends above all upon that student's initial educational experience
249	"Context: Scientist: Given the human tendency to explore and colonize new areas, some people believe that the galaxy will eventually be colonized by trillions of humans. If so, the vast majority of humans ever to live would be alive during this period of colonization. Since all of us are humans and we have no reason to think we are unrepresentative, the odds are overwhelming that we would be alive during this period, too. But, because we are not alive during this period, the odds are slim that such colonization will ever happen. 
 Question: The scientist's argument proceeds by 
 (0) reasoning that because an event has not occurred, that event has a low probability of occurring (1) drawing a conclusion that implicitly contradicts one of the premises that the argument accepts (2) taking for granted that dependable predictions about the future cannot ever be made simply on the basis of the present facts (3) inferring that since an event that is taken to be likely on a given hypothesis has not occurred, the hypothesis is probably false (4) making a prediction far into the future based on established human tendencies 
 Answer:"	(3) inferring that since an event that is taken to be likely on a given hypothesis has not occurred, the hypothesis is probably false
250	"Context: Professor Riley characterized the university president's speech as inflammatory and argued that it was therefore inappropriate. However, Riley has had a long-standing feud with the president, and so we should not conclude that her speech was inflammatory solely on the basis of Riley's testimony. Therefore, unless there are independent reasons to deem the president's speech inflammatory, it is not true that her speech was inappropriate. 
 Question: The argument is flawed in that it 
 (0) takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory (1) fails to adequately address the possibility that inflammatory speeches may be appropriate for some audiences (2) favors the university president's side in a dispute simply because of the president's privileged standing (3) concludes that Riley's claim is false merely on the grounds that Riley has something to gain if the claim is accepted as true (4) fails to adequately address the possibility that Riley's animosity toward the university president is well founded 
 Answer:"	(0) takes for granted that the speech could not be inappropriate if it was not inflammatory
251	"Context: Radio producer: Our failure to attract new listeners over the past several years has forced us to choose between devoting some airtime to other, more popular genres of music, and sticking with classical music that appeals only to our small but loyal audience. This audience, however loyal, did not generate enough advertising revenue for us to pay our bills, so if we appeal to them alone, our station risks going out of business. We should not take that risk. We should, therefore, devote some airtime to other, more popular genres of music. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to that used by the radio producer? 
 (0) We should either buy blinds for the windows or make full-length curtains. Blinds would be very expensive to purchase. Thus, if cost is our greatest concern, we should make curtains. (1) We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains. (2) For the living room windows, we can make curtains or valances or both. We want to have privacy; and while curtains provide privacy, valances do not. So we should make curtains but not valances. (3) Since we have very little fabric, we will have to either buy more, or make valances instead of curtains. However, if we use this fabric to make valances, then we will have to buy blinds. Since it would be hard to buy fabric that matches what we already have, we should buy blinds. (4) We should either buy blinds or make curtains for the windows. If we buy blinds but do not make valances, the windows will look bare. We should not have bare windows. So if we do not make the curtains, we should make the valances. 
 Answer:"	(1) We should either make curtains for the windows or buy blinds. Since the windows are not standard sizes, if we buy blinds we will have to special order them. Since we do not have time to wait for special orders, we should make the curtains.
252	"Context: Art historian: This painting, purportedly by Mary Cassatt, is a forgery. Although the canvas and other materials are consistent with most of Cassatt's work, and the subject matter is similar to that of Cassatt's finest paintings, the brush style of this painting is not found in any work known to be Cassatt's. Hence this painting is definitely not a genuine Cassatt. 
 Question: The art historian's argument depends on assuming which one of the following? 
 (0) The type of canvas and other materials that Cassatt used in most of her work were readily available to others. (1) None of Cassatt's works is painted using a brush style that is not exhibited in any of her known works. (2) Cassatt's work generally had a characteristic subject matter that distinguished it from the work of other painters of her era. (3) The most characteristic feature of Cassatt's work is her brush style. (4) No painter other than Cassatt would be able to match Cassatt's brush style perfectly. 
 Answer:"	(1) None of Cassatt's works is painted using a brush style that is not exhibited in any of her known works.
253	"Context: In the Riverview Building, every apartment that has a balcony also has a fireplace. None of the apartments with balconies is a one-bedroom apartment. So none of the one-bedroom apartments has a fireplace. 
 Question: The flawed nature of the argument above can most effectively be demonstrated by noting that, by parallel reasoning, we could conclude that 
 (0) every fish has fur since no cat lacks fur and no cat is a fish (1) some cats lack fur since every dog has fur and no cat is a dog (2) no dog has fur since every cat has fur and no cat is a dog (3) every cat is a fish since no cat is a dog and no dog is a fish (4) no fish is a dog since every dog is a mammal and no fish is a mammal 
 Answer:"	(2) no dog has fur since every cat has fur and no cat is a dog
254	"Context: Alissa: If, as the mayor says, the city can no longer continue to fund both the children's museum and local children's television programming, then it should cease funding the television programming. The interactive character of the exhibits at the museum makes for a richer educational experience than watching television, which is largely passive. Greta: We should stop funding the museum, not the television programming, because, as the mayor has also pointed out, the museum reaches a much smaller audience. 
 Question: On the basis of their statements, it can be inferred that Alissa and Greta disagree on which one of the following? 
 (0) whether the city will need to cease funding local children's television programming if it continues funding the children's museum (1) whether the mayor has spoken truthfully about what will need to happen if the city does not cease funding local children's television programming (2) whether the city should cease funding local children's television programming if continuing to fund it would mean that the city would have to cease funding the children's museum (3) whether local children's television programming provides a beneficial educational experience to a greater number of children in the city than does the children's museum (4) whether the children's museum provides a rich educational experience for those children who visit it 
 Answer:"	(2) whether the city should cease funding local children's television programming if continuing to fund it would mean that the city would have to cease funding the children's museum
255	"Context: The television star Markus Hermann refuses to grant interviews with newspapers unless he is given the right to approve the article before publication. The Greburg Messenger newspaper refuses to do anything that its editors believe will compromise their editorial integrity. So the Messenger will not interview Hermann, since 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument is properly drawn if which one of the following completes the passage? 
 (0) the editors of the Messenger believe that giving an interviewee the right to approve an article before publication would compromise their editorial integrity (1) the Messenger has never before given an interviewee the right to approve an article before publication (2) most television stars are willing to grant interviews with the Messenger even if they are not given the right to approve the articles before publication (3) Hermann usually requests substantial changes to interview articles before approving them (4) Hermann believes that the Messenger frequently edits interviews in ways that result in unflattering portrayals of the interviewees 
 Answer:"	(0) the editors of the Messenger believe that giving an interviewee the right to approve an article before publication would compromise their editorial integrity
256	"Context: Columnist: An information design expert has argued that using the popular presentation-graphics software GIAPS, with its autopresentation wizard and simplistic premade templates, leads people to develop ineffective presentations. But that is absurd. GIAPS is just a tool, so it cannot be responsible for bad presentations. The responsibility must lie with those who use the tool poorly. 
 Question: The columnist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) bases its conclusion on claims that are inconsistent with each other (1) takes for granted that any presentation that is not ineffective is a good presentation (2) bases an endorsement of a product entirely on that product's popularity (3) fails to consider that a tool might not effectively perform its intended function (4) rejects a claim because of its source rather than its content 
 Answer:"	(3) fails to consider that a tool might not effectively perform its intended function
257	"Context: Editorial: The legislature is considering allowing oil drilling in the Cape Simmons Nature Preserve. Supporters claim that, because modern drilling methods will be used, there will be no damage to the environment. However, that claim is easily disproven by looking at nearby Alphin Bay, where oil drilling began five years ago. The land there is marred by industrial sprawl, drilling platforms, and thousands of miles of roads and pipelines. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument in the editorial? 
 (0) The Cape Simmons Nature Preserve is one of the few areas of pristine wilderness in the region. (1) The companies drilling for oil at Alphin Bay never claimed that drilling there would not cause any environmental damage. (2) The editorialist believes that oil drilling should not be allowed in a nature preserve unless it would cause no environmental damage. (3) There have been no significant changes in oil drilling methods in the last five years. (4) Oil drilling is only one of several industrial activities that takes place at Alphin Bay. 
 Answer:"	(3) There have been no significant changes in oil drilling methods in the last five years.
258	"Context: James: Community colleges, by their very nature, work to meet the educational needs of the communities they are in. The same is not true of universities, whose primary goals differ from those of community colleges. Margaret: A primary goal of any university is to serve the needs of the community where it is located. The main reason people have for attending a university is the same as that for attending a community college: preparing oneself for a career. 
 Question: James's and Margaret's statements provide the most support for the claim that they disagree over the truth of which one of the following? 
 (0) A primary goal of any university is to serve the educational needs of its community. (1) Most universities adequately serve the educational needs of the communities in which they are located. (2) The main reason people have for attending a university is to prepare themselves for a career. (3) In a typical community, the primary educational need is to prepare community residents for careers. (4) The main reason people have for attending a university is the same as the main reason people have for attending a community college. 
 Answer:"	(0) A primary goal of any university is to serve the educational needs of its community.
259	"Context: Most people who have taken a seminar for building organizational skills in the workplace have indeed become more organized as a result; however, despite having become more organized, few have become any more efficient. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above? 
 (0) Some of the people who are most efficient in the workplace are not among the most organized. (1) Most people whose organizational skills in the workplace are below average do not take seminars for building organizational skills in the workplace. (2) Most seminars for building organizational skills in the workplace are designed for people who have been selected for management training. (3) Most people who have taken a seminar for building organizational skills in the workplace have below-average organizational skills before they enroll in the seminar. (4) Most people who have taken a seminar for building organizational skills in the workplace consequently expend a great amount of time organizing their activities. 
 Answer:"	(4) Most people who have taken a seminar for building organizational skills in the workplace consequently expend a great amount of time organizing their activities.
260	"Context: Problem: The Thimble Corporation recently distributed rebate coupons for one of its products. Some of the coupons bore an expiration date that was too early. This created an unfair situation in which some customers believed, incorrectly, that the rebate offer had already expired. Principle: Anyone who creates an unfair situation has an obligation to rectify any unfair result of that situation. 
 Question: The principle, if valid, most helps to justify which one of the following judgments concerning the problem? 
 (0) If a customer believed that the expiration date had passed but applied for the rebate anyway, the Thimble Corporation is not obligated to give a rebate to that customer. (1) Because some customers who knew that they were eligible for the rebate chose not to apply for it, the Thimble Corporation is not solely responsible for creating the unfair situation. (2) If there is a chance that any customers did not apply for the rebate because of an incorrect expiration date on their rebate coupon, the Thimble Corporation is obligated to try to identify them and offer them the rebate. (3) Because it cannot identify all of the customers who were adversely affected by the incorrect expiration date, the Thimble Corporation should deny the rebate to all of the customers who applied for it. (4) If a customer did not rely on an incorrect expiration date when applying for the rebate but was denied the rebate for any other reason, the Thimble Corporation is not obligated to offer that customer the rebate. 
 Answer:"	(2) If there is a chance that any customers did not apply for the rebate because of an incorrect expiration date on their rebate coupon, the Thimble Corporation is obligated to try to identify them and offer them the rebate.
261	"Context: Critic: The recent biography of Shakespeare does not explain what is of most interest about him. It is by an expert on the history of Elizabethan England, and so does a good job of showing what life would have been like for Shakespeare as a man of that time. But it does not explain what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) There is no way to know what made Shakespeare different from his contemporaries. (1) The life of the average man in Elizabethan England is uninteresting. (2) Shakespeare was very different from the other men of his time. (3) A biography should always focus on what makes its subject distinctive. (4) What is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries. 
 Answer:"	(4) What is most interesting about Shakespeare is what made him different from his contemporaries.
262	"Context: The result of attempting to whip cream in a blender is a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. This is because a blender's container does not let in enough air to whip cream effectively. Although using a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can help somewhat, it cannot fully compensate for the container's poor air intake. 
 Question: If all of the statements above are true, which one of the following must be true? 
 (0) Cream that has been whipped ineffectively generally becomes a thick, velvety substance rather than fluffy whipped cream. (1) The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively. (2) When attempting to whip cream in a blender, using a special whipping-cream attachment always produces a fluffier result than could be obtained without using such an attachment. (3) The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender can reduce the total amount of air required to whip cream effectively in that blender. (4) The use of a blender, with or without any special attachments, is not the most common way to attempt to produce whipped cream. 
 Answer:"	(1) The use of a special whipping-cream attachment in a blender does not suffice to whip cream completely effectively.
263	"Context: Astronomer: Proponents of the hypothesis that life evolved extraterrestrially and drifted here in spores point out that, 3.8 billion years ago, Earth was bombarded by meteorites that would have destroyed any life already here. Yet 3.5 billion years ago, Earth had life forms complex enough to leave fossil remains. Such life could not have evolved here in the 0.3 billion years following the meteorite bombardments, they claim. There is good reason to regard their hypothesis as false, however, for they merely offer empirical arguments against the view that life evolved on Earth; neither they nor anyone else has provided positive support for the extraterrestrial-spore theory of the origin of terrestrial life. 
 Question: The reasoning in the astronomer's argument is flawed because the argument 
 (0) concludes, simply because there is no evidence in favor of a hypothesis, that there is evidence against that hypothesis (1) fails to justify its claim that the view being criticized is inherently implausible (2) reasons that a hypothesis is false simply because there is another hypothesis that is equally likely to be true (3) attempts to derive a conclusion from premises that contradict it (4) grants the truth of claims that are made by the advocates of the hypothesis but that do nothing to 
 Answer:"	(0) concludes, simply because there is no evidence in favor of a hypothesis, that there is evidence against that hypothesis
264	"Context: Advertisement: VIWY, a video-based foreign language course for children, was introduced seventeen years ago. Amy, Matt, and Evelyn were among the first children to use VIVVY. Now they are successful university students. So if your child uses VIVVY, you can expect him or her to become a successful university student. 
 Question: Which one of the following demonstrates most effectively by parallel reasoning that the argument in the advertisement is flawed? 
 (0) Similarly, you could conclude that you can expect to win the lottery if you carry a good-luck charm. After all, Annie, Francisco, and Sean carry good-luck charms, and these three people are lottery winners. (1) Similarly, you could conclude that Jesse should not expect to get food poisoning. After all, Jesse, Doris, and Christine all attended the company picnic, and only Christine has gotten food poisoning as a result. (2) Similarly, you could conclude that Eric, Diane, and Martin are the only employees who will be laid off. After all, any employee hired within the last year can expect to be laid off, and these three employees are the only ones who were hired within the last year. (3) Similarly, you could conclude that Ken, Norma, and Mary routinely drive faster than the speed limit. After all, if you routinely exceed the speed limit, you can expect to get a speeding ticket eventually, and these three people have gotten speeding tickets. (4) Similarly, you could conclude that Jack, Stephen, and Tina can expect to get jobs after they complete their university education. After all, these three people attend Perry University, and most people who graduated from Perry last year found jobs.

265	"Context: Activist: Accidents at the Three Mile Island and Chernobyl nuclear plants have shown the dangers of nuclear power. It was earlier argued that nuclear power was necessary because fossil fuels will eventually run out. Recently, however, a technology has been developed for deriving from sewage sludge an oil that can be used to generate power. This new technology, therefore, together with the possibility of using alternative sources of energy like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, raises the hope that we can dispense altogether with nuclear power and that we can meet our energy needs in a way that better protects the environment from harm than we do at present. 
 Question: Which one of the following considerations is LEAST relevant in evaluating the degree of practicability of the hope expressed by the activist above? 
 (0) whether the current methods of disposing of sewage sludge by dumping do environmental damage (1) whether the processes that are used to turn sewage into clean water and sewage sludge have been improved in recent decades (2) whether the cost of producing and using oil from sewage sludge would be economically sustainable (3) whether the burning of oil from sewage sludge would, in contrast to nuclear power production, produce gases that would have a harmful warming effect on climate worldwide (4) whether waste products that would be produced in deriving oil from sewage sludge and burning it would be as dangerous as those produced by the mining and use of nuclear fuel 
 Answer:"	(1) whether the processes that are used to turn sewage into clean water and sewage sludge have been improved in recent decades
266	"Context: In a study of tropical forests it was found that while the species of trees that is most common in a particular forest also reproduces the most, trees of the species that is rarest there tend to survive longer. This pattern holds regardless of which species of trees is the most common and which is the rarest. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain why trees of the rarest species tend to survive longer than trees of the most common species? 
 (0) The species of trees that is most common in a forest thrives there because it is best suited to the local climate. (1) Older trees tend to reproduce the least. (2) The study tracked preexisting tree species but did not introduce any new species to the tropical forests. (3) The survival of the trees of the rarer species enables tropical forests to recover more easily from moderate destruction. (4) The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species. 
 Answer:"	(4) The trees of the common species have more competition for the resources they need than do the trees of the rare species.
267	"Context: The television network's advertisement for its new medical drama grossly misrepresents what that program is like. Thus, it will not as effectively attract the sort of viewers likely to continue watching the program as would the advertisement that the program's producers favored; people who tune in to the first episode based on false expectations will be unlikely to watch subsequent episodes. 
 Question: The argument relies on which one of the following assumptions? 
 (0) Most viewers who tune in to the first episode of the program will do so because of the network's advertisement for the program. (1) The advertisement that the program's producers favored would not have grossly misrepresented what the program would be like. (2) Most people who tune in to the first episode of the program and become loyal viewers will not have tuned in to the first episode as a result of the network's advertisement for the program. (3) If the advertisement that the program's producers favored were used instead of the network's advertisement, almost all of the viewers who tuned in to the first episode would tune in to subsequent episodes as well. (4) Most people who become loyal viewers of a program do not miss the program's first episode. 
 Answer:"	(1) The advertisement that the program's producers favored would not have grossly misrepresented what the program would be like.
268	"Context: Sharon heard her favorite novelist speak out against a political candidate that Sharon has supported for years. As a result, Sharon's estimation of the novelist declined but her estimation of the candidate did not change. 
 Question: The situation described above conforms most closely to which one of the following principles? 
 (0) Artists who speak out on political matters will have influence only among their most dedicated fans. (1) A political statement from an artist should be considered only if the artist has established a reputation for being an honest and knowledgeable observer of politics. (2) Artists should limit their public political statements to issues that are somehow related to the arts. (3) Someone who hears testimony that contradicts a long-standing opinion will generally entertain doubts about the source of the testimony rather than the correctness of the opinion. (4) People are far less likely to renounce an allegiance that they have had for many years than to renounce an allegiance that is new to them. 
 Answer:"	(3) Someone who hears testimony that contradicts a long-standing opinion will generally entertain doubts about the source of the testimony rather than the correctness of the opinion.
269	"Context: Advertisement: In a carefully controlled study, blindfolded volunteers were divided evenly into five groups. Each volunteer tasted Sparkle Cola and one of five competing colas, each group tasting a different cola. Most of the volunteers said they preferred Sparkle Cola to the competing cola tasted. This shows that Sparkle Cola elicits a more favorable response from consumers than any of the competing colas tested. 
 Question: The reasoning in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds? 
 (0) It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups. (1) It takes for granted that most of the volunteers would buy Sparkle Cola rather than one of the other colas tasted, at least in situations where Sparkle Cola is not much more expensive. (2) It overlooks the possibility that some cola not tested in the study would have elicited a more favorable response than Sparkle Cola. (3) It overlooks the possibility that many people may prefer Sparkle Cola to competing colas for reasons such as the packaging or price of Sparkle Cola, rather than its taste. (4) It is based on a study that does not elicit consumers' responses to any beverages other than colas. 
 Answer:"	(0) It overlooks the possibility that a generalization true of the entire group of volunteers was not true of each of the five smaller groups.
270	"Context: Evidently, watching too much television can lead people to overestimate the risks that the world poses to them. A recent study found that people are more likely to think that they will be victims of a natural disaster if they watch an above-average amount of television than if they do not. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the reasoning above? 
 (0) Many people overestimate the dangers that the world poses to them, regardless of the amount of television they watch. (1) A person is less likely to live in an area that is prone to natural disasters if that person watches an above-average amount of television than if that person watches a below-average amount of television. (2) People who watch a below-average amount of television tend to have a fairly accurate idea of the likelihood that they will be victims of a natural disaster. (3) People who are well informed about the risks posed by natural disasters tend to have become well informed in some way other than by watching television. (4) A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not. 
 Answer:"	(4) A person is more likely to watch an above-average amount of television if that person lives in an area that is prone to natural disasters than if that person lives in an area that is not.
271	"Context: Meteorologist: Heavy downpours are likely to become more frequent if Earth's atmosphere becomes significantly warmer. A warm atmosphere heats the oceans, leading to faster evaporation, and the resulting water vapor forms rain clouds more quickly. A warmer atmosphere also holds more moisture, resulting in larger clouds. In general, as water vapor in larger clouds condenses, heavier downpours are more likely to result. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the meteorologist's argument by the claim that, in general, as water vapor in larger clouds condenses, heavier downpours are more likely to result? 
 (0) It is the only conclusion in the argument. (1) It is the conclusion of the argument as a whole but is not the only explicitly stated conclusion in the argument. (2) It is a statement that the argument is intended to support but is not the conclusion of the argument as a whole. (3) It is used to support the only conclusion in the argument. (4) It provides a causal explanation of the phenomenon described by the conclusion of the argument as a whole, but it is not intended to provide support for that conclusion. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is used to support the only conclusion in the argument.
272	"Context: Field studies, which have long been a staple of anthropological research, involve the researcher living within the community being studied. However, the usefulness of field studies tends to be overrated by anthropologists. Although most anthropologists do realize that living within the community one is studying affects that community, they generally underestimate the extent of such effects. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion drawn in the argument? 
 (0) Anthropologists tend to overestimate the value of field studies. (1) In a field study, the researcher lives within the community being studied. (2) Field studies have been a central feature of anthropological research for a long time. (3) Most anthropologists know that when they live within a community being studied, the community is affected at least somewhat. (4) Most anthropologists underestimate how much of an effect the researcher's presence has on a community being studied. 
 Answer:"	(0) Anthropologists tend to overestimate the value of field studies.
273	"Context: Juarez thinks that the sales proposal will be rejected by the committee if it is not rewritten before they see it. Juarez's opinion is very reliable on such matters. Thus, since the proposal will not be rewritten, it will probably be rejected by the committee. 
 Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to the reasoning in the argument above? 
 (0) A leading science journal has concluded that data provided by the manufacturer of a certain controversial new medication are accurate. The journal is generally reliable on such matters. Thus, the medication is probably safe, for if the company's data are accurate, the medication must be safe. (1) The data from the manufacturer of a controversial new medication prove that the medication is safe, because a leading science journal has concluded that the medication is safe, and it would not have done so had the manufacturer's data not proven that the medication is safe. (2) A leading science journal states that a certain controversial new medication is safe if the data provided by the company that developed the drug are accurate. Thus, the medication is probably safe, for the science journal is rarely wrong about such matters, and the company's data are accurate. (3) A leading science journal states that the data provided by the manufacturer of a controversial new medication are probably accurate and that if they are accurate, the medication is safe. Thus, the manufacturer's data are probably accurate, for the science journal is fairly reliable on such matters. (4) The data from the manufacturer of a controversial new medication are probably accurate, because a leading science journal has published the data and has concluded that the data are probably accurate. Moreover, the journal is fairly reliable on such matters. 
 Answer:"	(2) A leading science journal states that a certain controversial new medication is safe if the data provided by the company that developed the drug are accurate. Thus, the medication is probably safe, for the science journal is rarely wrong about such matters, and the company's data are accurate.
274	"Context: Advertisement: In a recent survey, a sample representative of all new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders reported savings of $250 a year, on average, as a result of switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. Thus, most people who hold auto insurance policies with other companies could save hundreds of dollars by switching to Popelka. 
 Question: The argument in the advertisement is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds? 
 (0) It overlooks the possibility that at least some of the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed reported that they saved little or no money when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. (1) It takes for granted that the new Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders pay no less for their auto insurance, on average, than do people who have held Popelka Auto Insurance policies for a longer period of time. (2) It fails to address adequately the possibility that switching to another insurance company would enable many auto insurance policyholders to save even more money than they would save by switching to Popelka. (3) It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka. (4) It fails to address adequately the possibility that people capable of saving hundreds of dollars by switching their auto insurance coverage to Popelka are disproportionately represented among the new Popelka auto insurance policyholders. 
 Answer:"	(3) It takes for granted that few if any of the Popelka Auto Insurance policyholders surveyed underestimated how much they saved when they switched their auto insurance coverage to Popelka.
275	"Context: Consumer magazine: Because front-loading washers use less water than top-loading washers, ordinary powder detergent does not dissolve readily in front-loading washers. So, to get clothes really clean in a front-loading machine you need to use a detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers, instead of ordinary powder detergent. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument in the consumer magazine? 
 (0) All top-loading washing machines use the same amount of water. (1) A laundry detergent formulated especially for front-loading washers dissolves more readily in them than it does in top-loading washers. (2) A washing machine gets clothes really clean only with a laundry detergent specially formulated for that machine. (3) A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it. (4) Washers that use more water get clothes cleaner than those that use less. 
 Answer:"	(3) A laundry detergent does not get clothes really clean in a washer unless it dissolves readily in it.
276	"Context: In marketing their products, drug companies often send gifts to physicians. According to a recent survey, most physicians believe that their own choices when prescribing drugs are not influenced by drug companies' gifts. The same survey indicates that the majority of physicians believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are influenced by such gifts. 
 Question: If the survey results are accurate, which one of the following must be true? 
 (0) Physicians who do not accept gifts from drug companies are less likely to prescribe unnecessary drugs than those who do accept such gifts. (1) Most physicians believe that drug companies should adopt new guidelines that regulate their practices in sending gifts to physicians. (2) Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians. (3) Some physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that other physicians' prescription choices are influenced to a greater degree by such gifts. (4) All physicians who admit that their own choices when prescribing drugs are influenced by drug companies' gifts believe that most other physicians' prescription choices are also influenced by such gifts. 
 Answer:"	(2) Some physicians are mistaken either about the degree to which they are influenced by gifts from drug companies or about the degree to which such gifts influence other physicians.
277	"Context: Columnist: Although most people favor the bill and the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights, it will not be passed for many years, if at all; nor will any similar bill. Those people who would be adversely affected were it to become law are very influential. This shows that, if this country is a democracy at all, it is not a well-functioning one. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's reasoning? 
 (0) In a well-functioning democracy, any bill that would benefit most people will be passed into law within a few years if it does not violate anyone's basic human rights. (1) If a democracy is well functioning, then any bill that is opposed by influential people but favored by most other people will eventually pass into law. (2) In a well-functioning democracy, a bill that is favored by most people will become law within a few years only if those who oppose it are not very influential. (3) Any bill passed into law in a well-functioning democracy will be favored by most people and be consistent with individuals' basic human rights. (4) A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights. 
 Answer:"	(4) A bill that most people favor will be passed promptly into law in a well-functioning democracy if the bill does not violate anyone's basic human rights.
278	"Context: Many homeowners regularly add commercial fertilizers to their lawns and gardens to maintain a healthy balance of nutrients in soil. The widely available commercial fertilizers contain only macronutrients-namely, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. To remain healthy in the long term, soil for lawns requires the presence of these macronutrients and also trace amounts of micronutrients such as zinc, iron, and copper, which are depleted when grass clippings are raked up rather than allowed to decay and return to the soil. 
 Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above? 
 (0) There is no single fertilizer that provides both the macronutrients and micronutrients necessary for maintaining soil's long-term health. (1) The macronutrients nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are available to homeowners only in commercial fertilizers. (2) Widely available commercial fertilizers are not alone sufficient to maintain a healthy balance of nutrients in soil for lawns where grass clippings are not allowed to decay and return to the soil. (3) For soil to remain healthy in the long term, it requires the regular addition of both commercial fertilizers and a source of micronutrients such as grass clippings that are allowed to decay and return to the soil. (4) Homeowners who rake up their grass clippings are unable to maintain the long-term health of the soil in their lawns and gardens. 
 Answer:"	(2) Widely available commercial fertilizers are not alone sufficient to maintain a healthy balance of nutrients in soil for lawns where grass clippings are not allowed to decay and return to the soil.
279	"Context: In most industrial waste products that contain the toxic chemical XTX, the concentration of this chemical is approximately 1,000 parts per million. A federal law intended to reduce the harm that can result from the introduction of XTX into the environment permits a company to dispose of these waste products in a dump for hazardous waste, but only if the concentration of XTX is below 500 parts per million. Waste products with concentrations above that level must be destroyed by incineration. The law further specifies that manufacturers may not dilute XTX-containing waste products to bring their concentration of XTX down to a permissible level for dumping. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, argues most strongly for the inclusion of the antidilution provision of the law? 
 (0) If improperly incinerated, waste products containing undiluted concentrations of XTX can release into the environment a gaseous form of the chemical that is more than twice as toxic as XTX is in its usual liquid state. (1) If present in the environment in sufficient quantities, the diluted XTX is as harmful as the more concentrated XTX. (2) When XTX is exposed to sunlight and oxygen, it eventually breaks down into a number of components that individually and collectively carry no risk of environmental harm. (3) Most owners of dumps for hazardous waste are willing to accept XTX for disposal in their facilities only in concentrations below 800 parts per million. (4) To manufacturers, the cost of diluting and disposing of waste products containing XTX is approximately the same as the cost of destroying these products by incineration. 
 Answer:"	(1) If present in the environment in sufficient quantities, the diluted XTX is as harmful as the more concentrated XTX.
280	"Context: The quantity and type of pollution that entered the river last Thursday night suggest that the local auto repair shop is responsible. But the penalty for this type of pollution is so severe that, unless stronger evidence is discovered or the perpetrator admits responsibility, we cannot be sufficiently certain of the identity of the polluter to justify imposing the penalty. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument? 
 (0) The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party. (1) Penalties for crimes should be severe enough to deter people from committing them, but not so severe as to undermine one's willingness to impose them. (2) The severity of the penalty imposed for an infraction should be proportional to the harm caused by that infraction. (3) The more severe the penalty for an offense is, the less likely it is that someone will come forward and admit responsibility for the offense. (4) The severity of the penalty for an offense should not be so great that one can never be sufficiently certain of guilt to justify punishment for that offense. 
 Answer:"	(0) The more severe the penalty for an infraction is, the more certain one must be of the guilt of a party before being justified in imposing the penalty on that party.
281	"Context: Depression is a serious problem for residents of nursing homes. However, a recent study has found that residents who developed personal bonds with pets had significantly lower rates of depression than did residents who did not develop personal bonds with pets. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) Nursing-home residents are more subject to depression than any other individuals. (1) The best method for helping a nursing-home resident to overcome depression is to provide access to a pet. (2) High rates of depression among nursing-home residents may result at least in part from a lack of companionship. (3) Animal companionship is essential for psychological well-being. (4) Allowing free access to pets in nursing homes would eliminate problems relating to depression. 
 Answer:"	(2) High rates of depression among nursing-home residents may result at least in part from a lack of companionship.
282	"Context: Humorous television advertisements are the only effective ones. For if something is humorous it will not only attract people's attention, it will hold their attention long enough for a message to be conveyed. And, obviously, for an advertisement to be effective it must convey its message. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the argument? 
 (0) It takes for granted that nothing but humor can attract a person's attention and hold it long enough for a message to be conveyed. (1) It confuses attracting a person's attention with holding a person's attention long enough for a message to be conveyed. (2) It treats a necessary condition for an advertisement's being effective as if it were a sufficient condition. (3) It uses two senses of the term ""effective"" without differentiating them. (4) It takes for granted that an advertisement's only purpose is to convey its message. 
 Answer:"	(0) It takes for granted that nothing but humor can attract a person's attention and hold it long enough for a message to be conveyed.
283	"Context: Physician: Stories of people developing serious health problems shortly after receiving vaccinations have given rise to the question of whether vaccination is safe. But even if these stories are true, they need not be cause for concern. With millions of people being vaccinated every year, it is to be expected that some will develop health problems purely by coincidence shortly after receiving vaccinations. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the physician's argument? 
 (0) For the most part, stories of people developing serious health problems shortly after receiving vaccinations involve vaccines that were recently introduced. (1) Some of the illnesses that vaccines are designed to prevent have become so rare that even if people are not vaccinated, they are unlikely to contract those illnesses. (2) People are no more likely, on average, to develop serious health problems shortly after receiving vaccinations than shortly before receiving vaccinations. (3) The health problems that some people have developed shortly after receiving vaccinations have been more serious than the health problems that the vaccines were intended to prevent. (4) In a few cases in which people developed serious health problems shortly after taking other medications, these problems were initially attributed to coincidence but were later determined to be due to the medications. 
 Answer:"	(2) People are no more likely, on average, to develop serious health problems shortly after receiving vaccinations than shortly before receiving vaccinations.
284	"Context: Sharita: Anyone who owns a cat should have it spayed or neutered unless they are willing to take care of the cat's offspring. It is because people fail to do this that there are so many stray cats around. Chad: Stray cats are not only a nuisance, they spread diseases and cause injuries to other cats and to humans. People feed these animals out of kindness, but doing so only exacerbates the problem unless the cats are then captured and adopted. 
 Question: Sharita's and Chad's statements provide the most support for the claim that they agree about which one of the following? 
 (0) It is usually wrong to feed stray cats. (1) There are more stray cats than there should be. (2) Stray cats are a problem because of the risk they pose to humans. (3) Stray cats spread diseases to other cats. (4) It is mainly out of kindness that people feed stray cats. 
 Answer:"	(1) There are more stray cats than there should be.
285	"Context: Detective: People who repeatedly commit crimes like embezzlement or bribery without being caught tend to become more confident. With each success, they believe that getting caught is less likely. However, the more crimes a person commits, the greater the chance that one of those crimes will be solved. It is therefore likely that most people who commit embezzlement or bribery will eventually be caught. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the detective's argument? 
 (0) The majority of people who commit embezzlement or bribery do so repeatedly. (1) People who commit embezzlement or bribery tend to be people who feel confident. (2) Embezzlement and bribery are more likely to be solved than are many other types of crimes. (3) People who repeatedly commit embezzlement or bribery become more and more careless the longer they avoid detection. (4) No one who commits embezzlement or bribery is ever caught the first time. 
 Answer:"	(0) The majority of people who commit embezzlement or bribery do so repeatedly.
286	"Context: If grain prices double then the average price of a loaf of bread will rise between 10 and 15 percent, whereas the price of grain-fed beef will come close to doubling. 
 Question: Which one of the following would, if true, most contribute to an explanation of the phenomenon described above? 
 (0) Farmers engaged in very large-scale cattle production generally try to reduce the labor costs involved in the production and sale of beef. (1) The wholesale price per pound of beef is approximately ten times the wholesale price per pound of bread. (2) The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef. (3) Only an insignificantly small proportion of the beef sold in retail markets is produced from cattle fed on grass rather than grain. (4) The vast majority of retail grocery outlets purchase the bread they sell from small independent bakers but purchase the meat they sell from large wholesale processing operations. 
 Answer:"	(2) The labor and marketing costs in producing and selling bread represent most of its cost, but the cost of feeding cattle represents most of the cost of producing beef.
287	"Context: Mark: The decongestant drug Zokaz was discontinued by its manufacturer because long-term studies revealed that it increased the risk of heart attack. Qualzan, another decongestant, works by essentially the same physiological mechanism as Zokaz. So Qualzan probably also increases the risk of heart attack. Kathy: The decongestive effects of the two drugs do stem from the same physiological mechanism. But since they are different chemically, the two drugs probably have different side effects. 
 Question: Which one of the following is a technique of reasoning used in Kathy's response to Mark? 
 (0) using a product's overall record of safety as evidence that the product is not linked to a particular health problem (1) attempting to discredit an argument by comparing it to another obviously flawed argument that is logically parallel (2) arguing against a conclusion by raising questions about the validity of scientific studies cited in support of that conclusion (3) attempting to undermine an argument by showing that it is incompatible with a fundamental principle of medicine (4) challenging an argument from analogy by focusing on a dissimilarity between the things being compared 
 Answer:"	(4) challenging an argument from analogy by focusing on a dissimilarity between the things being compared
288	"Context: CEO: We have been falsely criticized for not being an environmentally responsible corporation. Environmentally responsible corporations are corporations that do all they can to pollute less. Our current production methods pollute significantly less than our old methods did, and there currently are no methods that do not produce any pollution. 
 Question: The reasoning in the CEO's argument is flawed in that it 
 (0) takes for granted that production methods that do not produce pollution cannot be developed (1) fails to take into account the possibility that different causes can have similar effects (2) generalizes too hastily from the inapplicability of a specific criticism to the inapplicability of a class of criticisms (3) takes for granted that because the company has attempted to reduce the amount of pollution produced, they must have succeeded (4) ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now 
 Answer:"	(4) ignores the possibility that there are currently production methods that would allow the corporation to produce less pollution than it does now
289	"Context: A recent study showed that people who address problems quickly and directly are significantly less likely to have gum disease than are people who react to problems by refusing to think about them. Since stress can have a negative effect on the immune system, the study's results clearly indicate that some forms of gum disease are caused or aggravated by suppression of the immune system. 
 Question: The argument requires the assumption that 
 (0) painful conditions will interfere with a person's ability to address problems quickly and directly (1) refusing to think about something troubling contributes to a person's level of stress (2) people who have highly stressful lives tend to address problems quickly and directly (3) people who tend to address problems quickly and directly will invariably seek dental care at the first sign of problems (4) the reason some people refuse to think about problems is that they find addressing problems to be stressful 
 Answer:"	(2) people who have highly stressful lives tend to address problems quickly and directly
290	"Context: A science class stored one selection of various fruits at 30 degrees Celsius, a similar selection in similar conditions at 20 degrees, and another similar selection in similar conditions at 10 degrees. Because the fruits stored at 20 degrees stayed fresh longer than those stored at 30 degrees, and those stored at 10 degrees stayed fresh longest, the class concluded that the cooler the temperature at which these varieties of fruits are stored, the longer they will stay fresh. 
 Question: The class's reasoning is flawed in that the class 
 (0) generalized too readily from the fruits it tested to fruits it did not test (1) ignored the effects of other factors such as humidity and sunlight on the rate of spoilage (2) too readily extrapolated from a narrow range of temperatures to the entire range of temperatures (3) assumed without proof that its thermometer was reliable (4) neglected to offer any explanation for the results it discovered 
 Answer:"	(2) too readily extrapolated from a narrow range of temperatures to the entire range of temperatures
291	"Context: Though Earth's human population is increasing, it currently uses only a relatively small fraction of the supply of fresh water. Thus, claims that water shortages will plague humankind in the near future unless population growth trends change are simply mistaken. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above? 
 (0) Population growth trends are notoriously hard to predict with reasonable accuracy. (1) The amount of fresh water available to meet the needs of Earth's population varies significantly from region to region. (2) Not all of Earth's population will adopt water conservation methods in the near future. (3) If Earth's population continues to increase, it will eventually outstrip all available resources. (4) The percentage of fresh water used for agriculture is likely to grow more quickly than is the percentage used for industry. 
 Answer:"	(1) The amount of fresh water available to meet the needs of Earth's population varies significantly from region to region.
292	"Context: Consultant: The dramatic improvements in productivity achieved during the Industrial Revolution resulted in large part from standardization of processes and procedures coupled with centralization of planning and decision making. Yet, in recent years, many already productive companies have further improved their productivity by giving individual employees greater influence in decision making and in how they do their work. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent paradox in the consultant's statements? 
 (0) Most companies still try to improve productivity mainly through greater standardization and centralization of decision making. (1) Increased productivity is not the only benefit of giving individual employees greater control over their work; job satisfaction increases as well. (2) Most of the increases in industrial productivity that have occurred in recent years have been due to the introduction of advanced technology like industrial robots. (3) The innovations of the Industrial Revolution are only now being applied in those companies in which individual employees have traditionally been entirely in control of how they do their work. (4) Increases in productivity in highly productive companies depend on management's broad application of innovative ideas solicited from individual employees about their work. 
 Answer:"	(4) Increases in productivity in highly productive companies depend on management's broad application of innovative ideas solicited from individual employees about their work.
293	"Context: Professor: The most important function of epic poetry is to transmit the values by which a group of people is to live. This transmission is accomplished not by an explicit discussion of those values, but rather by their embodiment in heroic figures, who are presented as role models. Imitating those role models gives meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear the poems. 
 Question: If the professor's statements are true, which one of the following must also be true? 
 (0) An important function of poetry is to give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear or read it. (1) Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models. (2) When values are represented in poetry, they are rarely if ever set forth explicitly. (3) For many groups of people, heroic figures serve as role models embodying the values by which those people are to live. (4) Only epic poetry presents heroic figures as role models that, if imitated, give meaning and direction to the lives of those who hear it. 
 Answer:"	(1) Epic poems accomplish their most important function by presenting heroic figures as role models.
294	"Context: Letter to the editor: You say that if the government were to confiscate a portion of the wages of convicted burglars when they reenter the workforce, it would be a form of stealing, hence an abuse of power. Yet under the proposal now being considered, the government would confiscate such wages in order to fund an account to compensate burglary victims. So even if confiscating a portion of burglars' wages were a form of stealing, it would still be justified. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to support the argument in the letter to the editor? 
 (0) Money stolen from a burglar should be given to that burglar's victims. (1) Burglars are obligated to provide compensation to the same individuals they victimized. (2) The motive prompting an action determines whether or not that action is justified. (3) A crime is justified only if it is a means of compensating people who deserve compensation. (4) Stealing is never justified even if it benefits someone who has been a burglary victim. 
 Answer:"	(2) The motive prompting an action determines whether or not that action is justified.
295	"Context: Some heartburn-medication advertisements imply that unrelieved heartburn is likely to cause esophageal cancer. This is simply false. The fact is that only about 5 percent of people with severe heartburn have a condition called Barrett's esophagus, in which cells similar to those in the stomach's lining develop in the lower esophagus. Only these people have an increased risk of developing cancer because of heartburn. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument? 
 (0) Only those people with Barrett's esophagus can suffer an increased risk of developing cancer from heartburn. (1) An increase in the risk of esophageal cancer arises from cells similar to those in the stomach's lining developing in the lower esophagus. (2) Unrelieved heartburn is not likely to cause esophageal cancer. (3) Some heartburn-medication advertisements imply that unrelieved heartburn is likely to cause esophageal cancer. (4) The dangers touted by heartburn-medication advertisements will affect relatively few of the people who see those advertisements. 
 Answer:"	(2) Unrelieved heartburn is not likely to cause esophageal cancer.
296	"Context: We can be sure that at least some halogen lamps are well crafted, because halogen lamps from most major manufacturers are on display at Furniture Labyrinth. Any item on display at Furniture Labyrinth is well crafted. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above? 
 (0) We can be confident that the temperature will drop abruptly on at least one day this week, for there is a chance of storms most days this week; whenever there are storms, the temperature drops suddenly. (1) We can be positive that there are at least a few disturbing sonnets, given that Melinda has written several different kinds of sonnets; everything Melinda writes is disturbing. (2) We can be sure that Gianna will get at least some good mechanical work done to her car, because she can have her car worked on at any of several shops in the city, and every shop is capable of doing good mechanical work. (3) We can be positive that at least some minnows are healthy, because many different species of minnow can be found in lakes nearby, and every lake nearby is teeming with healthy fish. (4) We can be confident that the cornmeal used at Matteo's Trattoria is healthful and organic, since cornmeal is among the ingredients used in preparing meals there; whenever a meal is prepared at Matteo's Trattoria, only healthful, organic ingredients are used. 
 Answer:"	(1) We can be positive that there are at least a few disturbing sonnets, given that Melinda has written several different kinds of sonnets; everything Melinda writes is disturbing.
297	"Context: Psychologists have found that the implementation of policies allowing work schedules to be tailored to individuals' needs does not typically increase managers' job satisfaction or their efficiency—although this may be because most managers already have the autonomy to adjust their own schedules. But these flexible-schedule policies do increase job satisfaction, productivity, and attendance among nonmanagerial employees. The benefits dissipate somewhat over time, however, and they are reduced even further if schedules are too elastic. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements is most supported by the information above? 
 (0) Implementing flexible schedules would be an effective means of increasing the job satisfaction and efficiency of managers who do not already have scheduling autonomy. (1) Flexible-schedule policies should be expected to improve the morale of some individual employees but not the overall morale of a company's workforce. (2) Flexible schedules should be expected to substantially improve a company's productivity and employee satisfaction in the long run. (3) There is little correlation between managers' job satisfaction and their ability to set their own work schedules. (4) The typical benefits of flexible-schedule policies cannot be reliably inferred from observations of the effects of such policies on managers. 
 Answer:"	(4) The typical benefits of flexible-schedule policies cannot be reliably inferred from observations of the effects of such policies on managers.
298	"Context: Viewers surveyed immediately after the televised political debate last year between Lopez and Tanner tended to think that Lopez had made the better arguments, but the survey respondents who reported that Lopez's arguments were better may have been biased in favor of Lopez. After all, Lopez eventually did win the election. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously undermines the argument? 
 (0) Most people who voted in the election that Lopez won did not watch the debate. (1) Most people in the live audience watching the debate who were surveyed immediately afterward said that they thought that Tanner was more persuasive in the debate than was Lopez. (2) The people who watched the televised debate were more likely to vote for Tanner than were the people who did not watch the debate. (3) Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner. (4) Lopez won the election over Tanner by a very narrow margin. 
 Answer:"	(3) Most of the viewers surveyed immediately prior to the debate said that they would probably vote for Tanner.
299	"Context: Recent medical and anthropological data show that prohibitions on the use of certain foods served important social, economic, and medical functions in ancient cultures. But these data cannot explain the origin of the prohibitions involved, since those who originally adopted and enforced them did not have access to the same data as modern researchers. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) The origin of a food prohibition must be explained with reference to the understanding that the people who adopted and enforced the prohibition had. (1) The social, economic, and medical problems of a society may lead to the adoption of contradictory food prohibitions. (2) The social importance of the origin of a food prohibition is independent of the nutritional value of the food prohibited. (3) The original purpose of a food prohibition is often forgotten a few generations after the prohibition is introduced. (4) The people who originally adopted and enforced food prohibitions in ancient cultures generally had a nontechnical understanding of the medical functions of those prohibitions. 
 Answer:"	(0) The origin of a food prohibition must be explained with reference to the understanding that the people who adopted and enforced the prohibition had.
300	"Context: Editor: Most of the books of fiction we have published were submitted by literary agents for writers they represented; the rest were received directly from fiction writers from whom we requested submissions. No nonfiction manuscript has been given serious attention, let alone been published, unless it was from a renowned figure or we had requested the manuscript after careful review of the writer's book proposal. 
 Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the editor's statements? 
 (0) Most unrequested manuscripts that the publishing house receives are not given serious attention. (1) Most of the books that the publishing house publishes that are not by renowned authors are books of fiction. (2) If a manuscript has received careful attention at the publishing house, then it is either a work of fiction or the work of a renowned figure. (3) The publishing house is less likely to give careful consideration to a manuscript that was submitted directly by a writer than one that was submitted by a writer's literary agent. (4) Any unrequested manuscripts not submitted by literary agents that the publishing house has published were written by renowned figures. 
 Answer:"	(4) Any unrequested manuscripts not submitted by literary agents that the publishing house has published were written by renowned figures.
301	"Context: If the budget does not allow for more dairy inspectors to be hired, most of the large dairies in the central valley will not meet federal standards governing the disposal of natural wastes, which can seep into streams and groundwater. The new district budget, however, does not allow for the hiring of more dairy inspectors. Consequently, most of the district's drinking water is likely to become polluted. 
 Question: The conclusion above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) If most of the dairies in the central valley meet federal standards for the disposal of natural wastes, it is unlikely that most of the district's drinking water will become polluted. (1) To keep all the drinking water in the district clean requires more dairy inspectors to monitor the dairies' disposal of natural wastes. (2) All of the district's drinking water is likely to become polluted only if all of the large dairies in the central valley do not meet federal standards for the disposal of natural wastes. (3) Most of the district's drinking water is likely to become polluted if most of the large dairies in the central valley do not meet federal standards for the disposal of natural wastes. (4) If none of the large dairies in the central valley meets federal standards for the disposal of natural wastes, most of the district's drinking water is likely to become polluted. 
 Answer:"	(3) Most of the district's drinking water is likely to become polluted if most of the large dairies in the central valley do not meet federal standards for the disposal of natural wastes.
302	"Context: Company president: Almost every really successful product introduced in the last ten years has been launched by a massive television advertising campaign. We are using a massive television advertising campaign to introduce the Vegetaste Burger. So the Vegetaste Burger will probably be very successful. 
 Question: The flawed nature of the company president's argument can most effectively be demonstrated by noting that, by parallel reasoning, we could conclude that 
 (0) the president of Corbin Corporation has an office that is not in Corbin's headquarters building, since almost all of the offices in Corbin's headquarters building are small, whereas Corbin's president has a large office (1) Donna has at least ten years of experience as a computer programmer, since almost every programmer who works for Coderight Software has at least ten years experience, and Donna will probably be hired as a programmer by Coderight (2) almost all of Acme's employees oppose the pending merger with Barrington Corporation, since almost all of Acme's employees are factory workers, and almost all of the factory workers at Acme oppose the merger (3) Robinson will probably be appointed as president of Sifton University, since almost every one of Sifton's previous presidents had a Ph.D., and Robinson has a Ph.D. (4) the novel Safekeeping will probably earn a profit 
 Answer:"	(3) Robinson will probably be appointed as president of Sifton University, since almost every one of Sifton's previous presidents had a Ph.D., and Robinson has a Ph.D.
303	"Context: Biologist: Scientists have discovered fossilized bacteria in rocks 3.5 billion years old. The fossils indicate that these bacteria were quite complex and so must have already had a long evolutionary history when fossilized 3.5 billion years ago. However, Earth is only 4.6 billion years old, so the first life on Earth must have appeared soon after the planet's formation, when conditions were extremely harsh. This suggests that life may be able to arise under many difficult conditions throughout the universe. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the biologist's argument by the claim that the fossilized bacteria discovered in rocks 3.5 billion years old must have had a long evolutionary history? 
 (0) It is a claim for which no support is provided in the argument, and that is used to illustrate the conclusion of the argument as a whole. (1) It is a claim for which no support is provided in the argument, and that is used to support a claim that in turn lends support to the conclusion of the argument as a whole. (2) It is a claim for which some support is provided in the argument, and that itself is used to support another claim that in turn lends support to the conclusion of the argument as a whole. (3) It is a claim for which some support is provided in the argument, and that itself is not used to support any other claim in the argument. (4) It is a claim for which some support is provided in the argument, and that itself is used to support two distinct conclusions, neither of which is intended to provide support for the other. 
 Answer:"	(2) It is a claim for which some support is provided in the argument, and that itself is used to support another claim that in turn lends support to the conclusion of the argument as a whole.
304	"Context: At one time, many astronomers assumed that Earth remains motionless while the stars revolve around it. They concluded from this that the stars were not more than a few million miles from Earth. They reasoned that if the stars were farther away, they would have to move at tremendously great speeds in order to circle Earth during the day and reappear in roughly the same positions each night. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the reasoning described above? 
 (0) If the stars do not revolve around Earth, it is possible for at least some stars to be more than a few million miles from Earth. (1) All stars move at exactly the same speed when they are revolving around Earth. (2) Earth does not remain motionless while the stars revolve around it. (3) Stars do not move at tremendously great speeds. (4) A star that is more than a million miles from Earth could reappear in roughly the same position each night. 
 Answer:"	(3) Stars do not move at tremendously great speeds.
305	"Context: People may praise the talent of a painter capable of realistically portraying a scene and dismiss as artistically worthless the efforts of abstract expressionists, but obviously an exact replica of the scene depicted is not the only thing people appreciate in a painting, for otherwise photography would have entirely displaced painting as an art form. 
 Question: The argument proceeds by 
 (0) using a claim about what most people appreciate to support an aesthetic principle (1) appealing to an aesthetic principle to defend the tastes that people have (2) explaining a historical fact in terms of the artistic preferences of people (3) appealing to a historical fact to support a claim about people's artistic preferences (4) considering historical context to defend the artistic preferences of people 
 Answer:"	(3) appealing to a historical fact to support a claim about people's artistic preferences
306	"Context: Children should be discouraged from reading Jones's books. Reading them is like eating candy, which provides intense, short-term sensory stimulation but leaves one poorly nourished and dulls one's taste for better fare. In other words, the problem with letting children read Jones's books is that . 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the argument above? 
 (0) it will lead them to develop a taste for candy and sweets (1) too many children may become frustrated by their difficulty and stop reading altogether (2) their doing so interferes with the development of appreciation for more challenging literature (3) their message may undermine the positive teaching done by parents (4) children may become so enthralled with books that they will want to spend all their time reading 
 Answer:"	(2) their doing so interferes with the development of appreciation for more challenging literature
307	"Context: Archaeologist: How did the Parthenon's stonemasons manage to carve columns that all bulged outward in the center in precisely the same way? One hypothesis is suggested by the discovery of a scale drawing of a column etched into the stone of a Greek temple at Didyma. The drawing is a profile view of a column surrounded by a grid, which makes it possible to determine the correct width at every height of the column. The stonemasons who carved the Parthenon's columns may have relied on a drawing like the one at Didyma. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, adds the most support for the archaeologist's hypothesis? 
 (0) Modern attempts to recreate columns like those at the Parthenon have only been partially successful. (1) The construction of the temple at Didyma was begun over a century after the Parthenon was constructed. (2) Scale drawings were commonly used in many types of construction in ancient Greece. (3) The surviving columns at Didyma are almost twice as tall as the columns at the Parthenon. (4) The Parthenon's stonemasons had considerable experience carving columns before they started work on the Parthenon. 
 Answer:"	(2) Scale drawings were commonly used in many types of construction in ancient Greece.
308	"Context: Editorial: The government should not fund any part of its health services with lottery revenue. These health services are essential to our community, but lottery revenue could decline at some time in the future, leaving the government scrambling to make up a budget shortfall. The argument in the editorial most closely conforms to 
 Question: which one of the following principles? 
 (0) Governments should spend more of their revenue on essential services than on nonessential services. (1) Essential government services must be funded from reliable sources of revenue. (2) No government service should be entirely dependent on lottery revenue for its funding. (3) Governments should consider all health services to be essential to the community. (4) At least some lottery revenue must be set aside in case of budget shortfalls in the future. 
 Answer:"	(1) Essential government services must be funded from reliable sources of revenue.
309	"Context: Scientist: Rattlesnakes prey on young California ground squirrels. Protective adult squirrels harass a threatening rattlesnake by puffing up their tails and wagging them. New results show that the squirrel's tail also heats up when harassing a rattlesnake. Since rattlesnakes have an infrared sensing organ that detects body heat, the heating up of the squirrel's tail probably plays a role in repelling rattlesnakes. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to support the scientist's hypothesis? 
 (0) Rattlesnakes do not have the ability to increase the temperature of their tails. (1) Squirrels puff up their tails and wag them when they attempt to attract the attention of other squirrels. (2) Rattlesnakes react much more defensively when confronted with a squirrel whose tail is heated up than when confronted with one whose tail is not. (3) The rattlesnake is not the only predator of the California ground squirrel that causes it to engage in harassing behavior as a defensive mechanism. (4) Mammals such as the California ground squirrel have no organ for sensing infrared energy. 
 Answer:"	(2) Rattlesnakes react much more defensively when confronted with a squirrel whose tail is heated up than when confronted with one whose tail is not.
310	"Context: Critic: Fillmore, an influential television executive, argues that watching television regularly is not detrimental to very young children. Fillmore bases this on the claim, which I grant, that children can learn much that is beneficial from television. But we should reject Fillmore's argument, because clearly it is to Fillmore's benefit to convince parents that television is not harmful to their children. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the critic's reasoning? 
 (0) It takes a necessary condition for something's being harmful to be a sufficient condition for being harmful. (1) It concludes that something is true merely on the grounds that there is no evidence to the contrary. (2) It rejects an argument solely on the grounds that the argument could serve the interests of the person making that argument. (3) It is based on an appeal to the views of someone with questionable authority on the subject matter. (4) It bases its conclusion on claims that are inconsistent with one another. 
 Answer:"	(2) It rejects an argument solely on the grounds that the argument could serve the interests of the person making that argument.
311	"Context: While grapefruit juice is a healthy drink, it has been discovered that a chemical in the juice affects how certain medicines are absorbed, with the result that normal medicinal doses act like higher doses. Getting the wrong dose is dangerous. Since it is always desirable to take the lowest effective dose, the best medical approach would be to take lower doses of these medicines along with prescribed amounts of grapefruit juice. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
 (0) The amount of the chemical in grapefruit juice is highly unpredictable from glass to glass. (1) Grapefruit juice is less expensive than most of the medicines with which it interacts. (2) When scientists removed the chemical from grapefruit juice, the juice no longer affected how certain medicines were absorbed. (3) The chemical in grapefruit juice works by inhibiting an enzyme in the body that affects how certain medicines are metabolized. (4) Long before the chemical in grapefruit juice was identified, doctors were advising patients who took certain medicines to avoid grapefruit juice. 
 Answer:"	(0) The amount of the chemical in grapefruit juice is highly unpredictable from glass to glass.
312	"Context: A landlord needed to replace the air-conditioning unit in a small rental home. The salesperson at the appliance store showed the landlord two air-conditioning units with identical prices. She told the landlord that the Sno-Queen was the most powerful unit for the price, but advised him to purchase the less powerful FreezAll unit, saying that the FreezAll was powerful enough for his needs. 
 Question: The salesperson's advice to the landlord most closely conforms to which one of the following principles? 
 (0) When the prices of two different brands of a particular home appliance are identical, either of the products can satisfy the needs of the consumer. (1) When a consumer is choosing between two different brands of a particular home appliance, the consumer should select the less powerful product only if it is also less expensive. (2) A salesperson should always recommend that a customer buy the product that represents the best value. (3) When advising customers about a purchase of a home appliance, a salesperson should direct the customer toward the product that yields the highest commission for the salesperson. (4) When a consumer is choosing a home appliance, that consumer should choose the least powerful product that meets his or her needs. 
 Answer:"	(4) When a consumer is choosing a home appliance, that consumer should choose the least powerful product that meets his or her needs.
313	"Context: Editorial: Our political discussions tend to focus largely on the flaws of our nation's leaders, but we need to remind ourselves that these leaders were chosen democratically. The real question that needs answering is how our nation's institutions and procedures enable such people to attain positions of power. Thus, to focus our attention on the flaws of our leaders is to indulge in a pointless distraction. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption that the argument requires? 
 (0) Examining an individual leader's personal flaws does not reveal anything about how the nation's institutions and procedures influence the selection of leaders. (1) Political discussions that focus on the flaws of the nation's leaders will become even more common if the nation's institutions and procedures are not examined. (2) The workings of the nation's current institutions and procedures ensure that only flawed individuals will attain positions of power. (3) As yet, no one in the nation has made the effort to critically examine the details of the nation's institutions and procedures. (4) Concentrating on the flaws of the nation's leaders creates greater dissatisfaction with those leaders. 
 Answer:"	(0) Examining an individual leader's personal flaws does not reveal anything about how the nation's institutions and procedures influence the selection of leaders.
314	"Context: Many calcium supplements contain lead, a potentially dangerous substance even in small amounts. The body can safely store in bones trace amounts of lead from food, but high levels of lead in the blood are a major public health concern, associated with anemia and nerve damage. Despite this, many doctors contend that for some people calcium supplements containing lead are preferable to no calcium supplements at all. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above? 
 (0) Some fruits and vegetables contain trace amounts of lead derived from the soil in which they are grown. (1) It is difficult to ensure that one has completely eliminated trace amounts of lead from one's diet. (2) Lead is only one of the common public health concerns that are associated with anemia and nerve damage. (3) A high-calcium diet decreases the amount of lead that the body is able to tolerate safely. (4) When calcium intake is insufficient, the body draws calcium from bones, releasing stored lead into the bloodstream. 
 Answer:"	(4) When calcium intake is insufficient, the body draws calcium from bones, releasing stored lead into the bloodstream.
315	"Context: Principle: People should buy an expensive antique only if they can be confident of its authenticity and they find the piece desirable for its intrinsic qualities and not just for its value as an investment.Application: Matilde should not buy the expensive antique vase offered for sale on the Internet. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to justify the above application of the principle? 
 (0) While this style of vase is not currently sought after by other collectors, Matilde has acquired quite a few similar pieces and has developed significant expertise in identifying counterfeits. (1) Although the seller is willing to take back the vase if Matilde cannot independently authenticate it, Matilde is not sure that the vase will appreciate much in value in the future. (2) The seller of the vase has offered documentation of its age and origin, and Matilde is highly attracted to its shape and color; moreover, she suspects that it will be highly desirable to other collectors in the future. (3) The asking price for the vase is significantly less than the amount Matilde thinks it is worth, and the vase is of a style that Matilde particularly likes. (4) While Matilde likes the color and features of the vase, its particular style has frequently been reproduced for the mass market, and the vase cannot be examined closely or authenticated over the Internet. 
 Answer:"	(4) While Matilde likes the color and features of the vase, its particular style has frequently been reproduced for the mass market, and the vase cannot be examined closely or authenticated over the Internet.
316	"Context: Critic: In her presentation of important works of art in her art history textbook, Waverly claims to have presented only objective accounts: ""I have sought neither to advocate nor to denigrate what I included."" In writing about art, a pretense of objectivity never succeeds: clearly, Waverly writes much better about art she likes than about art to which she is indifferent. 
 Question: The critic's statements, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? 
 (0) Waverly believes that a historian of art should not prefer certain works of art to other works of art. (1) Waverly has only included works of art that she has strong opinions about in her textbook. (2) Waverly wrote her textbook with the intention of advocating the works of art that she likes best. (3) Waverly has not succeeded in her intended objectivity about works of art discussed in her textbook. (4) Waverly does not really believe that objectivity is a desirable trait in an art history textbook. 
 Answer:"	(3) Waverly has not succeeded in her intended objectivity about works of art discussed in her textbook.
317	"Context: Archaeologists are discovering a great deal about the Sals culture. For example, recent excavations have unearthed smelting furnaces and tools of smelted copper and bronze. There were distinct Sals words for copper and for bronze, but none for iron. Thus, the Sals did not smelt iron. 
 Question: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) If a culture had a distinct word for a metal, then it smelted that metal. (1) If a culture was unfamiliar with a metal, then it did not have a distinct word for that metal. (2) If a culture smelted copper and bronze, then it had distinct words for copper and bronze. (3) If a culture did not smelt a metal, then it was unfamiliar with that metal. (4) If a culture smelted a metal, then it had a distinct word for that metal. 
 Answer:"	(4) If a culture smelted a metal, then it had a distinct word for that metal.
318	"Context: Community organizations wanting to enhance support for higher education programs need to convince the public that such programs benefit society as a whole. Taking this approach makes the public more receptive. It is much easier, for example, to get the public to support road building, which is seen as benefiting everyone, than it is to get them to support programs that are seen as benefiting only a relatively small segment of society. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument? 
 (0) Community organizations seeking to encourage higher education programs must persuade the public that these programs benefit society as a whole. (1) It is easier to get the public to support programs that are seen as benefiting everyone than it is to get them to support programs that are seen as benefiting only a small segment of society. (2) It is easy to get the public to support road building, because road building is seen as benefiting society as a whole. (3) Convincing the public that higher education programs will benefit society as a whole makes the public more receptive to those programs. (4) Higher education is similar to road building in that both are beneficial to society as a whole. 
 Answer:"	(0) Community organizations seeking to encourage higher education programs must persuade the public that these programs benefit society as a whole.
319	"Context: Currently, no satellite orbiting Earth is at significant risk of colliding with other satellites or satellite fragments, but the risk of such a collision is likely to increase dramatically in the future. After all, once such a collision occurs, it will probably produce thousands of satellite fragments, each large enough to shatter other satellites. The resulting collisions will produce many more fragments, and so on, causing the space around Earth to become quite heavily cluttered with dangerous debris. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the argument by the claim that the risk of a satellite orbiting Earth colliding with other satellites or satellite fragments is likely to increase dramatically in the future? 
 (0) It is an unsupported claim that is used to provide support for the argument's conclusion. (1) It is an unsupported claim that is used to support another claim that in turn supports the argument's conclusion. (2) It is a claim for which the argument provides some support, and which in turn is used to support the argument's conclusion. (3) It is a claim that serves as the argument's conclusion. (4) It is a claim that provides nonessential background information for the argument's conclusion. 
 Answer:"	(3) It is a claim that serves as the argument's conclusion.
320	"Context: Researcher: Sal-monella bacteria are a major cause of illness in humans who consume poultry. Young chicks that underwent a new treatment exhibited a lower incidence of Salmonella infection than did untreated chicks, although one week after the treatment was administered the treated chicks had higher concentrations of a variety of bacteria than did untreated chicks. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the concentrations of bacteria one week after the treatment? 
 (0) The new treatment takes several weeks to administer. (1) Levels of Salmonella bacteria in young chicks are generally not high to begin with. (2) Most chicks develop resistance to many harmful bacteria by the time they reach adulthood. (3) The untreated chicks experienced a higher incidence of illness from infection by bacteria other than Salmonella than did treated chicks. (4) The bacteria found in the treated chicks were nonvirulent types whose growth is inhibited by Salmonella bacteria. 
 Answer:"	(4) The bacteria found in the treated chicks were nonvirulent types whose growth is inhibited by Salmonella bacteria.
321	"Context: Debater: As a pedagogical practice, lecturing embodies hierarchy, since the lecturer is superior to the student in mastery of the subject. But people learn best from peer interaction. Thus, the hierarchy in lecturing is a great weakness.Respondent: By definition, all teaching and learning are hierarchical, for all teaching and learning must proceed from simple to complex. In teaching mathematics, for example, arithmetic must precede calculus. Thus, the hierarchy in lecturing is a strength. 
 Question: The respondent's reply to the debater's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the respondent 
 (0) concedes one of the major assumptions on which the debater's argument depends (1) takes for granted that teaching methods that are effective in mathematics are also effective in other academic disciplines (2) fails to consider the possibility that some characteristics of lecturing other than hierarchy are weaknesses (3) applies a key concept to a different aspect of education than the aspect to which the debater applied it (4) takes for granted that the conceptual structure of mathematics is sufficiently representative of the conceptual structure of at least some other academic disciplines 
 Answer:"	(3) applies a key concept to a different aspect of education than the aspect to which the debater applied it
322	"Context: How the pigment known as Han purple was synthesized by the ancient Chinese of the Qin and Han dynasties has puzzled scientists. The Chinese chemists employed the same chemical ingredients used for Han purple in the production of a common type of white glass during that period. Both were produced in processes that involved subjecting the mixtures to high heat and mixing in lead to decrease the melting temperature. Thus, Han purple was probably discovered by fortuitous accident during glass production. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most strengthen the argument? 
 (0) Chemical analysis shows that most of the known fragments of both Han purple and the white glass were produced within a small geographical radius. (1) Han purple was used for luxury and ceremonial items, whereas the white glass was used to make certain household items. (2) The technique used for producing Han purple was known to very few people during the Qin and Han dynasties. (3) The ingredients used in producing both Han purple and the white glass were easily obtainable during the Qin and Han dynasties. (4) The white glass is found in more surviving artifacts from the Qin and Han dynasties than Han purple is. 
 Answer:"	(0) Chemical analysis shows that most of the known fragments of both Han purple and the white glass were produced within a small geographical radius.
323	"Context: Medical researcher: A survey of more than 1 million adults found that there was a greater frequency of illness among people who regularly slept at least 8 hours a night than among people who slept significantly less. This shows that mild sleep deprivation is not unhealthy and, in fact, probably bolsters the body's defenses against illness. 
 Question: The reasoning in the medical researcher's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) fails to address the possibility that an observed correlation between two phenomena is due to another factor that causally contributes to both phenomena (1) fails to consider that even if a given factor causally contributes to the occurrence of a given phenomenon, it may not be the only factor affecting the occurrence of that phenomenon (2) concludes, from the claim that a certain phenomenon occurs and the claim that a certain condition is sufficient for that phenomenon to occur, that the condition also exists (3) takes for granted that there will be an observable correlation between two phenomena if either of those phenomena causally contributes to the other (4) fails to consider that even if a specific negative consequence is not associated with a given phenomenon, that phenomenon may have other negative consequences 
 Answer:"	(0) fails to address the possibility that an observed correlation between two phenomena is due to another factor that causally contributes to both phenomena
324	"Context: If temperatures had dropped below freezing when I was gone last week, the impatiens in my garden would have died. If the impatiens had died, they obviously could not continue to bloom. However, since the impatiens in my garden are still in bloom today, temperatures did not drop below freezing last week. 
 Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely parallels that in the argument above? 
 (0) If a species is highly adaptable, it will thrive when introduced into a new environment. If a species thrives in its new environment, it will have an adverse effect on species already existing in that environment. But, since this species has not had an adverse effect on any species already existing in its new environment, it is not highly adaptable. (1) If a species thrives in a new environment, that species is adaptable. Species that adapt to new environments adversely affect some species already existing in those environments. So, if a species does not adversely affect any species already existing in its new environment, it has not adapted to it. (2) If a species is introduced into a new environment, it adversely affects some species already existing in that environment, but only if it adapts well to it. Therefore, if a species does not adapt well to a new environment, it will not adversely affect any species already existing in it. (3) If the introduction of a new species would adversely affect some species already existing in an environment, that species should not be introduced into it. Therefore, since the introduction of species into new environments will result in some species in those environments being adversely affected, species should probably not be introduced into new environments. (4) If a new species would damage an environment, that species should not be introduced into it. If a new species is introduced, the risk can be reduced by controlling its population. Therefore, because the introduction of species into new environments is likely to happen, their populations should be controlled. 
 Answer:"	(0) If a species is highly adaptable, it will thrive when introduced into a new environment. If a species thrives in its new environment, it will have an adverse effect on species already existing in that environment. But, since this species has not had an adverse effect on any species already existing in its new environment, it is not highly adaptable.
325	"Context: If the city builds the proposed convention center, several national professional organizations will hold conventions there. And if several large conventions are held in the city, the total number of visitors will of course increase. Tax revenues will certainly increase if the number of visitors increases. Thus, building the convention center will increase the city's tax revenues. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) If the number of visitors to the city does not increase, then the city's tax revenues will not increase. (1) If the number of visitors to the city increases, then the amount of money spent by visitors will increase. (2) The city's tax revenues will not increase unless the convention center is built. (3) People who are now regular visitors to the city will continue to visit the city if the new convention center is built. (4) If several national professional organizations hold their conventions in the convention center, those conventions will be large. 
 Answer:"	(4) If several national professional organizations hold their conventions in the convention center, those conventions will be large.
326	"Context: In a study, pairs of trained dogs were placed side by side and given a command such as ""sit."" After both obeyed the command, one dog was given a treat while its partner was given no reward at all. Over time, the dogs who went unrewarded began to disobey the command. This shows that dogs have an aversion to being treated unfairly. 
 Question: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument? 
 (0) Were dogs who were accustomed to receiving regular rewards prior to the study more inclined to obey the command? (1) Is there a decline in obedience if rewards are withheld from both dogs in the pair? (2) Were dogs who received treats in one trial ever used as dogs that did not receive treats in other trials? (3) Were there any cases in which the dog who was given a reward became more inclined to obey the command? (4) How many repetitions were required before the unrewarded dogs began to disobey the command? 
 Answer:"	(1) Is there a decline in obedience if rewards are withheld from both dogs in the pair?
327	"Context: A study of 20,000 20- to 64-year-olds found that people's satisfaction with their incomes is not strongly correlated with the amount they make. People tend to live in neighborhoods of people from their same economic class, and the study shows that people's satisfaction with their incomes depends largely on how favorably their incomes compare with those of their neighbors. 
 Question: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following hypotheses? 
 (0) People with high incomes are consistently more satisfied with their incomes than are people in the middle class. (1) Older people are generally more satisfied with their incomes than are younger people. (2) Satisfaction with income is strongly correlated with neighborhood. (3) In general, people's income levels have little effect on their level of satisfaction with life as a whole. (4) An increase in everyone's incomes is not likely to greatly increase people's levels of satisfaction with their own incomes. 
 Answer:"	(4) An increase in everyone's incomes is not likely to greatly increase people's levels of satisfaction with their own incomes.
328	"Context: Geologist: The dominant view that petroleum formed from the fossilized remains of plants and animals deep in the earth's crust has been challenged by scientists who hold that it formed, not from living material, but from deep carbon deposits dating from the formation of the earth. But their theory is refuted by the presence in petroleum of biomarkers, molecules indicating the past or present existence of a living organism. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the geologist's argument? 
 (0) Fossils have been discovered that are devoid of biomarkers. (1) Living organisms only emerged long after the earth's formation. (2) It would take many millions of years for organisms to become petroleum. (3) Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust. (4) Some carbon deposits were formed from the fossilized remains of plants. 
 Answer:"	(3) Certain strains of bacteria thrive deep inside the earth's crust.
329	"Context: Any driver involved in an accident leading to personal injury or property damage exceeding $500 is legally required to report the accident to the department of motor vehicles, unless the driver is incapable of doing so. Ted is not required to report the accident in which he was involved as a driver. 
 Question: Which one of the following can be properly inferred from the statements above? 
 (0) If Ted is incapable of reporting the accident, then the accident did not lead to property damage exceeding $500. (1) If Ted's car was damaged in excess of $500 in the accident, then he is incapable of reporting the accident to the department of motor vehicles. (2) Someone other than Ted is legally required to report the accident to the department of motor vehicles. (3) If Ted is incapable of reporting the accident to the department of motor vehicles, then he was injured in the accident. (4) Either no one was injured in the accident or the accident did not lead to property damage exceeding $500. 
 Answer:"	(1) If Ted's car was damaged in excess of $500 in the accident, then he is incapable of reporting the accident to the department of motor vehicles.
330	"Context: Student: If a person has an immunity to infection by a microorganism, then that microorganism does not cause them to develop harmful symptoms. Since many people are exposed to staphylococcus without developing any harmful symptoms, it follows that they have an immunity to infection by this microorganism. 
 Question: The student's argument is most similar in its flawed pattern of reasoning to which one of the following? 
 (0) Everything morally right is just, but some actions that best serve the interests of everyone are not just. Thus, some morally right actions do not serve the interests of everyone. (1) Advertisers try to persuade people that certain claims are true. Since writers of fiction are not advertisers, they probably never try to persuade people that certain claims are true. (2) Isabel said that she would take the medication. Obviously, though, she did not do so, because medication either cures disease or alleviates its symptoms, and Isabel is still quite ill. (3) When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high. (4) Studies show that doctors tend to wash their hands less often than any other health care professionals. This shows that the procedure cannot be of much value in preventing disease. 
 Answer:"	(3) When business owners are subjected to excessive taxation, they become less willing to expand their businesses. The recent decline in business expansions thus shows that their taxes are too high.
331	"Context: Ming: Since trans fat is particularly unhealthy, ifs fortunate for the consumer that so many cookie manufacturers have completely eliminated it from their products. Carol: Why do you say that? Even without trans fat, desserts do not make for healthy eating. 
 Question: Carol's response indicates that she interpreted Ming's remarks to mean that 
 (0) the more trans fat a cookie contains, the more unhealthy it is (1) food that doesn't contain trans fat is healthy food (2) if a food is not healthy, then it is unhealthy (3) a cookie containing any amount of trans fat is unhealthy (4) consumers should purchase cookies only if they do not contain trans fat 
 Answer:"	(1) food that doesn't contain trans fat is healthy food
332	"Context: Historian: During the Industrial Revolution, for the first time in history, the productivity of the economy grew at a faster rate than the population and thus dramatically improved living standards. An economist theorizes that this growth was made possible by the spread of values such as hard work and thrift. But successful explanations need to be based on facts, so no one should accept this explanation until historical evidence demonstrates that a change in values occurred prior to the Industrial Revolution. 
 Question: The overall conclusion of the historian's argument is that 
 (0) during the Industrial Revolution the productivity of the economy grew at a faster rate than the population (1) the fact that the productivity of the economy grew at a faster rate than the population during the Industrial Revolution led to a dramatic improvement in living standards (2) no one should accept the economist's explanation until historical evidence demonstrates that a change in values occurred prior to the Industrial Revolution (3) the improvement in living standards that occurred during the Industrial Revolution was not due to the spread of a change in values (4) values such as hard work and thrift did not become widespread prior to the Industrial Revolution 
 Answer:"	(2) no one should accept the economist's explanation until historical evidence demonstrates that a change in values occurred prior to the Industrial Revolution
333	"Context: The master plan for the new park calls for the planting of trees of any species native to this area, except for those native trees that grow to be very large, such as the cottonwood. The trees that the community group donated were purchased at Three Rivers Nursery, which sells mostly native trees and shrubs. Thus, the donated trees are probably consistent with the master plan. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) Some tree species that grow to be very large are consistent with the master plan. (1) Three Rivers Nursery sells cottonwood trees. (2) Many of the native species that Three Rivers Nursery sells are shrubs, not trees. (3) Tree species that are not native to this area and that are consistent with the master plan are rare and hard to find. (4) Three Rivers Nursery does not sell any tree species that grow to be very large. 
 Answer:"	(4) Three Rivers Nursery does not sell any tree species that grow to be very large.
334	"Context: Paleontologists had long supposed that the dinosaur Diplodocus browsed for high-growing vegetation such as treetop leaves by raising its very long neck. But now computer models have shown that the structure of Diplodocus's neck bones would have prevented such movement. The neck could, however, bend downward and even extend below ground level, allowing Diplodocus to access underwater vegetation from dry land. Thus, Diplodocus must have fed on plants on or near the ground, or underwater. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) The same type of neck structure is found in modern ground-feeding animals. (1) Diplodocus was not able to see in front of itself unless its head was angled steeply downward. (2) It would be impossible for a large animal such as Diplodocus to supply blood to an elevated brain. (3) Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs. (4) Diplodocus was not able to browse for underwater vegetation by kneeling beside bodies of water or by walking into them. 
 Answer:"	(3) Diplodocus had no other way of accessing high-growing vegetation, such as by rising up on its hind legs.
335	"Context: Government official: Although the determination of local residents to rebuild hiking trails recently devastated by a landslide indicates that they are strongly committed to their community, the government should not assist them in rebuilding. The reason is clear: there is a strong likelihood of future landslides in that location that could cause serious injury or worse. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the government official's argument? 
 (0) Residents should not be allowed to rebuild trails unless the government assists them in rebuilding. (1) The determination of residents to rebuild hiking trails devastated by landslides should be what determines government support for the project. (2) Government agencies should not assist people with projects unless those people are strongly committed to their community. (3) The government should not assist in projects that are very likely to result in circumstances that could lead to serious injury. (4) Residents should be discouraged from rebuilding in any area that has had an extensive history of landslides. 
 Answer:"	(3) The government should not assist in projects that are very likely to result in circumstances that could lead to serious injury.
336	"Context: Scientist: There is a lot of concern that human behavior may be responsible for large-scale climate change. But this should be seen as more of an opportunity than a problem. If human behavior is responsible for climate change, then we can control future climate change to make it less extreme than previous climate shifts. 
 Question: The scientist's argument requires assuming which one of the following? 
 (0) The same degree of climate change produces less damage if it is caused by human behavior than if it has a purely natural cause. (1) Human beings can control the aspects of their behavior that have an impact on climate change. (2) At least some previous large-scale climate changes have been caused by human behavior. (3) Large-scale climate change poses a greater danger to human beings than to other species. (4) It is easier to identify the human behaviors that cause climate change than it is to change those behaviors. 
 Answer:"	(1) Human beings can control the aspects of their behavior that have an impact on climate change.
337	"Context: In a study of heart patients awaiting treatment for reduced blood flow to the heart, those still waiting to find out whether they would need surgery were less likely to experience pain from the condition than were those who knew what type of treatment they would receive. Assuming that this uncertainty is more stressful than knowing what one's future holds, then it is reasonable to conclude that . 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the argument? 
 (0) stress sometimes reduces the amount of pain a heart patient experiences (1) the pain experienced by heart patients is to some extent beneficial (2) the severity of a heart patient's condition is usually worsened by withholding information from the patient about the treatment that that patient will receive (3) stress is probably an effect rather than a cause of reduced blood flow to the heart (4) heart patients suffering from reduced blood flow to the heart who are experiencing pain from the condition are more likely to require surgery than are such patients who are not experiencing pain 
 Answer:"	(0) stress sometimes reduces the amount of pain a heart patient experiences
338	"Context: Given the shape of the hip and foot bones of the Kodiak bear, it has been determined that standing and walking upright is completely natural behavior for these bears. Thus, walking on hind legs is instinctive and not a learned behavior of the Kodiak. 
 Question: To which one of the following criticisms is the argument most vulnerable? 
 (0) The argument incorrectly generalizes from the behavior of a few bears in support of its conclusion. (1) The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity. (2) The word ""behavior"" illicitly changes meaning during the course of the argument. (3) The argument presumes, without giving justification, that all behavior can be explained in one or both of only two ways. (4) The argument incorrectly appeals to the authority of science in order to support its conclusion. 
 Answer:"	(1) The argument fails to consider the possibility that walking on hind legs is the result of both learning and an innate capacity.
339	"Context: People are usually interested in, and often even moved by, anecdotes about individuals, whereas they rarely even pay attention to statistical information, much less change their beliefs in response to it. However, although anecdotes are generally misleading in that they are about unrepresentative cases, people tend to have fairly accurate beliefs about society. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to explain why people tend to have accurate beliefs about society despite the facts described above? 
 (0) Statistical information tends to obscure the characteristics of individuals. (1) Most people recognize that anecdotes tend to be about unrepresentative cases. (2) The more emotionally compelling an anecdote is, the more likely it is to change a person's beliefs. (3) Statistical information is made more comprehensible when illustrated by anecdotes. (4) People tend to base their beliefs about other people on their emotional response to those people. 
 Answer:"	(1) Most people recognize that anecdotes tend to be about unrepresentative cases.
340	"Context: In 2005, paleontologist Mary Schweitzer made headlines when she reported finding preserved soft tissue in the bones of a Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaur. Analysis of the collagen proteins from the T. rex showed them to be similar to the collagen proteins in modern-day chickens. Schweitzer's discovery therefore adds to the mountain of evidence that dinosaurs are closely related to birds. 
 Question: The answer to which one of the following questions would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the argument? 
 (0) How rare is it to find preserved soft tissue in the bones of a dinosaur? (1) Is there any evidence at all against the claim that dinosaurs are closely related to birds? (2) How likely is it for animals that are not closely related to each other to have similar collagen proteins? (3) Is it possible that T. rex is more closely related to modern-day chickens than to certain other types of dinosaurs? (4) Before Schweitzer's discovery, did researchers suppose that the collagen proteins in T. rex and chickens might be similar? 
 Answer:"	(2) How likely is it for animals that are not closely related to each other to have similar collagen proteins?
341	"Context: A university professor researching sleep disorders occasionally taught class after spending whole nights working in a laboratory. She found lecturing after such nights difficult: she reported that she felt worn out and humorless, and she had difficulty concentrating and finding the appropriate words. After several weeks of lectures, she asked her students to guess which lectures had been given after nights without sleep. Interestingly, very few students were able to correctly identify them. 
 Question: Which one of the following statements is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) The subjective effects of occasional sleep deprivation are more pronounced than are its effects on overt behavior. (1) No one can assess the overall effects of sleep deprivation on a particular person as well as that sleep-deprived person can. (2) Sleep deprivation has less effect on professors' job performance than it does on the job performance of others. (3) Occasional sleep deprivation is not as debilitating as extended sleep deprivation. (4) University students in a lecture audience tend to be astute observers of human behavior. 
 Answer:"	(0) The subjective effects of occasional sleep deprivation are more pronounced than are its effects on overt behavior.
342	"Context: Prime minister: Our nation's government should give priority to satisfying the needs of our nation's people over satisfying the needs of people of any other nation. This is despite the fact that the people of other nations are equal in worth to the people of our nation, which means that it is objectively no more important to satisfy the needs of our nation's people than to satisfy those of other nations' people. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to reconcile the apparent conflict among the prime minister's claims? 
 (0) A nation's government should not attempt to satisfy the needs of a group of people unless the satisfaction of those people's needs is objectively more important than that of any other group's needs. (1) A nation's government should give priority to satisfying the needs of its own people over satisfying the needs of another nation's people only if its own people are more worthy than the other nation's people. (2) The priority a nation's government should place on satisfying the needs of a group of people depends mainly on how objectively important it is for the needs of those people to be satisfied. (3) When the people of two nations are equally worthy, the needs of the people of each of those nations should be satisfied primarily by the people's own governments. (4) A nation's government should give priority to the satisfaction of the needs of a group of people if, but only if, there is no other way for that group's needs to be satisfied. 
 Answer:"	(3) When the people of two nations are equally worthy, the needs of the people of each of those nations should be satisfied primarily by the people's own governments.
343	"Context: Mayor: To keep our neighborhoods clean, every street in town will be swept at least once a month. If a neighborhood needs more frequent sweepings, due to excessive dirt from major construction for example, that neighborhood will be qualified for interim sweepings. All requests for interim sweepings from qualified neighborhoods will be satisfied immediately. 
 Question: If all of the mayor's statements are true, then which one of the following must also be true? 
 (0) All neighborhoods in which construction is under way are qualified neighborhoods. (1) All qualified neighborhoods will get their streets swept more than once a month. (2) No street will be swept more than once a month unless it is located in a qualified neighborhood. (3) A qualified neighborhood that requests an interim sweeping will have its streets swept more than once a month. (4) No street in an unqualified neighborhood will be swept more than once a month even if the neighborhood requests it. 
 Answer:"	(3) A qualified neighborhood that requests an interim sweeping will have its streets swept more than once a month.
344	"Context: Journalist: It is unethical for journalists to lie—to say something untrue with the purpose of deceiving the listener—to get a story. However, journalists commonly withhold relevant information in interviews in order to elicit new information. Some argue that this, like lying, is intentional deception and therefore unethical. However, this argument fails to recognize the distinction between failing to prevent a false belief and actively encouraging one. Lying is unethical because it actively encourages a false belief. 
 Question: The journalist argues by 
 (0) pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn (1) defending what the journalist considers a controversial distinction by offering an example of a clear instance of it (2) defining a concept and then showing that under this definition the concept applies to all of the cases under discussion (3) appealing to a counterexample to undermine an ethical principle that supports an argument the journalist is trying to refute (4) clarifying and defending a moral principle by comparing a case in which it applies to one in which it does not apply 
 Answer:"	(0) pointing out a difference between the two cases being compared in order to show that a conclusion based on their similarities should not be drawn
345	"Context: Economist: Many of my colleagues are arguing that interest rates should be further lowered in order to stimulate economic growth. However, no such stimulation is needed: the economy is already growing at a sustainable rate. So, currently there is no reason to lower interest rates further. 
 Question: The reasoning in the economist's argument is questionable in that the argument 
 (0) relies solely on the testimony of experts (1) confuses economic growth with what stimulates it (2) presumes that a need to stimulate economic growth is the only possible reason to lower interest rates now (3) takes what is merely one way of stimulating economic growth to be the only way of stimulating economic growth (4) concludes that a further reduction of interest rates would lead to unsustainable economic growth merely from the fact that the economy is already growing at a sustainable rate 
 Answer:"	(2) presumes that a need to stimulate economic growth is the only possible reason to lower interest rates now
346	"Context: Most commentators on Baroque painting consider Caravaggio an early practitioner of that style, believing that his realism and novel use of the interplay of light and shadow broke sharply with current styles of Caravaggio's time and significantly influenced seventeenth-century Baroque painting. One must therefore either abandon the opinion of this majority of commentators or reject Mather's definition of Baroque painting, which says that for any painting to be considered Baroque, it must display opulence, heroic sweep, and extravagance. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Paintings that belong to a single historical period typically share many of the same stylistic features. (1) A painter who makes use of the interplay of light and shadow need not for that reason be considered a nonrealistic painter. (2) Realism was not widely used by painters prior to the seventeenth century. (3) A realistic painting usually does not depict the world as opulent, heroic, or extravagant. (4) Opulence, heroic sweep, and extravagance are not present in Caravaggio's paintings. 
 Answer:"	(4) Opulence, heroic sweep, and extravagance are not present in Caravaggio's paintings.
347	"Context: Under the legal doctrine of jury nullification, a jury may legitimately acquit a defendant it believes violated a law if the jury believes that law to be unjust. Proponents argue that this practice is legitimate because it helps shield against injustice. But the doctrine relies excessively on jurors' objectivity. When juries are empowered to acquit on grounds of their perceptions of unfairness, they too often make serious mistakes. 
 Question: The argument uses which one of the following techniques in its attempt to undermine the position that it attributes to the proponents of jury nullification? 
 (0) attacking the motives of the proponents of the doctrine (1) identifying an inconsistency within the reasoning used to support the position (2) attempting to show that a premise put forward in support of the position is false (3) presenting a purported counterexample to a general claim made by the doctrine's proponents (4) arguing that the application of the doctrine has undesirable consequences 
 Answer:"	(4) arguing that the application of the doctrine has undesirable consequences
348	"Context: Pharmacist: A large study of people aged 65-81 and suffering from insomnia showed that most of insomnia's symptoms are substantially alleviated by ingesting melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, which plays a role in the regulation of the body's biological clock. Thus, the recent claims made by manufacturers of melatonin supplements that the pineal gland produces less melatonin as it ages are evidently correct. 
 Question: The pharmacist's argument is flawed in that it 
 (0) infers from the effect of an action that the action is intended to produce that effect (1) relies on the opinions of individuals who are likely to be biased (2) depends on using two different meanings for the same term to draw its conclusion (3) confuses an effect of a phenomenon with its cause (4) relies on a sample that is unrepresentative 
 Answer:"	(4) relies on a sample that is unrepresentative
349	"Context: The recent concert was probably not properly promoted. Wells, who is quite knowledgeable about the concert business, was certain that it would sell out unless it was poorly promoted. But the concert did not sell out. 
 Question: The pattern of reasoning in which one of the following is most similar to that in the argument above? 
 (0) Dr. Smith, a well-trained cardiologist, said the patient would probably survive the heart transplant if it were performed by a highly skilled surgeon. Thus, since the patient did not survive the surgery, it probably was not properly performed. (1) Professor Willis, who is quite knowledgeable about organic chemistry, said that the sample probably did not contain any organic compounds. So, the sample probably is not labeled correctly, for if it were, it would contain organic compounds. (2) My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage. (3) The builder said that the school's roof would not require repairs for years, unless it is damaged in a storm. The roof is already leaking. Thus, since there have been no major storms, the builder was probably wrong. (4) Professor Yanakita, who is an expert on the subject, said that the tests would find lead in the soil if they were properly conducted. So, since the tests did find lead in the soil, they probably were properly conducted. 
 Answer:"	(2) My neighbor, who is an experienced home renovator, said the damage to the wall would not be noticeable if it were properly repaired. Thus, the repair to the wall probably was not properly done, since one can still notice the damage.
350	"Context: Economist: Global recessions can never be prevented, for they could be prevented only if they were predictable. Yet economists, using the best techniques at their disposal, consistently fail to accurately predict global recessions. 
 Question: The economist's argument is most vulnerable to the criticism that it 
 (0) presupposes in a premise the conclusion that it purports to establish (1) fails to establish that economists claim to be able to accurately predict global recessions (2) treats the predictability of an event, which is required for the event to be preventable, as a characteristic that assures its prevention (3) fails to address the possibility that the techniques available to economists for the prediction of global recessions will significantly improve (4) implicitly bases an inference that something will not occur solely on the information that its occurrence is not predictable 
 Answer:"	(3) fails to address the possibility that the techniques available to economists for the prediction of global recessions will significantly improve
351	"Context: Letter to the editor: When your newspaper reported the (admittedly extraordinary) claim by Mr. Hanlon that he saw an alien spaceship, the tone of your article was very skeptical despite the fact that Hanlon has over the years proved to be a trusted member of the community. If Hanlon claimed to have observed a rare natural phenomenon like a large meteor, your article would not have been skeptical. So your newspaper exhibits an unjustified bias. 
 Question: The argument in the letter conflicts with which one of the following principles? 
 (0) If a claim is extraordinary, it should not be presented uncritically unless it is backed by evidence of an extraordinarily high standard. (1) One should be skeptical of claims that are based upon testimonial evidence that is acquired only through an intermediary source. (2) If a media outlet has trusted a source in the past and the source has a good reputation, the outlet should continue to trust that source. (3) People who think they observe supernatural phenomena should not publicize that fact unless they can present corroborating evidence. (4) A newspaper should not publish a report unless it is confirmed by an independent source. 
 Answer:"	(0) If a claim is extraordinary, it should not be presented uncritically unless it is backed by evidence of an extraordinarily high standard.
352	"Context: Fish with teeth specialized for scraping algae occur in both Flower Lake and Blue Lake. Some biologists argue that because such specialized characteristics are rare, fish species that have them should be expected to be closely related. If they are closely related, then the algae-scraping specialization evolved only once. But genetic tests show that the two algae-scraping species, although possibly related, are not closely related. Thus, the algae-scraping specialization evolved more than once. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that it 
 (0) infers a cause merely from a correlation (1) infers that just because the evidence for a particular claim has not yet been confirmed, that claim is false (2) takes a sufficient condition as a necessary one (3) infers merely because something was likely to occur that it did occur (4) appeals to the authority of biologists who may not be representative of all biologists with expertise in the relevant area 
 Answer:"	(2) takes a sufficient condition as a necessary one
353	"Context: The constitution of Country F requires that whenever the government sells a state-owned entity, it must sell that entity for the highest price it can command on the open market. The constitution also requires that whenever the government sells a state-owned entity, it must ensure that citizens of Country F will have majority ownership of the resulting company for at least one year after the sale. 
 Question: The government of Country F must violate at least one of the constitutional requirements described above if it is faced with which one of the following situations? 
 (0) The government will sell StateAir, a state-owned airline. The highest bid received was from a corporation that was owned entirely by citizens of Country F when the bid was received. Shortly after the bid was received, however, noncitizens purchased a minority share in the corporation. (1) The government has agreed to sell National Silver, a state-owned mine, to a corporation. Although citizens of Country F have majority ownership of the corporation, most of the corporation's operations and sales take place in other countries. (2) The government will sell PetroNat, a state-owned oil company. World Oil Company has made one of the highest offers for PetroNat, but World Oil's ownership structure is so complex that the government cannot determine whether citizens of Country F have majority ownership. (3) The government will sell National Telephone, a state-owned utility. The highest bid received was from a company in which citizens of Country F have majority ownership but noncitizens own a minority share. However, the second-highest bid, from a consortium of investors all of whom are citizens of Country F, was almost as high as the highest bid. (4) The government will sell StateRail, a state-owned railway. The government must place significant restrictions on who can purchase StateRail to ensure that citizens of Country F will gain majority ownership. However, any such restrictions will reduce the price the government receives for StateRail. 
 Answer:"	(4) The government will sell StateRail, a state-owned railway. The government must place significant restrictions on who can purchase StateRail to ensure that citizens of Country F will gain majority ownership. However, any such restrictions will reduce the price the government receives for StateRail.
354	"Context: The makers of Activite, a natural dietary supplement, claim that it promotes energy and mental alertness. To back up their claim, they offer a month's supply of Activite free to new customers. Clearly, Activite must be effective, since otherwise it would not be in the company's interest to make such an offer. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the argument? 
 (0) The nutrients in Activite can all be obtained from a sufficiently varied and well-balanced diet. (1) There are less expensive dietary supplements on the market that are just as effective as Activite. (2) A month is not a sufficient length of time for most dietary supplements to be fully effective. (3) The makers of Activite charge a handling fee that is considerably more than what it costs them to pack and ship their product. (4) The mere fact that a dietary supplement contains only natural ingredients does not insure that it has no harmful side effects. 
 Answer:"	(3) The makers of Activite charge a handling fee that is considerably more than what it costs them to pack and ship their product.
355	"Context: Of the citizens who disapprove of the prime minister's overall job performance, most disapprove because of the prime minister's support for increasing the income tax. However, Theresa believes that the income tax should be increased. So Theresa probably approves of the prime minister's overall job performance. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments exhibits flawed reasoning that is most parallel to that in the argument above? 
 (0) Of the people who support allowing limited logging in the Grizzly National Forest, most support it because they think it will reduce the risk of fire in the forest. Andy thinks that limited logging will not reduce the risk of fire in the forest, so he probably opposes allowing limited logging there. (1) Of the people who expect the population in the area to increase over the next ten years, most think that an expected population increase is a good reason to build a new school. Bonita does not expect the population to increase over the next ten years, so she probably does not favor building a new school. (2) Of the people who believe that the overall economy has improved, most believe it because they believe that their own financial situation has improved. Chung believes that the economy has worsened, so he probably believes that his own financial situation has worsened. (3) Of the people who oppose funding a study to determine the feasibility of building a light rail line in the Loffoch Valley, most also believe that the Valley Freeway should be built. Donna opposes increasing funding for a study, so she probably supports building the Valley Freeway. (4) Of the people who believe that there will be a blizzard tomorrow, most believe it because of the weather report on the Channel 9 news. Eduardo believes that there will be a blizzard tomorrow, so he probably saw the weather report on the Channel 9 news. 
 Answer:"	(0) Of the people who support allowing limited logging in the Grizzly National Forest, most support it because they think it will reduce the risk of fire in the forest. Andy thinks that limited logging will not reduce the risk of fire in the forest, so he probably opposes allowing limited logging there.
356	"Context: Bird watcher: The decrease in the mourning-dove population in this area is probably a result of the loss of nesting habitat. Many mourning doves had formerly nested in the nearby orchards, but after overhead sprinklers were installed in the orchards last year, the doves ceased building nests there. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) Mourning doves were recently designated a migratory game species, meaning that they can be legally hunted. (1) The trees in the nearby orchards were the only type of trees in the area attractive to nesting mourning doves. (2) Blue jays that had nested in the orchards also ceased doing so after the sprinklers were installed. (3) Many residents of the area fill their bird feeders with canola or wheat, which are appropriate seeds for attracting mourning doves. (4) Mourning doves often nest in fruit trees. 
 Answer:"	(1) The trees in the nearby orchards were the only type of trees in the area attractive to nesting mourning doves.
357	"Context: In the bodies of reptiles, some industrial by-products cause elevated hormonal activity. Hormones govern the development of certain body parts, and in reptiles abnormal development of these parts occurs only with elevated hormonal activity. Recently, several alligators with the telltale developmental abnormalities were discovered in a swamp. So, apparently, industrial by-products have entered the swamp's ecosystem. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) provides no explanation for developmental abnormalities that do not result from elevated hormonal activity (1) fails to consider whether elevated hormonalactivity can result from factors other than the presence of industrial by-products (2) fails to address the possibility that industrialby-products were contained in food the alligators ate (3) fails to say whether reptiles other than alligators were examined for the same developmental abnormalities that were discovered in the alligators (4) uses evidence drawn from a sample of alligators that is unlikely to be representative of alligators in general 
 Answer:"	(1) fails to consider whether elevated hormonalactivity can result from factors other than the presence of industrial by-products
358	"Context: Government official: Residents who are foreign citizens can serve as public servants at most levels, but not as cabinet secretaries. This is wise, since cabinet secretaries perform some duties that should be performed only by citizens, and no one should be appointed to a position if it involves duties that person should not perform. Moreover, a cabinet undersecretary is expected to serve as cabinet secretary when the actual secretary is unavailable. So, ____. 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the government official's statement? 
 (0) foreign citizens who serve as public servants should be granted citizenship in the country they serve (1) foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries (2) only former cabinet undersecretaries should be appointed as cabinet secretaries (3) foreign citizens should be eligible to serve as cabinet secretaries (4) cabinet undersecretaries should not be expected to stand in for cabinet secretaries 
 Answer:"	(1) foreign citizens should not be appointed as cabinet undersecretaries
359	"Context: Doris: I've noticed that everyone involved in student government is outspoken. So if we want students to be more outspoken, we should encourage them to become involved in student government. Zack: Those who are in student government became involved precisely because they are outspoken in the first place. Encouraging others to become involved will do nothing to make them more outspoken. 
 Question: Doris and Zack disagree over whether 
 (0) students should be more outspoken (1) students should be encouraged to become involved in student government (2) becoming involved in student government makes students more outspoken (3) all students who are involved in student government are outspoken (4) students will not become more outspoken unless they become involved in student government 
 Answer:"	(2) becoming involved in student government makes students more outspoken
360	"Context: Biologist: A careful study of the behavior of six individual chameleons concluded that lizards such as chameleons bask in the sun not only for warmth but also to regulate their production of vitamin D. Critics of the study—although correct in observing that its sample size was very small—are wrong to doubt its results. After all, the study's author is well regarded professionally and has been doing excellent work for years. 
 Question: The reasoning in the biologist's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) takes the behavior of chameleons to be generalizable to lizards as a whole (1) fails to explain how chameleons regulate their vitamin D production by basking in the sun (2) focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself (3) fails to demonstrate that the study's critics have elevant expertise (4) holds the study's author to a higher standard than it holds the study's critics 
 Answer:"	(2) focuses its attention on the study's author rather than on the study itself
361	"Context: Political scientist: Some analysts point to the government's acceptance of the recent protest rally as proof that the government supports freedom of popular expression. But the government supports no such thing. Supporting freedom of popular expression means accepting the expression of ideas that the government opposes as well as the expression of ideas that the government supports. The message of the protest rally was one that the government entirely supports. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption that is required by the political scientist's argument? 
 (0) The government helped to organize the recent protest rally. (1) The message of the recent protest rally did not concern any function of the government. (2) The government would not have accepted aprotest rally whose message it opposed. (3) There are groups that are inhibited from staging a protest rally out of a fear of government response. (4) The government feared a backlash if it did not show acceptance of the recent protest rally. 
 Answer:"	(2) The government would not have accepted aprotest rally whose message it opposed.
362	"Context: Lawyer: In addition to any other penalties, convicted criminals must now pay a ""victim surcharge"" of S30. The surcharge is used to fund services for victims of violent crimes, but this penalty is unfair to nonviolent criminals since the surcharge applies to all crimes, even nonviolent ones like petty theft. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, would most help to justify the reasoning in the lawyer's argument? 
 (0) The penalties for a crime should be severe enough to deter most people who would commit the crime if there were no penalties. (1) The overall penalty for a violent crime should be more severe than the overall penalty for any nonviolent crime. (2) A surcharge intended to provide services to victims is justified only if all proceeds of the surcharge are used to provide services. (3) A criminal should not be required to pay for services provided to victims of crimes that are more serious than the type of crime the criminal has been convicted of. (4) Convicted thieves should be fined an amount at least as great as the value of the property stolen. 
 Answer:"	(3) A criminal should not be required to pay for services provided to victims of crimes that are more serious than the type of crime the criminal has been convicted of.
363	"Context: Economist—Owing to global economic forces since 1945, our country's economy is increasingly a service economy, in which manufacturing employs an ever smaller fraction of the workforce. Hence, we have engaged in less and less international trade. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to explain the decreasing engagement in international trade by the economist's country? 
 (0) International trade agreements have usually covered both trade in manufactured goods and trade in services. (1) Employment in the service sector tends to require as many specialized skills as does employment in manufacturing. (2) Because services are usually delivered in person, markets for services tend to be local. (3) Many manufacturing jobs have been rendered obsolete by advances in factory automation. (4) Some services can be procured less expensively from providers in other countries than from providers in the economist's country. 
 Answer:"	(2) Because services are usually delivered in person, markets for services tend to be local.
364	"Context: Merton: A study showed that people who live on very busy streets have higher rates of heart disease than average. I conclude that this elevated rate of heart disease is caused by air pollution from automobile exhaust. Ortiz: Are you sure? Do we know whether people living on busy streets have other lifestyle factors that are especially conducive to heart disease? 
 Question: Ortiz criticizes Merton's argument by 
 (0) raising a question about the validity of the study that Merton cites (1) contending that Merton needs to take into account other effects of air pollution (2) claiming that Merton misunderstands a crucial aspect of the study's findings (3) raising* a counterexample to the general conclusion that Merton draws (4) suggesting that alternative explanations for the study's findings need to be ruled out 
 Answer:"	(4) suggesting that alternative explanations for the study's findings need to be ruled out
365	"Context: Two lakes in the Pawpaw mountains, Quapaw and Highwater, were suffering from serious declines in their fish populations ten years ago. Since that time, there has been a moratorium on fishing at Quapaw Lake, and the fish population there has recovered. At Highwater Lake, no such moratorium has been imposed, and the fish population has continued to decline. Thus, the ban on fishing is probably responsible for the rebound in the fish population at Quapaw Lake. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument above? 
 (0) Highwater Lake is in an area of the mountains that is highly susceptible to acid rain. (1) Prior to the ban, there was practically no fishing at Quapaw Lake. (2) Highwater Lake is much larger than Quapaw Lake. (3) Several other lakes in the Pawpaw mountains have recently had increases in their fish populations. (4) There used to be a greater variety of fish species in Highwater Lake than in Quapaw Lake, but there no longer is. 
 Answer:"	(1) Prior to the ban, there was practically no fishing at Quapaw Lake.
366	"Context: The Asian elephant walks with at least two, and sometimes three, feet on the ground at all times. Even though it can accelerate, it does so merely by taking quicker and longer steps. So the Asian elephant does not actually run. 
 Question: The conclusion drawn above follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) If an animal cannot accelerate, then it cannot run. (1) To run, an animal must have all of its feet off the ground at once. (2) The Asian elephant can walk as quickly as some animals run. (3) It is unusual for a four-legged animal to keep three feet on the ground while walking. (4) All four-legged animals walk with at least two feet on the ground at all times. 
 Answer:"	(1) To run, an animal must have all of its feet off the ground at once.
367	"Context: A hardware store generally sells roughly equal numbers of Maxlast brand hammers and Styron brand hammers. Last week, all of the Maxlast hammers were put on sale and placed in a display case just inside the store entrance while the Styron hammers retained their usual price and location. Surprisingly, the Styron hammers slightly outsold the Maxlast hammers. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to explain the surprising result? 
 (0) For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise. (1) Most of the hardware store's customers are attracted by quality and service rather than low prices. (2) Customers who bought the Maxlast hammers last week commonly mentioned the sale as their reason for buying a hammer at that time. (3) The hardware store circulated flyers that publicized the sale prices on Maxlast hammers. (4) In general, a single item that is on sale will not motivate shoppers to make a special trip to a store. 
 Answer:"	(0) For the first several seconds after shoppers entera store, they do not take detailed notice of the store's merchandise.
368	"Context: In an experiment, two groups of mice—one whose diet included ginkgo extract and one that had a normal diet—were taught to navigate a maze. The mice whose diet included ginkgo were more likely to remember how to navigate the maze the next day than were the other mice. However, the ginkgo may not have directly enhanced memory. Other studies have found that ginkgo reduces stress in mice, and lowering very high stress levels is known to improve recall. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most weaken the argument? 
 (0) The doses of ginkgo in the diet of the mice in the experiment were significantly higher than the doses that have been shown to reduce stress in mice. (1) Neither the mice who received the ginkgo nor the other mice in the experiment exhibited physiological signs of higher-than-normal stress. (2) Some chemical substances that reduce stress in mice also at least temporarily impair their memory. (3) Scientists have not yet determined which substances in ginkgo are responsible for reducing stress in mice. (4) The mice who received the ginkgo took just as long as the other mice to learn to navigate the maze. 
 Answer:"	(1) Neither the mice who received the ginkgo nor the other mice in the experiment exhibited physiological signs of higher-than-normal stress.
369	"Context: Some of the politicians who strongly supported free trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico are now refusing to support publicly the idea that free trade should be extended to other Latin American countries. 
 Question: If the statement above is true, which one of the following must also be true? 
 (0) Some of the politicians who now publicly support extending free trade to other Latin American countries did not support free trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico. (1) Not all politicians who now publicly support extending free trade to other Latin American countries strongly supported free trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico. (2) Some of the politicians who strongly supported free trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico have changed their position on free trade. (3) Not all politicians who strongly supported free trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico now publicly support extending free trade to other Latin American countries. (4) Some of the politicians who strongly supported free trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico now publicly oppose extending free trade to other Latin American countries. 
 Answer:"	(3) Not all politicians who strongly supported free trade among Canada, the United States, and Mexico now publicly support extending free trade to other Latin American countries.
370	"Context: Principle: Any person or business knowingly aiding someone's infringement on a copyright is also guilty of copyright infringement. Application: Grandview Department Store, which features a self-service photo-printing kiosk, is guilty of copyright infringement since a customer using the kiosk infringed on a wedding photographer's copyright by printing photographs whose copyright is held by the photographer. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if assumed, most helps to justify the application of the principle? 
 (0) The operator of a business has the same legal obligations to customers who use self-service facilities as it has to customers who use full-service facilities. (1) The management of a business that is open to the public is obligated to report to the authorities any illegal activity that it witnesses on its property. (2) The owner of a self-service printing kiosk should post a notice advising customers that copyrighted material should not be printed at the kiosk without the permission of the copyright holder. (3) Owners of self-service facilities should monitor those facilities in order to ensure that they are not used for illegal or unethical purposes. (4) A person or business providing a service that can be expected to be used to infringe on a copyright should be considered to knowingly aid any copyright infringer using the service. 15 
 Answer:"	(4) A person or business providing a service that can be expected to be used to infringe on a copyright should be considered to knowingly aid any copyright infringer using the service. 15
371	"Context: Journalism's purpose is to inform people about matters relevant to the choices they must make. Yet, clearly, people often buy newspapers or watch television news programs precisely because they contain sensationalistic gossip about people whom they will never meet and whose business is of little relevance to their lives. Obviously, then, the sensationalistic gossip contained in newspapers and television news programs ____. 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the arguments? 
 (0) is at least sometimes included for nonjournalistic reasons (1) prevents those news media from achieving their purpose (2) is more relevant to people's lives now than it used to be (3) should not be thought of as a way of keeping an audience entertained (4) is of no value to people who are interested in journalism 
 Answer:"	(0) is at least sometimes included for nonjournalistic reasons
372	"Context: When surveyed about which party they would like to see in the legislature, 40 percent of respondents said Conservative, 20 percent said Moderate, and 40 percent said Liberal. If the survey results are reliable, we can conclude that most citizens would like to see a legislature that is roughly 40 percent Conservative, 20 percent Moderate, and 40 percent Liberal. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the reasoning of the argument? 
 (0) The argument uses premises about the actual state of affairs to draw a conclusion about how matters should be. (1) The argument draws a conclusion that merely restates a premise presented in favor of it. (2) The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group. (3) The argument fails to consider that the survey results might have been influenced by the political biases of the researchers who conducted the survey. (4) The argument uses evidence that supports only rough estimates to draw a precisely quantified conclusion. 
 Answer:"	(2) The argument takes for granted that the preferences of a group as a whole are the preferences of most individual members of the group.
373	"Context: City leader: If our city adopts the new tourism plan, the amount of money that tourists spend here annually will increase by at least $2 billion, creating as many jobs as a new automobile manufacturing plant would. It would be reasonable for the city to spend the amount of money necessary to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant here, but adopting the tourism plan would cost less. 
 Question: The city leader's statements, if true, provide the most support for which one of the following 
 (0) The city should implement the least expensive job creation measures available. (1) In general, it is reasonable for the city to spend money to try to convince manufacturing companies to build plants in the city. (2) The city cannot afford both to spend money to convince an automobile manufacturer to build a plant in the city and to adopt the new tourism plan. (3) It would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan. (4) The only way the city can create jobs is by increasing tourism. 
 Answer:"	(3) It would be reasonable for the city to adopt the new tourism plan.
374	"Context: An article claims that many medical patients have an instinctual ability to predict sudden changes in their medical status. But the evidence given is anecdotal and should not be trusted. The case is analogous to empirically disproven reports that babies are born in disproportionately high numbers during full moons. Once that rumor became popular, maternity room staff were more likely to remember busy nights with full moons than busy nights without them. 
 Question: The argument requires the assumption that 
 (0) the article claiming that medical patients can instinctually predict sudden changes in their medical status will soon be empirically disproven (1) patients' predictions of sudden changes in their medical status are less likely to be remembered by medical staff if no such change actually occurs (2) the patients in the article were not being serious when they predicted sudden changes in their medical status (3) babies are less likely to be born during a night with a full moon than during a night without a full moon (4) the idea that medical patients have an instinctual ability to predict sudden changes in their medical status is not a widely held belief 
 Answer:"	(1) patients' predictions of sudden changes in their medical status are less likely to be remembered by medical staff if no such change actually occurs
375	"Context: Politician: Union leaders argue that increases in multinational control of manufacturing have shifted labor to nations without strong worker protections, resulting in a corresponding global decrease in workers' average wages. Given that these leaders have a vested interest in seeing wages remain high, they would naturally want to convince legislators to oppose multinational control. Thus, legislators should reject this argument. 
 Question: The reasoning in the politician's argument is flawed in that the argument 
 (0) treats the mere fact that certain people are union members as sufficient to cast doubt on all of the viewpoints expressed by those people (1) presumes, without providing justification, that anyone whose political motivations are clearly discernible is an unreliable source of information to legislators (2) treats circumstances potentially affecting the union leaders' argument as sufficient to discredit those leaders' argument (3) presumes, without providing justification, that the argument it cites is the union leaders' only argument for their view (4) presumes, without providing evidence, that leaders of all unions argue against increases in multinational control of manufacturing 
 Answer:"	(2) treats circumstances potentially affecting the union leaders' argument as sufficient to discredit those leaders' argument
376	"Context: Professor: The number of new university students who enter as chemistry majors has not changed in the last ten years, and job prospects for graduates with chemistry degrees are better than ever. Despite this, there has been a significant decline over the past decade in the number of people earning chemistry degrees. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the decline? 
 (0) Many students enter universities without the academic background that is necessary for majoring in chemistry. (1) There has been a significant decline in the number of undergraduate degrees earned in the natural sciences as a whole. (2) Many students are very unsure of their choice when they pick a major upon entering universities. (3) Job prospects for graduates with chemistry degrees are no better than prospects for graduates with certain other science degrees. (4) Over the years, first-year chemistry has come to be taught in a more routinely methodical fashion, which dampens its intellectual appeal. 
 Answer:"	(4) Over the years, first-year chemistry has come to be taught in a more routinely methodical fashion, which dampens its intellectual appeal.
377	"Context: Although the first humans came to Australia 56,000 years ago and undoubtedly brought new diseases with them, human-borne diseases probably did not cause the mass extinction of large land animals and birds that took place over the following 10,000 years. After all, more than 55 different species disappeared at about the same time, and no one disease, however virulent, could be fatal to animals across that many different species. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments exhibits flawed reasoning that is most parallel to that in the argument above? 
 (0) Even though high interest rates can lead to an economic downturn, high interest rates probably did not cause the current economic downturn. It is true that rates have been on the rise, but high interest rates are not always economically harmful. (1) Even though I can fix some things and you can fix some things, the two of us will be unable to repair our apartment without outside help. The apartment has both a broken window and a broken bedroom door, and neither of us is able to fix both doors and windows. (2) Even though Lena, Jen, and Mark would like to go out to dinner together after the movie tonight, they will probably go straight home after the show. Of the five restaurants that are in the immediate vicinity of the theater, there is not a single one that all three of them like. (3) Even though this painting is highly regarded by critics, it cannot legitimately be deemed great art. Most art that was produced in the last hundred years is not great art, and this painting, beautiful though it is, was probably painted only 40 years ago. (4) Even though the influenza vaccine does not always prevent influenza, it sometimes reduces the severity of its symptoms. Therefore it is incorrect to say that some people who receive the vaccine derive no benefit from it. 
 Answer:"	(1) Even though I can fix some things and you can fix some things, the two of us will be unable to repair our apartment without outside help. The apartment has both a broken window and a broken bedroom door, and neither of us is able to fix both doors and windows.
378	"Context: A tax preparation company automatically adds the following disclaimer to every e-mail message sent to its clients: ""Any tax advice in this e-mail should not be construed as advocating any violation of the provisions of the tax code."" The only purpose this disclaimer could serve is to provide legal protection for the company. But if the e-mail elsewhere suggests that the client do something illegal, then the disclaimer offers no legal protection. So the disclaimer serves no purpose. 
 Question: The argument's conclusion can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) If the e-mail does not elsewhere suggest that the client do anything illegal, then the company does not need legal protection. (1) If e-mail messages sent by the tax preparation company do elsewhere suggest that the recipient do something illegal, then the company could be subject to substantial penalties. (2) A disclaimer that is included in every e-mail message sent by a company will tend to be ignored by recipients who have already received many e-mails from that company. (3) At least some of the recipients of the company's e-mails will follow the advice contained in the body of at least some of the e-mails they receive. (4) Some of the tax preparation company's clients would try to illegally evade penalties if they knew how to do so. 
 Answer:"	(0) If the e-mail does not elsewhere suggest that the client do anything illegal, then the company does not need legal protection.
379	"Context: Well-intentioned people sometimes attempt to resolve the marital problems of their friends. But these attempts are usually ineffectual and thereby foster resentment among all parties. Thus, even well-intentioned attempts to resolve the marital problems of friends are usually unjustified. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most strongly supports the reasoning above? 
 (0) One should get involved in other people's problems only with the intention of producing the best overall consequences. (1) Interpersonal relations should be conducted in accordance with doing whatever is right, regardless of the consequences. (2) Good intentions are the only legitimate grounds on which to attempt to resolve the marital problems of friends. (3) The intentions of an action are irrelevant to whether or not that action is justified (4) No actions based on good intentions are justified unless they also result in success. 
 Answer:"	(4) No actions based on good intentions are justified unless they also result in success.
380	"Context: It has been said that authors who write in order to give pleasure cannot impart to their readers the truth of their subject matter. That claim cannot be true. If it were, one could determine the truthfulness of a book simply by looking at its sales figures. If the book were very popular, one could reasonably conclude that it gave people pleasure and therefore that at least some of what is written in the book is not true. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) When people choose to read a book, they generally do not already know whether reading it will give them pleasure. (1) Even when an author writes with the goal of giving people pleasure, that goal will not necessarily be achieved. (2) In many cases, a book's readers are unconcerned about the truth of the book's contents. (3) A book will not give its readers pleasure unless it was intended by its author to have that effect. (4) A book can be popular for reasons other than its ability to give readers pleasure. 
 Answer:"	(3) A book will not give its readers pleasure unless it was intended by its author to have that effect.
381	"Context: It is likely that most of the new television programs Wilke & Wilke produce for this season will be canceled. Most of the new shows they produced last season were canceled due to insufficient viewership. Furthermore, their new shows are all police dramas, and few police dramas have been popular in recent years. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to strengthen the argument? 
 (0) Wilke & Wilke have produced more new shows for this season than they produced last season. (1) Most of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year were police dramas. (2) None of the shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were not canceled were police dramas. (3) All of the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas. (4) None of the most popular television shows last year were police dramas. 
 Answer:"	(3) All of the new shows that Wilke & Wilke produced last year that were canceled were police dramas.
382	"Context: If a corporation obtains funds fraudulently, then the penalty should take into account the corporation's use of those funds during the time it held them. In such cases, the penalty should completely offset any profit the corporation made in using the funds. 
 Question: Which one of the following conforms most closely to the principle illustrated above? 
 (0) If a driver causes an accident because the automobile being driven was not properly maintained, that driver should be required from then on to regularly demonstrate that his or her automobile is being properly maintained. (1) If a factory is found to have been recklessly violating pollution laws, that factory should be required to make the expenditures necessary to bring it into compliance with those laws to the satisfaction of the regulators. (2) If someone is sentenced to perform community service, the court has a responsibility to ensure that the community at large rather than a private group benefits from that service. (3) If an athlete is found to have used banned performance-enhancing substances, that athlete should be prohibited from participating in all future athletic competitions. (4) If a convicted criminal writes a memoir describing the details of that criminal's crime, any proceeds of the book should be donated to a charity chosen by a third party. 
 Answer:"	(4) If a convicted criminal writes a memoir describing the details of that criminal's crime, any proceeds of the book should be donated to a charity chosen by a third party.
383	"Context: Aisha: Vadim is going to be laid off. Vadim's work as a programmer has been exemplary since joining the firm. But management has already made the decision to lay off a programmer. And this firm strictly follows a policy of laying off the most recently hired programmer in such cases. 
 Question: Aisha's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) The firm values experience in its programmers more highly than any other quality. (1) When Vadim was hired, the policy of laying off the most recently hired programmer was clearly explained. (2) Vadim is the most recently hired programmer at the firm. (3) Every other programmer at the firm has done better work than Vadim. (4) It is bad policy that the firm always lays off the most recently hired programmer. 
 Answer:"	(2) Vadim is the most recently hired programmer at the firm.
384	"Context: Wanda: It is common sense that one cannot create visual art without visual stimuli in one's work area, just as a writer needs written stimuli. A stark, empty work area would hinder my creativity. This is why there are so many things in my studio. Vernon: But a writer needs to read good writing, not supermarket tabloids. Are you inspired by the piles of laundry and empty soda bottles in your studio? 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the principle underlying Vernon's response to Wanda? 
 (0) It is unhealthy to work in a cluttered work area. (1) The quality of the stimuli in an artist's environment matters. (2) Supermarket tabloids should not be considered stimulating. (3) Messiness impairs artistic creativity. (4) One should be able to be creative even in a stark, empty work area. 
 Answer:"	(1) The quality of the stimuli in an artist's environment matters.
385	"Context: The official listing of an animal species as endangered triggers the enforcement of legal safeguards designed to protect endangered species, such as tighter animal export and trade restrictions and stronger antipoaching laws. Nevertheless, there have been many cases in which the decline in the wild population of a species was more rapid after that species was listed as endangered than before it was so listed. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, does most to account for the increase in the rate of population decline described above? 
 (0) The process of officially listing a species as endangered can take many years. (1) Public campaigns to save endangered animal species often focus only on those species that garner the public's affection. (2) The number of animal species listed as endangered has recently increased dramatically. (3) Animals are more desirable to collectors when they are perceived to be rare. (4) Poachers find it progressively more difficult to locate animals of a particular species as that species' population declines. 
 Answer:"	(3) Animals are more desirable to collectors when they are perceived to be rare.
386	"Context: Annette: To persuade the town council to adopt your development plan, you should take them on a trip to visit other towns that have successfully implemented plans like yours. Sefu: But I have a vested interest in their votes. If council members were to accept a trip from me, it would give the appearance of undue influence. 
 Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Annette and Sefu disagree over whether 
 (0) the council should adopt Sefu's development plan (1) Sefu should take the council on a trip to visit other towns (2) Sefu has a vested interest in the council's votes (3) other towns have successfully implemented similar development plans (4) the appearance of undue influence should be avoided 
 Answer:"	(1) Sefu should take the council on a trip to visit other towns
387	"Context: Scholar: Recently, some religions have updated the language of their traditional texts and replaced traditional rituals with more contemporary ones. These changes have been followed by increases in attendance at places of worship affiliated with these religions. This shows that any such modernization will result in increased numbers of worshipers. 
 Question: The scholar's reasoning is flawed because the scholar presumes without giving sufficient justification that 
 (0) not every religion can update its texts and replace its traditional rituals (1) modernization of religious texts and rituals will not involve an alteration of their messages (2) the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance (3) making texts and rituals more modern is the only way in which a religion could bring about an increase in attendance at places of worship (4) the growth in attendance at places of worship affiliated with religions that made their texts and rituals more modern is irreversible 
 Answer:"	(2) the modernization of the texts and rituals of some religions was the cause of their increases in attendance
388	"Context: If one is to participate in the regional band, one must practice very hard or be very talented. Therefore, Lily, who is first trombonist in the regional band and is very talented, does not practice hard. 
 Question: The flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments most closely resembles the flawed reasoning in the argument above? 
 (0) In order to have a chance to meet its objectives, the army needs good weather as a precondition for retaining its mobility. The weather is good today, so the army will meet its objectives. (1) If Lois were on vacation, she would be visiting her brother in Chicago or seeing friends in Toronto. Since she is not on vacation, she is in neither Chicago nor Toronto. (2) If Johnson is to win the local election, then neither Horan nor Jacobs can enter the race. Since neither of them plans to run, Johnson will win the race. (3) To stay informed about current events, one must read a major newspaper or watch national TV news every day. So Julie, who is informed about current events and reads a major newspaper every day, does not watch TV news. (4) If Wayne is to get a ride home from the library, either Yvette or Marty must be there. Yvette is not at the library, so Marty must be there. 
 Answer:"	(3) To stay informed about current events, one must read a major newspaper or watch national TV news every day. So Julie, who is informed about current events and reads a major newspaper every day, does not watch TV news.
389	"Context: Dietitian: Eating fish can lower one's cholesterol level. In a study of cholesterol levels and diet, two groups were studied. The first group ate a balanced diet including two servings of fish per week. The second group ate a very similar diet, but ate no fish. The first group showed lower cholesterol levels, on average, than the second group. The two groups had displayed similar average cholesterol levels prior to the study. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the role played in the dietitian's argument by the claim that the two groups had displayed similar average cholesterol levels prior to the study? 
 (0) It is offered as an objection to the main conclusion of the argument. (1) It expresses the main conclusion of the argument. (2) It rules out an alternative explanation of the data collected in the study. (3) It provides background information on the purpose of the study. (4) It introduces an alternative explanation of the phenomenon described in the main conclusion. 
 Answer:"	(2) It rules out an alternative explanation of the data collected in the study.
390	"Context: Satellite navigation systems (satnavs) for cars, in which computer voices announce directions as you drive, save fuel and promote safety. Studies show that, when assigned to novel destinations, drivers using satnavs took, on average, 7 percent fewer miles per journey than drivers using paper maps. Fewer miles driven means, on average, less fuel consumed. Also, the drivers who used satnavs drove more carefully in that they were not taking their eyes off the road to check paper maps. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) People who are often required to drive to novel destinations are more likely to use satnavs than people who are rarely required to drive to novel destinations. (1) The more fuel a vehicle consumes, the more motivation a driver has to find the shortest route to his or her destination. (2) Drivers who do not routinely need to drive to an unfamiliar location are more likely to plan out their route carefully prior to departure. (3) Drivers who own satnavs usually prefer to drive to their accustomed destinations by using their customary routes rather than by following the directions given by the satnavs. (4) Drivers who are given directions as needed are less likely to change course suddenly or make other risky maneuvers. 
 Answer:"	(4) Drivers who are given directions as needed are less likely to change course suddenly or make other risky maneuvers.
391	"Context: A manager cannot extract the best performance from employees by threatening them with termination or offering financial rewards for high productivity. Rather, employees must come to want to do a good job for its own sake. One of the best ways for a manager to achieve this is to delegate responsibility to them, especially for decisions that previously had to be made by the manager. 
 Question: Which one of the following propositions is best illustrated by the situation described in the passage? 
 (0) Increased responsibility can improve a person's sense of how power should be used. (1) It is often the case that the desire for prestige is more powerful than the desire for job security. (2) In some cases one's effectiveness in a particular role can be enhanced by a partial relinquishing of control. (3) People who carry out decisions are in the best position to determine what those decisions should be. (4) Business works best by harnessing the self-interest of individuals to benefit the company as a whole. 
 Answer:"	(2) In some cases one's effectiveness in a particular role can be enhanced by a partial relinquishing of control.
392	"Context: Richard: Because it fails to meet the fundamental requirement of art—that it represent—abstract art will eventually be seen as an aberration. Jung-Su: Although artists, like musicians, may reject literal representation, makers of abstract art choose to represent the purely formal features of objects, which are discovered only when everyday perspectives are rejected. Thus, whatever others might come to say, abstract art is part of the artistic mainstream. 
 Question: Richard and Jung-Su disagree over whether 
 (0) makers of abstract art reject literal representation (1) the fundamental requirement of art is that it represent (2) musicians may reject literal representation (3) abstract art will be seen as an aberration (4) abstract art is representational 
 Answer:"	(4) abstract art is representational
393	"Context: A person who knowingly brings about misfortune should be blamed for it. However, in some cases a person who unwittingly brings about misfortune should not be blamed for it. For example, a person should never be blamed for unwittingly bringing about misfortune if the person could not reasonably have foreseen it. 
 Question: The principles above, if valid, most help to justify the reasoning in which one of the following? 
 (0) Although he would have realized it if he had thought about it, it did not occur to Riley that parking his car in the center lane of Main Street could lead to a traffic accident. So, if a traffic accident does result from Riley's parking his car in the center lane of Main Street, he should not be blamed for it. (1) Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it. (2) Gougon had no reason to think that serving the hollandaise sauce would make his guests ill, but he was concerned that it might. Thus, if the hollandaise sauce does make Gougon's guests ill, Gougon should be blamed for it. (3) When Dr. Fitzpatrick gave his patient the wrong medicine, he did not know that it would cause the patient to experience greatly increased blood pressure. So, if no one else knowingly did anything that contributed to the patient's increase in blood pressure, no one other than Dr. Fitzpatrick is to blame for it. (4) Any reasonable person could have foreseen that dropping a lit cigarette in dry leaves would start a fire. Thus, even if Kapp did not realize this, she is to blame for starting a fire on Rodriguez's farm since she dropped a lit cigarette in dry leaves there. 
 Answer:"	(1) Oblicek had no idea that suggesting to her brother that he take out a loan to expand his business was likely to cause the business to go bankrupt, nor could she have reasonably foreseen this. So, if the loan does cause her brother's business to go bankrupt, Oblicek should not be blamed for it.
394	"Context: Researcher: Research has shown that inhaling the scent of lavender has measurable physiological effects tending to reduce stress. It is known that intense stress can impair the immune system, making one more susceptible to illness. Therefore, it is likely that the incidence of illness among those who regularly inhale the scent of lavender is reduced by this practice. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption that the researcher's argument requires? 
 (0) Many, if not all, of the scents that have a tendency to reduce susceptibility to illness do so, at least in part, by reducing stress. (1) Some people who regularly inhale the scent of lavender would otherwise be under enough stress to impair their immune systems. (2) At least some people who use the scent of lavender to induce relaxation and reduce stress are no more susceptible to illness than average. (3) In anyone for whom the scent of lavender reduces susceptibility to illness, it does so primarily by reducing stress. (4) Reduced stress diminishes susceptibility to illness only for people who are under enough stress to impair their immune systems to at least some degree. 
 Answer:"	(1) Some people who regularly inhale the scent of lavender would otherwise be under enough stress to impair their immune systems.
395	"Context: Government statistics show that the real (adjusted for inflation) average income for families has risen over the last five years. Therefore, since this year the Andersen family's income is average for families, the family's real income must have increased over the last five years. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) ambiguously uses the term ""average"" in two different senses (1) fails to take into account inflation with respect to the Andersen family's income (2) overlooks the possibility that most families' incomes are below average (3) fails to consider the possibility that the Andersen family's real income was above average in the recent past (4) presumes, without providing justification, that the government makes no errors in gathering accurate estimates of family income 
 Answer:"	(3) fails to consider the possibility that the Andersen family's real income was above average in the recent past
396	"Context: Certain methods of creating high-quality counterfeit banknotes involve making accurate measurements of the images printed on genuine banknotes. Hence, if the production of high-quality counterfeit banknotes is to be prevented, some of the images on banknotes must be made very difficult or impossible to measure accurately. 
 Question: The argument's conclusion can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Today's copying technology is sophisticated enough to replicate almost any paper product with great precision. (1) Once the images printed on a banknote have been measured accurately, there is no further impediment to the banknote's being exactly replicated. (2) Governments have better printing technology available to them than counterfeiters do. (3) Few countries produce banknotes with images that are difficult for counterfeiters to measure accurately. (4) New designs in banknotes generally lead to decreases in the amount of counterfeit currency in circulation. 
 Answer:"	(1) Once the images printed on a banknote have been measured accurately, there is no further impediment to the banknote's being exactly replicated.
397	"Context: Armstrong: For the treatment of a particular disease, Dr. Sullivan argues for using nutritional supplements rather than the pharmaceuticals that most doctors prescribe. But this is in his self-interest since he is paid to endorse a line of nutritional supplements. Thus, we should not use nutritional supplements in treating the disease. 
 Question: Armstrong's argument is flawed in that it 
 (0) relies on two different meanings of the term ""supplement"" to draw a conclusion (1) relies solely on an appeal to an authority whose trustworthiness should not necessarily be taken for granted (2) appeals to people's emotions regarding the treatment of disease rather than to the efficacy of the two approaches to treatment (3) criticizes Dr. Sullivan's motives for holding a position rather than addressing the position itself (4) fails to justify its presumption that nutritional 
 Answer:"	(3) criticizes Dr. Sullivan's motives for holding a position rather than addressing the position itself
398	"Context: Economist: If the economy grows stronger, employment will increase, and hence more parents will need to find day care for their young children. Unfortunately, in a stronger economy many day-care workers will quit to take better-paying jobs in other fields. Therefore, a stronger economy is likely to make it much more difficult to find day care. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption the economist's argument requires? 
 (0) If the economy grows stronger, most of the new jobs that are created will be in fields that pay well. (1) If the economy grows stronger, the number of new day-care workers will not be significantly greater than the number of day-care workers who move to better-paying jobs in other fields. (2) If the economy grows stronger, the number of workers employed by day-care centers is likely to decrease. (3) The shortage of day care for children is unlikely to worsen unless employment increases and many day-care center employees quit to take better-paying jobs in other fields. (4) The total number of young children in day-care centers will decrease if the cost of day care increases significantly. 
 Answer:"	(1) If the economy grows stronger, the number of new day-care workers will not be significantly greater than the number of day-care workers who move to better-paying jobs in other fields.
399	"Context: Ostrich farming requires far less acreage than cattle ranching requires, and ostriches reproduce much faster than cattle. Starting out in cattle ranching requires a large herd of cows, one bull, and at least two acres per cow. By contrast, two pairs of yearling ostriches and one acre of similar land are enough to begin ostrich farming. The start-up costs for ostrich farming are greater, but it can eventually bring in as much as five times what cattle ranching does. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) Two pairs of yearling ostriches are more expensive than a herd of cows and a bull. (1) Cattle ranching is not a good source of income. (2) A cow consumes no more feed than an ostrich does. (3) The average ostrich farm generates almost five times as much profit as the average cattle ranch. (4) Ostrich farmers typically lose money during their first year. 
 Answer:"	(0) Two pairs of yearling ostriches are more expensive than a herd of cows and a bull.
400	"Context: For several centuries there have been hairless dogs in western Mexico and in coastal Peru. It is very unlikely that a trait as rare as hairlessness emerged on two separate occasions. Since the dogs have never existed in the wild, and the vast mountainous jungle separating these two regions would have made overland travel between them extremely difficult centuries ago, the dogs must have been transported from one of these regions to the other by boat, probably during trading expeditions. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption that the argument requires? 
 (0) Hairless dogs have never been found anywhere except in the regions of western Mexico and coastal Peru. (1) Most of the trade goods that came into western Mexico centuries ago were transported by boat. (2) Centuries ago, no one would have traveled between western Mexico and coastal Peru by boat except for the purposes of carrying out a trading expedition. (3) If hairless dogs were at one time transported between western Mexico and coastal Peru by boat, they were traded in exchange for other goods. (4) Centuries ago, it was easier to travel by boat between western Mexico and coastal Peru than to travel by an overland route. 
 Answer:"	(4) Centuries ago, it was easier to travel by boat between western Mexico and coastal Peru than to travel by an overland route.
401	"Context: Researchers working in Western Australia have discovered the oldest fragments of the Earth's early crust that have yet been identified: microdiamonds. These microscopic crystals measure only 50 microns across and were formed 4.2 billion years ago. This discovery sheds light on how long it took for the Earth's crust to form, since this date is only 300 million years after the formation of the Earth itself. 
 Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true? 
 (0) The Earth's crust took no longer than 300 million years to start to form. (1) The Earth's crust first formed in the area that is now Western Australia. (2) The Earth's crust took billions of years to form. (3) Microdiamonds were the first components of the Earth's crust to form. (4) All naturally occurring microdiamonds were formed at the time the Earth's crust was being formed. 
 Answer:"	(0) The Earth's crust took no longer than 300 million years to start to form.
402	"Context: The public square was an important tool of democracy in days past because it provided a forum for disparate citizens to discuss the important issues of the day. Today, a person with Internet access can discuss important issues with millions of people across the nation, allowing the Internet to play the role once played by the public square. Hence, we should ensure that Internet users have at least as much freedom of expression as did people speaking in the public square. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) People speaking in the public square of days past had complete freedom of expression. (1) All citizens have the same level of access to the Internet. (2) A public forum can lose effectiveness as a tool of democracy if participants cannot discuss issues freely. (3) The Internet is more often used to discuss important issues than to discuss frivolous issues. (4) Other than the Internet, no other public forum today is an important tool of democracy. 
 Answer:"	(2) A public forum can lose effectiveness as a tool of democracy if participants cannot discuss issues freely.
403	"Context: At a large elementary school researchers studied a small group of children who successfully completed an experimental program in which they learned to play chess. The study found that most of the children who completed the program soon showed a significant increase in achievement levels in all of their schoolwork. Thus, it is likely that the reasoning power and spatial intuition exercised in chess-playing also contribute to achievement in many other areas of intellectual activity. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most tends to undermine the argument? 
 (0) Some students who did not participate in the chess program had learned to play chess at home. (1) Those children who began the program but who did not successfully complete it had lower preprogram levels of achievement than did those who eventually did successfully complete the program. (2) Many of the children who completed the program subsequently sought membership on a school chess team that required a high grade average for membership. (3) Some students who did not participate in the chess program participated instead in after-school study sessions that helped them reach much higher levels of achievement in the year after they attended the sessions. (4) At least some of the students who did not successfully complete the program were nevertheless more talented chess players than some of the students who did complete the program. 
 Answer:"	(2) Many of the children who completed the program subsequently sought membership on a school chess team that required a high grade average for membership.
404	"Context: On Wednesdays, Kate usually buys some guava juice. But the only place she can buy guava juice is the local health food store. It follows that she must sometimes shop at the local health food store on Wednesdays. 
 Question: The argument above is most similar in its pattern of reasoning to which one of the following arguments? 
 (0) Only teachers at the Culinary Institute are allowed to use the institute's main kitchen. Most dinners at Cafe Delice are prepared in that kitchen. So at least some dinners at Cafe Delice must be prepared by Culinary Institute teachers. (1) All dinners at Cafe Delice are prepared in the main kitchen of the Culinary Institute. But only teachers at the institute are allowed to use that kitchen. So the dinners at Cafe Delice must be prepared by Culinary Institute teachers. (2) Most dinners at Cafe Delice are prepared in the main kitchen of the Culinary Institute. All the teachers at the institute are allowed to use that kitchen. So at least some dinners at Cafe Delice must be prepared by Culinary Institute teachers. (3) Most teachers at the Culinary Institute are allowed to use the institute's main kitchen. Dinners at Cafe Delice are only prepared in that kitchen. So dinners at Cafe Delice must sometimes be prepared by Culinary Institute teachers. (4) Only teachers at the Culinary Institute are allowed to use the main kitchen of the institute. Dinners at Cafe Delice are usually prepared by Culinary Institute teachers. So dinners at Cafe Delice must sometimes be prepared in the main kitchen of the Culinary Institute. 
 Answer:"	(0) Only teachers at the Culinary Institute are allowed to use the institute's main kitchen. Most dinners at Cafe Delice are prepared in that kitchen. So at least some dinners at Cafe Delice must be prepared by Culinary Institute teachers.
405	"Context: Editor: The city's previous recycling program, which featured pickup of recyclables every other week, was too costly. The city claims that its new program, which features weekly pickup, will be more cost effective, since the greater the volume of recyclables collected per year, the more revenue the city gains from selling the recyclables. But this is absurd. People will put out the same volume of recyclables overall; it will just be spread out over a greater number of pickups. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the editor's argument? 
 (0) The cost of collecting and disposing of general trash has been less than the cost of collecting and disposing of recyclables, and this is still likely to be the case under the new recycling program. (1) Even if the volume of collected recyclables increases, that increase might not be enough to make the recycling program cost effective. (2) Because the volume of recyclables people accumulate during a week is less than what they accumulate during two weeks, the city expects a recyclables pickup to take less time under the new program. (3) A weekly schedule for recyclables pickup is substantially easier for people to follow and adhere to than is a schedule of pickups every other week. (4) Because of the increase in the number of pickups under the new program, the amount charged by the contractor that collects the city's recyclables will increase significantly. 
 Answer:"	(3) A weekly schedule for recyclables pickup is substantially easier for people to follow and adhere to than is a schedule of pickups every other week.
406	"Context: Professor: Many introductory undergraduate science courses are intended to be ""proving grounds,"" that is, they are designed to be so demanding that only those students most committed to being science majors will receive passing grades in these courses. However, studies show that some of the students in these very demanding introductory courses who are least enthusiastic about science receive passing grades in these courses. Hence, designing introductory science courses to serve as proving grounds has not served its intended purpose. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption that the professor's argument requires? 
 (0) If some of the students who are most enthusiastic about science do not receive passing grades in introductory science courses, then designing these courses to serve as proving grounds has been unsuccessful. (1) Science departments need a way to ensure that only those students most committed to being science majors will receive passing grades in introductory science courses. (2) Some of the students in the very demanding introductory science courses who are most enthusiastic about science do not receive passing grades in those courses. (3) None of the students in the very demanding introductory science courses who are least enthusiastic about science are among the students most committed to being science majors. (4) Introductory science courses should not continue to be designed to serve as proving grounds if doing so has not served its intended purpose. 
 Answer:"	(3) None of the students in the very demanding introductory science courses who are least enthusiastic about science are among the students most committed to being science majors.
407	"Context: Many bird and reptile species use hissing as a threat device against potential predators. The way these species produce hissing sounds is similar enough that it is likely that this behavior developed in an early common ancestor. At the time this common ancestor would have lived, however, none of its potential predators would have yet acquired the anatomy necessary to hear hissing sounds. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above? 
 (0) Like its potential predators, the common ancestor of bird and reptile species would have lacked the anatomy necessary to hear hissing sounds. (1) The common ancestor of bird and reptile species would probably have employed multiple threat devices against potential predators. (2) The production of a hissing sound would have increased the apparent body size of the common ancestor of bird and reptile species. (3) The use of hissing as a threat device would have been less energetically costly than other threat behaviors available to the common ancestor of bird and reptile species. (4) Unlike most modern bird and reptile species, the common ancestor of these species would have had few predators. 
 Answer:"	(2) The production of a hissing sound would have increased the apparent body size of the common ancestor of bird and reptile species.
408	"Context: Grecia: The survey that we are conducting needs to track employment status by age, so respondents should be asked to indicate their age. Hidalgo: We don't need results that provide employment status figures for every single age. So we should instead ask respondents merely to identify the age range that they fall into. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most justifies Hidalgo's stance? 
 (0) Surveys gathering information for a specific purpose should not collect more detailed personal information than is necessary to achieve the purpose. (1) Survey respondents should not be asked a particular question if they are unlikely to answer accurately. (2) Sensitive personal information should be gathered only if a secure means of storing that information is available. (3) Surveys should be allowed to gather any information that might be needed to meet their purposes. (4) Surveys should gather detailed personal information only if survey respondents are first told about how that information will be used. 
 Answer:"	(0) Surveys gathering information for a specific purpose should not collect more detailed personal information than is necessary to achieve the purpose.
409	"Context: In 1893, an excavation led by Wilhelm Dorpfeld uncovered an ancient city he believed to be Troy, the site of the war described in Homer's epic poem the Iliad. But that belief cannot be correct. In the Iliad, the Trojan War lasted ten years, but a city as small as the one uncovered by Dorpfeld's team could not have withstood a siege lasting ten years. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) In 1 893, scholars knew of no other ancient city that could have been Troy. (1) The Iliad does not provide any clues about the specific location of Troy. (2) Dorpfeld's team found no evidence in the city they excavated that a siege had occurred there. (3) The city excavated by Dorpfeld's team had many features that scholars of the time believed Troy had. (4) The Iliad accurately represents the duration of the Trojan War 
 Answer:"	(4) The Iliad accurately represents the duration of the Trojan War
410	"Context: Flynn: Allowing people to collect large damage awards when they successfully sue corporations that produce dangerous products clearly benefits consumers, since the possibility of large awards gives corporations a strong incentive to reduce safety risks associated with their products. Garcia: Without sensible limits, damage awards can be so high that corporations are destroyed. As a result, employees lose their jobs and the productivity of the corporation is lost. This harms the economy and thus harms consumers. 
 Question: Garcia responds to Flynn's argument by 
 (0) arguing that the policy supported in Flynn's argument could have undesirable consequences (1) providing evidence that undermines one of the premises of Flynn's argument (2) comparing Flynn's argument to an obviously flawed argument that has the same logical structure (3) contending that Flynn's argument could be used to support a policy that is inconsistent with the policy that Flynn advocates (4) providing an alternative explanation for a situation described in Flynn's argument 
 Answer:"	(0) arguing that the policy supported in Flynn's argument could have undesirable consequences
411	"Context: Monroe: Our organization's project has been a failure. Our stated goal was to reduce as much as possible the number of homes in the community that lack electricity. Now, at the project's conclusion, approximately 2,000 homes are still without electricity. Wilkerson: But before the project began, over 5,000 homes in the community had no electricity. Surely bringing electricity to around 3,000 homes counts as a success for the project. 
 Question: Monroe and Wilkerson disagree over the truth of which one of the following? 
 (0) Approximately 2,000 homes in the community are still without electricity. (1) Before the organization's project began, over 5,000 homes in the community had no electricity. (2) The organization's project must be considered a failure if any home in the community has no electricity. (3) The stated goal of the project was to reduce as much as possible the number of homes in the community that lack electricity. (4) Leaving approximately 2,000 homes in the community without electricity at the conclusion of the project counts as a failure for the project. 
 Answer:"	(4) Leaving approximately 2,000 homes in the community without electricity at the conclusion of the project counts as a failure for the project.
412	"Context: Researchers asked 1 00 fifty-year-olds and 1 00 twenty-year-olds whether they gave blood. Because nearly twice as many fifty-year-olds as twenty-year-olds reported that they sometimes gave blood, the researchers concluded that, on average, fifty-year-olds are more altruistic than twenty-year-olds. But there is reason for skepticism. Many people hesitate to admit that their behavior does not conform to societal expectations. 
 Question: The reasoning above calls into question a conclusion drawn from statistical data by 
 (0) showing that the data are based on an unrepresentative sample (1) offering an alternative explanation of some of the data (2) showing that one cannot directly observe altruism (3) criticizing the motives of the researchers (4) offering a specific counterexample 
 Answer:"	(1) offering an alternative explanation of some of the data
413	"Context: Mario: I see that the only rug store in Glendale has gone out of business. Evidently there's little demand for rugs in Glendale. So if you're planning to open a new business there, rugs would be one product to avoid. Renate: It's true that the store is gone, but its closing had little to do with the product it sold. All this means is that the 
 Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Mario and Renate disagree over whether 
 (0) the rug store in Glendale sold rugs of inferior quality (1) it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale (2) it is possible to determine the market for rugs in Glendale (3) any other stores have gone out of business in Glendale (4) rug stores can close because of insufficient demand for rugs 
 Answer:"	(1) it is a good idea to open a rug store in Glendale
414	"Context: Editorialist: The city council is considering increasing the amount of air traffic allowed at the airport beyond its original design capacity. Several council members say that this increase would not decrease safety as it would be accompanied by the purchase of the latest safety technology. But in fact it would decrease safety. Numerous studies conducted 30 years ago show that safety was reduced at every airport where the permitted level of traffic was increased beyond the airport's original design capacity, even when those airports made use of the latest safety technology. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the editorialist's argument? 
 (0) The argument draws a conclusion on the basis of a general statement that has in tum been inferred from a very limited number of particular instances. (1) The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is. (2) The argument fails to consider the possibility that the city council members who support the increase are aware of the studies that were conducted 30 years ago. (3) The argument confuses an absence of evidence for the claim that the airport can.safely permit air traffic in excess of its original design capacity with the existence of evidence against this claim. (4) The argument fails to consider that a slight increase in safety risks might be acceptable if it yields overriding benefits of another kind. 
 Answer:"	(1) The argument fails to consider the possibility that whether an airport can allow more air traffic than it was originally designed for without reducing safety depends largely on what the latest technology is.
415	"Context: Philosopher: It has been argued that because particular moral codes differ between cultures, morality must be entirely a product of culture and cannot be grounded in some universal human nature. This argument is flawed. Research suggests that certain moral attitudes, such as disapproval of unfairness and cruelty, are shared across all cultures. And just as certain universal tastes like sweetness and saltiness can, in different cultural contexts, provide the basis for many different 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the argument? 
 (0) moral codes tend to be based in the specific contexts in which they arise (1) the moral codes of most cultures resemble each other in many respects (2) a variety of moral codes can be based in shared moral attitudes (3) it is possible to understand the basis of the moral codes of different cultures (4) moral attitudes can be adapted to suit the moral codes of many different cultures 
 Answer:"	(2) a variety of moral codes can be based in shared moral attitudes
416	"Context: In a recent field study of prairie plants, the more plant species a prairie plot had, the more vigorously the plants grew and the better the soil retained nutrients. Thus, having more plant species improves a prairie's ability to support plant life. 
 Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) infers of two correlated.phenomena, X and Y, that X causes Y without considering whether Y causes X (1) fails to describe the mechanism by which productivity is supposedly increased (2) takes for granted that the characteristics of one prairie plot could reveal something about the characteristics of other prairie plots (3) bases a general conclusion on data that is likely to be unrepresentative (4) takes an increase in number to indicate an increase in proportion 
 Answer:"	(0) infers of two correlated.phenomena, X and Y, that X causes Y without considering whether Y causes X
417	"Context: Anthropologist: In an experiment, two groups of undergraduates were taught how to create one of the types of stone tools that the Neanderthals made in prehistoric times. One group was taught using both demonstrations and elaborate verbal explanations, whereas the other group learned by silent example alone. The two groups showed a significant difference neither in the speed with which they acquired the toolmaking skills nor in the level of proficiency they reached. This shows that Neanderthals could just as well have created their sophisticated tools even if they had no language. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the anthropologist's argument? 
 (0) Apart from the sophistication of their stone tools, there is a great deal of evidence suggesting that Neanderthals possessed some form of language. (1) The students who were taught with verbal explanations were allowed to discuss the toolmaking techniques among themselves, whereas the students who learned by silent example were not. (2) The tools that the undergraduate's were taught to make were much simpler and easier to make than most types of tools created by Neanderthals. (3) The instructor Who taught the .group of students who learned by, silent example alone was much less proficient at making the stone tools than was the instructor who taught the other group of students. (4) The tools created by Neanderthals were much less sophisticated than the tools created by anatomically modem humans who almost certainly possessed language and lived at the same time as the Neanderthals. 
 Answer:"	(2) The tools that the undergraduate's were taught to make were much simpler and easier to make than most types of tools created by Neanderthals.
418	"Context: Modest amounts of exercise can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. One should exercise most days of the week, but one need only do the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking on those days to obtain cardiovascular health benefits. More vigorous exercise is more effective, but a strenuous workout is not absolutely necessary. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the statements above? 
 (0) Having a strenuous workout most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health. (1) Doing the equivalent of an hour of brisk walking two or three times a week generally produces dramatic improvements in cardiovascular health. (2) It is possible to obtain at least as great an improvement in cardiovascular health from doing the equivalent of half an hour of brisk walking most days of the week as from having a strenuous workout most days of the week. (3) Aside from exercise, there is no way of improving one's cardiovascular health. (4) To obtain a dramatic improvement in one's cardiovascular health, one must exercise strenuously at least occasionally. 
 Answer:"	(0) Having a strenuous workout most days of the week can produce a dramatic improvement in cardiovascular health.
419	"Context: Sartore is a better movie reviewer than Kelly. A movie review should help readers determine whether or not they are apt to enjoy the movie, and a person who is likely to enjoy a particular movie is much more likely to realize this by reading a review by Sartore than a review by Kelly: even though Sartore is more likely to give a movie an unfavorable review than a favorable one. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) Sartore has technical knowledge of film, whereas Kelly is merely a fan. (1) Most of Kelly's movie reviews are unfavorable to the movie being reviewed. (2) One who is apt not to enjoy a particular movie is more likely to realize this by reading a review by Sartore than a review by Kelly. (3) Reading a movie review by Sartore will usually help one to enjoy the .movie more than one otherwise would have. (4) Most of the movies that Sartore reviews are also reviewed by Kelly. 
 Answer:"	(2) One who is apt not to enjoy a particular movie is more likely to realize this by reading a review by Sartore than a review by Kelly.
420	"Context: Specially bred aquarium fish with brilliant coloration and unusual body shapes may be popular with connoisseurs, but they are inferior to ordinary fish. Hampered by their elaborate tails or strangely shaped fins, the specially bred fish cannot reach food as quickly as can the ordinary fish that compete with them for food, and so they are often underfed. Also, they do not breed true; most offspring of the specially bred fish lack the elaborate tails and brilliant coloration of their parents. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) Specially bred aquarium fish must receive special care if they are to survive. (1) Connoisseurs are not interested in dull-colored, simply shaped fish. (2) Most specially bred aquarium fish are purchased by connoisseurs. (3) Ordinary fish tend not to have elaborate tails or strangely shaped fins. (4) Strangely shaped fins and elaborate tails interfere with a fish's ability to reproduce. 
 Answer:"	(3) Ordinary fish tend not to have elaborate tails or strangely shaped fins.
421	"Context: Ethicist: The general principle-if one ought to do something then one can do it-does not always hold true. This may be seen by considering an example. Suppose, someone promises to meet a friend at a certain time, but-because of an unforeseen traffic jam-it is impossible to do so. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the ethicist's argument? 
 (0) If a person failed to do something she or he ought to have done, then that person failed to do something that.she or he promised to do. (1) Only an event like an unforeseen.traffic jam could excuse a person from the obligation to keep a promise. (2) If there is something that a.person ought not do, then it is something that that person is capable of not doing. (3) The obligation created by a promise is not relieved by the fact that the promise cannot be kept. (4) If an event like an unforeseen traffic jam interferes with someone's keeping a promise, then that person should not have made the promise to begin with. 
 Answer:"	(3) The obligation created by a promise is not relieved by the fact that the promise cannot be kept.
422	"Context: The production of leather and fur for clothing is labor intensive, which means that these materials have tended to be expensive. But as fashion has moved away from these materials, their prices have dropped, while prices of some materials that require less labor in their production and are more fashionable have risen. 
 Question: The situation described above conforms most closely to which one of the following generalizations? 
 (0) The price of any manufactured good depends more on how fashionable that good is than on the materials it is made from. (1) It is more important for the materials used in the manufacture of clothing to be fashionable than it is for them to be practical. (2) Materials that require relatively little labor in their production tend to be fashionable. (3) The appearance of a manufactured good is the only thing that determines whether it is fashionable. (4) Cultural trends tend to be an important determinant of the prices of materials used in manufacturing. 
 Answer:"	(4) Cultural trends tend to be an important determinant of the prices of materials used in manufacturing.
423	"Context: In most of this forest, the expected outbreak: of tree-eating tussock moths should ,not be countered. After all, the moth is beneficial where suppression of forest fires, for example, has left the forest unnaturally crowded with immature trees, and 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument is most strongly supported if which one of the following completes the passage? 
 (0) more than half of the forest is unnaturally crowded with immature trees (1) mature trees are usually the first to be eaten by tussock moths (2) usually a higher proportion of mature trees than of immature ones are destroyed in forest fires (3) the expected outbreak: of tussock moths will almost certainly occur if no attempt is made to counter it (4) there are no completely effective countermeasures against the moth 
 Answer:"	(0) more than half of the forest is unnaturally crowded with immature trees
424	"Context: In order to relieve traffic congestion, the city of Gastner built a new highway linking several of the city's suburbs to the downtown area. However, the average commute time for workers in downtown Gastner increased after the new highway opened. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps, to explain the increase in average commute time? 
 (0) Most people who work in the downtown area of Gastner commute from one of the city's suburbs. (1) The location of the new highway is most convenient for people who commute to and from Gastner's largest suburbs. (2) Shortly after the new highway was opened, several suburban roads connecting to the new highway were upgraded with new stoplights. (3) At the same time the new highway was being built,. road repair work was being done on important streets leading to downtown Gastner. (4) In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened. 
 Answer:"	(4) In Gastner's downtown area, traffic on the roads near the new highway become more congested after the new highway was opened.
425	"Context: Office worker: I have two equally important projects that remain undone. The first one is late already, and if devote time to finishing it, then I won't have time to finish the second one before its deadline. Admittedly, there's no guarantee that I can finish the second project on time even if I devote all of my time to it, but I should nonetheless devote all of my time to the second one. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the office worker's reasoning? 
 (0) It is better to focus one's time on a single project than to split one's time between two projects. (1) It is better to finish one of two projects than to risk failing to finish both projects. (2) It is better to first finish those projects that must be done than to interrupt them with projects that are merely optional. (3) It is better not to worry about having failed to finish a project on time than to allow such worry to interfere with finishing a competing project on time. (4) It is better to attempt to finish a project on time than to attempt to finish a late project that does not have higher priority. 
 Answer:"	(4) It is better to attempt to finish a project on time than to attempt to finish a late project that does not have higher priority.
426	"Context: Science teacher: An abstract knowledge of science is very seldom useful for the decisions that adults typically make in their daily lives. But the skills taught in secondary. school should be useful for making such decisions. Therefore, secondary school science courses should teach students to evaluate science-based arguments regarding practical issues, such as health and public policy, instead of or perhaps in addition to teaching more abstract aspects of science. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption the science teacher's argument requires? 
 (0) Secondary schools should teach only those skills that are the most useful for the decisions that adults typically make in their daily lives. (1) Teaching secondary, school students the more abstract aspects of science is at least as important as teaching them to evaluate science based arguments regarding practical issues. (2) Adults who have an abstract knowledge of science are no better at evaluating science-based arguments regarding practical issues than are adults who have no knowledge of science at all. (3) No secondary school science courses currently teach students how to evaluate science-based arguments regarding practical issues. (4) The ability to evaluate science-based arguments regarding practical issues is sometimes useful in making the decisions that adults typically make in their daily lives. 
 Answer:"	(4) The ability to evaluate science-based arguments regarding practical issues is sometimes useful in making the decisions that adults typically make in their daily lives.
427	"Context: Lyle: Admittedly, modernizing the language of premodern plays lessens their aesthetic quality, but such modernizing remains valuable for teaching history, since it makes the plays accessible to students who would otherwise never enjoy them. Carl: But such modernizing prevents students from understanding fully what the plays said to premodern audiences. Thus, modernizing plays is of no use for teaching history, because students cannot gain deep knowledge of the past from modernized plays. 
 Question: Which one of ,the following most accurately expresses a point of disagreement between Lyle and Carl? 
 (0) whether modernizing the language of premodern plays results in plays that have different pedagogical value than the originals (1) whether the loss in aesthetic quality that results from modernizing the language of premodern plays lessens the plays usefulness for teaching history (2) whether the highest form of aesthetic enjoyment of premodern plays comes from seeing them as they were originally performed (3) whether increasing the accessibility of premodern plays through modernizing their language is valuable for teaching history (4) whether using plays with modernized language to teach history requires that there be some loss in the aesthetic quality of the plays 
 Answer:"	(3) whether increasing the accessibility of premodern plays through modernizing their language is valuable for teaching history
428	"Context: Most kinds of soil contain clay, and virtually every kind of soil contains either sand or organic material, or both. Therefore, there must be some kinds of soil that contain both clay and sand and some that contain both clay and organic material. 
 Question: The pattern of flawed reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most parallel to that in the argument above? 
 (0) Most pharmacies sell cosmetics. Vrrtually every pharmacy sells shampoo or toothpaste, or both. Therefore, if there are pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste, there must also be some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo. (1) Undoubtedly, most pharmacies sell cosmetics for almost all pharmacies sell either shampoo or toothpaste, or both, and there are some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and shampoo and some that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste. (2) Most pharmacies sell cosmetics. Nearly all pharmacies sell shampoo or toothpaste, or both. Therefore, unless there are some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste, there must be some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo. (3) Virtually every pharmacy that sells shampoo also sells toothpaste. Most pharmacies sell cosmetics. Therefore, there must be some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste and some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo (4) Nearly all pharmacies sell either shampoo or toothpaste, or both. Therefore, since most pharmacies sell cosmetics, there must be some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste and some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo. 
 Answer:"	(4) Nearly all pharmacies sell either shampoo or toothpaste, or both. Therefore, since most pharmacies sell cosmetics, there must be some pharmacies that sell both cosmetics and toothpaste and some that sell both cosmetics and shampoo.
429	"Context: In 2005, an environmental group conducted a study measuring the levels of toxic—chemicals in the bodies of eleven volunteers. Scientifically valid inferences could not be drawn from the study because of the small sample size, but the results were interesting nonetheless. Among the subjects tested, younger subjects showed much lower levels of PCBs-toxic chemicals that were banned in the 1970s. This proves that the regulation banning PCBs was effective in reducing human exposure to those chemicals. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) takes an inconsistent stance regarding the status of the inferences that can be drawn from the study (1) overlooks the possibility that two or more chemicals produce the same effects (2) concludes that a generalization has been proven true merely on the grounds that it has not been proven false (3) takes something to be the cause of a reduction when it could have been an effect of that reduction (4) does not consider the possibility that PCBs have detrimental effects on human health several years after exposure 
 Answer:"	(0) takes an inconsistent stance regarding the status of the inferences that can be drawn from the study
430	"Context: A spy fails by being caught, and it is normally only through being caught that spies reveal their methods. The successful spy is never caught. So the available data are skewed: One can learn a lot about what makes a spy fail but very little about what makes a spy succeed 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the argument above? 
 (0) of those who participated in the marathon,some succeeded and others failed. But those who did not participate at all neither succeeded nor failed, since both success and failure require participation. (1) People who are aware of their motives can articulate them. But unconscious motives are usually impossible to acknowledge. So people are more likely to hear about other people's conscious motives than their unconscious ones. (2) It is unclear whether the company's venture succeeded, because the criteria for its success are undefined, But if the venture had had a measurable goal, then it would have been possible to judge its success. (3) A teacher is someone who teaches. In addition,there are people who teach but are not called teachers. So while the number of those called teachers is large, the number of those who teach is even larger. (4) Because someone intervened in the conflict, the effects of that intervention can be discerned. But since no one can investigate what does not happen, it is impossible to discern that would have happened had someone not intervened. 
 Answer:"	(1) People who are aware of their motives can articulate them. But unconscious motives are usually impossible to acknowledge. So people are more likely to hear about other people's conscious motives than their unconscious ones.
431	"Context: Families with underage children make up much of the ' population, but because only adults can vote, lawmakers in democracies pay too little attention to the interests of these families. To remedy this, parents should be given additional votes to cast on behalf of their underage children. Families with underage children would thus receive fair representation. 
 Question: The argument requires assuming which one of the following principles? 
 (0) The amount of attention that lawmakers give to a group's interests should be directly proportional to the number of voters in that group. (1) Parenis should not be given responsibility for making a decision on their child's behalf unless their child is not mature enough to decide wisely. (2) The parents of underage children should always consider the best interests of their children when they vote. (3) It is not fair for lawmakers to favor the interests of people who have the vote over the interests of people who do not have the vote. (4) A group of people can be fairly represented in a democracy even if some members of that group can vote on behalf of others in that group. 
 Answer:"	(4) A group of people can be fairly represented in a democracy even if some members of that group can vote on behalf of others in that group.
432	"Context: Critic: The Gazette-Standard newspaper recently increased its editorial staff to avoid factual errors. But this clearly is not working. Compared to its biggest competitor, the Gazette-Standard currently runs significantly more corrections acknowledging factual errors. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the critic's argument? 
 (0) The Gazette-Standard pays its editorial staff lower salaries than its biggest competitor pays its editorial staff. (1) The Gazette-Standard has been in business considerably longer than has its biggest competitor. (2) The Gazette-Standard more actively follows up reader complaints about errors in the paper than does its biggest competitor. (3) The Gazette-Standard's articles are each checked by more editors than are the articles of its biggest competitor. (4) The increase in the Gazette-Standard's editorial staff has been offset by a decrease in the reporting staff at the newspaper. 
 Answer:"	(2) The Gazette-Standard more actively follows up reader complaints about errors in the paper than does its biggest competitor.
433	"Context: A nonprofit organization concerned with a social issue sent out a fund-raising letter to 5,000 people. The letter was accompanied by a survey soliciting recipients opinions. Of the 300 respondents, 283 indicated in the survey that they agreed with the organization's position on the social issue. This suggests that most of the 5,000 people to whom the letter was sent agreed with that position. 
 Question: The argument is most vulnerable to criticism on which one of the following grounds? 
 (0) It draws a conclusion about a population from observations of a subgroup that is quite likely to be unrepresentative of that population in certain relevant respects. (1) It takes for granted that most individuals do not vary significantly in the opinions they would express on a given issue if surveyed regarding that issue on different occasions. (2) It relies on the accuracy of a survey made under conditions in which it is probable that most of the responses to that survey did not correctly reflect the opinions of the respondents. (3) It uses evidence about an opinion held by the majority of a population in an attempt to justify a conclusion regarding the opinion of a small part of that population. (4) It takes for granted that the fund-raising letter had some influence on the opinions of most of the people who received it. 
 Answer:"	(0) It draws a conclusion about a population from observations of a subgroup that is quite likely to be unrepresentative of that population in certain relevant respects.
434	"Context: An unstable climate was probably a major cause of the fall of the Roman empire. Tree-ring analysis shows that Europe's climate underwent extreme fluctuations between 250 A.D. and 550 A.D., a period that encompasses Rome's decline and fall. This highly variable climate surely hurt food production, which made the empire harder to rule and defend. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) Political failures within the Roman empire during its last years led to conflicts that hampered agricultural production. (1) The areas of the Roman empire that had the greatest climatic instability between 250 A.D. and 550 A.D. did not experience unusual levels of unrest during that period. (2) Poor farming practices led to depleted soil in many parts of Europe during the last years of the Roman empire. (3) During periods when the Roman empire was thriving, Europe consistently experienced weather that was favorable for agriculture. (4) Total food production in Europe was likely greater in the years around 550 A.D. than in the years around 250 A.D. 
 Answer:"	(3) During periods when the Roman empire was thriving, Europe consistently experienced weather that was favorable for agriculture.
435	"Context: Sales manager: Having spent my entire career in sales, most of that time as a sales manager for a large computer company, I know that natural superstar salespeople are rare. But many salespeople can perform like superstars if they have a good manager. Therefore, companies should ____ 
 Question: Which one of the following most logically completes the sales manager's argument? 
 (0) devote more effort to training than to evaluating salespeople (1) devote more effort to finding good managers than to finding natural superstar salespeople (2) keep to a minimum the number of salespeople for which a manager is responsible (3) promote more natural superstar salespeople to management positions (4) reward superstar performance more than superstar talent 
 Answer:"	(1) devote more effort to finding good managers than to finding natural superstar salespeople
436	"Context: According to economists, people's tendency to purchase a given commodity is inversely proportional to its price. When new techniques produced cheaper steel, more steel was purchased. Nevertheless, once machine-produced lace became available, at much lower prices than the handcrafted variety, lace no longer served to advertise its wearers' wealth and the lace market collapsed. Obviously, then, there are exceptions to the economists' general rule. 
 Question: The claim that more steel was purchased when it could be manufactured more cheaply plays which one of the following roles in the argument? 
 (0) It is described as inadequate evidence for the falsity of the argument's conclusion. (1) It is described as an exception to a generalization for which the argument offers evidence. (2) It is used to illustrate the generalization that,according to the argument, does not hold in all cases. (3) It is the evidence that, according to the argument,led economists to embrace a false hypothesis. (4) It is cited as one of several reasons for modifying a general assumption made by economists. 
 Answer:"	(2) It is used to illustrate the generalization that,according to the argument, does not hold in all cases.
437	"Context: Resident: Data indicates that 30 percent of the houses in our town have inadequate site drainage and 30 percent have structural defects that could make them unsafe. Hence, at least 60 percent of our town's houses have some kind of problem that threatens their integrity. 
 Question: The reasoning in the resident's argument is flawed in that the argument overlooks the possibility that 
 (0) the town has a relatively small number of houses (1) inadequate site drainage can make a house unsafe (2) structural defects are often easier to fix than inadequate site drainage (3) many houses in the town have neither inadequate site drainage nor structural defects that could make them unsafe (4) some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage 
 Answer:"	(4) some of the houses that have structure defects that could make them unsafe also have inadequate site drainage
438	"Context: The decisions that one makes can profoundly affect one's life years later. So one should not regret the missed opportunities of youth, for had one decided instead to seize one of these opportunities, one would not have some of the close personal relationships one currently has. And everyone deeply cherishes their close personal relationships. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in the argument? 
 (0) One should not regret making a decision unless a different decision would have resulted in one having a greater number of close personal relationships. (1) One should not regret making a decision if it helped to bring about something that one cherishes. (2) One should not regret making a decision that had little effect on one's life. (3) People who regret the missed opportunities of youth should cherish their close personal relationships more deeply. (4) People with few close personal relationships should cherish the ones they have. 
 Answer:"	(1) One should not regret making a decision if it helped to bring about something that one cherishes.
439	"Context: The Kuna, a people native to several Panamanian islands, generally have a low incidence of high blood pressure. But Kuna who have moved to the Panamanian mainland do not have a low incidence of high blood pressure. Kuna who live on the islands, unlike those who live on the mainland, typically drink several cups of cocoa a day. This cocoa is minimally processed and thus high in flavonoids. 
 Question: Of the following, which one is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) Foods high in flavonoids are not readily available on the Panamanian mainland. (1) Kuna who live on the islands drink cocoa because they believe that it is beneficial to their health. (2) The Kuna have a genetic predisposition to low blood pressure. (3) Kuna who live on the Panamanian mainland generally have higher blood pressure than other people who live on the mainland. (4) Drinking several cups of flavonoid-rich cocoa per day tends to prevent high blood pressure. 
 Answer:"	(4) Drinking several cups of flavonoid-rich cocoa per day tends to prevent high blood pressure.
440	"Context: Numerous studies suggest that when scientific evidence is presented in a trial, jurors regard that evidence as more credible than they would if they had encountered the same evidence outside of the courtroom context. Legal theorists have hypothesized that this effect is primarily due to the fact that judges prescreen scientific evidence and allow only credible scientific evidence to be presented in the courtroom. 
 Question: Which one of the following would be most useful to know in order to evaluate the legal theorists hypothesis? 
 (0) whether jurors typically know that judges have appraised the scientific evidence presented at trial (1) whether jurors reactions to scientific evidence presented at trial are influenced by other members of the jury (2) how jurors determine the credibility of an expert witness who is presenting scientific evidence in a trial (3) whether jurors typically draw upon their own scientific knowledge when weighing scientific evidence presented at trial (4) how jurors respond to situations in which different expert witnesses give conflicting assessments of scientific evidence 
 Answer:"	(0) whether jurors typically know that judges have appraised the scientific evidence presented at trial
441	"Context: Organized word-of-mouth marketing campaigns are driven by product boosters who extol a product to friends and acquaintances. A study found that these campaigns are more successful when the product booster openly admits to being part of an organized marketing campaign. This is surprising because one of the purported advantages of word-of-mouth campaigns is that consumers take a less skeptical stance toward word-of-mouth messages than toward mass-media advertisements. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the surprising finding? 
 (0) Word-of-mouth marketing campaigns are generally used for specialty products that are not well suited to being marketed through mass-media advertisements. (1) Those who tend to be the most receptive to mass-media marketing campaigns are also the least likely to be influenced by knowledge of a product booster's affiliation. (2) Most people who work as product boosters in word-of-mouth marketing campaigns have themselves been recruited through a word-of-mouth process. (3) Most word-of-mouth marketing campaigns cost far less than marketing campaigns that rely on mass-media advertisements. (4) When a word-of-mouth product booster admits his or her affiliation, it fosters a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of the marketed product. 
 Answer:"	(4) When a word-of-mouth product booster admits his or her affiliation, it fosters a more relaxed and in-depth discussion of the marketed product.
442	"Context: Consultant: If Whalley sticks with her current platform in the upcoming election, then she will lose to her opponent by a few percentage points among voters under 50, while beating him by a bigger percentage among voters 50 and over. Therefore, sticking with her current platform will allow her to win the election. 
 Question: The consultant's conclusion follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) There is no change Whalley could make to her platform that would win over more voters under 50 than it would lose voters 50 and over. (1) The issues that most concern voters under 50 are different from those that most concern voters 50 and over.

443	"Context: From 1880 to 2000 Britain's economy grew fivefold, but emissions of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas, were the same on a per capita basis in Britain in 2000 as they were in 1880. 
 Question: The claims made above are incompatible with which one of the following generalizations? 
 (0) A decrease in per capita emissions of carbon dioxide never occurs during a period of economic growth. (1) Countries whose economies are growing slowly or not at all usually cannot afford to enact laws restricting carbon dioxide emissions. (2) Economic growth initially leads to increased per capita emissions of greenhouse gases, but eventually new technologies are developed that tend to reduce these emissions. (3) As the world's population grows, emissions of greenhouse gases will increase proportionately. (4) Economic growth always increases household income and consumption, which inevitably increases per capita emissions of carbon dioxide. 
 Answer:"	(4) Economic growth always increases household income and consumption, which inevitably increases per capita emissions of carbon dioxide.
444	"Context: Advertisement: When you need a will, consulting a lawyer is much more expensive than using do-it-yourself software. And you get a valid will either way. However, when you're ill, you aren't satisfied with simply getting some valid prescription or other; what you pay your doctor for is the doctor's expert advice concerning your particular illness. Similarly, what you pay a lawyer for is to tailor your will to your particular circumstances. Clearly, when you need a will, a lawyer's expert advice is always worth paying for. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument presented in the advertisement? 
 (0) A lawyer's knowledge and level of expertise is at least as complex as that of a doctor. (1) Do-it-yourself software cannot tailor a person's will to meet that person's particular circumstances as well as a Jawyer can. (2) Many people who prepare their wills using do-it-yourself software are not satisfied with the results. (3) In the majority of cases, valid wills do not adequately meet the needs of the persons for whom the wills were prepared. (4) There is some way for an ill person to get a valid prescription without first consulting a doctor. 
 Answer:"	(1) Do-it-yourself software cannot tailor a person's will to meet that person's particular circumstances as well as a Jawyer can.

 Question: The reasoning in which one of the following arguments is most similar to that in the argument above? 
 (0) Any dessert with chocolate is high in calories,and any dessert high in calories is fattening. So any dessert with chocolate is fattening. (1) Every dessert with chocolate is high in calories, and every fattening dessert is also high in calories. So any dessert with chocolate is fattening. (2) Any dessert that is high in calories has chocolate in it, and any dessert that is high in calories is fattening. So every dessert with chocolate is fattening. (3) Every dessert with chocolate is high in calories,and every dessert that is high in calories is fattening. So every fattening dessert has chocolate in it. (4) Any dessert with chocolate is high in calories,and many desserts that are high in calories are fattening. So many desserts with chocolate are fattening. 
 Answer:"	(0) Any dessert with chocolate is high in calories,and any dessert high in calories is fattening. So any dessert with chocolate is fattening.
446	"Context: Seventeenth-century proponents of the philosophical school of thought known as mechanism produced numerous arguments that sought to use the principles of mechanism to establish the superiority of monarchies over all other systems of government. This proliferation of arguments has been construed as evidence that the principles of mechanism themselves are in tension with democracy. But it is more likely that the principles of mechanism support democracy and that the arguments multiplied because none of them worked. 
 Question: The claim that the proliferation of arguments has been construed as evidence that the principles of mechanism themselves are in tension with democracy plays which one of the fllowing roles in the argument? 
 (0) It states a principle that the argument seeks to establish. (1) It describes a general phenomenon that the argument seeks to explain. (2) It introduces a hypothesis that the argument challenges. (3) It provides evidence in support of the conclusion of the argument. (4) It expresses the conclusion of the argument. 
 Answer:"	(2) It introduces a hypothesis that the argument challenges.
447	"Context: A good manager must understand people and be able to defuse tense situations. But anyone who is able to defuse tense situations must understand people. Since Ishiko is able to defuse tense situations, she must be a good manager. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that it 
 (0) confuses a quality that shows an understanding of people with a quality that is necessary for understanding people (1) confuses a' quality that usually correlates with being a good manager with a quality that results from being a good manager (2) confuses qualities necessary for being a good manager with qualities that guarantee being a good manager (3) overlooks the possibility that different managers defuse tense situations in different ways (4) takes for granted that because all good managers have a certain quality, Ishiko must have that quality 
 Answer:"	(2) confuses qualities necessary for being a good manager with qualities that guarantee being a good manager
448	"Context: Babblers, a bird species, live in large cooperative groups. Each member attempts to defend the group by sounding a loud barklike call when it spots a predator, inciting the others to bark too. Babblers, however, are extremely well camouflaged and could usually feed safely, unnoticed by predators. These predators, indeed, generally become aware of the presence of babblers only because of their shrill barks, which continue long after most members of the group have been able to take cover and which signal the group 's approximate location to the predators. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to explain the babblers ' strange behavior? 
 (0) Babblers fly much faster than the predators that prey upon them. (1) Babblers ' predators are generally intimidated by large numbers of babblers. (2) There is more than one type of predator that preys upon babblers. (3) Babblers ' predators have very good eyesight but relatively weak hearing. (4) Animals that live in close proximity to babblers are also preyed upon by the predators that prey upon babblers. 
 Answer:"	(1) Babblers ' predators are generally intimidated by large numbers of babblers.
449	"Context: Photographs show an area of Europa, a moon of Jupiter, where the icy surface appears to have buckled as a result of turbulent water moving underneath. This photographic evidence indicates that there is a warm sea beneath Europa's icy surface. The presence of such a sea is thought by scientists to be a primary factor in the early development of life, so there is reason to believe that there may be life on Europa. 
 Question: The claim that there is a warm sea beneath Europa's icy surface figures in the argument in which one of the following ways? 
 (0) It is a subsidiary conclusion used by the argument to support its overall conclusion. (1) It is the overall conclusion of the argument. (2) It is used to discredit a theory that the argument disputes (3) It is the only consideration presented in support of the argument's overall conclusion. (4) It is presented as support for a..subsidiary conclusion drawn in the argument. 
 Answer:"	(0) It is a subsidiary conclusion used by the argument to support its overall conclusion.
450	"Context: For consumers, the most enjoyable emotional experience garnered from shopping is feeling lucky. Retailers use this fact to their advantage, but too often they resort to using advertised price cuts to promote their ware s. Promotions of this sort might make bargain-minded consumers feel lucky; but they cut into profit margins and undermine customer loyalty. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes the overall conclusion drawn ,in the argument? 
 (0) Feeling lucky is the most enjoyable emotional experience garnered from shopping. (1) Retailers take advantage of the fact that shoppers enjoy feeling lucky. (2) Advertised price cuts are overused as a means of gaining retail sales. (3) Using advertised price cuts to promote retail products reduces profit margins and undermines customer loyalty. (4) Making consumers feel lucky is usually not a good formula for retail success.

451	"Context: Jurist: To ensure that a legal system remains just, it is important to guarantee that lawbreaking does not give lawbreakers an unfair advantage over law abiders. Thus, notwithstanding any other goals that criminal punishment may serve, it should certainly attempt to ensure that criminal wrongdoing remains profitless. 
 Question: The jurist's claim that it is important to guarantee that lawbreaking does not give lawbreakers an unfair advantage over law abiders functions in the argument in which one of the following ways? 
 (0) It states a condition that, if fulfilled, will ensure that a legal system remains just. (1) It expresses a principle that is offered as support for the conclusion. (2) It is a conclusion for which the only support offered is the claim that the legal system serves multiple goals. (3) It is a premise presented as support for the claim that the most important goal of criminal punishment is to ensure that criminal wrongdoing remains profitless. (4) It is presented as refuting an argument that criminal punishment has goals other than guaranteeing that lawbreaking remains profitless. 
 Answer:"	(1) It expresses a principle that is offered as support for the conclusion.
452	"Context: The company president says that significant procedural changes were made before either she or Yeung was told about them. But, according to Grimes, the contract requires that either the. company president or any lawyer in the company's legal department be told about proposed procedural changes before they are made.

453	"Context: Journalist: People whose diets contain a relatively large amount of iron are significantly more likely to develop Parkinson's disease than are those whose diets contain less of this mineral. Limiting one's intake of meats, seafood, and other foods rich in iron should thus reduce one's chances of contracting this disease. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the journalist's reasoning? 
 (0) Most people who have a genetic predisposition to Parkinson's disease have no more iron in their diets than people without the predisposition. (1) Many of the vegetables regularly consumed by vegetarians who do not contract Parkinson's disease are as rich in iron as meat and seafood. (2) Children and adolescents require a much larger amount of iron in their diets than do mature adults. (3) The iron in some foods is much less easily absorbed by the body than the iron contained in other foods.

456	"Context: For a work to be rightly thought of as world literature, it must be received and interpreted within the writer's own national tradition and within external national traditions. A work counts as being interpreted within a national tradition if authors from that tradition use the work in at least one of three ways: as a positive model for the development of their own tradition, as a negative case of a decadent tendency that must be consciously avoided, or as an image of radical otherness that prompts refinement of the home tradition. 
 Question: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? 
 (0) A work of literature cannot be well received within an external national tradition if it is not well received within the writer's own national tradition. (1) A work of world literature offers more to readers within external national traditions than it offers to readers within the writer's national tradition. (2) A work should not be thought of as world literature if it is more meaningful to readers from the writer's national tradition than it is to readers from external national traditions. (3) A work of world literature is always influenced by works outside of the writer's national tradition. (4) A work is not part of world literature if it affects the development of only one national tradition.

457	"Context: At Morris University this semester, most of the sociology majors are taking Introduction to Social Psychology, but most of the psychology majors are not. Hence, there must be more sociology majors than psychology majors enrolled in the class. 
 Question: The flawed pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following? 
 (0) Most of the paintings on display at the Metro Art Museum are from the twentieth century, but most of the paintings the Metro Art Museum owns are from the nineteenth century. It follows that the museum owns few if any of the twentieth-century paintings it displays. (1) In an opinion poll of Silver Falls residents,more said they were in favor of increased spending on roads than said they were in favor of increased spending on parks. So most Silver Falls residents must be in favor of spending more on roads but opposed to spending more on parks. (2) In the San Felipe city arboretum, most of the trees are of local rather than exotic species. Therefore, in the San Felipe area,there must be more trees of local species than of exotic species. (3) Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo. (4) The Acme Realty website has photos of most of the houses, but of fewer than half of the condominiums, that Acme is offering for sale.So Acme must have more houses than condominiums for sale. 
 Answer:"	(3) Most of the vegetables available at the Valley Food Co-op are organic, but most of the vegetables available at the Jumbo Supermarket are not. Thus, more organic vegetables are available at Valley Food than are available at Jumbo.
458	"Context: Film director: Although the production costs of my latest film are very high, there is little risk that the film studio will not recover these costs. Even if the film is unpopular, much of the money is being spent to develop innovative special-effects technology that could be used in future films. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most seriously weakens the argument? 
 (0) Because the film studio owns the new technology, the studio will be able to control its use in any future films. (1) Films that introduce innovative special-effects technologies generally draw large audiences of people who are curious about the new effects. (2) The production costs of this film are so high that, even if the film is popular, it is unlikely that the film's ticket sales will offset those costs. (3) In the past, many innovative special-effects technologies were abandoned after the films for which they were developed proved to be unpopular. (4) The use of the new special-effects technology would lower the production costs of other films that use it. 
 Answer:"	(3) In the past, many innovative special-effects technologies were abandoned after the films for which they were developed proved to be unpopular.
459	"Context: In a recent study of dust-mite allergy sufferers, one group slept on mite-proof bedding, while a control group slept on bedding that was not mite-proof. The group using mite-proof bedding had a 69 percent reduction in the dust-mite allergen in their mattresses, whereas there was no significant reduction in the control group. However, even though bedding is the main source of exposure to dust mites, no symptom reduction was reported in either group. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent conflict in the statements above? 
 (0) Dust-mite allergens in bedding tend to irritate many allergy sufferers' nasal passages more than do the same allergens in other locations, such as carpets. (1) When people report their own allergy symptoms, they tend to exaggerate the severity of those symptoms. (2) The medical community does not fully understand how dust-mite allergens cause allergy. (3) For dust-mite allergy sufferers to get relief from their allergies, dust-mite allergens must be reduced by 90 to 95 percent. (4) All of the participants in the study were told that one group in the study would be sleeping on mite-proof bedding. 
 Answer:"	(3) For dust-mite allergy sufferers to get relief from their allergies, dust-mite allergens must be reduced by 90 to 95 percent.
460	"Context: Five years ago, the hair dryer produced by the Wilson Appliance Company accounted for 50 percent of all sales of hair dryers nationwide. Currently, however, Wilson Appliance's product makes up only 25 percent of such sales. Because of this decline, and because the average net income that Wilson receives per hair dryer sold has not changed over the last 5 years, the company's net income from sales of the product must be only half of what it was 5 years ago. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed because the argument 
 (0) mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product (1) does not provide specific information about the prof its hair dryers generate for the companies that produce them (2) fails to discuss sales figures for Wilson Appliance's products other than its hair dryers (3) overlooks the possibility that the retail price of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer may have increased over the past 5 years (4) provides no independent evidence that Wilson Appliance's hair dryer is one of the company's least profitable products 
 Answer:"	(0) mistakes a decline in the market share of Wilson Appliance's hair dryer for a decline in the total sales of that product
461	"Context: Whether or not one can rightfully call a person's faithfulness a virtue depends in part on the object of that personas faithfulness. Virtues are by definition praiseworthy, which is why no one considers resentment virtuous, even though it is in fact a kind of faithfulness-faithfulness to hatreds or animosities. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the overall conclusion drawn in the argument? 
 (0) The object of a person's faithfulness partially determines whether or not that faithfulness is virtuous. (1) Virtuous behavior is praiseworthy by definition. (2) Behavior that emerges from hatred or animosity cannot be called virtuous. (3) Faithfulness and resentment are obviously different, despite some similarities. (4) Resentment should not be considered a virtuous emotion.

462	"Context: Columnist: A government-owned water utility has received approval to collect an additional charge on water bills and to use that additional revenue to build a dam. A member of the legislature has proposed not building the dam but instead spending the extra money from water bills to build new roads.That proposal is unacceptable. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the columnist's judgment that the legislator's proposal is unacceptable? 
 (0) Customers of a utility have a right to know how the money they pay to the utility will be used. (1) Money designated for projects that benefit an entire community should not be used for projects that benefit only some members of a community. (2) An additional charge on water bills should not be used to fund a project that most of the utility's customers disapprove of. (3) An additional charge on water bills should not be imposed unless it is approved by the legislature. (4) A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures. 
 Answer:"	(4) A water utility should not collect an additional charge unless the money collected is used for water-related expenditures.
463	"Context: During its caterpillar stage, the leopard magpie moth feeds on a plant called the Natal grass cycad and by so doing laces its body with macrozamin, a toxin that makes the moth highly unpalatable to would-be predators. Since the Natal grass cycad is now endangered and facing extinction, the leopard magpie moth is also in danger of extinction. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption required by the argument? 
 (0) Feeding on the Natal grass cycad is the only means by which the leopard magpie moth can make itself highly unpalatable to predators. (1) The leopard magpie moth does not have the speed or the agility to escape from any of its potential predators. (2) Potential predators of the leopard magpie moth cannot determine from appearance alone whether a moth's body is laced with macrozamin. (3) Leopard magpie moths are not able to locate Natal grass cycads unless those plants are abundant. (4) None of the potential predators of the leopard magpie moth have developed a tolerance to macrozamin. 
 Answer:"	(0) Feeding on the Natal grass cycad is the only means by which the leopard magpie moth can make itself highly unpalatable to predators.
464	"Context: Citizen: Our government has a large budget surplus, which our leaders wish to use to pay down the national debt. This makes no sense. Because of underfunding, our military is inadequate, the infrastructures of our cities are decaying, and our highways are in disrepair. If homeowners used all their money to pay off their mortgages early, while refusing to pay for upkeep of their homes, this would not make them better off financially. The same goes for the country as a whole. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the conclusion drawn in the citizen's argument? 
 (0) Homeowners should not pay off their mortgages early if they must neglect upkeep of their homes in order to do so. (1) It does not make sense for the government to use the budget surplus to pay down the national debt. (2) A homeowner's personal financial situation is analogous in relevant ways to the financial situation of a country's government. (3) Because of underfunding, the government does not maintain adequate standards in the services it provides. (4) Government leaders want to use the country's large budget surplus to pay down the national debt. 
 Answer:"	(1) It does not make sense for the government to use the budget surplus to pay down the national debt.
465	"Context: Peraski: Although driving gas-guzzling automobiles produces a greater level of pollution than driving smaller cars, those of us who drive smaller cars when we could use a bicycle cannot speak out against the use of gas guzzlers. We would be revealing our hypocrisy. Jackson: I acknowledge I could do better in this area. But, it would be worse not to speak out against greater sources of pollution just because I am being hypocritical. 
 Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Peraski and Jackson disagree over whether 
 (0) driving a gas-guzzling automobile produces a greater level of pollution than driving a smaller car (1) speaking out against the use of gas guzzlers despite driving in situations in which one could use a bicycle reveals hypocrisy (2) driving even a small car when one could use a bicycle contributes to the level of pollution (3) one should speak out against polluting even if doing so reveals one's own hypocrisy (4) there is no moral difference between driving a gas guzzler and driving a smaller car 
 Answer:"	(3) one should speak out against polluting even if doing so reveals one's own hypocrisy
466	"Context: For a species of large abalone shellfish to develop from a species of smaller ones, they must spend less energy on finding food and avoiding predators, and more on competition in mating. So it is surprising that the fossil record shows that a species of large abalones developed from a smaller one only after otters' which prey on abalones, began to dominate the waters in which the abalones lived. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy in the information above? 
 (0) Otters and abalones also compete for the same types of food and so are drawn to the same waters. (1) The fossils that were studied showed the development of only one of the two species of large abalones known to exist. (2) Otters also prey on the abalones* competitors for food and so indirectly make it easier for abalones to get food. (3) Small abalone species tend to reproduce more rapidly than larger abalone species. (4) Otters have a preference for large abalones over small ones and so prefer waters in which large abalones are found. 
 Answer:"	(2) Otters also prey on the abalones* competitors for food and so indirectly make it easier for abalones to get food.
467	"Context: Some managers think that the best way to maximize employee performance is to institute stiff competition among employees. However, in situations where one competitor is perceived to be clearly superior, other competitors become anxious and doubt their own ability to perform. Thus, stiff competition can undermine the result it was intended to achieve. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument can be properly drawn if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Those who are perceived to be clearly superior almost always win. (1) The winner of a competition is often the competitor who exerts the most effort. (2) When competitors perceive the competition as winnable, their overall performance generally improves. (3) Doubting one's own ability to perform can decrease one's overall performance. (4) Competitors who work to undermine the confidence of other participants often do better in competitions. 
 Answer:"	(3) Doubting one's own ability to perform can decrease one's overall performance.
468	"Context: Creating a database of all the plant species in the scientific record has proved to be no easy task. For centuries, botanists have been collecting and naming plants without realizing that many were in fact already named. And by using DNA analysis, botanists have shown that varieties of plants long thought to belong to the same species actually belong to different species. 
 Question: Of the following claims, which one can most justifiably be rejected on the basis of the statements above? 
 (0) Most of the duplicates and omissions among plant names in the scientific record have yet to be cleared up. (1) An accurate database of all the plant species in the scientific record can serve as an aid to botanists in their work. (2) Duplicates and omissions in the scientific record also occur in fields other than botany. (3) Botanists have no techniques for determining whether distinct plant species have been given distinct names. (4) A person who consults the scientific record looking under only one of a plant's names may miss available information about that plant. 
 Answer:"	(3) Botanists have no techniques for determining whether distinct plant species have been given distinct names.
469	"Context: A year ago several regional hospitals attempted to reduce the number of patient injuries resulting from staff errors by implementing a plan to systematically record all such errors. The incidence of these injuries has substantially decreased at these hospitals since then. Clearly, the knowledge that their errors were being carefully monitored made the hospitals* staffs much more meticulous in carrying out their patient-care duties. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the argument? 
 (0) Before the plan was implemented the hospitals already had a policy of thoroughly investigating any staff error that causes life-threatening injury to a patient. (1) The incidence of patient injuries at a regional hospital that did not participate in the plan also decreased over the year in question. (2) The plan did not call for the recording of staff errors that could have caused patient injuries but did not. (3) The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed. (4) Under the plan, the hospitals' staff members who were found to have made errors that caused injuries to patients received only reprimands for their first errors. 
 Answer:"	(3) The decrease in the incidence of the injuries did not begin at any hospital until the staff there became aware that the records were being closely analyzed.
470	"Context: In a national park located on an island, a herd of moose was increasing in number and threatening to destroy species of native plants. Wolves were introduced to the island to reduce the herd and thereby prevent destruction of the vegetation. Although the wolves prospered, the moose herd continued to grow. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to explain the failure of the strategy involving wolves? 
 (0) The presence of wolves in an area tends to discourage other predators from moving into the area. (1) Attempts to control moose populations in other national parks by introducing predators have also been unsuccessful. (2) Wolves often kill moose weakened by diseases that probably would have spread to other moose. (3) Healthy moose generally consume more vegetation than do those that are diseased or injured. (4) Moose that are too old to breed are just as likely to die of natural causes as of attack by wolves. 
 Answer:"	(2) Wolves often kill moose weakened by diseases that probably would have spread to other moose.
471	"Context: If the purpose of laws is to contribute to peopled happiness, we have a basis for criticizing existing laws as well as proposing new laws. Hence, if that is not the purpose, then we have no basis for the evaluation of existing laws, from which we must conclude that existing laws acquire legitimacy simply because they are the laws. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument 
 (0) takes a sufficient condition for a state of affairs to be a necessary condition for it (1) infers a causal relationship from the mere presence of a correlation (2) trades on the use of a term in one sense in a premise and in a different sense in the conclusion (3) draws a conclusion about how the world actually is on the basis of claims about how it should be (4) infers that because a set of things has acertain property, each member of that set has the property 
 Answer:"	(0) takes a sufficient condition for a state of affairs to be a necessary condition for it
472	"Context: In order for life to exist on the recently discovered planet P23, there must be water on the planets surface. But there is no water on P23's surface, so there is no life on planet P23. 
 Question: The pattern of reasoning in the argument above is most similar to that in which one of the following arguments? 
 (0) A company must have efficient employees to be successful. And if a company's employees are knowledgeable and hardworking, then they are probably efficient. Thus, in order for a company to be successful, it must have knowledgeable and hardworking employees. (1) The fact that the suspect was flustered when questioned by the police might be a result of the suspect's surprise at being questioned. But if it is, the probability that the suspect is guilty is very low. Thus, the fact that the suspect was flustered is not necessarily a sign that the suspect is guilty. (2) Oil companies are not buying new drilling equipment. But if they were planning on increasing their drilling, they would be buying new drilling equipment. Thus, oil companies are not planning on increasing their drilling. (3) The price of real estate in a particular town is increasing. And if the town's economy were improving, the price of real estate there would increase. Thus, the town's economy is improving. (4) The exports of a particular nation have recently decreased. But whenever that nation's exports decrease, its trade deficit increases. Thus, the nation's trade deficit has recently increased. 
 Answer:"	(2) Oil companies are not buying new drilling equipment. But if they were planning on increasing their drilling, they would be buying new drilling equipment. Thus, oil companies are not planning on increasing their drilling.
473	"Context: Sanchez: The sixteen new computers that the school purchased were not as expensive as many people assume. So it isn't true that too much was spent on computers. Merriweather: It isn't that the school paid more for each computer than it was worth, but that the computers that were purchased were much more elaborate than they needed to be. 
 Question: The dialogue provides the most support for the claim that Sanchez and Merriweather disagree over whether the school 
 (0) needed sixteen new computers (1) purchased more computers than it should have (2) spent more in purchasing the sixteen computers than it should have (3) paid more for each computer than it was worth (4) has been harshly criticized for purchasing the sixteen computers 
 Answer:"	(2) spent more in purchasing the sixteen computers than it should have
474	"Context: Airport administrator: According to the latest figures, less than 1 commercial flight in 2 million strays off course while landing,a number low enough to allow runways to be built closer together without a significant increase in risk. Opponents of closer runways claim that the number is closer to 1 in 20,000, but this figure is based on a partial review of air traffic control tapes and so is relatively unreliable compared to the other figure, which is based on a thorough study of the flight reports required of pilots for all commercial flights. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately describes a flaw in the airport administrator's argument? 
 (0) The argument presumes, without providing justification, that building runways closer together will encourage pilots to be more cautious while landing. (1) The argument overlooks the fact that those who make mistakes are often unreliable sources of information about those mistakes. (2) The argument questions the integrity of those who are opposed to allowing runways to be built closer together. (3) The argument presumes, without providing justification, that the air traffic control tapes studied do not provide accurate information concerning specific flights. (4) The argument infers from a lack of conclusive evidence supporting the higher number's accuracy that it must be inaccurate. 
 Answer:"	(1) The argument overlooks the fact that those who make mistakes are often unreliable sources of information about those mistakes.
475	"Context: In deep temperate lakes, water temperatures vary according to depth. In winter, the coldest water is at the top; in summer, at the bottom. The changes in temperature distribution,or ""turnover,"" occur in fall and late winter- Lake trout will be found, as a rule, in the coldest water. So, if anglers seek lake trout in deep temperate lakes while these lakes are partially iced over in late winter, they will do best to eschew the lake trout's summer haunts and fish instead in a shallow bay or close to the surface off a rocky point. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
 (0) The ease with which lake trout can be caught by anglers varies with the time of year and the water temperature. (1) Cold water is denser, and therefore heavier,than relatively warmer water. (2) Lake txout are found exclusively in deep temperate lakes. (3) Lake trout do not alter their feeding habits from one part of the year to another. (4) In deep temperate lakes that have ice residues on the surface, late-winter ""turnover"" has not yet occurred. 
 Answer:"	"(4) In deep temperate lakes that have ice residues on the surface, late-winter ""turnover"" has not yet occurred."
476	"Context: Liang: Watching movies in which violence is portrayed as an appropriate way to resolve problems increases levels of aggression in viewers. Therefore, children's access to these movies should be restricted. Sarah: Watching a drama whose characters are violent allows the audience to vicariously experience the emotions associated with aggression and thus be purged of them. Hence, the access by mature audiences to such forms of entertainment should not be restricted. 
 Question: The dialogue provides the most support for inferring that Liang and Sarah agree with each other that 
 (0) people who experience an emotion vicariously are likely to purge themselves of that emotion (1) the members of a mature audience are unlikely to believe that violence is sometimes an appropriate way to resolve problems (2) if violence in certain movies causes violence in viewers, access to those movies should be restricted (3) the effects of dramatic depictions of violenceon audiences are at least partially understood (4) children are more likely than adults to be attracted to dramas involving characters who behave violently 
 Answer:"	(3) the effects of dramatic depictions of violenceon audiences are at least partially understood
477	"Context: Politician: Of the candidates running, Thompson is the best person to lead this nation. For one thing, Thompson opposes higher taxes whereas the other candidates support them. Many would agree that anyone who opposes higher taxes will make a better leader than someone who supports them. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, casts the most doubt on the politician's argument? 
 (0) Opposing higher taxes is not a factor contributing to good leadership. (1) Being opposed to higher taxes is not a sufficient condition for good leadership. (2) Thompson has questionable opinions concerning important issues other than taxes. (3) All of the past leaders who supported highertaxes performed their jobs adequately. (4) All of the past leaders who supported highertaxes were hardworking. 
 Answer:"	(0) Opposing higher taxes is not a factor contributing to good leadership.
478	"Context: Patterson: Bone flutes dating to the Upper Paleolithic are the earliest evidence for music. Thus it is likely that music first arose during this period. Garza: But the Upper Paleolithic is exceptional for the intensive use of bone, which typically survives well in archaeological contexts, unlike other materials commonly used for musical instruments, such as wood. 
 Question: Garza responds to Patterson by doing which one of the following? 
 (0) arguing that the body of evidence to which Patterson appeals is insufficient for Patterson's purposes (1) offering evidence to challenge the truth of the premise of Patterson's argument (2) presenting a counterexample to the general conclusion drawn in Patterson's argument (3) presenting an argument analogous to Patterson's argument to reveal a potential flaw in Patterson's reasoning (4) using Patterson's evidence to draw a conclusionin consistent with the conclusion drawn in Patterson's argument 
 Answer:"	(0) arguing that the body of evidence to which Patterson appeals is insufficient for Patterson's purposes
479	"Context: No occupation should be subject to a licensing requirement unless incompetence in the performance of tasks normally carried out within that occupation poses a plausible threat to human health or safety. 
 Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments? 
 (0) Because some of the duties that police officer scarry out have no connection to human health or safety, police officers should not be subject to a licensing requirement. (1) Because there are no realistic circumstances in which poor work by an interior designer poses a danger to human beings, interior designers should not be subject to a licensing requirement. (2) Because hospital administrators routinely make decisions that affect the health of hundreds of people, hospital administrators should be subject to a licensing requirement. (3) Because hair stylists regularly use substances that can pose a threat to human health if handled improperly, hair stylists should be subject to a licensing requirement. (4) Because tattoo artists who do not maintain strict sanitation pose a serious threat to human health, tattoo artists should be subject to a licensing requirement. 
 Answer:"	(1) Because there are no realistic circumstances in which poor work by an interior designer poses a danger to human beings, interior designers should not be subject to a licensing requirement.
480	"Context: Most of the new cars that Regis Motors sold last year were purchased by residents of Blomenville. Regis Motors sold more new cars last year than it did in any previous year. Still, most new cars purchased by Blomenville residents last year were not purchased from Regis Motors. 
 Question: If the statements above are true, which one of the following must also be true? 
 (0) Regis Motors sold more new cars to residents of Blomenville last year than they had in any previous year. (1) The total number of new cars purchased by residents of Blomenville was greater last year than it was in any previous year. (2) A car retailer other than Regis Motors sold the most new cars to residents of Blomenville last year, (3) The number of new cars purchased last year by residents of Blomenville is greater than the number of new cars sold by Regis Motors. (4) Regis Motors' share of the new car market in Blomenville last year increased over its share the year before. 
 Answer:"	(3) The number of new cars purchased last year by residents of Blomenville is greater than the number of new cars sold by Regis Motors.
481	"Context: Editorial: Teenagers tend to wake up around 8:00 A.M., the time when they stop releasing melatonin, and are sleepy if made to wake up earlier. Since sleepiness can impair driving ability, car accidents involving teenagers driving to school could be reduced if the school day began later than 8:00 A.M. Indeed, when the schedule for Granville's high school was changed so that school began at 8:30 A.M. rather than earlier, the overall number of car accidents involving teenage drivers in Granville declined. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, provides the most support for the argument in the editorial? 
 (0) Teenagers start releasing melatonin later at night and stop releasing it later in the morning than do young children. (1) Sleepy teenagers are tardy for school morefrequently than teenagers who are well rested when the school day begins. (2) Teenagers who work at jobs during the day spend more time driving than do teenagers who attend high school during the day. (3) Many of the car accidents involving teenage drivers in Granville occurred in the evening rather than in the morning. (4) Car accidents involving teenage drivers rose in the region surrounding Granville during the time they declined in Granville. 
 Answer:"	(4) Car accidents involving teenage drivers rose in the region surrounding Granville during the time they declined in Granville.
482	"Context: Lucinda will soon be attending National University as an engineering major. At National University, most residents of Western Hall are engineering majors. Therefore, Lucinda will probably live in Western Hall. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments exhibits a flawed pattern of reasoning most similar to that exhibited by the argument above? 
 (0) A major shopping mall is now being constructed in our city. Most cities with major shopping malls are regional economic hubs. Therefore, our city will probably become a regional economic hub. (1) Cities that are regional economic hubs generally experience tremendous economic growth at some point. Our city is a regional economic hub that has never experienced tremendous economic growth. Thus it will probably experience tremendous economic growth in the future. (2) Cities that are regional economic hubs always have excellent transportation systems. It is widely agreed that our city's transportation system is inadequate. Therefore, our city will probably never become a regional economic hub. (3) A major shopping mall was built in our city ten years ago, and our city has experienced tremendous economic growth since then. Therefore, most cities in which major shopping malls are built will experience tremendous economic growth shortly afterward. (4) Most cities that are regional economic hub scontain major shopping malls. A major shopping mall is now being constructed in our city. Therefore, our city will probably become a regional economic hub. 
 Answer:"	(4) Most cities that are regional economic hub scontain major shopping malls. A major shopping mall is now being constructed in our city. Therefore, our city will probably become a regional economic hub.
483	"Context: Oceanographer: To substantially reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in Earth's atmosphere, carbon dioxide should be captured and pumped deep into the oceans, where it would dissolve. The cool, dense water in ocean depths takes centuries to mix with the warmer water near the surface, so any carbon dioxide pumped deep into oceans would be trapped there for centuries. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption that the oceanographer's argument requires? 
 (0) Carbon dioxide will dissolve much more thoroughly if it is pumped into cold water than it will if it is pumped into warmer water. (1) Evaporation of warmer ocean water near an ocean's surface does not generally release into the atmosphere large amounts of the carbon dioxide dissolved in the evaporating water. (2) Carbon dioxide dissolved in cool, dense waterin ocean depths will not escape back into Earth's atmosphere a long time before the water in which that carbon dioxide is dissolved mixes with warmer water near the surface. (3) It is the density of the water in the ocean depths that plays the main role in the trapping of the carbon dioxide. (4) Carbon dioxide should be pumped into ocean depths to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere only if the carbon dioxide pumped into ocean depths would be trapped there for hundreds of years. 
 Answer:"	(2) Carbon dioxide dissolved in cool, dense waterin ocean depths will not escape back into Earth's atmosphere a long time before the water in which that carbon dioxide is dissolved mixes with warmer water near the surface.
484	"Context: Community organizer: Before last year's community cleanup, only 77 of the local residents signed up to participate, but then well over 100 actually participated. This year, 85 residents have signed up to participate. Since our community cleanup will be a success if we have at least 100 participants, we can be confident that this year's cleanup will be a success. 
 Question: The reasoning in the community organizer's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that the argument 
 (0) generalizes about the outcome of an event based on a single observation of a similar situation (1) takes for granted that people who participated in last year's cleanup will participate this year (2) confuses a condition that is required for an outcome with one that is sufficient for that outcome (3) overlooks the possibility that the cleanup will attract participants who are not residents in the community (4) defines a term in such a way as to ensure that whatever the outcome, it will be considered a positive outcome 
 Answer:"	(0) generalizes about the outcome of an event based on a single observation of a similar situation
485	"Context: Bell: Commentators in the media are wrong to criticize the policies Klein implemented. Although her policies are unpopular, they avoided an impending catastrophe. Klein is just the person we need making important decisions in the future. Soltan: Klein's policies have been effective, but politics matters. In the future, important decisions will need to be made, and she will not have the political support to make them. So she should step down. 
 Question: Bell and Soltan disagree with each other about which one of the following? 
 (0) Klein's policies have been effective. (1) Klein's policies are unpopular. (2) Klein should step down. (3) There are important decisions to be made in the future. (4) Klein's policies were implemented in the face of an impending catastrophe. 
 Answer:"	(2) Klein should step down.
486	"Context: Psychologist: In our study, participants who were offered the opportunity to purchase a coffee mug were not willing to pay more than $5. If, however, they were given a very similar mug and asked immediately afterwards how much they would be willing to sell it for, most of them held out for more than $5. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most helps to resolve the apparent discrepancy described above? 
 (0) A person's assessment of the value of an object depends on his or her evaluation of the inherent properties of the object. (1) People are usually unable to judge the value of an object when they have possessed it for a long period of time. (2) The amount a person is willing to spend on an object is determined by the amount that object sold for in the past. (3) People tend to value an object that they do no town less than they value a very similar object that they already own. (4) People are more likely to undervalue objects they have been given than objects they have purchased. 
 Answer:"	(3) People tend to value an object that they do no town less than they value a very similar object that they already own.
487	"Context: Ecologist: Before finding a mate, male starlings decorate their nests with fragments of aromatic plants rich in compounds known to kill parasitic insects. Since these parasites are potentially harmful to nestlings, some researchers have hypothesized that the function of these decorations is nestling protection. However, males cease to incorporate such greenery once egg laying starts, which suggests instead that the function of the decorations is to attract females. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the support for the ecologist's conclusion? 
 (0) Adult starlings are able to defend themselves against parasitic insects. (1) Male starlings do not decorate their nests in areas with unusually small populations of parasitic insects. (2) Nestlings grow faster in nests that incorporate aromatic plants than in nests that do not. (3) Male starlings tend to decorate their nests with a greater number of aromatic plants when a caged female is positioned adjacent to the nest. (4) The compounds in the aromatic plants used by the male starlings to decorate their nests are harmless to nestlings. 
 Answer:"	(3) Male starlings tend to decorate their nests with a greater number of aromatic plants when a caged female is positioned adjacent to the nest.
488	"Context: A commission has been formed to report on the nation's preparedness for a major natural disaster. The commission's report will not be effective unless the commission speaks with a unified voice. Since members of the commission have repeatedly expressed their own opinions about disaster preparedness in the news media well in advance of completion of the report, it will not be effective. 
 Question: The conclusion of the argument follows logically if which one of the following is assumed? 
 (0) Commission members who have expressed their opinions about disaster preparedness in the news media have also emphasized their commitment to producing an effective report. (1) News organizations should not provide a platform for members of the commission to express their opinions about disaster preparedness if doing so will undermine the effectiveness of the commission's report. (2) The commission will be able to speak with a uniform voice only if individual members' opinions about disaster preparedness are not made public before the report is completed. (3) If commission members had not expressed their opinions about disaster preparedness in the news media before the report was completed, there would have been much public speculation about what those views were. (4) The commission's report will not be effective if some of the commission members already had opinions about the nation's disaster preparedness even before the commission was formed. 
 Answer:"	(2) The commission will be able to speak with a uniform voice only if individual members' opinions about disaster preparedness are not made public before the report is completed.
489	"Context: Engineer: Wide roads free of obstructions have been shown to encourage drivers to take more risks. Likewise,a technical fix to slow or reverse global warming by blocking out a portion of the sun's rays would encourage more carbon dioxide emissions, which might cause more global wanning in the future. 
 Question: The engineer's argument can most reasonably be interpreted as invoking which one of the following principles? 
 (0) Conditions that create a feeling of security also encourage risk taking. (1) Problems created by humans require human-created solutions. (2) Technical fixes are inevitably temporary. (3) Technical fixes cannot discourage risk-taking behavior. (4) The longer a problem goes unresolved, the worse it becomes. 
 Answer:"	(0) Conditions that create a feeling of security also encourage risk taking.
490	"Context: Although some animals exhibit a mild skin reaction to urushiol, an oil produced by plants such as poison oak and poison ivy, it appears that only humans develop painful rashes from touching it. In fact, wood rats even use branches from the poison oak plant to build their nests. Therefore, urushiol probably did not evolve in these plants as a chemical defense. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, adds the most support for the conclusion of the argument? 
 (0) Wood rats build their nests using dead, brittle branches, not live ones. (1) A number of different animals use poison oakand poison ivy as food sources. (2) It is common for plants to defend themselves by producing chemical substances. (3) In approximately 85 percent of the human population, very small amounts of urushiol can cause a rash. (4) Poison oak and poison ivy grow particularly well in places where humans have altered natural forest ecosystems. 
 Answer:"	(1) A number of different animals use poison oakand poison ivy as food sources.
491	"Context: Politician: Some cities have reversed the decay of aging urban areas by providing tax incentives and zoning variances that encourage renovation and revitalization in selected areas. But such legislation should not be commended. Its principal beneficiaries have turned out to be well-to-do professionals who could afford the cost of restoring deteriorating buildings; the long-term residents these programs were intended to help now face displacement due to increased rent and taxes. 
 Question: Which one of the following principles, if valid, most helps to justify the politician's criticism? 
 (0) Evaluation of legislation should take into account actual results, not intentions alone. (1) The wealthier members of a community should not have undue influence on its governance. (2) A community' s tax laws and zoning regulations should apply equally to all individuals within selected areas. (3) Legislation that is not to anyone's benefit should not be commended. (4) Laws that give advantage to the well-to-do can also benefit society as a whole. 
 Answer:"	(0) Evaluation of legislation should take into account actual results, not intentions alone.
492	"Context: Pundit: It is good to have national leaders voted out of office after a few years. The reason is that reforms are generally undertaken early in a new government. If leaders do not act quickly to solve a problem and it becomes an issue later, then they must either deny that there is a problem or deny that anything could have been done about it; otherwise, they will have to admit responsibility for the persistence of the problem. 
 Question: Which one of the following most accurately expresses the main conclusion of the pund it's argument? 
 (0) If national leaders who fail to solve problems are voted out of office after a few years, new leaders will be more motivated to solve problems. (1) National leaders who stay in power too long tend to deny responsibility for problems that they could have dealt with earlier. (2) National leaders are most likely to undertake reforms early in a new government. (3) National leaders who immediately respond to problems upon taking office should be given enough time to succeed at solving them. (4) National leaders should be removed from office every few years by the voting in of new leaders. 
 Answer:"	(4) National leaders should be removed from office every few years by the voting in of new leaders.
493	"Context: Farmer: Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation that do not use commercial products may solve agricultural problems at least as well as any technique, such as pesticide application, that does use such products. Nonetheless, no private for-profit corporation will sponsor research that is unlikely to lead to marketable products. Thus, for the most part, only government-sponsored research investigates agricultural techniques that do not use commercial products. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most strengthens the farmer's argument? 
 (0) The government sponsors at least some investigations of agricultural techniques that are considered likely to solve agricultural problems and do not use commercial products. (1) For almost any agricultural problem, there is at least one agricultural technique that does not use commercial products but that would solve that agricultural problem. (2) Investigations of agricultural techniques are rarely sponsored by individuals or by any entity other than private for-profit corporations or the government. (3) Most if not all investigations of agricultural techniques that use commercial products are sponsored by private for-profit corporations. (4) Most if not all government-sponsored agricultural research investigates agricultural techniques that do not use commercial products. 
 Answer:"	(2) Investigations of agricultural techniques are rarely sponsored by individuals or by any entity other than private for-profit corporations or the government.
494	"Context: University spokesperson: Most of the students surveyed at the university said they would prefer that the current food vendor be replaced with a different food vendor next year. Several vendors have publicly expressed interest in working for the university. For a variety of reasons, however, the only alternative to the current vendor is Hall Dining Services, which served as the university's food vendor up until this past year. Since, other things being equal, the preferences of the majority of students should be adhered to, we should rehire Hall Dining next year. 
 Question: The spokesperson's argument is most vulnerable to criticism on the grounds that it 
 (0) overlooks the possibility that the students surveyed were unaware that only Hall Dining Services could be hired if the current vendor were not hired (1) relies on a sample that is likely to be unrepresentative (2) overlooks the possibility that student preferenceis not the only factor to be considered when it comes to deciding which food vendor the university should hire (3) overlooks the possibility that there is disagreement among students concerning the issue of food vendors (4) argues that a certain action ought to be undertaken merely on the grounds that it would be popular 
 Answer:"	(0) overlooks the possibility that the students surveyed were unaware that only Hall Dining Services could be hired if the current vendor were not hired
495	"Context: On average, cats fed canned cat food eat fewer ounces of food per day than do cats fed dry cat food; the canned food contains more calories per ounce than does the dry food. Nonetheless, feeding a cat canned cat food typically costs more per day than does feeding it dry cat food. 
 Question: Which one of the following is most strongly supported by the information above? 
 (0) On average, cats fed canned cat food eat more calories per day than do cats fed dry cat food. (1) Typically, cats are fed either canned cat food or dry cat food, or both. (2) How much it costs to feed a cat a given kind of food depends only on how many calories per ounce that food contains. (3) On average, it costs no less to feed a cat that eats fewer ounces of food per day than it does to feed a cat that eats more ounces of food per day. (4) Canned cat food typically costs more per ounce than does dry cat food. 
 Answer:"	(4) Canned cat food typically costs more per ounce than does dry cat food.
496	"Context: The Frauenkirche in Dresden, a historic church destroyed by bombing in World War II, has been reconstructed to serve as a place for church services and cultural events. The foundation doing the reconstruction took extraordinary care to return the church to its original form. It is a puzzle, then, why the foundation chose not to rebuild the eighteenth-century baroque organ originally designed for the church and instead built a modem organ, even though a donor had offered to pay the full cost of rebuilding the original. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, would most help to resolve the puzzle described above? 
 (0) An eighteenth-century baroque organ cannot adequately produce much of the organ music now played in church services and concerts. (1) The organ originally designed for the church had some features that modem organs lack. (2) The donation for rebuilding the originaleighteenth-century baroque organ was designated for that purpose alone. (3) By the time the church was destroyed in World War II, the eighteenth-century baroque organ had been modified several times. (4) In the eighteenth century, the organ playedan important role in church services at the Frauenkirche. 
 Answer:"	(0) An eighteenth-century baroque organ cannot adequately produce much of the organ music now played in church services and concerts.
497	"Context: Principle: A government should reduce taxes on imports if doing so would financially benefit many consumers in its domestic economy. There is a notable exception, however: it should never reduce import taxes if one or more of its domestic industries would be significantly harmed by the added competition. Conclusion: The government should not reduce taxes on textile imports. 
 Question: Which one of the following is a statement from which the conclusion can be properly drawn using the principle? 
 (0) Reducing taxes on textile imports would notf inancially benefit many consumers in the domestic economy. (1) Reducing taxes on textile imports would financially benefit some consumers in the domestic economy but would not benefit the domestic textile industry. (2) The domestic textile industry faces significant competition in many of its export markets. (3) The domestic textile industry and consumers in the domestic economy would benefit less from reductions in taxes on textile imports than they would from other measures. (4) The added competition produced by any reduction of taxes on imports would significantly harm the domestic textile industry. 
 Answer:"	(4) The added competition produced by any reduction of taxes on imports would significantly harm the domestic textile industry.
498	"Context: Global wanning has contributed to a rise in global sea level not only because it causes glaciers and ice sheets to melt, but also simply because when water is heated its volume increases. But this rise in global sea level is less than it otherwise would be, since over the years artificial reservoirs have been built all around the world that collectively contain a great deal of water that would otherwise reach the sea. 
 Question: Which one of the following can most reasonably be concluded on the basis of the information above? 
 (0) The exact magnitude of the rise in global sea level is in dispute. (1) Rises in global sea level that occurred before the world's reservoirs were built are difficult to explain. (2) Little is known about the contribution of global warming to the rise in global sea level. (3) The amount of water in the world's reservoirs is about equal to the amount of water that results from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets. (4) The amount of water that results from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets cannot be determined by looking at the rise in global sea level alone. 
 Answer:"	(4) The amount of water that results from the melting of glaciers and ice sheets cannot be determined by looking at the rise in global sea level alone.
499	"Context: Last year, a software company held a contest to generate ideas for their new logo. According to the rules, everyone who entered the contest would receive several prizes' including a T-shirt with the company's new logo. Juan has a T-shirt with the company?s new logo, so he must have entered the contest. 
 Question: The reasoning in the argument is flawed in that the argument 
 (0) infers a causal relationship when the evidence only supports a correlation (1) takes a condition that is sufficient for a particular outcome as one that is necessary for that outcome (2) infers that every member of a group has a feature in common on the grounds that the group as a whole has that feature (3) has a premise that presupposes the truth of the conclusion (4) constructs a generalization on the basis of a single instance 
 Answer:"	(1) takes a condition that is sufficient for a particular outcome as one that is necessary for that outcome
500	"Context: When expert witnesses give testimony, jurors often do not understand the technical information and thereby are in no position to evaluate such testimony. Although expert witnesses on opposite sides often make conflicting claims, the expert witnesses on both sides frequently seem competent, leaving the jury unable to assess the reliability of their testimonies. 
 Question: The statements above, if true, most strongly support which one of the following? 
 (0) There should be limits placed on how much technical information can be considered by both sides in preparing a legal case. (1) Jury decisions in cases involving expert witness testimonies are not always determined by the reliability of those testimonies. (2) Jurors who understand the technical information presented in a case can usually assess its legal implications accurately. (3) Jury members should generally be selected on the basis of their technical expertise. (4) Expert witnesses who testify on opposite sides in legal cases are likely to agree in their evaluations of technical claims. 
 Answer:"	(1) Jury decisions in cases involving expert witness testimonies are not always determined by the reliability of those testimonies.
501	"Context: Tax reformer: The proposed tax reform legislation is being criticized by political groups on the right for being too specific and by political groups on the left for being too vague. Since one and the same statement cannot be both too specific and too vague, the criticisms just go to show that the legislation is framed just as it should be. 
 Question: Which one of the following is an assumption on which the argument depends? 
 (0) It is rare for political groups both on the right and on the left to criticize a particular tax reform proposal. (1) Even an overly specific or vague tax reform proposal can be implemented in a way that produces beneficial results. (2) The proposed legislation has not been criticized by any group that does not identify itself with the political right or the political left. (3) The proposed legislation as it is framed was not meant to satisfy either political groups on the right or political groups on the left. (4) The proposed legislation is not made up of a set of statements some of which are overly specific and some of which are overly vague. 
 Answer:"	(4) The proposed legislation is not made up of a set of statements some of which are overly specific and some of which are overly vague.
502	"Context: Employee: The company I work for has installed website filtering software that blocks access to non-work-related websites. It claims that being able to visit such sites distracts us, keeping us from doing our best work. But offices that have windows or are nicely decorated can be highly distracting too, and no one claims that people do their best work in an undecorated, windowless room. 
 Question: Which one of the following arguments is most similar in its reasoning to the employee's argument? 
 (0) Some people advocate moderation in all things. But different people react differently to certain substances, so what counts as a moderate amount of, say, caffeine for you might be too much for me. So to talk about moderation is to fail to take into account people's basic biological differences. (1) Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason. (2) Acme expects that approximately 1,000 of its employees will retire over the next year. No one would claim that Acme does not need a work force as large as its present one. So Acme will need to hire approximately 1,000 people over the next year. (3) In many creative writing classes, aspiring writers are told that if the characters they create are not engaging, their novels and stories will not sell. But this does not mean that engaging characters guarantee a sale-publishers and agents often reject manuscripts that emphasize character to the exclusion of other elements. (4) In the movie industry, a film's success is judged in terms of its profit relative to its cost. This is misguided, because under this criterion an expensive movie that sells just as many tickets as a lower-budget movie would be less successful than the lower-budget movie, which is clearly counter intuitive. 
 Answer:"	(1) Activists are calling for an electronic device to be banned, for research has shown that prolonged exposure to the device while it is in use causes cancer in laboratory animals. But most chemicals probably cause cancer when administered in very high doses, yet no one would argue that we should ban all these chemicals for that reason.

505	"Context: Scientists once believed that the oversized head, long hind legs, and tiny forelimbs that characterized Tyrannosaurus rex developed in order to accommodate the great size and weight of this prehistoric predator. However, this belief must now be abandoned. The nearly complete skeleton of an earlier dinosaur has recently been discovered. This specimen had the characteristic T. rex features but was one-fifth the size and one-hundredth the weight. 
 Question: The answer to which one of the following questions would most help in evaluating the argument? 
 (0) Was the ratio of the head size of the recently discovered dinosaur to its body size the same as that for T. rexl (1) At what stage in its life did the recently discovered dinosaur die? (2) Was T. rex the largest and heaviest prehistoric predator? (3) Was the species to which the recently discovered dinosaur belonged related to T. rex? (4) Did the recently discovered dinosaur prey on species as large as those that T. rex preyed on? 
 Answer:"	(1) At what stage in its life did the recently discovered dinosaur die?
506	"Context: YXK is currently the television network with the highest overall number of viewers. Among YXK's programs, Bliss has the highest numbers of viewers. So Bliss currently has more viewers than any other program on television. 
 Question: The flawed reasoning exhibited by the argument above is most similar to that exhibited by which one of the following? 
 (0) Soccer players suffer more leg injuries, on average, than any other athletes at this university. Linda Wilson has suffered more leg injuries than any other soccer player at this university. Thus, Linda Wilson is the athlete at this university who has suffered the most leg injuries. (1) Teachers at our school have won more teaching awards, on average, than teachers at any other school in this city. Janna Patel is the teacher who has won the most awards in the city. So Janna Patel is the best teacher at our school. (2) The Olson Motor Company manufactures the three best-selling automobile models in the country. The Decade is the Olson Motor Company's best-selling model. Thus the Decade is the best-selling model in the country. (3) In this city the highest-paid police officer earns more than the highest-paid firefighter, and the lowest-paid police officer earns more than the lowest-paid firefighter. So in this city police officers earn more, on average, than firefighters do. (4) Falling Fast is the film that is currently earning the most at the box office in the country. The most successful film in the country is typically the one that is showing in the most theaters. So Falling Fast is probably the film that is currently showing in the most theaters. 
 Answer:"	(0) Soccer players suffer more leg injuries, on average, than any other athletes at this university. Linda Wilson has suffered more leg injuries than any other soccer player at this university. Thus, Linda Wilson is the athlete at this university who has suffered the most leg injuries.
507	"Context: A contract between two parties is valid only if one party accepts a legitimate offer from the other; an offer is not legitimate if someone in the position of the party to whom it was made would reasonably believe the offer to be made in jest. 
 Question: The principle stated above, if valid, most helps to justify the reasoning in which one of the following arguments? 
 (0) Joe made a legitimate offer to buy Sandy's car and Sandy has not rejected the offer. Thus, there was a valid contract. (1) Kenta accepted Gus's offer to buy a shipmentof goods, but Gus, unknown to Kenta, made the offer in jest. Thus, the contract was not valid. (2) Frank's offer to buy Mindy's business from her was legitimate. Thus, if Mindy is a reasonable person, she will accept the offer. (3) Hai's offer to sell artworks to Lea was made in such a way that no one in Lea's position would have reasonably believed it to be made in jest. Thus, if Lea accepts the offer, they have a valid contract. (4) The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them. 
 Answer:"	(4) The only offer that Sal made to Veronica was not a legitimate one. Thus, regardless of whether Sal made the offer in jest, there is no valid contract between them.
508	"Context: Scientist: A small group of islands near Australia is inhabited by several species of iguana; closely related species also exist in the Americas, but nowhere else. The islands in question formed long after the fragmentation of Gondwana, the ancient supercontinent that included present-day South America and Australia. Thus, these species' progenitors must have rafted on floating debris across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist's argument? 
 (0) A number of animal species that inhabit the islands are not found in the Americas. (1) Genetic analysis indicates that the iguana species on the islands are different in several respects from those found in the Americas. (2) Documented cases of iguanas rafting long distances between land masses are uncommon. (3) Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia. (4) The lineages of numerous plant and animal species found in Australia or in South America date back to a period prior to the fragmentation of Gondwana. 
 Answer:"	(3) Fossils of iguana species closely related to those that inhabit the islands have been found in Australia.
509	"Context: A recent archaeological find in what was once the ancient kingdom of Macedonia contains the remains of the largest tomb ever found in the region. It must be the tomb of Alexander the Great since he was the greatest Macedonian in history, and so would have had the largest tomb. After all, he conquered an empire that stretched from Greece to much of Asia, though it collapsed after his death. 
 Question: Which one of the following, if true, most weakens the scientist argument? 
 (0) Takes for granted that greatness can be attained only by military conquest (1) Takes for granted that the largest tomb found so far must be the largest that was built (2) Does not show how the recently discovered tomb compares with other tombs from the same period that have been found in other regions (3) Fails to evaluate the significance of the fact that Alexander empire did not survive his death (4) Takes for granted that archaeologists can determine the size of the tomb from its remains 
 Answer:"	(1) Takes for granted that the largest tomb found so far must be the largest that was built
