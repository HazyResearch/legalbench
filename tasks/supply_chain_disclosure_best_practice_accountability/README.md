Does the above statement disclose whether the retail seller or manufacturer maintains internal compliance procedures on company standards regarding human trafficking and slavery? This includes any type of internal accountability mechanism. Requiring independently of the supply to comply with laws does not qualify or asking for documentary evidence of compliance does not count either. 
```
