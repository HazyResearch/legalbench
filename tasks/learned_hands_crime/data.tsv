Hey! If your reading I thank you so much because I need to clear something up in my mind. So I basically shoplifted a few months ago, at sears (ik it's dumb) in April. The police were called as there're policy states. Anyways the police interviewed me and decided not to charge me. They took my info down (DOB,Adress,name) my concern is whether if it would show up any check for any type of employment in the future for event if they didnt charge me (police encounter)! Am I good?	Yes
[TL;DR I have an assumed bench warrant out for my arrest because I failed to show up for an out of state court summons. I was offered a chance to pay a fine after I emailed the Colorado DA but couldn't afford it at the time. Now that I'm wanting to go back to Co, I need to figure out if I even have a bench warrant or anything to pay]  I'm from California and have (had?) a bench warrant out for an unfortunate event that I was ticketed for in Breckenridge, Colorado. I got the the ticket about six years ago and have never taken care of it because I thought I would never be going back to Co.. that is, until a month ago. I was just curious if bench warrants expire after a certain amount of time? I'd like to get this taken care but was curious to know if there'd be anything to even take care of any more. I googled whether or not b.w's expire and I read that after 180 days they fall off, is this true? IF they don't, I'd like to take care of it and was wondering what the best way to do that would be.   For the backstory: A close friend and I were snowboarding and were riding down a groomed trail when we (stupidly) got the urge to ride down an unmarked section. There was a big gap in the boundary line so we veered off and started down some back country. It wasn't anything insane, just a densely packed forested area with some pretty heavy powder. We ended up going a long way down and basically got stuck as there were no trails or roads at the bottom and going all the way back up in heavy boots was impossible because of how deep the snow was. Finally got a hold of ski patrol who managed to find us from a service road which was literally about 100 feet away.. just couldn't see it from our vantage point (face palm of the century). Shouldn't have happened to begin with though and I certainly learned my lesson.  Ski patrol and police were obviously not very enthused with our decision and we were promptly issued with a summons for a court date set for a few months later. I ended up sending an email to the DA asking if there was anything that could be done so that I didn't have to go all the way back to Colorado and he basically extended an opportunity to just pay a fine (somewhere around $400 I believe). However, I was young and didn't have that kind of money at the time and after a while, just decided to not pay it as I chalked it up to not ever having to go back to Colorado again. Now that I actually want to, I'm worried that I could get arrested on the off-chance I get my id checked. Regardless, I'd like to handle things now that I can afford to pay the fine (if that would still even be an option).  Apologies about the novel, just wanted to be clear. Format might also be messed up because of mobile	Yes
Does anyone have any information on what it's like to be the victim when OSI investigates a sexual assault?  I admitted to having been sexually assaulted at AFROTC LEAD in front of my Field Training Officer (FTO). Unbeknownst to me, FTOs  are mandatory reporters. Also, because I am a cadet, my report was considered unrestricted (cadets aren't eligible for restricted reports). I was able to talk to the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, and my investigation will take place at my local base rather than Maxwell, AL, and I was told that I can apply to have a Special Victims' Counsel present, but other than that, I don't really know what will happen.   I don't have any rape kits or previous police reports on file. Can OSI make me give them information (especially the name of the person who assaulted me). Can the interview/subpoena people who I have shared the name of my rapist with? I'm a college student and I really don't want to have to undergo legal proceedings. Especially not for something like this. I dramatically altered my life to avoid contact with this guy, and don't want to have to face him in this investigation.   Also, although this is a military investigation, as a cadet, I am contracted, but I believe I'm IRR. Will I continue to have my civilian rights?	Yes
I know there may be other factors involved that could determine the outcome of something like this. But any general information would be helpful. This is about a persons s/o, I'm based in Medina, Ohio.	Yes
I'll keep this vague, to prevent doxxing.   So let's say, my Dad is a local business owner and he's being bullied by a lot of people in my hometown for basically nothing - cutting ~~good~~ the best deals with people the next town over. People are whiney babies but that's besides the point. Now, people get bored of attacking him with false accusations, so they start coming after me with some heavy stuff. Now let's say a local news anchor calls me up and let's me know that they're about to do a story on some pretty bad things that I may or may not have done, and want to see if I would like to comment.   To nip this all in the bud, I dump everything I have to prove them wrong but now it looks like what they were saying was actually maybe not entirely completely false, so I might have maybe kind have proven a little bit of what they were saying true.   Theoretically, if you supply evidence to your own crime, you can essentially plead the 5th and then they can't use that evidence so you're golden right?	Yes
Hey guys, my grandpa was called today by a scammer telling him my car broke down while I was traveling and that I needed 750$. My poor grandpa sent the money right away without asking my relatives and now can't make rent. What legal action can I take ? He's too afraid to report it since he's not a legal citizen yet, so is there anywhere I can report the number? Or anything I can do on my end? Any help would be appreciated!	Yes
Last night I got hit with a possession and paraphernalia citation. I'm in Missouri so their new decriminalization law of marijuana keeps the fine to only $25 but that's not all I am worried about.   I was sitting at my buddies house waiting for him to come home, he was taking longer than usual so I had been sitting there for a solid 20 minutes or so and then some cops pull up. They tell me one of the neighbors called about a suspicious car (which is BS because I have had this car for 3 years and am at this buddies house at a minimum of once a week, I am 100% sure they have seen my car on multiple occasions)   I wasn't smoking, not even a cig, my car was off and I was just browsing Reddit. When the cop started to talk to me he noticed a blunt on my floorboard. They of course confiscated everything, but they were very nice about it, probably understanding it was just coincidence and I wasn't even doing anything.   I ended up getting a citation for possession and paraphernalia and my court date is in October. Now what I'm really worried about is the fact I want to be a firefighter, I'm already certified but I'm worried about getting hired somewhere now. I haven't been smoking very long, and was going to quit once I started taking some more classes in the fall. Is there any way I can keep this off my record? It would pretty much destroy my whole plan in life if I can't be a firefighter, I've been training and taking classes for it since high school.   Any help or suggestions would be great, my buddy said I should get a lawyer to try and keep it off my record, but I don't know if that would actually work, and I don't have tons of spare cash lying around for one. Thank you.	Yes
I know limited details about this, my friend was contacted by her uncle, he asked for a place to stay. He violated a probation in washington state, and had a warrant issued as a result. He came to Minnesota as he has a lot of extended family. He reached out to my friend asking for a place to stay, and she agreed.  Is letting him stay at her apartment illegal?  What sort of legal trouble could she face?  If they find him at her place what will happen to her?  Im trying to convince her its incredibly stupid to let him stay there, apparently he had federal marshalls show up at his home in washington, but he had already fled the state, so it seems pretty serious. Do marshall normally show up looking for someone over a probation violation, or is it possible he's commited a more serious crime and lying to my friend?	Yes
"Before we begin, here's a little bit of useful background about myself: I'm currently 17, on probation for a misdemeanor paraphernalia charge, and live in a small town in Pennsylvania.  On Monday, (7/10/2017) I was hanging out at my girlfriend's house, as I usually do. Around 12 PM, her friend messaged her and asked if we wanted to hangout after said friend got off of work at 8 PM. At about 8:30 PM, my girlfriend's friend picked us up at her house. We really don't have much to do in my small town, so we decided to drive around for a bit.   At approximately 9:15 PM, the friend that was driving wanted to meet up with her other friend at a local gas station. When we arrived, the girl we were meeting there (19 years old) asked us all if we wanted to just ride in her car, since the friend that originally picked us up, had a pretty unreliable beater. We agreed and got in. I sat in the backseat on the passenger side, while my girlfriend sat in the backseat on the drivers side.   Having nothing to do, we again drove around aimlessly for a few minutes before deciding to go up to a pretty well known hangout spot that overlooks the town. When we got to the spot, the driver pulled out a mason jar with about 8 grams in it (so she said). The driver and friend that was the passenger offered my girlfriend and myself to smoke with them. I declined because i get regularly drug tested due to probation. My girlfriend also declined out of respect for myself. We had no knowledge of it being inside the vehicle before this point.   They rolled up and smoked inside the car, trying to hotbox it (it worked very well). The two finish smoking and the driver spots headlights at the head of the path you drive to get to the spot. She freaks out, and begins to drive down the path towards where she saw the headlights. Take a guess who the lights belonged to? The police. The driver takes a left and makes it about 300 feet before being lit up.   The officer comes up to the window asking what we were doing up there. I (respectfully) asked the officer what we were being stopped for, he claimed ""suspicious vehicle on private property"". Here's the thing, there's no signs anywhere near where we were, or even in the area that claim private property. I've gone up there with friends many times and have never once have heard it was private land. Anyways, obviously the car smelled like a dispensary. The officer collected everyone's ID and went back to his car. 5 minutes later, another police vehicle pulls up. The arriving officer comes right up to the window and the first thing he says is ""Where's the weed?"". Everyone in the car refused knowing who's it was or where it was, trying to keep us all out of trouble.   He then asks us all to step out of the car, and we all comply. He asks me if he can pat me down and search my person. I agree because I had nothing on me or in my possession, he found nothing on me and then repeated the process with the rest of the people. He asked me directly if I knew where it was and I politely plead the 5th. After not getting an answer out of anyone, he begins to search the car and finds the jar underneath the driver's seat. No body was arrested, they had us all call our parents to take us home.  I've went down to my local courthouse today and filled out a statement with my girlfriend entailing exactly what I've said here.   Here are my questions. The driver and passenger are both pretty good friends and I have no doubt they've tried to pin it on myself or my girlfriend by now saying it was one of ours. Would the prosecutor side with myself and girlfriend or them, being it was in the other girls car?   Also, what can I expect? I messed up before and was caught, now I have nothing to do with it and I don't want anymore legal trouble being as i'm already on probation.  Thank you all so much for any advice you can give."	Yes
Basically, some guys put trays under my rear wheels and I did 2 donuts in an abandoned parking lot with no cars. Some employees of a nearby store watched and apparently called the cops. I got charged with a disorderly, should I plead guilty or not guilty? It was a car meet with a LOT of other cars, who says the employees could pick out my car in particular? There was only 2-3 witnesses from the store.	Yes
I'm 20 and am expecting to go to trial. I had to get a police report in before I could have my car get towed after my collision in which I took a breathilizer and managed 2 points below a dwi (0.06). I have to show up in court in a month.  So now I'm wondering what first steps I should take before the court case's consequences such as getting my license suspended, getting a restricted license etc.	Yes
Am I under any legal trouble? From my understanding, I'm 21 with no authority over her, within 4 years, and the AoC is 16. We've been talking for 2 weeks and I told my family and they are strongly implying I'm going to face criminal charges.	Yes
Edit: Please read the entire thing before passing judgement  Hello, yesterday I was arrested for child endangerment because I took the keys out of the vehicle so we could stop arguing and to make sure I didn't go to jail for domestic abuse. (I was really pissed, it's a long story) yes, it was hot, but my wife was in the vehicle supervising my son. There was no harm to my son, this all happened in 5 minutes give or take. I got back in the vehicle, and offered her the keys, she told me to get out, so I got back out, and was then arrested for child endangerment. I looked at what the statutes are and my son was never unsupervised, and wasn't hurt in any way. (Less than 5 minutes in a vehicle, the AC had been going for a while, and at any time my wife could have taken my son out of the car) and I'm curious why I was arrested?	Yes
"(PH) So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I was in a relationship with this person. So yeah this is your typical, revenge porn or non-consensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.  I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
Hello! So my girlfriend has received a traffic citation on Friday from an apparently hit and run accident on June 18th. It's a misdemeanor failure to stop property damage citation with no insurance/registration(She has proof of both)  She is very unsure of this whole deal, I'm just trying to find some answers to help ease her uncertainty. I know the basics of never talk to police, get a lawyer etc. but I don't have much knowledge and feel bad I can't help more.  She is claiming not to remember any accident, or damage to her car. I believe there may be a scratch on her mirror that's about 2cm but she says it's been there before.   Anyways I'm wondering what to tell her to do besides getting/talking to lawyers, what's the worst case scenario outcome, no criminal record, first offense, one speeding ticket 6 years ago etc. and since there is only the failure to stop property damage citation(well no insurance and registration C/I's that she has proof of so no biggie), does that mean it's just the only accusation we have to worry about? Reckless/careless driving or other things at a later date from this incident isn't a concern right?    Just want to give her some clarity on everything and what she's facing, thanks so much. Let me know if you need anymore info.	Yes
"I was at 99 cents store earlier and I got 4 earphones and some chips and my sister got 4 earphones and some gummy bears. There was a guy acting suspicious the whole time but I didn't think much of it. I bought a plant and when I went to go pay, my sister left the store before me. When she was walking out a guy grabbed her and asked if she had been stealing, I was inside paying and I didn't know what was going on. When I walked out there were 2 guys waiting with my sister and one of them said ""you have to come with me"" then they took us to the back of the store, sat us down, and searched through my purse and my sisters purse. We returned everything we had stolen. I didn't have an Id so they made me write down my ssid on a paper, along with my DOB and name and address. Then they pulled out a tablet and took pictures of both my sister and I , they also took our signatures. They made us sign a ""trespassing notice"". Since I didn't have my identification they said that they were gonna call the police on me. I never even saw an identification from the 2 men that stopped me :/ they also said they will be sending us a civil demand letter. I feel like it was sketchy and now I'm paranoid they will use my info for something weird.   (I've learned my lesson on stealing and I won't do it again, I know I was stupid)"	Yes
"I dated a man for a little over a year. We lived together for the last 4 months. My cat died under unusual circumstances after ongoing ""illness"" and the autopsy revealed she died from physical trauma when he was home alone with her. Putting all the pieces together I believe he had been abusing her (the ""illness"") then crushed her to death. Otherwise our relationship was full of red flags and signs that he was an abusive psychopath. Abuse, stalking, harassment...I block his number and he uses another to contact me, I repeat the block he repeats the new number. I tried to break things off a dozen times and then he would do the stalking and harassment and manipulation and out of fear I would get back together with him. But no more now that he killed my cat. I could very well be his next victim. I believe he may have killed my cat because one time we broke up I told his mom the true nature of our relationship and about the bad things he had done to me.  I'm staying with my mom now and filing a TPO tomorrow along with animal cruelty charges. He knows where I live, work, workout, hang out, my schedule, all that. I'm so afraid he's going to come after me or send someone else after me. His family is connected to a drug cartel and he has done drug trafficking with them. I want to move but I'm afraid he'll still find me. When we were together he bragged about how easy it was to find my address online. My state is one of the 12 that doesn't have an address confidentiality program. I don't want to live my whole life in fear. I don't know what to do because I am certain he will try to get revenge on me at some point. What do I do?"	Yes
So yeah.. last night i got the worst luck ever when me and a couple of frienda got caught smoking marijuana... I live in Sweden and it was my first time offense.  I was planning on traveling through asia in a couple of months. Starting in thailand. Which countries will i have a hard time getting in to? Thailand? Malaysia? Bali?   I appriciate the help and i feel so empty right now...  Best Regards	Yes
"Hello. Last night, someone broke into my vehicle and stole about $380 cash, a $300 check, two debit cards and two credit cards along with my social security number as well (I had it in my car because I had just taken it for verification purposes at school the night before). They used all the cards, and due to them making online purchases (with shipping to their home), and video surveillance at the restaurants they went (license plate number and faces) and I have a ton of proof that I am going to be handing over to the police. I suppose my question is, I want to recover this money, but the police straight up said ""it is US Government property and might as well be gone"". I want to recover, obviously. Do I need to file a civil suit after the criminal charges? Is this petty theft, or larceny? All in all, they had spent about $600 on the cards plus everything else mentioned. Do I need to lawyer up to due someone? I had no idea where else to ask"	Yes
Not much context to be had here. Just wondering if a 21 year old can legally be tried for underage drinking after their 21st birthday.  Say that there is video evidence, and you are pleading 100% guilty. Would a judge still rule guilty if you are no longer a minor?	Yes
I'll preface this by saying I've been ticketed for this before, went to court, did a day's community service, wiped my hands of it. So recently I was at a park drinking, some officers came around and ticketed me. Especially since I only thought it was a ticketable offense, mixed with the fact that it was dark out, me and my friends were not yelling or playing music, I stuck around after the cops left. Not even a half hour later some new cops came around and arrested me, telling me I shoulda listened the first time around. Now I'm facing a real court date.   Will they probably just give me a ticket in court or am I facing a real problem here? I had no other charges in the system when I left (I double checked). Should I get a lawyer? This is my first arrest ever so I have no idea how to handle this.	Yes
My sister's husband is a sketchy man. He is wildly wealthy and his publicly stated occupation makes no sense. In interpersonal interactions he is a pathological liar. I know through the family grape vine that he and his brothers were under investigation by the FBI as of 2016 for something to do with receiving moneygrams from a certain tropical country (I am totally naive as to what they were doing, money laundering??).  Anyway, none of it has ever affected me until yesterday. My brother-in-law, whom I have no contact with beyond family functions, sent me a text message telling me to go to walmart and pick up a moneygram that he set up in my name (without my permission or awareness) at Walmart from said tropical country. I of course refused, also in text message, and backed-up the conversation to my computer.  I talked to a trusted older friend who suggested I contact the FBI about what happened. I did and, over the phone, relayed my understanding of the situation, the text messages received and the one I sent, and my brother-in-law's name and phone number as well as my name and address (when asked for it).  I have no idea what will happen next or to what degree the information I provided is of interest to the FBI. My question is, even though I am in no way associated with this man or his business and myself have nothing more serious than a single parking ticket on my record, in any potential legal jeopardy and should I talk to some kind of legal counsel about the possibilities?  Thank you very much for your time, this has been a nightmare turn of events for me and the family.	Yes
(Portland, OR) My transgender partner and I got into an argument. The argument continued to escalate to the point where I made a really horrible comment invalidating her gender. In response to this, she lunged at me and started punching me, pulling me down to the ground and beating me with a broomstick. I managed to constrain her and make my way out of the apartment. I called 911 and they arrested her.  When the police arrived, I made the mistake of talking to police who recorded a statement (I was completely jostled and nearly out of it when he was asking me questions). My apartment management also convinced me to call the DA and give them the case number. I have not yet been contacted by a prosecutor.  I do not wish to follow through with prosecution. While in this one instance she initiated the attack, I believe there has been a mutual pattern of abuse in our relationship. There have been times when I have yelled at her or made physical contact (such as grabbing her and trying to force her out of the room or pushing her when she was in my face). Usually this happens after we have been arguing and it quickly devolves into shouting matches. We are both to blame for raising our voices, talking over one another and escalating these arguments. We both say horrible things to one another. It's just a mutually abusive relationship that I want both of us to be out of because we've tried it for so long and it does neither of us any good.   tldr; me and transgender girlfriend got in fight, she was arrested for domestic assault, I called DA with case number. What can I do to have them drop charges / not continue with case?	Yes
So I met a girl through kik messenger. Turned out she lived like a couple streets over from me. We talked for a couple days about what she's into, and she said she was really into like fantasy forced stuff. Through talking to her she agreed she wanted me to come over and have sex. So she told me when to come over, said she would be in her room and to come in the back door, which was clearly unlocked and opened just like she told me (have kik messages to prove). I go in and go in her room and sit down on the bed, it was dark so I had grabbed her leg accidentally not being able to see, and she starts freaking out and runs into the living room. I walk in there and ask her what is wrong with her, she proceeds to punch me in the head, and I just left out of the front door and walked home. I'm assuming she called the cops, in which case what can I do? I didn't harm her or touch her wrongly, and I have the messages to prove she told me to come over and everything. What should I do? Also, I started to think that what if it wasn't her that was messaging me. I am pretty sure it was, but I have the messages and pictures of her telling me exactly what she wanted with consent to everything. How should I go about this? I haven't been contacted by police in any way. Should I go to them?	Yes
My mom suffers from bipolar manic depression. My wife and I went to go stay with her 7 years ago. She threatened to call 911 on me when she was having a manic episode. I called 911 to get them to come take her back to the hospital to get her some help. She lied to the police and told them they pulled her hair. My wife told them she didn't see me do that. They took me to jail anyway. I plead no contest to get out of jail because I was pretty ignorant at the time and had my ability to purchase a firearm prohibited. I still can't afford a lawyer. What should I do to get the false conviction off my record and restore my 2nd Ammendment right to purchase own and carry a firearm. I want to be able to defend my family and myself in an emergency. Please help. Thanks	Yes
"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, and it's very long, but I'll give it a shot. Disclaimer: I already know I made poor choices and deserved what I got. Just asking for advice.   I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know).   Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be  a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point.   We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to  get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open.  I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?  Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.  Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did? I was terrified out of my mind..you can't just drive off with someone against their will. Or can you?"	Yes
"TLDR; my lawyer is advising me to bring the money I'm accused of stealing to my preliminary hearing to avoid heavy charges and plea to a summary offense.   The city police have followed through and charged me with theft. I met with my lawyer yesterday and he advised me to think about bringing the $150 (I'm being wrongfully accused of taking) to my court hearing next week. He said that even though I'm innocent, ""throwing money at something sometimes makes it go away""..He says that all the prosecutor needs to prove at my preliminary hearing is that I was in Warren at the time of the incident. That my presence in my hometown is damning enough for a judge to assume they have enough evidence to go to trial. And that if I AM convicted, I'll be seeing 2 years of probation and a HUGE fine-FOR A CRIME I NEVER COMMITTED. I'm so scared and confused. I'm not sure a jury WOULD find me innocent or not. Maybe I feel that way bc I'm scared out of my mind... He said if I bring the $150, that I would be facing a summary offense, and a small fine instead of facing jail time or probation. He says that sometimes even though we're innocent, the criminal justice system finds us guilty anyway. Any advice or words of wisdom would be appreciated!"	Yes
So there is a company that called my work and asked for the maintenance guy's name. Then they sent us a huge $1,000 order of light bulbs and claimed that our maintenance guy ordered them.  We contacted the company and told them that we didn't order them and they needed to arrange to have them picked up or shipped back.  They were extremely rude, literally screaming that we ordered them and we had to pay for them. We of course refuse and tell them to stop contacting us.  A few months go by and then they send us a new invoice for only the freight to ship them back, $200. Again I contact them and tell them that we are not paying and they can have the product picked up or arrange to have it shipped back at their cost.  They refused and now I've received a letter from a collections agency for the $200.  They are complete scumbags, I looked them up on the Better Business Bureau and there are ~20 complaints about them running this exact same scam on other businesses.  I was content to ignore their requests for payment but now I don't want us to suffer any consequences for this being sent to collections.  What should I do?	Yes
Throwaway, first time posting here. I'm really paranoid right now because my sister (13) first of all, got caught shoplifting a couple months ago along with my other sibling. They have to do community service and stuff, and go to these appointments with their case worker. At their last appointment my sis made a suicidal joke and admitted to self harming. She was admitted to the hospital, the psychiatric ward I think, again. She had already been to a psychiatric ward about a year ago after she admitted to having suicidal thoughts at a doctor's check up. My mom grabbed some clothes from home to bring her, and in the pocket of one of my sister's jackets there was weed. She hasn't smoked for a couple months now as far as I know, but I guess she still had it laying around. The staff said they will ask my sister about it tomorrow.    I'm just really worried that since this will be her second offence, and idk how much weed there was, she might go to juvy or something. I have no idea what usually happens in this case, is there a possibility she (my mom I guess) will just be fined and my sis gets slapped with more community service? We really can't afford a fine anyway but it'd be better than juvy. I hope just having at least an idea of what might happen will ease my mind. Thanks in advance.	Yes
I received a Petty Misdemeanor about 5 years ago in New Mexico for shoplifting under $30. At the time I was homeless and hitchhiking through Albuquerque on my way back to Florida. I was never arrested but they took my information, banned me from going to any Kmart's, and gave me a court date. I talked to a public defender and she told me if I never plan on coming back to New Mexico that I should just leave. So I did. I ignored the court date and headed back to Florida without a second thought.  It's been 5 years, I have my shit together and I'm living in Colorado now. I haven't heard anything from the state of New Mexico since I left and forgot about the whole deal until I applied for Lyft a couple months back and was declined because of that charge from New Mexico. How should I go about dealing with this? I now regret just leaving like I did and feel like I probably made it worse. Does this mean I also have a warrant out for skipping a court date? The way the public defender talked about it made me think it was no big deal but obviously you can't just ignore stuff like this. Any guidance is appreciated.	Yes
Since I had posted bond for both charges, from both of the 2 counties, when I appear in court for sentencing after court appearance has been scheduled (plead guilty), would I be incarcerated? Or would that only be the case if that was my sentence was incarceration and not fines?  Feel free to ask me further questions - I'd prefer minimal admonishing, since I'm doing that to myself enough.  Thank you, community	Yes
"TL:DR at the end, plus my questions.  So, he raped me back in 2009, so the statute of limitations has expired from my knowledge. We were really young when it happened. I was 13. My mother had me convinced I wasn't really raped because that was the kind of mother she was back then.   After middle school we went to different high schools, and I thought ""oh cool, I won't ever have to deal with him again."" But alas, he's back.  I work at a big blue box store.   About a year ago I actually sold him cigarettes, I could no longer recognize someone who occasionally haunts my dreams because his face is so poc marked from doing meth.  Now about a month ago I am at the customer service desk, and he strolls up wanting to return something. I look up and he says ""how have you been?"" And smirked at me in a way that said ""yeah, I know I am causing you harm"" so I stammered out ""I'm going to go get my manager"" let her know of the situation and ran to the back room and I wouldn't come out until he left the store.  Today, he was in my store trying to steal stuff. AP said he was twitching like a tweaker, and that he wouldnt stand still because he was over heating. He was eventually deterred and said he ""left his wallet at home"" and would be back for his basket. We totalled up his basket, and it was well over $400 of stuff he was planning on stealing.  So I let AP know that the guy makes me extremely uncomfortable. They told me they can't ban him until he actually steals something, or if I can get a restraining order.  TL:DR man who raped me in 2009 shows up to my store, causes me great mental anguish, and tries to steal from my store. He cannot be banned until he actually steals something, or I get a restraining order.  My questions, can I actually get a restraining order even though the statute of limitations has past? Is it true that consultations with lawyers are usually free? I really need advice. I am scared to go to work."	Yes
Alright. I was caught shoplifting at BesbtBuy as the title says, I need to know what steps to follow.  I attempted to steal a $78 dollar charger for a macbook pro, I am 17 and about to turn 18 in about a month in a half, this is my first offense ever. If you plan on telling me that I am stupid, I know, I feel like a dumbass and honestly wish I didn't have legs so I couldn't even have gotten there in the first place.   I was caught, detained by LP, and sat there for two hours. Mall security was there. I signed two pieces of paper, I don't remember exactly what they said. One was agreeing/acknowledging I was banned and I don't remember what the other was. I honestly would have signed away my left arm if they had asked me to, I was and am really shaken up.   I admitted to stealing to the LP and mall security, I realize after reading posts that I shouldn't have.   Currently it seems that I will be charged as they have no reason not to. My family can't afford an attorney, much less stuff like heat or wifi half the time.   It currently seems the best bet is to plea not guilty, ask for a public defender and then leave it in the hands of the PD to cut me a deal.   I am wondering if this is the correct course of action and what other options are available. I am freaking out because just one moment of pure idiocy seems to have put my life in such a shitty position that could ruin it. Thanks for any help I get in advance.	Yes
"Yes, you read that right. Even he did that he's still my boyfriend until now but that's because I'm afraid that if I don't agree to get back with him and ""forgive"" him, he'd spread more nudes because according to him he has more photos.   He sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. ALL ARE MY STUDENTS. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
My friend was/is on probation for a DWI. He had a month left and he got violated because he tested positive for alcohol twice in a row.  He is currently in county jail and they haven't given him a court date yet. He's been there almost a week. My question is how long can they make him stay and can they sentence him with a full prison sentence even if he paid his restitution and has been on probation for 5 1/2 years.   We reside in New York State. 	Yes
"Long and short of it is I come from a very small town.  On top of issues with the department I have going back to when I was a little girl (they mishandled my sexual assault/abuse case that or another case of corruption I'll never know)  Since school got out there's been an obvious up-tick in noise around the neighborhood.  Oddly last year wasn't bad.  This year it's non stop atv's and dirtbikes, drinking, and yelling about ""teeners"" from the front steps at 1-3 am every morning.  I called to report noise two days ago.  dispatch asked , ""When you say yelling do you mean partying and having a good time?""  I said, ""if you're asking if they're fighting no but it's 1 am and they lit fireworks off outside my two daughters windows.  He sighed and said ok, ""you wanna talk to the deputy?""  I said ""no I wanna go back to bed"" he said ""ok deputy is in route.""    Deputy never showed.  I know because the fireworks continued and every time my daughters came back to my room freaked out and tired.   (it's worth mention that I have two years worth of video showing the same officer going to the same house in our cul-de-sac and staying for 45 mins to an hour a couple times a week.  They are no stranger to this home)    Last night we had 7-15 rounds fired in the center of town from a fairly loud gun.  They shot from 1-1:30 then 1:40-2 they took a break and resumed shooting until 3 am.  I lost count of rounds after that.  Police never showed up to that either.   Rewind over the last six months.  My brother in law is a crackhead.  (No joke) My MIL passed away almost 3 years ago.  Out of her passing we ended up taking the house as the sister was engaged in a lease and crackhead wouldn't pay the bills.  We let him stay in the house for two months until the eviction letter came and we had to take over.  So in lieu of house their sister said give him the truck.   He's never changed the title, never put tabs on or insured the vehicle.  It is still registered to his late mothers name.    this is where the corruption comes in.  He's been pulled over multiple times.  6 in the last 9 months to be exact.  over the course of three years?... countless. Every time up until recently he's called my husband to come pick him and the truck up.  He's caught driving with a suspended license (from not paying child support, has been suspended since shortly before their mom died)   The first couple times the hub went and got him.  The third time he asked the officer, ""Why don't you impound the vehicle and throw him in jail?""  (line of thinking is maybe he'll have a chance to sober up)  The officer called in a female officer for ""back-up"" and she informed him that they all know their mom died so they know he's going through a hard time.  Just take the vehicle and him home.   He was pulled over again two weeks ago.  Still suspended ,still unpaid fines.  Police still won't impound the vehicle.  We just got a letter from the DMV here under MIL's name saying that tabs and new plates were due this year.    My husband said we should take that letter up to the DMV and tell them the vehicle is scrapped.    There is so much more into the corruption than just this piddly stuff however I don't know how much they can actually watch/read.   My mom works fairly closely with police in her public position a couple of them have gone as far as telling her how they investigate.  That they can read through facebook messages without permission (legal I guess)  so I didn't want to ask her how to report as I really don't want a ""Walking Tall"" thing to go down.    How do I go about bringing a corruption charge against the police?  These things seem very minor I'm sure but as I said I have far more proof's I'm just not sure what I should do with it. (video, pictures, recorded conversations, multiple attempts on my end to contact said department)  Located MN   Thanks for any advice in advanced.  I'm going to work now and will check back on break.  And for clarification I don't have it out for police, all in all I generally get a long with them.  My grandma was a federal officer for 15 years.  I just have no tolerance for anyone who doesn't uphold the law, or rather, feels they ARE the law."	Yes
Hello everyone I am 28 years old and when I was 17/18 I had a troubled youth and was arrested on 4 different occasions resulting in 7 charges.  All convictions were for 5 misdemeanors and 2 violations.       For the violations and 3 of the misdemeanors I was given youthful offender I believe.  For the other misdemeanors I believe my record has been sealed / expunged.       I got my life straightened out and I went back to school eventually and just received my masters degree.  I have been offered a position which will require a background check.  On the application it asks if I have ever been convicted of an offense that HASN'T been expunged/sealed or given youthful offender status.  I answered NO here as I believe my records are sealed and given youthful offender.      Honestly i'm not sure what the background check will show up.  These charges happened so long ago and I believe the records have been sealed as part of my plea agreements, but I cant be certain. I submitted a free background check on myself however I may not receive the results in time.       My question is what should I do in this situation?  Tell the employer about my past criminal history before I accept the official offer?  Or should I just not admit to it and hope my records have been sealed?	Yes
Location is Alaska. My friend is 17, his brother is 20. Two nights ago they got drunk and his brother beat the shit out of him multiple times. Brother would let him walk away, then go beat him up again. My friend eventually got away, went home and got his AR15. He then spent an hour or so hunting his brother, chasing him around town and shooting at him when he saw him. He chased him through the woods behind my house, heard him unload 40-60 rounds at his brother. He was blackout drunk so he missed every time. Troopers came in yesterday, couldn't find my friend so they left. He's still hiding out. What will he be charged with? Attempted murder and evading arrest? How long will he get when he's caught?	Yes
Have a rockstar attorney ($750 / hr ) could it be tossed out? Refused breathalyzer and nurse couldn’t get any blood from me.	Yes
One thing that I found that aided me in my efforts to quit drinking was marijuana which seemed justifiable, however the county cop that pulled me over didn't see it that way. Im just a young adult that's never had any other run ins with the law so my record is squeaky so to keep it short, am I screwed?	Yes
How can I be treated as if I'm on probation, have to report every 2 weeks, and take random drug tests, If I haven't even been convicted of a crime or sentenced probation?  Also does an adac assessment count as a drug test? My probation officer said in court under oath that I received and failed a drug test, when in fact I've never received one and could have passed one at any point. When I asked him about it he said that since I said I had smoked weed in my adac assessment it's the same thing. I call bullshit. If he commited perjury by saying I failed a drug test, I'd really need/like to know.	Yes
As the title says, my girlfriend made a huge error in judgement the  other day and tried to  only pay for some of the makeup she had gotten off the shelf. She has a spotless record and is even hoping to  work for a very well known animation company and park. She immediately knew she'd made an awful and idiotic mistake and is completely remorseful. I'm trying my best  to help her through this with as little damage as possible to her employ-ability and record. What steps should I take, should I be out looking for an attorney? Any questions  I should know to ask? Any help is appreciated, thank you all for your time.	Yes
Hello, this post is regarding my work colleague. He is a European and was in the country on a work assignment last year.  He was jailed overnight for a DWI incident in Dallas, Texas last year with BAC &gt;= 0.15. After being released on bail for $500, he was in touch with the bail company to check about the court dates, and they assured they were working on it. Unfortunately, he had to leave before a court date was worked upon as his work assignment got over. He was in touch with the bail bond fairly afterwards and they said nothing to worry about after his leave.  This year, he got called in again on a 3 week assignment. But, once he reached Dallas, he was detained at the DFW airport jail as he had an open warrant. After that, I bailed him out for $1500. After the bail, he talked with an attorney to sort out a court date, and the attorney said  they can represent him for $6000, of which he has paid $2000 today. After he inquired whether he can leave the country as his assignment is getting over in the next 3 days, they said they are not sure.  What do you suppose he should do, as his flight tickets are booked and the panic has started to set in?	Yes
My friend recently got into a little legal trouble when he was drunk. He is required to take Random Enhanced BA (breath analysis) testing. His question was if there is a difference in the substances they test for in a regular BA test, and if there is a possibility that he would be randomly tested for something else. He wants to avoid further legal trouble so if anyone has any further information on the matter, it would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
So I am wanted for a pretty serious crime, like probably the first or second biggest one. There is a international warrant for my arrest. I want to look at my options with a lawyer and see what the best way to approach this is. Say I meet up with one, and tell him my situation, can he tell the police.. Lets say I dont pick him, can he call the police and say hes in this state.. etc.	Yes
how can I anonymously report him without him knowing if he finds out he would kill me even with a restraining order. (I know this is a bad relationship and need to get out and I have tried )	Yes
So recently I got a DUI and the lawyer was able to get me an agreement on a suspended imposition. This is only in a couple of states, South Dakota and Missouri I believe. Well my question is, will I still be found guilty under the courts judgement or convicted?	Yes
"So there is a guy who for this story i will call ""Tyrone"" who grabed my girlfriend (19F) as she was at the drinkstation at Mcdonalds. She and i used to work there and Tyrone was an aquantence, but without warning today he grabed her, im wondering what we should do. I am going to try my best to get her to file a police report but aside from that what should we do? I belive that it was caught on tape because there is a camera over that area. The people who own this Mcdonalds have covered for an employee in the past who was accused of sexual harassment, so we are not expecting much sympathy from them. I am willing to hire a lawyer for an hour or two to send a threatening letter to the owners, ideally i would like for this guy (he might be a minor, like 16,17,18) to face criminal charges and to lose his job. If you have any questions please let me know, sorry if this is not well put together i am just upset right now."	Yes
I was caught on private property by police officers as I was exiting with other people I did not know. (popular spot for kids to hang out) There was signage on the property and an empty police car. I had assumed at the time of entering the property that there was a cop inside the car since the windows were tinted and he would have informed me that I should not be there but it turns out the car was empty. The police informed us to never come back and they claimed to have taken our cars' license plates and we may see a trespassing summons in the mail. No one gave any information, nor were they asked by the cops for it.  If they didn't personally take my information and just read plates, could I still be sent a summons? I am not the person the car is registered to and there would be no way to prove who was on the property since no information was taken.  Thank you	Yes
I am shocked and embarrased and upset right now. I have no idea what to do. This is my first offense ever and the only way I can expunge my record is if I wait two years. I'm 17 and a senior in high school and was planning on applying to Ivy League but now that's obviously not going to happen. I have no idea what to do to move past this. 	Yes
I want to say first that my boyfriend is in reality capable of consent. He understands sex and is able to know what he wants and doesn't want. I am only asking about what the law is. He's a 25 year old man and is capable of having sex like anyone else.  He has schizophrenia and is diagnosed with an intellectual disability. It's a milder case of ID and mostly pertains to memory loss and difficulty understanding things. His schizophrenia is medicated but he still has delusions about magical things. However, he is able to function in daily life well.  My question is, what is the legal status of our relationship? If someone wanted to ruin my life, could they report me for statutory rape because he is mentally disabled?	Yes
"For ease, I will describe what I understand to be true as fact. I'm happy to clarify anything that seems unlikely, my information comes from various sources including the subject.   A transient (T) was falsely arrested a few months ago. She was already on probation for multiple minor charges (i.e. drunk in public), when she was shopping at a local store and had an altercation with an employee. The police were called, they looked for a reason to arrest her, and the store clerk said T spit on her. T is adamant that any spit that may have come out was accidental because she was talking loudly.   After some time trying to meet probation requirements, T was eventually picked up for missing a court date and has been in jail awaiting trial for months. Her Public Defender was going to take it to trial because the DA wouldn't budge and wanted to throw the book at her, the PD thought that was dumb. For background: T is mentally ill, physically disabled, has cognitive impairments, TBI, has been living on the streets for a decade, in and out of jail for minor offenses and drugs but nothing serious.   T has court this morning, and I found out late last week that it is for sentencing. I spoke to T (who is not always the most reliable source, but tends to be honest with me), and her PD convinced her to plea no contest, otherwise they were going to give her a year and a half because ""the judge doesn't want a trial."" Her PD also told her she'd seen surveillance video, which does *not* show the store clerk reacting as though she'd been spat on.  I'm concerned T doesn't understand that pleading no contest to something she was falsely arrested for means she won't be able to potentially recover damages from the false arrest (she had been trying really hard at that point and there had been some improvement, and she was *on her way to therapy* when this incident happened). I want to send an email to her PD before the sentencing to express my concerns that T isn't fully mentally competent and that she doesn't understand the implications here. I have about an hour.  Also, I know this kind of plea coercion is common, but I hope I don't sound too naive when I say I don't like it being used on a vulnerable member of the population. She has literally no resources in life, it was all too easy for a retail clerk to get annoyed that her authority wasn't respected and have this person incarcerated for months for it, and the police actively helped.   Question is: Anything specific I should/shouldn't say in this letter?"	Yes
"Note: I have a public lawyer, so I will try and be brief. This is in the state of Massachusetts.  Simply put, I've been charged with multiple counts of child rape. A child has claimed that they were raped and molested over the course of a few years by me (unsure of details). There is no physical or forensic evidence available, so it's the alleged victims word versus mine.  One of the only defenses I can think of (since I cannot prove I didn't do something) is a friend of mine who is related to the alleged victim. This friend of mine knows I've never been alone with the alleged victim and is willing to testify. Also, the biological mother of the alleged victim has a few mental disorders, I just don't know what exactly.  **I'm conflicted on these two points below;**  **1)** Proof beyond reasonable doubt is needed for a conviction, which seems impossible in this case.  **2)** I did some reading and came across a passage that stated if there is no ""logical explanation"" for the alleged victim to lie about the assault, then the defendant should be presumed guilty.  **Question:** Should I be worrying? Should I attempt or accept a plea bargain? If so, what can be considered a good plea bargain since I'm looking at maximum penalty of life in prison, despite not committing the crime?  Thanks in advance."	Yes
Now not reckless driving, but the one point negligent driving. It keeps coming back for job background checks and I disclose it now after the first time I was called out on it because I had no idea it was not a general type of ticket when I was 18 and then forgot the ticket was and never thought twice. I can't get a straight answer on if it is a misdemeanor or not? Also I have a lot of driving tickets (4) from the age 18-21. Will that impact me forever? I am embarrassed of them now especially since all my future employers can see them. I haven't had a ticket in two years (23 now) and drive much more responsibly now. I also live in Florida now with the one ticket at 21 in Florida, rest are in Maryland. Will all these forever show up?	Yes
Last night, I was out with my coworkers. We were supposed to meet at a manager's house for dinner, so I accompanied him to his house to make dinner for the group. Most ended up not coming, one did. We had been drinking before and during dinner. I had been driving coworkers, but as the night wore on I was not fit to drive and thought it would be a good idea to stay the night.  When we were alone, he forced himself on me despite me saying no, clearly, in many ways, more than once. I did not fight him. I was drunk, and scared.  Here's the issue: I am completing probation from a DV arrest. My abusive boyfriend called the police on me during a fight, I was arrested. I have completed a year of probation and my record is due to be expunged within the month. My court-appointed counselor advised me not to make a report, due to my record. She said I am unlikely to be taken seriously.   I am no longer on probation, I am allowed to drink, and I wasn't drunk enough to not know what was going on. I remember everything. He raped me, and I feel as though I have no recourse.  It is worth mentioning that while I am his employee, I am serving out my two weeks notice and will not be an employee past the 20th of this month.  What should I do? What can I do? I have been advised by that court-appointed counselor (who I have stayed in contact with because I like and trust her) to talk to him about what happened and proceed from there, depending on whether he gets defensive or not.  I am currently in the ER waiting on a rape kit, so I have at least some evidence to protect me in case this goes from bad to worse.   Thank you for reading.	Yes
I'd prefer to leave my location out as it is quite a small place and I don't want people knowing about this for obvious reasons. It is in Asia if that helps any and I am willing to PM the country to anyone that asks.  Basically I overheard my brother on the phone mentioning that he had videos of him and his girlfriend in compromising situations and I told my parents as well... they needed to know. I was told that they knew and that my mother had accidentally seen the video when she went to turn off his computer.   Both him and his girlfriend are under 16 and my parents have confronted him telling him how illegal this is and stuff but he is just not listening and denying everything. There was no like actual sex but just other stuff in the video apparently.   Legally how fucked is he? 	Yes
This friend of mine contacted this person and sent exploitative pics to her. This person is now trying to take revenge and is sending these pics to me and my other friends. I worry for my friend's safety and future. What are things he/I can do?  Sorry for bad English. Not first language.	Yes
"Throw away for super obvious reasons. TLDR: Dr. groped and propositioned me and. now won't send medical records to new doctors.     I saw this doctor for almost 7 years without major issue, he was always a bit flirty but in the last few months he had made some ""jokes"" that made it obvious he was getting a little out there. During  my last visit during the first week of June he asked to view my scars from a skin removal and breast augmentation. This made sense because all these years later I still have nylon sutures that very painfully come to the surface and breakthrough the skin.   This part is super hard to type out, idk why but I can't get it out of my head, can't sleep, can't stop thinking about it.    He repeatedly rubbed his hands around the scar from my lower body lift and then closed the room door and asked to see the scars on my breasts. I was not aware anyone else should be in the room so please don't yell at me about it. He then proceeded to rub his hands all over my breast ""feeling for sutures"" and after about 30 seconds I started totally freaking out because it was going where there weren't any. Then he proceeded to ask me repeatedly if I would ""play"" and if I liked to play, how he was a boob guy and an old man like him was just happy to touch them. I completely shut down as a human and said no I'm happily married and my scars weren't bothering me, pulled my bra back up and shirt back down. He then kept making comments about how I was probably grossed out and would tell my husband, I think I was in complete shock and I just needed to leave that room asap so I made a comment about no big deal I just need to run home to pick up my kid so I needed to get going. I knew I needed to find a new Dr right away and should officially tell someone but I was so ashamed, so embarrassed that this could happen to me and that I didn't handle it by yelling for someone to come in the room.. I just had no idea what to do.     So a few days later I'm sitting there watching the news and I see he was arrested for sexually assaulting another patient. It turns  It he's been doing stuff like that for awhile.  I have 2 new doctors that have changed my quality of life tremendously in less than a month as far as changing nearly every medication and actually checking my vitals. Previous Dr. checked  maybe twice in 6 years. Now the issue is his office will not send my medical records to the new doctors despite several requests and my signing all the documents for it to happen.   I don't know what to do. Should I still go file a police report about what he did to me ? How can I obtain my medical records if his office won't send them to my new doctors after almost 7 weeks of requesting them?   I'm a hot mess, I can't get it out of my head and I feel disgusting, depressed and ashamed of myself for not speaking up right away.   Thank you for wading through to the bottom of my post and for any advice in the right direction."	Yes
My friend was on felony probation for theft. They were arrested for a DWI a few months back and bonded out. Never heard about it again until while reporting, another officer said there was a warrant for his arrest.  1. a lot of the info I saw online was talking about violation of probation and such. Are we past that point? We don't know that his PO knows he was arrested (they are unreachable 100% of the time and are constantly changing).  2. If it is considered VOP, what are the odds that he will be jailed until court hearing? The odds that he will get significant jail time instead of reinstatement or added charges?  As of right now he doesn't have a GA lawyer, and he's convinced if he takes a public defender he will definitely get jail time. The maximum is 10 years I think, eligible for parole after 3-4.	Yes
I was walking out with merchandise in my hand. I past the last point of sale but did not exit the building, three security guards tackle me then two grab my arms while the third chocks me out and I'm begging for my life this happens for about two or three minutes. When the cops come and review the footage the one who chocked me out is cited for aggravated assualt. Is there anything I can do?	Yes
Can someone help me find a warrant? I have called the jails. The only thing I have is the Warrant or Case Number. 	Yes
A friend of mine is facing a serious felony assault charge, his lawyer told him he may be able to plead down to a lesser assault but it could go to jury where he is risking 2-8 year prison term. He asked the lawyer about if a person leaves the state for the coast since he hasn't been served a warrant. The lawyer said if he did he would never be extradited but would spend 30 days in jail and released basically any time he got a ticket. He also said that once this happens a clock starts and that after seven years there would be a statute of limitations. This doesn't sound correct to me, but if that's true it honestly seems better than risking his life being ruined. Any legal experts here that can verify this? Thanks. He is from Ohio.	Yes
"This is a long shot but I was curious if there's anything wrong about a police officer turning his camera off while searching someone's car after a stop.   The way it went down as he says is he got pulled over for running a stop sign, the guy started to smell the weed then had asked if he could search the car. Before searching he told my roommate that he is a ""good cop"" for turning the camera off as he searched.   I was lead to believe cops weren't allowed to turn their cameras off, is that not true? If it's true, is there anything he can do about that or is he pretty much just screwed?"	Yes
Hello all, I received a PI in the Travis county area in Texas and have yet to even go to court for the misdemeanor. I have no blemishes on my record and wish to expunge the misdemeanor ASAP. However I have no idea how to go about it or what to even say when I walk in the court room in a few days. All advice is welcome, thank you!	Yes
The card was expired so the transaction didn't go through. The address the person used is very close to where I live. I would like to report this, but I'm not sure where to start. Is this a lost cause?	Yes
I am in Oregon, sister in trouble is in WA. Her public defender is terrible. Our family is kind of shitty, and I have no money for an attorney. She has been waiting for trial for a very complicated case for 2 years. Her court-appointed attorney has ignored all of the resources and advocate options as well as contact info for expert witnesses I have provided. He has condescended to me, yelled at me over the phone. I told him that I will only communicate with him via email.  He has been often rude and aggressive toward her, then seems to have compassion on their next visit. He has told me to send the information and contact info of the people I have spoken to, they have tried to contact him, and no response. I wrote to him and told him she felt bullied and disregarded. He seemed to be on her side for about a month, then back to the roller coaster approach.  She said she has written a letter to the judge and told me it had been ignored. I have so few details, her self-worth is shattered, she has lost her fight. She told her psych doctor she wanted a new attorney and she was condescending and dismissive.  I have contacted another public defender in WA because I think she can switch easily if someone else is willing to step in? That person did not contact me back, and I don’t want to continue barking up the wrong tree. I also am afraid that the next one might be worse.  What might my best strategy be? We have contacted all of the legal aid resources we could find, and have gotten very minimal response.  I really appreciate all of the great info here. Thanks for your time	Yes
I have a petty misdemeanor for shoplifting in New Mexico from 4 years ago. I left the state without dealing with it and now I'm living in Colorado. I finally have my shit together and I want to resolve this but have no idea what I'm doing. I looked into it and obviously I have a warrant for not appearing in court. I talked to a criminal lawyer in Albuquerque and he would charge 1000 to represent me and would first file a motion to quash the warrant.   So I'm wondering if this would be my best option or is there some way I can deal with this myself without having to get an attorney? Maybe a public defender? I'd like to not have this on my record but I'm mainly worried about this warrant. I'm currently trying to find an apartment in Colorado and I feel like this is definitely going to cause problems when I start applying. As it is I don't have very much money so paying an attorney 1000 on top of whatever other costs I'll have is going to be hard. Should I call the Albuquerque court house and try to deal with this myself or will that just make things worse? Thanks for reading and any advice is much appreciated.	Yes
Hi, I'm new to legal advice and being in trouble in general, so please let me know if I'm missing anything.  First things first, I'm going to turn myself in obviously, I'm going to have my lawyer set up a time to do that.  About 5 years ago, my drug addict father showed up at my mom's house, after I hadn't seen him for over a year. In my opinion, he was messed up on prescription painkillers when he arrived. He was parked in the driveway, I yelled at him to leave, we yelled at each other. He tried to open the car door and I closed it back on him. I ran inside, called my mom, and he backed out of the driveway, called the cops and said I was threatening him. We were the only two people present. Honesty, I have no idea what I said to him. I was 20 at the time, and pretty upset that my abusive father showed up at my house without warning. The police arrived, assessed the situation, and told me something about how in domestic cases they usually arrest someone no matter what, but that my father wasn't going to sign a complaint and they told him to not come back to the property. The next day, apparently he called the police to sign a complaint. A warrant was issued for my arrest at the time, for misdemeanor domestic abuse  Here's where it gets fucked. I was never notified I had a warrant. Nobody ever showed up at my house. I never got a letter in the mail. I've had my ID ran by multiple police departments, including the one wanting to arrest me now (never in trouble or any other charges ever, just verbal warnings), applied for jobs, school, new passport, left the country and went through customs, etc ect. Nothing ever came up, so I had no idea.  About a year after that, my father passed away because his liver failed, due to the ridiculous amount of prescription pills and alcohol he was consuming.  Cut to just now. The police called me, saying they were going through old warrants and needed me to turn myself in. They explained that they tried to have the state's attorney quash the warrant, but the attorney refused. I'm not walking into the police station without a lawyer obviously.   What the hell happens next? The cops are saying that they'll transport me to court, I get booked, and then the bond court will PROBABLY throw it out. I don't believe them at all. I have bail/bond money, but I'm just afraid as fuck of jail.	Yes
   I live in an extremely small town, and apparently I've pissed off the wrong people. Now I can't leave my house without a bunch of people following me and even trying to beat me up and possibly kill or disfigure me permanently.    Is there any legal recourse I can take, I know all their faces but not all their names. I'm pretty nervous.	Yes
I'm 16 about to get my drivers license in Florida if I have a bench warrant in Texas for not appearing in court ( I took something that wasn't mine and got caught it was under $30 and got a citation but didn't show up to court because I left the day later I got the citation) am I able to get my drivers license with no worry ? 	Yes
My neighbor has been stalking me and threatening me.  I was granted a TRO today, and we go to court next week to extend it.  I have video evidence of several of the incidents.  The only problem is that when the videos save, for some reason the time stamps do not save with them.  I have a couple where they match up to still shots, which do keep their time stamps.  But most are just the video with no time stamps.  Is that going to be a problem in court?  Is there anything else I can do to prepare?  Also, should I get a copy of the related police reports, or will the court already have access to those?	Yes
Hello. I would just like some information about something that happened to me and my friends when we were young teenagers. I tried to use google to get information but it was confusing and not specific towards my situation. I'm using a throwaway since I don't want this attached to my main profile. I think this is the correct sub for my questions. Our interactions were during 2008. We lived in Ohio and John lived in South Carolina.   He met my friend Julie over Xbox online chat. John was friends with Julie's older brother and she was using her brothers account. He said he was 21 and she said she was 15 (she was really 13) he talked to her and they developed a romantic relationship. Flirting and talking to each other and all that. Julie introduced us to him so we could get to know him. Sarah was 14 with over protective parents, and she felt uneasy and unsure about him. I was 14 and wanted to get to know him and make sure he was ok. As I got to know him I would ask him questions and advice about growing up and boys and sex.  I still have some copies of some of our chats over gmail but most of our messaging was over aim. I accidentally revealed Julie was actually 13. He was upset about it and didn't want to talk to her anymore, but eventually got over it and continued to talk to us. Over time our messaging got more dirty and we would talk on the phone as well. I know he was romantically dating my friend and I'm a shitty person for getting flirty and intimate with him. Eventually he taught me how to have phone sex. At the end of one of the early sessions he said if I told anyone he'd kill me. I freaked out a little but he said he was only joking. We had phone sex regularly. I still have some of the chats on my gmail were I was talking about me moaning and him liking it. We even talked about that when he could finally come up to see Julie about the possibility of him and I having sex.  He stopped having phone sex abruptly with me. He said he was feeling guilty about having phone sex with me while being in a relationship with Julie. I've always wondered if he started having phone sex with her and was just done with me, but I never asked her about it. I've never told Julie about any of this. We've lost touch but we're still friends on Facebook, I figured I might ask her about it since we're not close friends anymore so I wouldn't have to worry about loosing anything with her lol.  Eventually our families found out we were talking to strangers on the internet. The three of us got in a lot of trouble over it. I told my family I was talking to him to make sure he was a nice guy and wasn't going to hurt Julie. I never mentioned the sexual conversations or the phone sex to them and denied that anything like that ever happened. The guy we were talking to ended up blocking us.  I don't know if I have any options right now. I'm not too affected by it, just kind of disturbed and disgusted. I know this definitely probably helped to promote my promiscuity as a teenager, but other stuff happened when I was as an even younger child so that probably helped to encourage my promiscuity too, but that's a different fucked up story lol.  Mostly I'm concerned if he did anything to Julie but I can just talk to her about it. My biggest concern is if he would do something like this again to someone else.  I have a handful of chats from my gmail account, I never delete anything. I've also had the same cell phone number since I was 13 so maybe phone records can be reviewed.  I don't really think I can press charges. I'm just worried about him doing it again to someone else.  I know Julie's older brother was talking to Johns younger sister for a while as well, even after our families found out about John. I know he was in a really terrible car accident a couple of years before he talked to us, and he showed us an article about it and it had the name he gave us, so I'm pretty sure he never lied about his name. I know he was becoming a Christian and I think he was involved or going to a Christian school. I think he said he was going to write a book about his accident and his relationship with god. Do you think I should report what happened? Who would I report it to? Would they even be able to find evidence against him or find him? I know I have 2 chats from 2008 about us talking and planning on having phone sex.  What do you guys think?	Yes
I was involved in a road rage incident in which someone fired shots directly at my vehicle as I was driving down the road- one of the rounds hit my car, less than a foot away from me. The perpetrator was arrested immediately and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon. It is a cut and clear case and I believe that this person will be convicted.  I am far from what you would call a proponent of pursuing damages in court, but I believe this individual intended to harm me (or worse). I was extremely shaken up directly after everything happened, but went on about my business as usual after providing my statement to the police, etc. It scared the hell out of me, naturally, but I never expected to have any further problems. Unfortunately, ever since the incident occurred, I have had persistent nightmares and experience panic attacks almost daily. I have missed nearly two weeks of work. I think most people would consider me to be a fairly realistic and level-headed person, but there have been times where I've been afraid to even leave my house due to the admittedly paranoid misapprehension of my assailant stalking me with the intention of harming me. I get anxious every time I see the same kind of vehicle the assailant was driving or if I hear a car backfire, etc.  Basically, I am dealing with quite a lot of unexpected mental woes stemming from an event that was more traumatic than I initially realized. I've given this a lot of thought and I have yet to come to a final decision, but I'd like to know what steps I should take in the event that I do elect to take legal action against my assailant.	Yes
I pled guilty to possession of drug paraphernalia and reckless driving in 2015 in North Dakota. Misdemeanor A and C respectively.   Today i received  mail from the court judge saying I got deferred imposition of the  sentences and my case has been dismissed, and records sealed.    If an employer asks if I've ever had a conviction should I say no? Do i  need to explain all this in my future interviews?	Yes
Does anybody know if they are not allowed to have pages such as Facebook? I ask because my bio father who I refuse to have contact with is harassing me on Facebook. I am constantly having to block a new page of his. If he is not allowed to have these pages I am more than happy to report it to his probation officer. But seeing as I don't know the correct legal information I as of yet have just been blocking him. Every few months or so I'm having to block him to continue having no contact with him like I have continuously told him I do not want. I have minor children that I want him having nothing to do with. 	Yes
Hi, I apologize because I know this is missing details and we're all a bit frantic at the moment.  My sister-in-law was attacked Saturday night / early Sunday morning in San Francisco.  She had been drinking, so not all details are clear.  She got into a ride-share, was attacked, and woke up in Daly City.  She said it is being investigated as attempted murder.  She was never taken to a hospital.  She does not have possession of the police report.  Since this happened in the middle of the night, the police are saying she can only talk with officers who were on duty at the time of the reported crime.  Again, not all details are clear, but it seems to me like getting a lawyer would be smart.  My wife and I are located in the midwest and our sister has no family in California.  Would you advise she contact a lawyer or is she in good hands with the police?	Yes
"My ex who I have been friends with is dating someone new. She tried to befriend me a year ago and I was nice to her. She gave me a bunch of clothes she didn't want and then much later asked for them back but since they were mine I gave them away. She's now saying I stole from her.   My ex gave me 1600 dollars a year ago when my family had a huge rough patch and he and I have no contract of this and he knows I'll pay him back as I earn it but now the new girlfriend is stating she can get me for 1600 dollars.  She's been sending me messages for a year and I've repeatedly asked her to stop and she doesn't. Sometimes I would respond but when I realized she was harassing me I told her to stop and asked my Ex to ask her to quit.   Two days ago I asked my ex a question through text and he ignored me and then I got a text from the girlfriend threatening me. I texted my ex very angrily stating I can't believe he would let someone else talk for him instead of just answering me. It was a low point of very angry texts but not threats. The next day he responds to me like nothing happened.   Now the new girlfriend is rep steely threatening me with her aunt who is a lawyer stating she has ""stuff I stole from her"" and my exes 1600 dollars I owe plus emotional damages that she could put against me. I've been in tears all day wondering if I'm going to end up in jail or with charges. I don't have records of all the harassing messages she sent over the last year because I gave a new phone so it seems like their case could be in their favor since I can't prove how she was harassing me. I have no idea what to do. My family says to ignore her and that she has nothing against me. Please help. "	Yes
I had some misdemeanor charges expunged at the start of the year.  I know at the county level it's complete. They made mention that it can take a bit more time at the state level.  I'm being offered a job and I need to fill out background check info. Im not sure if I should put it on there or not.  I know that some BG check companies 'cache' backgrounds so it might still be listed, but I can't find any info online about my case. The TN site doesn't show anything, but I'm not sure it ever did.  What should I do?	Yes
This is my first time posting to Reddit at all, so bear with me. I took a number of topless photos when I was younger. They were for my own personal use only, and although I shared them in limited capacity, I didn't think much of it (I was in my early 20s and stupid.) The first incident happened in early 2014, and my photos for put on a revenge porn site (if you don't know what those are, you can research them, they're pretty horrible.) I paid money to have them taken down by a DOA site that specializes in that sort of thing, and for 3 years I heard and saw nothing. Now whoever is posting them is back, they used my name and information and pictures on the site fetlife. I had them removed there by the site immediately. Now today I have been informed that someone posted my stuff on Craigslist. No contact info was apparently given (I'm hearing of this one thru a friend) but it was deleted soon after without my intervention.   My question is this. What would be the best action for me? This is a huge invasion of my privacy, and I'm scared. Whoever posts these things makes it seem like I'm into hardcore rape fantasy and noncon, and I feel like my life is in danger from this, considering they put my real name, city in which I live, and updated pictures of me that they gleaned from Facebook (I have it set to completely private but they just grabbed my profile pic I assume.) I would like to take some sort of legal action but I also know that it's incredibly hard to do so.   Tl;dr I'm being repeatedly doxxed with my own pictures and I'm terrified and I want to figure out what to do. I don't know who is doing this, it's not an ex as I have good relationships with all of them. It's someone who just doesn't like me because it's always the same info they use and the same nasty descriptions. Help?!	Yes
I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up. He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.  Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car. He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point... I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt. I also have a text message from a couple weeks ago where he threatens to fight me if I ever talk to him or if he sees me with the girl he was dating (neither of these things have happened but it is still a credible threat).  I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor. I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes. Will they take me in for my warrant? Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted? Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order? Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing. I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.  My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school. Is this a good plan?  Thank you	Yes
Hi all, got arrested for possession of marijuana under 50g. I requested discovery including the dash cam footage, (what they sent me isnt even video from my arrest, it's of some other traffic stop that isn't me) and of course lab results. I am hoping that the lab results will take a long time to come back and eventually the court will be pressed to dismiss the case.  It is actually a significant prejudice to me having to take off of work for the morning only court and drive 1.5 hours away to this courthouse.  In addition to all this, I also received a ticket in the mail for possession of CDS in a vehicle, signed 34 days after the initial arrest. It is my understanding that there is a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic violations , therefore I am submitting a motion to dismiss that ticket.   I am representing myself pro se, and would like to know basically how long is reasonable enough to wait for lab results before I ask for dismissal, and is there in fact a 30 day statute of limitations for traffic tickets?   Thank you all in advanced!	Yes
I'm a 36 year old man.  I live in Massachusetts.    A video went viral recently in a town adjacent mine that showed a group of minors assaulting another group of minors (all about 15).  The aggressors were larger and threw the smaller group to the ground and hit / kicked them while down.  The group being attacked offered no resistance.    As an adult, can I intervene?  Can I pull the aggressors off?  If I'm shoved / hit / kicked, can I fight back?    If I do fight, will I be charged?  If so, would it be child abuse?  If so, could I lose my children (5 y/o twins)?  I know this is a very situation dependent question, but in general, where do you all stand?    Can you intervene?    Would you intervene?  Should you intervene?	Yes
Background: Months of stalking &amp; bedroom peeping that resulted in a 6 month criminal ordeal in which I was the victim witness. I got a harassment prevention order. Criminal charges were dismissed due to prosecution making a clerical error. Currently, there are no active criminal charges, he's not on probation, all I have is the HPO. It was a traumatizing ordeal.  The other day I legally obtained physical(ish) proof that he recently went behind my house (not on property) while I was home, within 50 yds of me (HPO definition), and was in a place where you can see directly into my bedroom windows! Be clear, this was no accident- he went to the window peeping spot and turned around. I desperately don't want to trigger another criminal offense, go to court, etc. I'm trying to move out of state in six weeks and can't be another victim witness.   I was reading my HPO and it says that he can't contact me- but says nothing about me contacting him. Is this something that I can do to tell him to stay away? It would be a carefully worded e-mail (no harassment, want to explain the 50 yd radius and tell him to stay out of it in case he forgot). I'm not sure if I will do it, but just wanted to know if it's legal given the circumstances.  Can I get in trouble for doing that?	Yes
So last night my friend and I were riding home from a concert and were pulled over for speeding. Both my friend and I had sobered up to drive home, so we were not really worried about any DUI or alcohol charges. My friend stated immediately that this was a rental vehicle only he was authorized to drive, and that even if I had to drive I could not. The officer breathalyzed my friend and he was under the limit to continue driving home. The officer proceeds to breathalyze me and apparentely I still had alcohol in my system. Why I was even questioned is confusing to me considering I was only a passenger and had brought no suspicion. So my friend got a speeding ticket and I received an underage for literately sitting in a vehicle driving home. Worth noting this is my second underage charge, even though I participated in a program to have the charge reduced to a disorderly conduct. I also turn 21 in about 20 days so this is a huge and unexpected incovenience. I plan on speaking to an attorney tomorrow regarding this issue, but for now do I have enough to build a case and try to fight this charge? I really do feel wronged and that I should have never been questioned.   Thank you for your help.	Yes
"I am looking for advice on how to proceed with this situation. I've been living in my apartment for 4 years now and we just signed on for a 5th (and final) year. Now while living here I've accepted the trade off where the rent is cheap but the landlord and management company are terrible. We've had plenty of run in's and the landlord is very unprofessional/shady.   Recently I decided to install a security camera in my apartment and it only took 2 days to catch the maintenance man entering our apartment without notice (nobody was home). He is in our apartment for around 5 minutes and ends up leaving with our plunger (this is clearly visible on the recording). The whole incident was not captured on camera (only a few short videos) but I do see him emerge from the hallway where the bedrooms are (so if all he needed was a plunger there would be no reason for him to be back there). We didn't find anything else missing but we can't be sure he didn't take something else. It's been 48 hours since this incident and they still have not notified us of the entry and the plunger is still missing.   Both in our lease and and Chicago RLTO (Resident Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, section 5-12-050) it states that they must give 48 hours prior notice for entrance for regular repairs. There are 2 reasons they are allowed to enter without notice. One is ""in case of emergency"" the second is ""For practical necessity where repairs or maintenance elsewhere in the building unexpectedly require such access;"". The second stipulation is the one I'm worried that they will claim. I actually know the neighbors upstairs who recently moved out and they mentioned to me their toilet being broken. So my understanding is the maintenance man was probably doing repairs in that apartment, needed a plunger, and took ours.  For both of those stipulations if they enter without notice they need to notify us of the entry within 48 hours which that time period has just passed and we haven't heard a word.  How should I proceed? The tricky thing is that the year lease just started (this happened on literally day one of the new lease), and I do want to live here (ideally would like to not have to search for a new place). So if I decided to pursue criminal theft charges...it would be a long 11 months of dealing with the landlord. What do you guys think?"	Yes
I'm not too sure on the details but someone close to me was raped around 4 years ago with the person that they lived with. From my understanding the rape was never violent, but the attacker was repeatedly told no and to stop during the attack. Also the attacker would regularly use alcohol to the extent where my friend would be drunk to the point of passing out (so unable to consent) repeatedly. Attacker has also been slightly violent during arguments (old scars to prove it). Is there anything that can be done?   Also my friend had filed a police report years ago but nothing came of it, my friend believes the police were too lazy to investigate and she never tried again.	Yes
I received a ticket for urinating in public in Fullerton, ca at about 2:30 am after all the bars closed and nowhere to relieve myself. The ticket was marked as a misdemeanor.   I understand that it is mostly at the discretion of the prosecutor and that I should seek an attorney. I'm worried that I won't be able to get the ticket reduced to an infraction because I have a DUI on record from almost three years ago.	Yes
Hello Reddit. I wanted to see if someone could give me some steps to follow to begin work on expunging my felony record in Wyoming? I was charged with delivering a schedule 3 substance and also conspiracy about 15 years ago. I received 2 yrs probation (completed with no issue) for the charges and have not even had a speeding ticket since! I am a totally different person now with a great paying job and a family of 4 that I support. I want to put this behind me for good and would like to be able to vote or have a gun to protect my family if needed. I looked it up and it seems that in Wyoming I would not be disqualified from expungement with my charges but I do not know the first step in getting started. Of course I could start calling lawyers but I thought I would check here first to see if there is anything I can do on my own to save that expense. I am now living in a different state (thank god!) that is far away from there so I can’t just stroll into the local courthouse for help. Thanks in advance for any tips! 	Yes
Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	Yes
The charge is for under 21 alcohol consumption in Deleware County Indiana  Successfully completed a diversion program months ago that involves community service, but not sure if it will show up on a background check for job interviews, etc.  Thank you for the advice.	Yes
Hi r/legaladvice,  When I was 11 y/o I moved to Aurora, Colorado from my home country in Europe. When I was 12, I found a friend in the neighborhood (let's call him Sean, 15 y/o at this point) through my brother (let's call him Edward, 10 y/o at this point) and started hanging out with him. I was culture-shocked and very shy, so I latched on to Sean as my only friend outside of my 4 brothers. Within the first year of hanging out with him, both Edward and I were bullied by him nearly constantly because of a plethora of things 'wrong' or 'weird' about us, usually to reinforce how he was better than us. This escalated to forcing us to get into fights with him, he'd tell us it was what normal kids did, and we'd go along. Since he was so much older than us, he'd just end up beating us up, then laughing and calling us names. Edward quickly got sick of Sean and after failed attempts to talk with him about his attitude, stopped hanging out with us. I was happy when he stopped, because I hated listening to him cry at night about his weight, Sean's favorite part to pick about him. I knew this was the right thing to do, but I kept hanging out with Sean because I felt like he was sad as an only child, and it was my duty to be his friend.  This is when everything Sean used to do started to escalate. Verbal abuse got worse, play-fighting grew into routine punches in my gut, and more things started to develop. As an example, while playing runescape at his house, I started talking with a friend from my childhood. Sean added him without me knowing, and started talking with him. The next day, he showed me screenshots of what my friend had said about me during their conversation on Skype, about how I was oversensitive, annoying, the such. He refused to show me his side of anything he said, and told me I had no friends other than him and that no one loved me, that I was lucky he put up with me. He also found out through my old 'friend' a long-time crush I had been holding, pulled up a photo of her on Facebook and continuously mocked me for liking a girl, telling me no girl'd ever love me, etc.  Later on came the worst parts of my time with him. He'd make fun of me for not knowing about sex or watching porn at 12-13 y/o, so he occasionally would bring it up on his phone and make me watch it, regardless of how many times I'd say no or try to walk away. Then, he would take off his pants and masturbate in front of me, then ejaculate on his couch in the basement, or on the walls. Several times I would run away from him through his house while he was peeing, until he'd corner me and pee on me while laughing. During sleepovers, I wouldn't be given blankets and would try to fit myself on the carpet where there weren't stains from his many ejaculations. Through continuous grooming, he forced me to pull down my pants, and would mock me. A couple of times, he slapped my genital while laughing about it.  There are so, so many more things that happened. He'd lock me in the bathroom, turn off the lights and hold the door because he knew I was terrified to be in there. He'd quickly cover up any of my brothers coming to hang out with us, even would hang up my skype calls from his basement with them. He'd come to my house and very respectfully chat with my parents and ask if I was able to hang out today, my parents were always very impressed by him. Several times while I was home alone, I would hear the door ring and run to hide under my brother's beds. I would hear him come around the house to try every door and look through the windows, then leave. I was constantly terrified of him.  Around two years after the worse of this started, my family moved to Parker, Colorado (30m drive) because of work. By this time, Sean was around 18 y/o. I burned every bridge of communication I had with him, finally being able to escape him without having to face him. Around a year after moving, he came unannounced to my house and asked my parents for me. My parents yelled at me for hiding in the basement when my 'best friend' was here to see me. He came back a few times after that, but I gave him the least amount of attention I could everytime he'd come, and he ended up leaving me alone. I haven't talked to him since.  I'm now nearly 20, and bought myself 6 therapy sessions a few months ago, which has helped a ton with how to cope with PTSD, and many other mental problems I deal with daily. For the record, I Do have a girlfriend! Of 2 years who pushed and supported me to get therapy, and has helped me so much through this. I have a dream job out of college and am finally tasting life again. My therapist strongly believes Sean might be a psychopath, and through experience thinks Sean may have abused other people before, after, or is abusing someone now. He brought up the idea of legal action to me, and I'm trying to find out more about it. I'd like to do something against Sean, because I want him to be finally be responsible for something, and pay for the wrong he did. I don't want anyone else to be abused by him, and feel like I could be the starting stone to make more people come out about him.  So my questions are these:  - What are my next steps, and what am I expecting (should this be a lawsuit, or trying to get him registered as a sex offender? I'm not sure how this works)? - As a greencard holder in the U.S., what can or can't I do? - Am I at risk to somekind of a turn-around in legal actions by him once this starts?  Thanks for reading this far! I'm very open to answering Any question about him, myself, or anything that happened.  Thank you so much for helping.	Yes

When I was homeless, I left my vape out on the window ledge. And after coming back from being scammed by a fake landlord my neighbour was peeping through the fence at me. He had my vape and he turned it on and a vape cloud formed and he was coughing.  Afterwards a signal went off and people surrounded the garden ( either he was trying to scare me. Or he called police in claiming I was trying to attack him, or a mafia. Cameras were popping up in the hedge and I could hear a helicopter and things spraying and trying to shock us.  I've tried reporting this to the police but there's no evidence. The vape cost me £120 and because he is an old man the police would beleive him over me and people would also beleive him over me and my family and parents down beleive me where it happend.  Is there anything I can actually do about this?	Yes
I hear people are banned from a CDL for life if they have 2 DUIs. But what if You never had a CDL before? Guessing it doesn't make a difference. 	Yes
My mother is a realtor. Last year she plead guilty to several criminal charges unrelated to real estate, but her other business. She is currently serving in a probation program for 3 years for those crimes.  Now Real Estate Commission is trying to suspend/revoke her license with possible fines, given that she plead guilty to these crimes (demonstrating poor conduct, dishonesty, etc.), and that she failed to notify them within 30 days (she didn't know she had to do this, and sent the info immediately after getting notice). They are requesting admission/denial of allegations, upon which they will determine if there's any validity to the disputes to warrant a trial. If not, there will be a hearing where we can provide witnesses/evidence which will decide the final penalty/sanction.   Obviously the best scenario is avoiding any trial, and having as minimal penalty/sanction/fines as possible. My mother's previous business closed down, she declared bankruptcy and is 64 years old, so financially she has no money - Being a realtor was how she was making ends meet, so this will be a huge blow. That said, we had a consultation with a lawyer and he's quoting a very high retainer fee and billing rate, which we can barely afford.   Question is: Is it worth it to call the Commission case office directly, before hiring the lawyer, to get an idea of what the possible penalty/sanctions/fines could be in the first place? The lawyer said if we hired him, the first thing he would do is call the Commission to do exactly this, so we're wondering if we can just ask ourselves?   Our rationale for this is if the penalty/sanctions/fines are actually not that bad, we can avoid wasting money on a lawyer. [I've read through actual outcomes of real estate license cases ('disciplinary actions') as they're all online, and it seems like for people who committed crimes unrelated to real estate, and are already serving in a probation program, the penalty/sanctions/fines aren't that bad...] On the other hand, we can confirm that the Commission is considering a harsh penalty and high fines, in which case, we can just go ahead and hire a lawyer to help get them reduced. I'd like to know if asking the Commission about this is a good idea or one that could bite us in the ass?  TL;DR - mother is realtor and might have her license suspended/revoked for crimes unrelated to real estate. Fines may also be imposed. Mother has no money (bankrupt) and 64 years old, so losing license will be devastating. At the same time, potential Lawyer is asking for very high fee. Wondering if we can call Real Estate Commission case officer directly to get an idea of possible sanctions and fines the have in mind, and go from there, OR if this is a dumb idea and we should just hire lawyer.     Thanks in advance for your help.	Yes
They told him it was a federal offence and he had no idea. What can he do?	Yes
I am an 24 year old male executive assistant in MD and I've been working for my boss for 7 years now, she is in her 50's. She was always touchy on the shoulders and what not and I never really thought anything of it... However yesterday was a meeting she's asked me for the last 2 weeks to tag along with, and it's nothing out of the ordinary for me to tag along to these kinds of things. 30 minutes into driving she's realised she has forgotten something at home that is needed for the meeting so she heads there which is about an hour and a half away from the office. We get there and she invites me in, and after 10 minutes comes downstairs with just a towel on and proceeds to tell me that if I don't give her what she wants then I won't have a job when I find my own way back to the office. At this point I'm completely appalled that she is not only serious, but that this is actually happening.   I felt cornered because I love my job, I am paid very well, and I am planning on proposing to my girlfriend very soon and if I did not have this job it wouldn't be possible. I went through with it and I have no idea what to do next. I feel ashamed so I haven't told anyone, because this situation isn't something that happens often. She told me to shower afterwards and I only showered parts of my body in case I needed the other parts to be untouched. I don't know what to do next.	Yes
"Something that made me think a bit recently.   What if a person is looking for ""Chile"" and autocorrect or a mistake makes it to ""child"". Or what if someone searches for ""kind girl"" (because the person might remember that ""kind"" was in the title) without knowing that ""kind"" means ""child"" in German?  It's obvious that no one would really search for this disgusting stuff on renowed websites like Pornhub but how does Pornhub react, if they see that someone allegedly searched for it and how can you prove, that it wasn't your fault?"	Yes
"I was blackout drunk. The girl said nothing happened. Ex-father-in-law said he saw sex. I fought the case for a year. Assistant DA said they were going to bring in an expert to say the girl had ""Stolkholm syndrome"" and felt the need to defend me since she had a history of sexual abuse. Lawyer advised I take a plea for a county year and 5 years felony probation with the requirement that I ""p.c. 290 register while on probation."" That's a direct quote from my minute orders. I finished my probation, without incident and am still stuck on the registration. My lawyer called my charge a wobbler. This was all in California. Is there anything I can do?"	Yes
I'm a 21 y/o male from SD just for reference. So just over a week ago I made the biggest mistake of my life I decided to get behind the wheel drunk. I've done it before after a few beers and I guess I was overly confident in my abilities and thought I was okay to drive. Well anyways I was not at all. I love about a half hour from where I was drinking in a different small town, I left town made it almost all the way to the main highway that would take me home and remembered that I wanted to stop at a store real quick and I knew the closest one closed at midnight so my idiot self decided to speed back into town and go to the store. On my way back in I passed a highway patrol and they pulled me over for going 88 in a 50 (the ticket I received says 88 in an 80 idk if that matters or not also I had an open case of beer in my vehicle but they never mentioned that). Anyways they gave me a field sobriety test and I failed pretty badly then they did a breathalyzer and I blew about a 0.22 so I was arrested and taken straight to the hospital for a blood sample and, honestly it's a little fuzzy, but I believe I asked for representation like a lawyer and they said that they would just get a warrant or I could do it right then and I said fine we'll get a warrant then. Then they took me back to the police station for some of the processing and about an hour or so after I got pulled over they served me a warrant for the blood, we went and did that and when I got back I asked for a phone call so someone could come get me or bail me out or anything and they wouldn't let me they told me I had to sober up first which i guess I understand but they didn't tell me that until after I had made a very big fuss about not getting a call. Now this was my first offense I've never been pulled over before and the only thing on my record is a seat belt violation from right after I turned 18 riding passenger in a car. I just basically wanna know what you guys think of it's even worth getting a lawyer or if I should just plea guilty to the DUI and hope they'll drop the other charges or if maybe I should try to get a suspended imposition and what hopes I might have to jump through. Anything at all will help thanks.  (Also sorry for formatting and grammar issues I'm on mobile)	Yes
I was pulled over yesterday while on my way to work. I had just lit a cigarette and I guess I was swerving a little bit while trying to light it. It was my first cigarette of the day so I had a pretty strong buzz from it. Usually I don't get much of a buzz but that morning I overslept and was late so I hadn't had breakfast and had only woken up about 15 minutes prior. The officer asked why I was swerving and I told him it was because I was looking at my lighter while trying to light it and told him that I guess it had given me a small buzz. At that point I had no buzz but he told me to get out of the car. He made me do all the things that you'd expect if you were driving drunk and I know I had absolutely no problem doing them but he claimed that I was stumbling and having trouble and arrested me anyway.  At this point I just got home and I'm wondering if any of this could possibly stick? I've never heard of being charged for DWI for nicotine. Is this even possible? What do I even do now?	Yes
I had been caught buying mushrooms months ago. I was handcuffed but the detective who had arrested me told me that the incident would be in his notes but due to the fact that they were looking for a serial rapist (that just so happened to fit my description) and that it was my first offense I would be let go. Yesterday two cops came to my door, showed me a warrant for my arrest and took me to jail. I was realeased on bail 18 hours after arrest. At the time I thought that it kind of made sense but now that I've had time to think about it I don't really understand why it took them that long to arrest me. I gave the detective my number and everything but I never received a call or a letter about having to appear in court but all of a sudden there's a warrant for my arrest? I just need some advice because this is my first (and hopefully last) run in with the law.	Yes
I was recently involved in an altercation in Seoul, South Korea including 2 of my other friends. We were semi-sober and we were walking home. We accidentally bump into a Korean National and he decides to grab and hold on to one of my friends. I in my right mind was trying to break up the fight by pulling the Korean guy away from my OTHER friend that was punching the guy to let go of the one he has a grasp on. In the video and from what I remember I was just standing around at one point and yelling at the both of the because they were going at it. I ended up being allegedly accused of an assault charge and so did my both of my friends. When in reality only one of us got into an actual fist fight with the guy. He was 30,000,000 Korean Won (which is about 30k roughly) from all 3 of us and all of us being a minor we have no way to compensate. Need advise on what I should do/what could happen to me in this case. Thanks	Yes
I'm still in disbelief of what happened yesterday.   So my sister got drunk alone after an argument with her husband. She drank at least 2 12oz beers. She's small, so it effected her noticeably.   She then commences a shitstorm on Facebook, arguing with random strangers on a parenting page, on how to be a proper parent. Oh, the irony.   Anyhow, she tells me about it, explaining how she was in the right and everyone else was flat out wrong. I disagreed with her and pointed out the dangers of exposing your identity like that to random strangers.   That sparked a heated argument.   Long story short;   *Sshe got in the car with her kids  * I got behind the car to note down her plate numbers   * She then backs up into me without any regards for my safety  * I stand in front of the car as I call the police  * She speeds towards me, probably thinking I will move out the way  * I jumped on the hood  * She accelerated over 30 mph to get me off, presumably   * She stops, I get off because I was convinced she will kill me  * Once I was back inside the house, I noticed the booster seat by the door, meaning she drove off drunk with at least on kid, both under 5 years of age, without proper safety measures    .................  This all happened yesterday. She is not home, as I imagine she does not want to face the consequences. But I am ignorant of the law, so I do not know how to proceed.   Can she be charged with a DUI the next day once sobered down?  What charges can I have against her?  I would prefer to keep the family together, but she cannot get away without some form of punishment.	Yes
I'm hoping this will be coherent but my head is still kind of spinning so we'll see.   My brother(M21) and his fiancé(F26) have twin boys (6 months). They are not married, they rent an apartment together. He is sole earner, she stays home with the kids. He is an alcoholic, he's textbook abusive (gas lighting, emotional abuse and two weeks ago he pushed her around enough to leave bruises) and it has come to light he's been cheating for who knows how long.   My SIL (for lack of a better term) is at a loss of what to do. She's at her mother's with the kids, but apparently there is nothing legally stopping my brother from forcefully taking the kids and going to NJ. SIL is concerned for the kids safety, my brother consistently drives drunk. She has photo evidence of the bruises he left, the cheating, the horrible things he says to her. But she doesn't have the money to retain a lawyer. And he has grandparents who are well off and have paid his way out of trouble for 21 years. He keeps threatening her that if she leaves, she'll never see the boys again and that his grandparents will pay for the best lawyer to destroy her.   Please help me find resources for her. What options does she have? Will she lose her kids to someone so toxic and harmful?	Yes
I was charged with a few serious but meritless crimes. I did the whole song and dance for over a year and finally everything has been np and now expunged.    I wanted to know how long does the final(?) step of expungement take? I have copies of the signed Expungement Orders from the judge which have been filed (last week) and sent to the state police.    Different attorneys I spoke to in passing gave me answers ranging from 48 hours to 6 months. Does anyone know when these charges will disappear? 	Yes
Not me but a relative was fired today after 6 months working for a company. Their reason was that he did not inform HR of his conviction. This was his first job after prison and he was required to provide the halfway house he lived in a signed agreement confirming employment. His bosses both knew of the conviction from the interview forward. Even signed said document the prison system required.   Arkansas is right to work. But is there a case against the employer here? If not, is there a case to still get unemployment? They said he would not be eligible for failure to disclose the conviction to HR.   Please help! Thanks.	Yes
Tomorrow I have a court date for a petty larceny charge. I've already been arraigned and this will be My second court date. My lawyer called me up this morning and told me he won't be able to be there tomorrow, and to show up and ask for an adjournment and he said the judge will have no issue granting this.  Is there anything I should worry about regarding this?	Yes
"My rap sheet consists of 1 DUI, which most companies I want to work at don't consider to be a disqualification. I got a job offer at my dream company and now I have to wait on the background check. I've seen a report from a background check company before and it has all ""gory details"" of the court case, including aggravating factors that were ultimately ignored. Can a background check company use all that info against me or can they only report on the fact that I have a *Gross Misdemeanor - Driving Under the Influence, 1st Offense*."	Yes
Hello reddit. Yesterday someone had posted a redirect link to a drive on mega on 4chan with spanish video files with cp in the title of each. When translated they were words like little boy. I reported them since they seemed like cp but there was no way to confirm without downloading, and i did not want to download it.   There is good news and bad news. The good news is that the link is removed but the problem is that after I reported I found out that it was a UK based service. I am not sure what to do now as I am an American. Thanks for helping.	Yes
When I was 14 I had to go to the diversion program for having a utility knife on school grounds, now at 17 I was in the car while my friend was pulled over and there was an empty beer bottle on the ground, I had took a few sips of it prior and it showed on the breathalyzer, I now have court on sept 6th. Will what happened before come back? What's going to happen to me and what should I do? I've always wanted to join the army, is that out of the window?	Yes
"I was arrested approx. 12 months ago due to DUI. However, I blew barely above the legal limit, and only failed the field sobriety test because it was extremely cold outside and I was shivering, something the officer noted in the police report. On my court date, the cold, along with discovery that the breathalyzer was far past calibration date resulted in the DUI being dropped and I received a ""Failure to Reduce Speed"" charge. As my lawyer explained it, this was very good because usually if the DUI gets dropped, which is rare, you receive a Reckless Driving. Regardless, my license was suspended due to the DMV being a separate entity as I understand it. My question now is, I've now graduated college and am applying for serious jobs that inquire about previous arrests and such. Is there a particular way to go about explaining what happened? I will definitely seek legal advice in person ASAP, was just curious what Reddit would advise. Thanks!"	Yes

Wife tried to reserve a beach house for this summer, and the long story short, she was being scammed by a guy through craigslist. Since this was a family reunion that we were planning, we decided to pay from one account (family gives money for the trip to father in law, he pays the supposed land lord through pay-pall). Total sum stolen was about $1800.   What is the best course of action from here? We have the persons phone number and 2 of his bank account numbers. We tried to contact the banks with no support from either. Options?   Thanks in advance.	Yes
After I was rear ended I was assaulted badly, as was my then a minor girlfriend, by the other driver. The officer who handled the situation charged me with harassment (violation) for claims that I shoved the guy, and he was not charged with assault on either account. The officer also did not include witness information for several people (including 2 vehicles with multiple people who let me sit in their car after I was beaten), only 2 workers from a nearby business who claimed I stopped short causing the accident (accident photos show otherwise, which the officer refused to look at and did not take a statement from me at the hospital).  My attorney sent a FOIL letter and something else to the police requesting the 911 call (my girlfriend called immediately after the accident and stayed on the phone until the police arrived 10 minutes later, through me and her being assaulted, drivers stopping to help us, etc.)  The department responded saying they will not release the tapes without a subpoena.   From what my lawyer explained, due to something called Brady Material, and the Freedom of Information Act, those tapes should have been handed over, especially since they would help prove my innocence and go against the police report.   Suffolk County, NY	Yes
I was a arrested months ago and was charged with possession of marijuana, cocaine, and paraphernalia. My question has to do with how charges interact with eachother.   Basically me and my friend got pulled over and the cop took me and him out the truck when he saw weed and a pipe. At this point we were under arrest for possession of weed and para, i had the coke in my pocket. The cop was asking to search my pockets but i told him no, he left for a lil bit then came back saying me and my friend are splitting the possession of weed and that gave him the right to search my pockets. Then he found the coke and everything happened.  I heard from some people that I could go into court and tell the judge it was not my weed and i was just riding in the truck and get it dropped as long as he said the same thing and did the probation for the charge.   Would this mean that the coke is inadmissable because they found it saying it was my weed? Are charges independent from stuff like that once they become official? This is my first offense and am looking to do the pretrial aversion, so would just having the coke charge be easier to deal with than three? Im just wondering if this is worth doing or if I am going to be doing the same thing wether i manage to get the weed charge off or not.  All input is appreciated, Thanks	Yes
I'd rather not provide the state I'm from with the high-controversy surrounding this fragile topic, etc.	Yes
My friend was accused of sexual assault and she never used the words no, stop or anything of a similar sense to convey she did not wish to continue. It was oral and hands if that makes a difference. She is spreading around that he raped her and he is scared that he will get sent to jail. He was 15 at the time of the alleged assault and is currently 17. Live in canada. What can he do to protect himself or legally go after her without ruining his life.	Yes
I'm so flustered right now, and trying to type on mobile. Apologies for incoherences or confusion, I just have no idea what to do.   So, as far as I know the Bureau of Narcotics Investigation and Drug Control officers visited my home this afternoon while I was at work. My wife is a stay at home mom, 4 kids whom were all always with grandparents by some stroke of luck. They confiscated 24 plants that have been growing for a few weeks. They said they had pictures of my wife and I watering them. She took all the blame and said I had nothing to do with it, attempting to compartmentalize the damage. She also told them she was growing for someone else, so now they're pressuring her to flip on someone. Problem is, that's a lie. It was all personal because we have zero connections right now. I wish she would have just asked for a lawyer, but what's done is done. They also confiscated our paraphernalia, a couple pips, bongs, grinder, etc.   I'm worried about her going to jail. Neither of us have anything on our records, but I'm hearing PA had mandatory sentencing. I need to get her a lawyer, but I'm also barely surviving on my current income. The fines will ruin us if the lawyer fees don't first. And the fact she would be a felon means most of her career options are impossible (she got her MBA while raising kids).   I just want to leave the state for greener pastures, but I we have to deal with this. Who do I contact, what do I do? Any advice is appreciated.    Sincerely Yours, Sobbing and Sorry Pot Growers in PA	Yes
Location Vic/ Australia  I received a caution/ drug diversion for possession/ being under the influence of LSD along with a caution for possession of a air rifle last year (I'm young and stupid, that's a cop out but that's the truth).   I'm currently trying to apply for a working visa for Canada and for jobs. They ask about previous convictions and cautions including driving offences. I understand it's in my best interest to be truthful but I also know it could ruin my chances to mention these offences.   What I want to know is will they show up on a background check for my visa? I was told by police they wouldn't show up on police records checks for work as they are only cautions but I don't know if the visa application is more in depth.   Tl;dr received cautions in aus, will they show up on visa application for Canada?	Yes
I have my court date coming up for getting pulled over with weed in my car. I was arrested and I got out on a PR bond. I'm not really sure what to expect or what I should plea. Any suggestions?	Yes
Hi Reddit! So I'm in high school and today my friend told me that she was sexually assaulted last night. The events of the night go as follows. She was drunk at a party and she needed a place to crash. A guy (the rapist) offered his place. She went over and was pretty much blacking out at this point. He gave her the bed and left her be for a bit. Later that night, assuming she wouldn't be able to remember, he took off her clothes and forced him to give him a handjob. How does she seek legal recourse for his actions????	Yes
"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this, and it's very long, but I'll give it a shot. Disclaimer: I already know I made poor choices and deserved what I got. Just asking for advice.  I was out very late on a Saturday and didn't want to stay at any of my friends' places (1st mistake). Ended up on a train to my parents' house late at night. My dumb self fell asleep on the train (not even drunk, just exhausted) and missed my stop. This was late at night and I didn't want to wait 20 mins for nearest uber, so I just got in the first cab that showed up at the station(also stupid, I know). This is a suburb of New York City and the cab was private. Cab driver doesn't tell me how much the fare is going to be but says flat out he will only accept cash. The ride was 15 minutes...I figured it would be a ripoff, had $20 in cash and called my dad to let him know I'd need him to come out with more cash for the guy. Dad agrees, all is well. The guy had a dispute over $3 with the girl I shared the cab with, who got dropped off before me. Cursed her out even though she did give him the (very overpriced) fare. He got nasty with me after she left and said $40 for you, do you hear me?! Fine. I tell my dad the exact amount. I'm a girl, alone at night, and look younger than I am. I just wanted to go home and neither my dad nor I cared about the fare amount at this point.  We get to the house and he says to give him $40. I open my bag for the $20 and start to explain, and my dad is waiting there with the door open ready to come give the guy cash. Without even letting me get a word in this guy locks the doors, speeds up and won't let me out of the cab. He says ""If you don't give me my f***ing money you're never getting out of this car."" Okay dude I'm trying to tell you that you're going to get your money. I'm terrified and just unlock the door and jump out while the car's still moving. I guess he slowed down out of surprise because I managed not to bust my face open. I call the cops with his plate # and they run my license and presumably his (I was explaining to my mom what happened and my dad was outside talking to the cops so I'm not 100% sure if they ran the guy's license, but I would assume so for the police report). Cops basically talk me out of doing anything because ""You have to understand, he's probably had people try and skip out on fares before."" Fine, I get it, I'm sure there are a lot of jerks out there who rip off cab drivers. But if he actually thought I was trying to stiff him, why not keep me in the car in front of the house and call the cops unless someone in the house brought him money? Like, isn't that the logical thing to do instead of driving off with someone (who doesn't have the full fare anyway) against their will and threatening them?  Also, the guy got out of the car to start screaming at my dad. While he did this my dad grabbed the car keys so he couldn't leave until the cops got there. The guy then told the cops my dad kidnapped him. Technically he did take his car keys but only to keep him from driving off before the cops could get here, after he sees his daughter run down the block out of a moving vehicle at 4:30 am. He didn't keep him there to hurt him. But the cops ultimately said they couldn't charge this guy for kidnapping without charging my dad as well.  Again, I realize I made dumb decisions and realize why the guy could assume I was trying to skip out on a fare. But does that really justify what he did? I was terrified out of my mind..you can't just drive off with someone against their will. Or can you?"	Yes
"Guys, I'm still really hurting so I don't really want to go into too much detail. I'd like to preface this by saying, I'm aware I'm most likely the one who is going to suffer with this, I'm posting here to have an idea of what I'm looking at...  Essentially (I'm going to make this as brief as possible). I've been seeing this girl for the past 6 months, but we've had a thing for about 7 or 8 years now, but between me having a gf at the time and then moving country, it was only really 6 months ago we actually ""finally connected"". Anyway, so about 3 weeks she starts going cold on me, I ask her what's up and she's says nothing. I knew straight away what was happening so I asked ""are you seeing someone else""? Like I said, its fine because we've always been on and off, no real strings attached. I admit, i'd fallen hard for her. She'd spent the last 6 months telling me she loved me and all that. But either way, I wasn't too mad/sad because I we live in different countries now and we both knew whatever we were going to have would be most likely temporary. But bare in mind, we'd been crazy for each other since we first met.  So anyway, I spend the next couple of weeks just trying to get her be honest, I didn't mind if she wanted to cut things off with me, just honesty. She eventually made a ""play"", saying that I'm being pedantic and that of course she loved me and only me etc.. so we met up, and we cuddled that night, and I just couldn't help myself. I went on her phone, I NEEDED to know. Turns out I was just her side bit. She'd been talking to her ex the whole time, and the only reason we started up again was because he'd gone cold on her and she wanted attention.  Next morning, normal stuff, she goes on her way (thinking she convinced me that play) and I obviously don't say a word. Later that night I just say ""wish you'd been honest, was nice knowing you"". Obviously I was a bit hurt, but I was also finally ""free"".  But about 2 days later, I saw her with her ex. I was in my car just going to go get some food. They were talking and having a coffee etc and I was legit fine. In a sense I was happy because they had in fact been together for quite a while (who am I to get in the way). But then he put his hand on her shoulder, and kissed her, and I just couldn't handle it.  I know this is no justification for what I did, truly, but bear in mind this guy used to beat the shit out of her. She used to send me pictures and she'd call me crying.  I stepped out of my car, completely blind, I can't even remember if I put the handbrake on, and just steamed towards him. It was all over so quick, I mean, now it just feels like some messed up dream... Her screaming begging me to stop, and I just couldn't help myself. All I could picture were the pictures she used to send me. So without getting into detail, I got into my first fight. I regret in a way now, I didn't think I could go so far....  Tl:DR; Beat the shit out of a girls abusive boyfriend, no weapons involved. Definitely broke some bones. I am not proud of it believe me, this has been one of the worst experiences of my life. I just want to know what to expect if he presses charges...   By the way, if the story is unnecessary let me know and I'll remove it, thank you."	Yes
"Long story short I got a vandalism charge, and went back the next day to pay the owner for the damage.  It was exactly 250 and the arresting officer ""added"" additional damages to get a felony arrest so it was originally vandalism over 500.  I didn't realize until I got my background check that it is incorrect and has been on my record this entire time.  So that makes me think the amount that I paid my probation was incorrect as well.  What steps can I take to getting this fixed and correcting it to a ""misdemeanor"" which is what it should have been in the first place."	Yes
"I just opened a letter containing a warrant for not attending the court mandated, ""Mothers Against Drunk Driving"" class. It's not a good excuse, but the deadline slipped my mind as I've been focused on completing my 3 month DUI program (weekly group sessions, 6 weekly education classes, 3 AA meetings). In fact, I'll be done with the program this Friday.  I called a bail bonds place and he said they could put the bail ahead of time or something like that, where they would schedule a court date. But he also mentioned for a misdemeanor warrant, he doesn't expect I would have to do any jail time.   My question: what should I expect going to court tomorrow? The letter states to come in at 8:30 Monday-Friday. If I try to handle it without the bail bond and try to show up at the court and attempt get and extension with a public defender, will I be arrested on the spot? I'm just struggling for cash, so I want to know if paying the bail bonds place ahead of time is absolutely necessary."	Yes
A friend of mine got caught sending a lot of grams of Molly through the mail .he doesn't know if the website or the person he was getting it for set him up .  He's ready to flee the country . Is there any of options for minimal jail time or to get out of it he can take ? From PA please need advice asap 	Yes
I'm pretty sure it happened when I just turned 16...  it's still on my record as a misdemeanor. How do I go about getting this off?	Yes
He freaked out on her and then tried to cover it up saying he was giving the cards back to the respective customers in an effort to get them a better deal on their phones/plans. Shady as fuuuuck. I am certainly not a lawyer, but this smacks of fraud to me.   Question: legally, what specifically is this considered? I'm telling her to seek legal advice, but I need her to understand the gravity of the situation (if there is indeed gravity).  Thanks in advance.	Yes
I'd like to take care of my warrant from June 2016. The warrant is for failure to appear for a violation of probation for not showing up to probation (I'm on probation in a county 7 +hours away).   I was convicted of domestic battery and sentenced to:  60 days in jail  3 years probation  52 weekly classes  Restitution  Probation would have expired April 2017, but it has been revoked since June 2016. I believe that would make it 10 months left.   Classes were finished October 2015, but I still owe most of the restitution.   What kind of time am I looking at and what's the best way to minimize that?  Is it more likely they will entirely revoke probation and I serve out the max one year minus 60 days served?  Or is it possible to avoid/minimize jail time and get off probation if I pay entire restition balance?   Also, I'm 7+ hours north of Ventura. Is there a way to hire an attorney to appear 977 for my mandatory appearance ? The protective order expired in April 2017.   Thanks for the advice!	Yes
I'm 15 and got caught stealing at Walmart I know I'm really dumb so don't bother commenting saying I'm dumb i know I am for this but in all honesty I need to know What my options are here . I stole under $30 worth of merchandise (2 iPhone chargers) and they caught me and took me to a room and officers came and wrote me a ticket or whatever . I gave them my first and last name as well as the first initial to my middle name but keep in mind this happened in Texas and I live in Florida. I gave the officers my old house address which is a rental house and they said I have until august 7th to go to court and pay a fine or they will put out a warrant for my arrest. So the question is should I tell my parents or just leave it alone and don't worry about them trying to find me back in Florida ? since they don't have my real address. Will they be able to put a warrant for my arrest in Only Texas since this all happened in Texas or Florida too ? or would they still be able to find me? can I pay this over the phone without showing up to court since I leave Texas tomorrow ?  	Yes
"Hello. This sort of thing never happens to me when I'm out so I'm just looking for advice/info.  My friends and I were out at a bar last night, one friend and I were a bit drunk and being stupid, there was a cup of plastic forks/knives on the table and we spilled it over (admittedly this was immature and stupid on my end but I would have cleaned it up). As we do this a bartender walks up to my friend and grabs his shirt and demands he comes with him. So I interjected and said no don't go with him. Then another bartender comes up and physically slams me to the ground, then straddles on top of me for over a half hour. Meanwhile he is aggressively pulling my left arm over my throat and choking me, so I try to fight back and get him off me. He's also laughing at me and saying things like ""you're a faggot. You can't do shit. No one is going to help you"". Then my cell phone falls out of my pocket and another worker walks over, picks it up and takes it away somewhere.  Eventually after a half hour of struggling they let me up and leave, and I had to argue with multiple workers to give me my property back. The guys wouldn't give me their names of course.  I woke up today with a large bruise on my right arm, my left rotator cuff is killing me, and my neck is red.  They could have easily asked us to leave or thrown me out the door, but instead they brought me close to the back of the restaurant and assaulted me.   Can businesses/bars do this to customers? Do I have any legal action I can take? Multiple of my friends witnessed and are willing to testify.   Thanks so much. This was ridiculous."	Yes
"Hello, I am a 23 year old male with no past criminal or any legal history. I was camping with friends in Acadia National Park in the state of Maine and we bone-headedly didn't realize that the land inside the park is federal and not part of Maine. We were caught with a small amount of weed and given US District Court Violation Notice that charges me with 36 CFR 2.35 (b) (2), ""possession of a controlled substance marijuana."" The park ranger repeatedly told me it was an ""infraction"" that would not appear on public record if I simply pay the fine to the Central Violations Bureau as documented in the notice. Is this true? Ive been reading online and have gotten conflicting information. Will this show up on my criminal record? What impact could it have on my professional-life or future? I am also planning on getting a 1 hour legal consultation. What would be the best ways of finding a good lawyer to talk to about this? Also I plan on calling the Central Violations Bureau tomorrow. Are there any specific questions that would be good to ask them? Sorry for all the questions I'm just really nervous about this. Thank you, for taking the time to read this and any help I receive!"	Yes
My boyfriend's mother is apparently pretty controlling. I have met her several times and she always seemed nice, but I have come to learn that it was a facade. One day, she was upset at my boyfriend about something. He had band practice, and she threatened that if he wasn't back by a specific time that she would report his car stolen. I don't know if she would have actually done this had he not been back in time.  He is 21 and not a minor.  Pretty sure actually filing the false report would be illegal, but is threatening to do so also illegal? This is mostly hypothetical because I am sure it wouldn't even be worth pursuing and risking my boyfriend getting cut off and unable to afford school, but I'd like to know.	Yes
"So I am pretty frustrated... someone I know is currently incarcerated (I'll call him Steve) and in the prison there are a few select TVs that inmates can have in their cells. For whatever reason the prison leaves it up to the inmates to arrange the buying and selling of the TVs when someone who has one is released. So an inmate who has a TV, Jay, is being released tomorrow (Monday). Steve wanted to buy the TV from Jay so we arranged that I would meet up with Jay's father, Sean, and give him $110 for it, then he would let Jay know he received the money, and give Steve the TV.  However, after giving Sean the $110, he claimed to let Jay know he received it, however Jay has not given Steve the TV, claims his father did not receive the money, and in fact has ""sold"" it to someone else by having their family member western union money somewhere and is in the process of ""selling"" it to another inmate as well! The TV remains in his cell. I have no idea what his plan is when he leaves tomorrow and owes 3 people this TV. And Sean has stopped responding to my text messages and phone calls about returning my $110.  My question is, if Steve does not receive the TV (which is seeming incredibly likely) is there ANYTHING I can do legally? Is theft by deception even a crime in PA? I don't know if Jay and Sean are their real names even, but I have ""Sean""'s phone number and the text message where it was laid out that we were meeting up to exchange the money for the TV. And they can obviously check to see that Steve has not received the TV in the jail. It's just extra complicated bc everything between Jay and Steve and Steve and I was verbal obviously."	Yes
Hi all, I am not directly involved, the guy was an ex from 15 years ago who went to jail for a terrible thing against his now ex wife, got out on a technicality, initiated contact with me and over a 6 month period threatened repeatedly to harm her family. I was asked to submit the proof by a mutual friend to police and I did. Ex wife got restraining order and seeking a harassment charge. He did 3 months in jail waiting on trial, and was released last week as trial date was pushed back into next month. His sentencing guidelines for the new charge are 1-3 months of jail time, credit time served. Confirmed with prosecutor's office, that there will be no jail time and they can offer me NO protection order, nothing. Basically they just want me to testify so they can slap him with a felony that will prohibit his job search and he can put blame on me.   I have a baby, no time off work, no reliable transportation to cross a mountain pass to GET to this trial 4 hours away... this is all so irritating. Should I be getting a lawyer to try to get out of this? CAN I get out of this? They have no ability to skype, legal assistant says they want witnesses present to jury can read body language.... I feel like Im being used here for nothing and they cant protect me and I just need some advice man. Can I get out of this?	Yes
I accepted a small gift from a vendor that provides resources to the public company I work for with the gift being worth about $5. This was an informal chance meeting where the vendor was throwing a mixer and I recognized them, we talked for a bit and they then gave me that gift which I took without even thinking about it. Apparently someone reported this to my company because HR is now calling me in for multiple sessions of intense questioning. I have no authority at my job, I'm just a lower level cog with nobody under me and no purchasing power.   Am I looking at jail-time or a felony? That's what they hinted at in the meetings.	Yes
"I recently went to purchase a new firearm and I was denied. I have a clean record. So I called the local police to see what the issue is. They responded with saying ""on the Attorney General's database I'm listed as suicidal by another towns police department."" Next I called that town that has me falsely listed as suicidal ( mentally ill). The lieutenant in that town told me ""he will not remove the suicidal listing unless he gets a court order."" I then questioned him on how and why he's doing this. He said ""it had to do with a case I was involved in durning 2014."" That case was a misdemeanor vandalism. I received a one year filing, then the case was expunged. At no point did anything ever come up about being suicidal or mentally ill. I told the lieutenant ""how do you have proof that I'm suicidal? No doctor, psychiatrist, or professional in the mental health industry made any of these decisions."" He responded with I will not remove it unless I get a court order. At this point I realized he's just gonna keep giving me the same answer.    My constitutional right to bear arms is being revoked from me because of his lie.   Also when this vandalism case happened in 2014 the police took all my firearms and ammunition from me then gave it all back after we were done in court.   If this officer really thought I was suicidal why did he give me back nine firearms and a bunch of ammunition?  What do I do to clear my name?  It seems like I have to sue the towns police department.  Also what kind of case do I have here?"	Yes
I recently got caught with 5 tabs of acid and got a court citation. What should I expect when I go to court and what should I expect to receive as a punishment. I live and got caught in Vermont	Yes
I'm living in Indiana. My girlfriend was on seekingarrangements and she met up with this investment banker who said he was making 500k a year and was going to pay her $500 to meet him at a hotel. At the hotel, she gets a bad feeling about him and says that never mind she doesn't want to go through with it. He hadn't paid her anything yet. He got all angry then saying she wasted his time and had to at least suck his dick. He was going to let her leave. So she pulled a gun on him and he was scared and gave her the money. She blocked him on seekingarrangement but he had her number so he texted her and found her address and facebook and is threatening to come over to her house and report her to the police and tell them that he robbed her. But really, can he even do that since what he was doing is against the law too.	Yes
I’ve been doing some research and learned that felons ( and those convicted of lower level crimes ) have been turned away at the Canadian border.  I’d like to visit Canada ( Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, etc. ) but I’d like to figure out process of gaining entry first before wasting my time and being turned away at the border.  As far as my criminal history is concerned, 16 year’s ago I was charged and convicted of withholding information ie. not snitching.  This was a federal charge.  I haven’t had any issues with obtaining employment.  I was able to get into college and get my degree as well.    I’m not much for making excuses and letting life hold me back.  That being said, I do like to be proactive and be prepared and that’s why I’m posting about this on this sub.  So, what can I do to be have a chance at being allowed entry into Canada as a visitor/tourist/sightseer?  Will I need legal representation?	Yes
The Title says it all. I know I could find this info by doing some digging, but I'm extremely lazy. A friend of mine wants to know for whatever reason. he lives in Colorado but goes to school here with me in Louisiana. I know that it's probably not legal in either state, but if it's not what would the penalties be? Misdemeanor, Felony? And what would the fines look like, etc.	Yes
I have these neighbors who have 6 dogs and 4 cats. Over double the legal limit for both animals and every time I go over and when I'm at my house I can see and hear them being beaten and abused. What are my options? Do I call animal control? What are my boundaries legally as far as helping/ protecting theses animals? Pls help!	Yes
"I want to make this short so people will read this and give me advice, cause I've never been in this much trouble before.  I'm a 19 y/o male college student, and I was arrested a week ago while sitting in my car in a neighborhood near my house (I was alone). Cops searched my car and found my mason jar, which contained:  - ~14 grams of marijuana (in two different bags)  - A pea-sized amount of wax (hashish), with a paperclip  - A grinder  - 3 packs of rolling papers  - A small bag of tobacco  - A paintbrush that smelled of marijuana (I used it to clean my grinder)  I stupidly lied to my arresting officer when he initially asked if I had drugs in the car, they searched my car with probable cause, and after that I was cooperative. The cop asked ""why did you lie to me?"" then said ""Nevermind you don't have to answer that"" so I never admitted to having knowledge of the marijuana (not that it matters.. I was my car).  Also, I had not been smoking that day, and the officers knew that (they let me drive my car home after they booked me), so DUI isn't an issue.  I was charged with a misdemeanor. I have already hired a lawyer, and he contacted my arresting officer, and the officer agreed to bring it down to a disorderly conduct. But, my lawyer said I was going to have trouble getting the District Attorney to agree to that due to the amount and the wax/rolling papers.  Any advice or sympathy would be much appreciated, this is my first brush with the law and it's really scary. Thank you in advance!!"	Yes
I live in Ontario, Canada.  My sibling has hereditary back problems and gets massage therapy or something to help with it, but this requires a doctor's note/prescription or something (I'm honestly not certain of the details). They have mentioned to me how my school's insurance covers a good chunk of the cost if I were to try it out, so I said sure and asked my doctor for a note as well, which was very willingly given to me. I never ended up using it, so my sibling took the note and used it for themselves. They then asked my mother for my student number and made an account under my name on my school's insurance website or whatever to claim back some of the money they spent on the massage stuff, without my knowledge or consent (I heard about this through my mother). I'm pretty sure this is insurance fraud and identity theft; please correct me if I am wrong. What can I do? How can I stop them from doing more of this?	Yes
"Tuesday around 2:30 AM a couple friends and I were leaving a bar. I knew I was drunk and shouldn't drive, but this isn't about me justifying myself. Well, I was heading from one parking lot to the other across the street to take my friends back to their cars, where someone would have taken me home or I would have Uber'd (more on that later). I turned left on a road where I didn't know there was a median, crossed the street, got to my destination, but before I could pull into the lot I had lights on me. Since I already knew I was driving on the wrong side of the road like an idiot, I figured that's what I was being pulled over for. It was. However I just left the bar, I had 3 (and a half) beers between 10:30 PM and 2:30 AM, so I'm sure I smelled, or my non-driver smashed passenger did. Officer has me do field sobriety tests, I probably failed, but while under the impression my sentence would he lighter if I blew, I consented and went along with it.  Blew a 0.121, arrested, and I was allowed to leave the station with my stepdad.  Totally cool with paying the fines and the 90 day suspension and even the classes as I know I shouldn't have been driving drunk, even if it was just to cross the street. Got off lucky that no one was hurt, I acknowledge that. The important part for me is when my court date came, the judge told me I was being charged with 2 counts of DUI, one for driving and one for blowing over the limit, meaning my first offense is counted as my second. He said I'm facing something like 180 days in jail/10k fine/1 year suspension. I wasn't even in the car for 5 minutes. Sidenote: my breaks are broken and I was driving my brother's car. How big of an issue is this? (Again, I know I shouldn't have, even to cross the street, but honest to God I was JUST crossing the street, I was not driving home. I was on the wrong side of the road, so me getting pulled over is justifiable, I just didn't think it through. I would have gotten pulled over sober because I'm just stupid.) Though it's not my place to say, is that ""fair""? I have an attorney who I can hopefully afford, but I can't meet with him until Friday. I just need some peace of mind, and knowing how much trouble I'm in could definitely help me prepare mentally."	Yes
I am engaged to a prisoner who is being held at a detention center in Maryland. He is currently awaiting trial. For a number of reasons, we would like to be married as soon as possible.  I do have an appointment with a lawyer of my own later this week but wanted to see if anyone could advise if our plans would result in a valid marriage.  I have gotten a family member ordained online already. Our plan is for me to pick up the marriage license, and after the 2 day waiting period, have the ordained family member pronounce us married during a visit.  Would this wedding be considered valid? There is a chapel and he can put in a request, but we prefer to do this as outlined above.  Thanks for any insight you can offer.	Yes
So my other post is on here but I'll cut to the chase now. My ex has a RO against me and I found a video on my google drive that was connected to my old phone of her sexually assaulting and raping me in my sleep. I called the police and they are having an officer call me back. She took the footage on my phone while i was asleep. I can't get in trouble for having this footage can I? Should I not report? Please help. The officer should be calling me any minute.  	Yes
update from-  https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6cog03/local_deputy_sheriff_not_abiding_by_us/  North Carolina § 14-223.  Resisting officers. If any person shall willfully and unlawfully resist, delay or obstruct a public officer in discharging or attempting to discharge a duty of his office, he shall be guilty of a Class 2 misdemeanor. (1889, c. 51, s. 1; Rev., s. 3700; C.S., s. 4378; 1969, c. 1224, s. 1; 1993, c. 539, s. 136; 1994, Ex. Sess., c. 24, s. 14(c).)  So since the charge, I have met with a Lawyer, who told me he could get the charges dropped without ever going to court. He has a sheet/waiver to sign that pretty much said I was okay with him going to court on my behalf but didn't want me to sign it as I already stated, he said it would never make it to court. Well, weeks have passed and I have not heard from him. I emailed him a few documents (Eagle Scout certificate, etc) that could help demonstrate my character. He never emailed back and my court date was today at 9 AM EST. I still haven't heard from him should I be worried? Also just a note- the lawyer was highly recommended by many people I know, as well as he had great reviews online.	Yes
"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons.  Last night, I was getting off of work at around 11:30pm.  I received a text from a former HS friend that he was stranded and needed a ride.  I don't hang out with this kid, virtually ever, and I haven't really even spoke to him much as of recent.  In all honesty, since HS really...  But I did run into him over the weekend, which is how we re-touched base and he mentioned to me that he was going through a bit of a rough patch, and to top it all off, didn't have a car because it was in the shop.  He texted me an address, and I figured since I was heading back toward that area it wouldn't help to pick the kid up.  I'm generally a very nice guy, sometimes too nice maybe.  Anyway, not within 45 seconds, as we were pulling away, a cop starts tailing me.  I turned once, and as soon as we approached a stoplight, his sirens go off.  Now initially I was a little confused, I wasn't sure why we were being pulled over.  Immediately my friend to the right of me goes ""aw fuck.""   Apparently, he had some weed on him (not much, 4-5 grams), and ""forgot about it"" until the cop was right behind us with his sirens on.  So, I tried to stay calm.  I figured maybe this was just a fluke, a coincidence; that I had made a rolling stop or whatever.  Well, before I could even think the officer was asking me to step out of my vehicle.  He also KNEW the kid that I was with BY NAME, immediately, and wasn't surprised when he saw him in my car (which makes me realize that he probably saw me pick him up).  Still, I tried to stay collected.  I felt that I personally didn't have anything to hide, and while I was very nervous, I was calm in the fact that if I explained to the officer my situation, I wouldn't be the one in trouble.  Then he informed me that the area in which I picked him up in was one of the ""heavier areas for narcotics trade in the city.""  Immediately my heart sank and I realized that I may have been in some deeper shit than I had imagine.   Well, he asked to search my car.  Initially I told him I felt it wasn't necessary, to which the cop to the next of him IMMEDIATELY rings in the K9 unit.  I have a vast amount of respect for law enforcement.  I have many close friends who are police officers, and my uncle himself was a cop back in the day.  I didn't want them to have to waste their time and resources for this crap, so I changed my response.  I told the officers that after what I had heard about the area in which I picked my friend up, I became a little hesitant as I did not know what my friend had on him.  (I DID not rat him out, I'm not a fucking rat)  So, they searched my car.  My friend was taken out, they searched him too, and found nothing....  Which is when it hit me.  The guy left it in my car.  It took not 45 seconds for the cops to find the baggy in my center console, which apparently is where he left it.  And what do you know after this?  The mother fucker tries to pinpoint it on me, yelling phrases like ""OWN UP TO IT BRO, YOU KNOW IT'S NOT MINE"" blah blah blah, just a bunch of bullshit.  I still, stayed collective and said nothing.  I was always told growing up that ""the less you say to cops, the better.""  Well, a few seconds after that, I see him take my friend over to the sidewalk, where they empty the baggy out and crush it into the sidewalk (virtually destroying all evidence they had, which confused me).  He then, walked over, pointed at me and said ""you, get out of here.  Go home.""  I don't know how, or why the cop decided to bless me like he did, but jesus you know I got out of there as fast as I could.  I had a little aftershock about it throughout the day, but all in all I'm just very grateful that there truly are a lot of non-asshole cops out there.    I did, however, receive a call from a private number around 8pm this evening.  I didn't answer, as I was working, and they didn't leave a message (however I think my mailbox may have been full as I'm currently applying to different jobs as I intend to finish school in December).  My question is, is there anyway I can still get into any trouble for what happened?  If the private number WAS indeed the police trying to contact me (for whatever reason), what should I do?    Please help, as I may just be incredibly paranoid.  I just want to make sure that I know I'm in the clear from this so I'm not worrying about it over the course of the next 2 weeks.  Thank you"	Yes
This happened a year ago, but right after it happened, I moved from New Jersey to Michigan, and next week I will be living in Ontario. I recently got a subpoena in the mail to appear for the case. It's not against me, it's state VS the guy, but I'm just going to be there as a witness. I will be 8 months pregnant during the time of the court date and I won't be able to travel, especially since I don't think I will be able to travel to the States while my citizenship paperwork is being processed in Canada. I've tried contacting the detective a few times but haven't heard anything back yet, my next step is to call the court house even though the subpoena specifically says to just contact the detective. Is there any way they can try to force me to go considering my circumstances?	Yes
Mom and i recently found out my father (divored) has been molesting my sisters but they hid it for years because they didnt want to lose their dad. We tried to report him but they sent cops and cps to our mom trying to charge her for it  because there's no proof against him. Also, my sisters said they found child porn on his phone but they didnt mention it to cops because they were telling them theyll go to a foster home.  How can we report him for that instead? My sisters dont see him no more	Yes
"Good afternoon. I am a family friend of a disabled person who is in a bit of a pickle, and I'm wondering if you can point me to relevant information on how to proceed.    Quite a mouthful: My family friend has cognitive disabilities that are evident. He went to the mall on a day trip, where a third party salesman at a kiosk talked him into buying more than 1500 dollars worth of gift cards (rather than using his card or cash, which raises alarms since gift cards are notorious liasons for fraud) which were then used to purchase a multitude of accessories, two phones, and a new line of service. A new account was set up under his name. The kiosk entered their own email into his account though, he was not told his username or how to access it, and the security questions were not asked. The store must have put random information in, because when trying to access his account with common answers he gives to those questions, they are all wrong. I believe this was purposeful as the incorrect info made it very difficult to access the account or petition for a refund.   When he arrived home and this was all discovered, the phones and accessories were returned in full with ample time left on their return conditions.   He took back everything to the same kiosk and was told to expect a ""corporate check"" in a few weeks to his home address (we don't know if the address they have is correct, since the information on the account is not accessable due of the incorrect info filled in by the kiosk salesman...) Unfortunately when he returned these products, they handed him one return reciept which was folded- it shows only the return of the accessories, totalling about 185 dollars. The phones he returned are NOT listed on this, and this was not found out until later. They kept his orginal purchase reciept when he made the return.   It has been 2 months and no refund has been received, no corporate contact will speak with us or confirm that they have the reciept of this phone purchase in their system. They refer us only the the kiosk. The third party kiosk has not returned our calls. I am starting to worry that he was the victim of opportunistic fraud and that this is not a civil case.   So, what do you think of all this? Should we pursue civil action/arbitration over the untimely refund, or does this sound like a criminal matter to involve police in? We are unsure what to do and are very unsettled. Thank you!"	Yes
"This is a long one:   My boyfriend (of 5 years) &amp; I went down to Miami to vacation with my sister and her husband. Our last weekend night there we decided to have a good time. We went to a few dance clubs and met up with 2 friends we had met in our hotel. My sister &amp; her SO decide to leave, but the other 4 of us stay back. After the club closed the one girl calls a Lyft to get us back to our hotel. The lyft driver some how convinced us we needed one more drink and that we should check out this 24/7 strip joint. We're all quite drunk and we're on vacation so we say hell lets do it.   We get there and drinks / entrance everything is so expensive, but non-the-less we decide to stay. I go to the bathroom and when I come out my boyfriend is no where to be found. He's a stand up guy, a hard worker, and never would have gone to this joint had it not been for me (oops). Anyways, I'm frantically looking for him, but this place is HUGE with multiple stories and various rooms, I cannot find him for a good half hour. Finally I see a stripper walking him somewhere while holding his hand. I run up to them and say what in the world is going on. Anyways, I bolt out, he tried to run after me, but I leave the club. Not thinking clearly, I'm drunk, hes totally wasted, &amp;  also it is 7am. He runs after me but I'm already in my own Lyft going to the hotel.   I finally crash, but wake up around 10 am realizing he never came in. My heart drops, he could be anywhere or dead! I call and text yet get no reply (only to find out that the club had seen all my calls and put his phone on do not disturb!!). I try to call the club (which like I said was 24/7) yet all I could get was automated message saying ""all circuits are busy please try your call again later"". I decide to go back and look for him because the alcohol has faded away and I genuinely was worried for his safety. I get there around 1030/11 am and see him completely passed out face down on a couch, hes not even remotely conscious. He should have never even been served anymore alcohol! The manager and a worker try to give him water but hes just slumped over and cannot even open his eyes. The manager told me he spent 2k on a private room and that he signed off  on it. The poor guy couldn't even spell his name, let alone sign off on anything. He has absolutely zero recollection of what happened and we're an honest couple so he would tell me the truth. I take him back to the hotel room and he passes out until 7pm that evening.  Once he wakes up we try to piece together what happened and decide to enjoy our last evening since its our last night. 2k is a lot of money, but it wasn't the end up the world.  This all happened between 7am-1030am on Sunday morning. Flash forward to Wednesday, and we find that multiple cards have been charged for a total of  over 7k!!! Plus cash was taken out from his bank account. There are no receipts proving anything, and the manager himself had said it was only 2k he spent. We called our credit cards and filled them in so they're going to do an investigation, but we have no idea where to go from here. I called the club and they won't do anything until we sign off on a form, which we don't feel comfortable doing because they obviously are scammers. We've since found this place has reviews online that similar things have happened to many other people. Some people claim they may have even been drugged, which honestly he very well could have been. I've never in 5 years have seem him in the state he was in when I went to pick him up that morning. It was pretty terrifying.  It seems to us after talking things over, that he was absolutely taken advantage of, and quite frankly robbed. This club is well known, so they must have video footage. With me being a witness picking him up I feel we may have some grounds to stand on to get at least SOME money back. We're just nervous to move anything forward, because from what it sounds this club has done some very shady things in the past.  We're just looking for any and all legal advice anyone can give.  What are our rights and how should we handle this? Do we contact the police? Should we fill out this affidavit from the strip club? We really have no idea what the protocol is, and no matter what there is no way he signed off on this many charges. They would have needed his signature over 8 times! The manager told me he had only signed once. So how are there this many charges?  The club will not give us any answers, and we're considering going to a lawyer, so we would appreciate any help we could get! Thanks!  TLDR; went to miami, drunkenly go to 24/7 strip club, lose boyfriend (who is 27 &amp; has never went to a strip club before), come back to said club frantically worried at 1030am, find boyfriend passed out on couch totally drugged/intoxicated, manager tells me he spent 2k, yet he was not even coherent enough to tell me his name, come back from vacation and multiple charges have been made on multiple cards for over 7k. We definitely got majorly scammed &amp; taken advantage of. We want to know what we can legally do.   Thanks everyone!   I don't want any negative or rude comments, we already feel bad enough as it is. We never go to strip clubs, and after doing much research I've found this is a common scam, and we're just looking for any guidance."	Yes
"Hi, I apologize if this is the wrong place to post. I just don't know where else to put this. At the beginning of this year, I posted on r/gonewild for fun. My inbox got flooded with messages, and one of them was a man promising me a very large sum of money in exchange for sexual pictures/videos with my face in them. He said he would pay up at the end of a predetermined amount of months. I agreed because I was naive and pretty strapped for cash.   The whole arrangement started getting very demanding as soon as I entered it. What was supposed to be like a video once a week and some pictures throughout the day turned into demands to know where I was at all times and watching me over Skype while I slept. I thought he was controlling but sweet because he seemed to open up to me sometimes. So when I stopped responding to his messages out of stress, I assumed he would be a little upset, but not go as far as to distribute the images/videos I had sent him. He messaged me a few times but stopped saying anything to me soon after.   Well, today I opened up my r/gonewild account to some interesting messages and posts. (He had my r/gonewild password.) First, he posted some of the photos I had sent to him, though luckily without face. (However, they had very identifiable backgrounds.) Second, he had been messaging potential other ""sugar babies"" from my account as a way to verify his ""authenticity"", and had been sending them screenshots of ""my"" PayPal transaction with him (which, obviously, never occurred.) Right now, other than thanking the high heavens that I didn't go through with this obviously very scammy arrangement, I am scared that he is going to start posting photos of me on the internet. Not just on Reddit, but whatever other message boards people use for this kind of stuff.   What can I do to stop him? I think I pieced together enough information to know his real identity. I know his name (I think) and the state he lives in (Georgia), as well as his approximate age. First, I'm gonna try to talk to him human-to-human, and tell him to knock it off, but obviously this isn't someone that can be trusted. Could I report him for financial fraud (the name on the PayPal account isn't his, and I highly doubt he has been paying all these girls) or revenge porn? I need to operate very carefully as he has hundreds of nude images of me with face.   Thank you and please let me know if this isn't the appropriate place for this!"	Yes
I got a ticket for having a dog without a leash a few weeks ago. I'm new to Texas and have no idea how tickets work here but apparently I don't have a set court date yet. Is this even worth fighting? It's a $500 fine, which sucks, but I can manage. I'm more concerned with this being a misdemeanor and causing me to have a criminal record. I have no prior criminal history except for a handful of traffic tickets years ago in another state. Would it be worth contacting a lawyer? What kind of lawyer do I look for and what's the best way to pick one?	Yes
In 2013 my boyfriend  was working at a gas station. They were short handed and he was the only one working in the store and it was quite busy. He wasn't paying close enough attention to an ID and ended up selling cigarettes to a minor that was a few months from being of legal age in a sting. Obviously we expected a ticket and probably for him to lose his job which did happen but he also ended up being charged with a misdemeanor and the charge was endangering a minor. His lawyer told him that basically he can never get this expunged and its been hindering his search for better paying jobs. He only has a job right now because he knew someone in the company and they let him explain the charge. He feels like anytime someone sees it they automatically think hes a child abuser and bad person. Is there anyway to make this go away at some point or will he be stuck with it forever? 	Yes
This happened before states began to outlaw student teacher relationships even if the student was over the age of consent.  Essentially, when I was going through a rough time emotionally, I began receiving a lot of extra attention from a teacher. It started innocently and then progressed to emails, followed my phone calls, then texts, then flirting, some sexting and sending him pictures of me in skimpy negligees. When I graduated high school (he was still my teacher for a summer session) we began to go out on dates. He then came to my college to take control of the department I was majoring in and remained my teacher throughout college (we maintained a relationship during this time).   Now with all of the new legislation and scandals being unearthed (like the choate one) I'm wondering if I have an obligation to report this to someone (the school, his current employer which still has him around students all the time etc). I don't want to get him in trouble because I do still care about him and as far as I'm aware he didn't break any laws (except possession of child porn when I sent the negligee pics (if they count) but they are long gone from all of my electronic devices (this was before the cloud etc).   See the thing is, I don't know if what he did was wrong/ illegal. My therapist (when I was 17 and involved with him) told me to cut ties but never reported him. My guidance counselor at school knew because the man in question didn't have a drivers license so I drove him one on one to the practice he had at another school after ours was over and I once told my guidance counselor I may be late because of driving him and she said it was inappropriate but never followed up. I don't like thinking I was groomed or a victim (though he was emotionally abusive once he had me in the relationship).   I also have proof/know he did this with at least four other students.  So, if it happens in the future and I don't report it am I liable for what happens to any further students he becomes involved with?   Do I have a legal obligation to report it to the schools he works for?  I need to know if there's anything I need (or should) do from a legal standpoint.   I don't want to press charges (I can't he did nothing illegal with me) and I don't want to get him in trouble but I also don't want any other students to go through what I did and I what I know others did because of his narcissism (he's diagnosed) and emotional abuse.  Yes, I am in therapy for this and working through it and I know it's messed up that I care for him but I do. I just need to know what my legal obligations are.	Yes
"In PA - I have a co worker who books travel arrangements for employees. Person is a full time employee w our company. On the side, my co-worker owns a travel agency. He collects commission from the rooms/flights he books at my job. He has contracts made out to his business's name, uses his company's ID # on all hotel reservations... To get extra money.   Does this have legal ramifications or is it a company by company decision? I always thought ""double dipping"" is illegal, but maybe it is an ethical situation decided by the company."	Yes
So I was granted an expungement for a dismissed charge from 7 years ago the first week of June 2017. I've been delaying an application with the school system fearing it hasn't cleared all databases. How long does it typically take for granted expungements to clear all databases and when will a background check that is ran on me show up clear? 	Yes
I gave my friend money to lend and believed her story. Today, I thought I was dropping her off to see her mother, but I drove her to pick up heroin from her drug dealer. I had no idea this was happening, and I'm scared and worried for the child. The grandparents are likely to get CPS and the police involved.   I just would like to know what to expect from my end; will I be called in to give information or have to testify in court, if it happens? What is the process involving opiate addiction and pregnancy? Will I get in trouble?  Thanks.	Yes
The text basically sums it up. My mom received a call about rewards points and things pertaining to a car my dad has never owned. The account was under his name. My mom suspects my older brother could be using my dad's information to open up accounts. However, there really is no tangible proof that my brother is the one doing this, but he is known for needing money quite often. He and his wife are living above their means in a house they cannot afford, and they both have had lots of car troubles. My grandmother has had to bail him out after he took out payday loans in the past.  Anyway, other than advising my dad to contact the credit bureaus and a lawyer, is there anything else that can be done to find out who is doing this (whether it is my brother or someone else) and how to mitigate the damage?	Yes
Hello, I'm 25 and I met a 16 year old who desires sexual relations. While I know the age of consent in Indiana is 16, I want to recognize the legal complexities of the matter. Please advise me on how to best chart this course and what I should avoid.	Yes
"Happened in Utah, USA.  To begin, yes I learned my lesson. Won't be happening again.   Basically what happened is, at night my SO and I decided to drive out to a seemingly secluded place. We found a parking lot for a hiking trail that was empty. We did the deed, and then as we were putting clothes back on an officer approached the car.   We decided the best plan of action was to come clean. And so we did.   He asked us both basic questions (""Are you here on your own free will, did you consent to the activities taken place"") and looked at both of our IDs.  Then he just came back and said ""yeah, just find a better place to do this next time, go home tonight."" He didn't say ""you're under arrest"" either.   No alcohol was involved. We are both adults.   Am I off the hook? Was I unknowingly charged with anything? He didn't mention anything like an arrest or a citation or anything like that. Did he jus need our IDs to confirm our birthdays or are we going to get citations?  I feel like I'm kinda off the hook but I can never be too sure.   Thanks in advance."	Yes
I am on probation for a dui. Im done in 2 weeks.  On thursday i drank which im not supposed to but cops came to drop me off at my house. Apparently i was very compliant and they were very nice to me.    According to my boyfriend, they were just worried about my safety. I do not have a drivers license but i have a state ID.   Apparently i refused medical attention so they just gave me a ride home. They did not breathalyze me either.   I am of legal drinking age and the cops said i did nothing illegal and i was not arrested or given a ticket and my state id was given back to me.   I am on probation. But i do not recall them being aware of that. Unless they checked it later after they dropped me off.   My PO did not call the following day. What are the chances that i got away with this? I think the cops were just trying to be nice people and drive me home.  What do you think?	Yes
I'm currently living in Los Angeles, and I started chatting with someone that I met through a dating app. I stupidly sent them nudes of myself and now they are threatening to send them to everyone of my Facebook friends including my family. I sent the messages through Kik, so I know I could report them for abuse and state the exact reason and let them look at the messages, but I'm afraid they'd only get banned then just send the pictures because they would figure I reported them. I honestly have no idea what to do right now.	Yes
So, my friend and I were driving pretty late last night. We had a long car ride, so he brought pot with him, and I shrugged it off. We hit a highway that had quite a few cars pulled over, so I was obeying all speed laws. Approaching a steady green light, I was riding my brakes a bit in the event it turned yellow before I got there (as to not get pulled over for running a red light). Turns out, one of my brake light was out. He had the grinder in my passenger side door pocket, which the officer then saw when I was giving my license and registration.   My car was then searched, and to my horror, I had my overnight bag tossed in my trunk which I meant to take out of my car before I left, but was in such a rush to leave and forgot to take it out. (I live walking distance from where I stayed the night before, I was being lazy and instead of walking three flights up to my apartment, I tossed it in my trunk to go walk and do other errands--- I never intended to drive). The cop read me my rights and asked me if that stuff was mine. I told him yes out of nervousness.   I'm 22 years old. About to graduate college (early for my program). I do community service regularly already. I'm planning on applying to graduate programs this fall for a PhD. I've had zero encounters with the law prior.   What do I do from here? The cops told me I could hire a lawyer or speak to the prosecutor myself on my first appearance. I was planning on applying for jobs as well this March, which I will all be background checked for. How is this going to affect background checks? Grad school applications? My life in general? How much are lawyer fees going to cost (on average) if I go that route? I have ~10 days until my first appearance.   Thanks in advance.	Yes
I have a friend that I visit once a month. He has a developmental disability and lives with his parents. I was his Personal Support Worker a couple of years ago. Now I just go over to check on him and hang out. He's 21 years old. We live in Oregon.  The situation in question is that his parents have cameras all over their house. That's cool with me. Parents raising kids with disabilities are super protective and want to keep their kids safe. However, they recently moved my friend's living space to their old office. It's a pretty sweet setup. However, the camera that was in the office was never moved out of there when he moved into the office.  He pays rent from money that he gets from the state and his job. So that's HIS space. I'm not sure that the camera is turned on. But, is it okay for them to check in on him like that? That's his space. They do not have guardianship of him. He is their son but he is an adult renter and, disability or not, he has access to the same human rights as anyone else.  As his parents, I'm sure they have many excuses (if the camera is, in fact, turned on) to check in on their son. But my basic questions are: Is it okay for them to watch him remotely from the cameras? Is this something that should be reported to our local CDDP?  Thanks for your time!	Yes
This happened in Washington, DC in March 2015. I was going to school there and dating a guy. We had been dating for about 18 months when the rape happened. He was very verbally and mentally abusive, and had me completely under his thumb. I was also suffering from depression and untreated anxiety at the time. He penetrated me while I was sleeping. I immediately felt assaulted, but I didn't file a report because I was too depressed to make myself do anything and too afraid of him.  I've been haunted by this ever since it happened. I still feel violated, I still have issues with intimacy, I still have huge issues with distrust. I know he's out there being successful and living his life with no consequences while I deal with nothing but pain. I feel like the only way I can move on is if I get some sort of justice.   But there are problems:  -I don't live in Washington, DC anymore. I ended up transferring colleges.   -It was so long ago. I don't even remember the exact date and time.   -We had consensual sex before he raped me and consensual sex afterwards, because I was in shock and afraid. I know that kind of thing looks bad to police and juries though.   -He asked me if he had raped me several times and I always told him no. I only said no because I still loved him like a fool, and I was terrified. But I know it makes me look really bad.   I would change what I did and said if I could in a heartbeat, but I can't.   Do the lawyers here recommend that I report him anyway? Would I look like a liar or someone who wanted revenge? And how would I go about it since I don't live in the same state that it happened, and I don't remember some vital details?  Thank you	Yes
"Hey,  When I was 14 in 2003 I met a 24 year old man online whom I later found out I had a girlfriend. We started a sexual relationship in 2003 after I had turned 15, this happened a dozen times or more, and included everything barring penetrative sex, ending November 2004.  He told me he loved me, that he'd leave his partner for me, was my source of counsel and support while I was going through problems at home including going to live in foster care.  I know that at this time, the legal age of consent was 14 in Canada, and that this was ""upgraded"" to 16 in 2008 when I was 19, 4 years after the contact ended.  Are there any exceptions to this rule? I know there is a law that nullifies the age of consent law if he was in a position of authority, but he wasn't my baseball coach, nor was he a teacher. I have pretty in depth diary entries from that time to provide proof of my emotional state, and some verbatim copy and paste AIM messages between him and I.   Are you aware of any cases in Canadian criminal court where something like this was allowed to go ahead?  I would just take a walk down to my local police station and speak to a detective, but I live aboard now and am back in the city where this happened for 2 weeks in a few months, so any conversations I've had with detectives over the phone have been very hypothetical, but they've encouraged me to come down.  I appreciate all you can offer me in way of legal advice is a guide, as well as hypothetical. Regardless of what happens, I will of course still go to the station to give a statement and submit my evidence so that the detectives and attorneys can make a decision, but I'm sure you can imagine that being thousands of miles away, unable to speak to someone now, I am quite anxious.  Any advice is fully appreciated."	Yes
Some years back, my gf's brother was charged for possession, but not with enough on him for attmept to distribute, and finished his probation last year.  Today, officers pulled him over, charged him with the same thing as before and arrested him, took about $1,000 from his wallet, impounded his car and threatened not to return it to him.  He had his pistol registered in his name with him, but I'm not entirely sure if he can have one legally. Either way, they confiscated that too.  They set his bail for about $300. Can they really keep his car or the $1,000?	Yes
Pulled over yesterday and told I was swerving. I was not drunk, but was pretty tired because it was the end of a long drive. I had a major panic attack during the field sobriety tests, I was shaking too hard to stand, and when the officer did the visual test I almost passed out from locking my legs. There is no way I passed those tests. The attack passed by the 3rd test (balance test) which I was able to do fine, but I was not allowed to retake the previous two.   Officer thought I was on some kind of narcotic, and brought me into the station. The did take a urine sample, which I'm positive will come back clean, I don't do drugs. I did have a few beers earlier that afternoon but this stop happened over 4 hours after I had drinks, and I did not have enough to even get buzzed. I did tell the officer when I had the drinks, and complied with all testing and requests, and I was incredibly polite through the whole ordeal.  This is my first OBI, I have no priors, and I have already spoken to a lawyer and have things in motion to meet before my arraignment hearing. What should I be expecting to happen here? Is it normal for a first time offense to be downgraded into a reckless driving charge? Should I expect the book to get thrown at me and to receive the manditory 72 hours in jail? These questions will obviously be asked to my lawyer, but I was hoping to hear some positives to this before going in because I'm freaking out right now.	Yes
Got six months probation for a DUI. Stayed out of trouble mostly, but as a result of severe mental illness and a little bit of laziness, I didn't do all the requirements on time. I told my PO I was having problems with the conditions and I got a notice from the judge that I had a probation violation hearing ordered. I didn't start my community service until after the hearing was ordered and didn't finish it until after my probation was scheduled to end. I didn't enroll in a DUI school until afterwards too, and while I've now done that - they didn't have an opening until after the date of the hearing. Also they said I didn't do the vehicle immobilization, but I have paperwork saying I sold the car almost immediately (which I told them before).   So, technically all I have to do is finish the DUI class. How much am I screwed considering I've done most of the terms now, if not just incredibly late?   Will the judge likely close the case, extend my probation, or give me jail time? I have no prior criminal history. But I don't really have an excuse and I'm not sure what I could say in my defense.   Also - I'm unemployed. I've heard some say employment is a condition for probation, but I was never told that and can't find much on it. Will that hurt me too?  Thanks.	Yes
"We're in Minnesota, USA. My husband had a piece of equipment worth $10,000 stolen from our vehicle in the parking lot of our apartment building. We have cameras facing where our vehicle was parked, and we have an open police report, but our apartment landlords are refusing to look over the tapes because, ""we don't have a two-hour time frame of the crime."" We have a 6-hour window from parking and realizing the car was burglarized, but that isn't good enough for them. They won't let us review the tapes ourselves, and the officers don't really care about a petty theft case unless the office can see someone with the piece of equipment (it's rather large).   Is there any sort of legal action we can pursue to get our landlord to review the tapes?"	Yes
There is a video of a woman, who is antireligious, drawing a picture of Muhammad.  And in the comments there was  a guy who found her address where she lives, and another man wrote 3 days ago that he is going to her address to address kill her because she drew the cartoon.  Im from Scandinavia, and i dont know how to report this to the police in LA. Maybe im overdramatic, but eeeh... am i really? For some reason i think this is quite important to report. Any tips?	Yes
The title says it.  I cleaned my car out last night (it is often filthy, with garbage etc everywhere...) I had it sparkling clean and had shampooed the seats.  I left the windows down overnight for it to dry.  I got in this morning to head out to work and noticed my glovebox was left open.  Checked with my wife and she had not brought that stuff inside when cleaning.  So someone casually walked by and helped themselves to the contents of my glovebox.  I honestly don't know what all was in there - owner's manual, registration, some old proof of insurance and a tire warranty maybe.  I called for a police report and am waiting on them to call back - what else should I be getting ready to do?  Credit freeze?  Some kind of fraud alert?  Any help would be greatly appreciated, I'm pretty spooked.	Yes
"I went to a big box store and parked. When I got out I was stuck between two large SUV which limited my view going back. I honestly slowly went back when a car blasted their horn and sped. I would say around me but at no time were we closer than 8 feet. I let it go I did not even honk back or give them the finger or yell anything to them.  I had already put my windows down because the temperature was only ~80 degrees. My mistake. I happened to use the same exit as that person because there are only really two ways to get out.  I left at least one car space probably more. The passenger gets out of the car. Cars are coming into the big box store so I cannot go around. I am blocked on the right by a sidewalk and the passenger coming at me. There are cars already behind me.  The guy comes at me with fists drawn and in a threatening manner already yelling ""I am going to kick your fucking ass."" I panic and remembered I had pepper spray. I fumble for it as he is already at my car screaming. I yell ""GO back to your car"" at least 4 times and he takes a swipe at me and then spits at me right into my face and eye. I spray the pepper spray directly into his face. He immediately walks away and then his wife (driver of car) starts screaming at me. I call 911 the moment the situation was calmer.  He and she are screaming at me. I finally close my window (I forgot to do that) The police are there in about two minutes which is really quick. I tell my story. The other guy is warned to stay over there cause he keeps trying to get close to me. The police tell me that his story does not make sense and to tell me my story twice now. 4 more officers come. I tell them each and they warned me that I might be arrested because pepper spray is ""illegal"" in new jersey and that ""spitting does not constitute an assault""  Luckily a supervisor says that my pepper spray (bought on amazon which limits which size I can buy in my state) is legal and that spitting does constitute an assault or something else. I was still quite amped up to understand exactly what he said.  At the end, all of the officers told me had it happened to them they would have done the same or even more (one officer said I would have beat the living shit out of him) But they gave me my license, my pepper spray back, and a police report number no ticket was issued to me. I am not sure of the other person.  They said that the passenger already said that he will be pressing charges against me. The police told me at 9 am Monday to go to the police station pick up the police report and file charges against the passenger.  I would like to know what am I facing? Can I use a self defense claim? I never left the vehicle, he came into my vehicle trying to punch me and spit into my face.  What would I counter charge him with? Can I press charges against the driver of the vehicle as well as she preventing me from leaving.  Was anything I did illegal?"	Yes
Looking to understand the route to go here - My brother was stopped at a DUI checkpoint less than half a mile from a bar where he had only had 2 beers. He had beer in his mouth when they breathalyzed because of the proximity to the bar, so he blew a higher BAC than was accurate (though still very low) and the cop charged him with a DUI misdemeanor and made him spend the night in jail with no priors. He is looking to bring the charge down to zero and keep his record clean. He has gotten mixed info on whether to use a private or public attorney, with the argument for public being that his case is straight forward. He has one year left in grad school so is concerned about a mark on his record impacting his job prospects, but is also cash-strapped from school. Looking for advice on best way to approach this, thanks!!	Yes
My son's car has been egged several times over the last few months.  The second time it happened we made a police report but it's happened 3 times since and we haven't called it in.  They have also gotten my husband's car and our house.  What I want to know is, is this considered illegal?  The egg just washed off so no real damage, but my son thinks it's kids at school doing it because he is gay.... would that make it a hate crime if egging isn't even a crime?  I am so frustrated.  We only have room to park one car in the driveway, not that it would deter them, but it seems like whichever one of us is parked on the street is getting it, just us, not our neighbors.  Our neighbor behind us did get it once, but not since.  My son's car is just a $2000 car, but my husband and I drive much nicer cars and don't want to have to deal with this crap.  It happened once on a Friday night, but all other instances were on Sunday nights.	Yes
What's the best way to fight the ticket?	Yes
So I was out at 1am with friends, and I had 2 oz of weed in my bag. Cops were called by the neighbor, they showed up detained us and kept me bc of my weed I also had a scale but they gave it back. I'm 16 this is my first offense. What's going to happen at court ?	Yes
Someone i know is being tried for CSC charges. If they were to run before their final court date and were not found, What would happen to the case? Would it be dismissed?	Yes
"A friend of mine ""borrowed"" my car without my permission, meaning he stole my keys and took my car to run an errand, but later returned both.  Is there legal action that could be taken?  The state this occurred in is Georgia."	Yes
"I intend to apply for my FID license in the near future. However I am in a bit of a pickle with question 5 on the application (**Have you ever been arrested or appeared in court as a defendant for any criminal offense**). I was arrested four years ago when I was 16. My understanding is that the case was CWOF and ultimately dismissed. I don't remember many specific details regarding this as it was a very complicated and stressful time in my life. The only paperwork I was able to dig up regarding the case was a form regarding pre-trial probation. I would like to be as truthful as possible on the license application but I simply do not have as much information regarding this as I'd like.  **Do I even need to include these specifics? The form only asks for ""dates, circumstances, and location"". Does this include every court date relevant to this arrest?** As I recall there were several. **Where would I get this information (arrest date+charges, court dates+other info)?**  On a slightly different but related note I was also in juvenile court earlier in my life because of a CHINS petition related to school truancy. My understanding is that this is not relevant because I was not a defendant for a criminal offense but I'd like to clarify that."	Yes
"About 3 years ago I got a warrant for shoplifting at a Walmart for about 300 dollars worth of things.  It's a long story, i was on tour with a band, I made some mistakes, I'll go with the general ""young n dumb"" excuse...  Anyway, I got out of being taken to jail to be held for my court date because the cop was being lazy.  He lets me go with a court date ticket.  This is in Riverside, California.  I grew up in and am currently in Chicago.  I was back in Chicago within days.  I never went to the court date and nothing has ever happened really.  I am not a band person, this would be the only thing on my record so I kind of just want to take care of it before it stings me to hard (?).  Everyone tells me to ""lawyer up"" which I assume I'll have to do to take care of this, but does anyone have any idea what I may have to go through?  Will I end up doing time?  Can I negotiate/turn myself in?  Will I have to put my life in Chicago on hold to take care of this?  How much would it cost me?  It's a world of worry and having never been in trouble with the law really I'm in the dark.  Any input appreciated!"	Yes
Hey, so the gist of the story is as follows. I have a safe in my house that is key operated that used to contain $11000 as well as a rolex and some other valuables, during a party I had a few weeks ago some friends slept at my house, one of them in my room because it has two beds.  Today, I opened my safe to discover $5700 was missing.  To clear a few things up..  * The safe is in my room  * I never take my money out of the safe and the safe stays in my room so there is no way I would have misplaced the money, I know when I have opened the safe, and the last time I opened it everything was there.  * The only people that knew about the location of my safe was a few of my closest friends   * I have searched my house to see if my money was anywhere just in case  * the key to the safe was on my keychain which was next to me while I slept in my room  *  No one broke into my house or has otherwise had any unsupervised access to my room, the only time when the theft could have happened was while I slept after the party  * Me and my friends are all 17  * The money is all mine and of course I want it back  What steps would you suggest to recover the money, there is only 3 or 4 people it could have been, I have proof in the form of pictures and receipts that I had the money.	Yes
Got caught with a drink at a bar and i'm underage (18) the cop took me outside, wrote up a citation and left a number for me to call for a diversion program before she sent me on my way. I was also given a court date. If that number can't help me and I go to court, what punishment should i expect? Do i need a lawyer? I violated section 4301-69(e). Feel free to ask questions if i left anything out. A friend bought the drink and I had no fake on me	Yes
Uh hello guys, so this very crooked media group is talking about my son doing some things that they claim are illegal and he didn't do these things, but he just posted some content on twitter that says he did do these things. Now I know some very big lawyers, the best lawyers, let me tell you. I don't know, but people are telling me all sorts of things. I have so many people working on this, the best people, but you can never have too many of the best people.  What is collusion? Let's say a member of a not low-level US campaign, you know, offered to throw out some nasty regulations in exchange for some TRUTH about crooked Hil... about another candidate. Would that be not legal?	Yes
Hey all, ill keep this short. Cop pulled me over today, suspected pot in my car, I complied and cooperated fully. They searched my car and found a one hitter, as well as the roach to a joint. The officer threw the roach on the ground, and took the one hitter. He let me off with a warning. Are there any long lasting repercussions for insurance, criminal record, possible summons in the mail, etc? Im 23 and live in minnesota.	Yes
"I am considering attempting to get a protective order against my ex-boyfriend, but he is not an immediate threat.  This last April, he began to contact me after several months (August 2016-April 2017) of not speaking. We attempted to be friends, but our situation was not pleasant. He revealed to me during our time together in April 2017 that he had created a private Twitter account where he consistently had been posting about me for the last seven or so months. These posts contained explicit sexual details (both fantasy and real), photos of me, and specifically referred to me by name in the posts. I requested he remove the page, but he did not (as of 7/8/17, the account has been removed).   Later in April 2017, we had engaged in a hook-up. As he drove me home (I was intoxicated and he was not- he provided the alcohol in his home), he drove past the exit to my home and instead took me to an empty street where he proceeded to assault me (choking and gagging which was intended to be sexual- I told him during the assault that I was too drunk and scared to consent, nor did I want to, but he did not stop). Later, I confronted him about it and he apologized. My therapist at the time recommended going to the police, but I was afraid to do so and didn't.  We do not talk now but he continues to post and speak about me on social media sites and to mutual friends. On the Fourth of July, he had a mutual friend text me photos of him during a party, despite the fact that I have him blocked on my social media. I messaged him yesterday for the first time since May 2017 to tell him to stop posting and talking about me, as well as to stop attempting to contact me through friends. He told me that he would not stop and that I could not make him ""forget me"".  I recognize that the online behavior is not illegal, but it feels very intentionally intimidating, as I fear him posting slanderous or sexual things about me. I am not comfortable with him still having photos of me, knowing that he has posted them in the past without my knowledge. I also feel as though he will find any means through which to try and contact me, despite me making it abundantly clear that I do not want him to. His assault against me is the primary legal issue, but since I did not take action at the time to contact authorities, I fear it is now too late. I do have texts from him admitting to the assault. Rather than attempting to bring him to court for the assault, I am interested in a protective order so that he cannot contact me, nor make me feel like I do not have any sort of privacy. I do not know if protective orders can prevent a person from posting about someone on social media, but ideally the order would stop him from doing so.   I do not fear for my safety as he has not attempted to come to my house.  Does my particular case warrant seeking a protective order? If not, is there anything I can do to stop him from posting things about me online and attempting to contact me through friends or social media?"	Yes
Who is guilty? Two brothers, one 36, one 26, live in their father's home with their mother who is ill with cancer. The two are not amicable. Great deal of bad blood. 26 claims history of violence at hands of 36.  They take turns occupying shared spaces in the home. 36 goes to work to make private income. Family income provided by the father. 26 stays at home caring for ill mother. 36 returns to house in the middle of the day. This is not typical. 26 doesn't want 36 in the house. Feels it's his time to occupy spaces. 36 just want to prepare for business trip. 26 grabs a skillet, stands at the entrance, and blocks 36 from entering house. He warns 36 not to enter. 36 comes in anyway toward 26 punching. 26 weakly swings skillet no injuries. 36 knocks skillet away. 26 jumps on 36 and bites chest and arm. 26 clings to 36s back. Fight pauses, they talk about issues. 36 gets fed up and strangles 26 with hands until he passes out. 26 calls cops. Report filed. 26 leaves home later that night to live on streets. 36 remains at home.	Yes
"Hi all,  I'm a freshman at Penn State, and I was just cited for underage drinking yesterday. I went to a party off campus, and had a bit too much to drink. I got back to my dorm room fine, and I wasn't being disorderly/causing any problems with anyone. I basically just stumbled back to my dorm and was ready to go to sleep.  However, I wasn't handling the alcohol very well and began to puke into my dorm's trash can. My roommate walks in on me puking and is panicking because he has never dealt with an intoxicated person before. He calls the RA because he was concerned for my health, and the RA calls 911.  A cop arrives at my dorm and starts asking me questions. He asks me how much I had to drink, and I told him I had a few beers. He then asks me questions like ""What's the month/date"", ""Who's the President of the United States"", and what state I was in. I answered all of the questions correctly, and I was being pretty compliant the entire time. I tell him my home phone number and he calls my parents.  He tells my parents that I was drinking underage and that he was going to send a citation to their address (not my dorm). He didn't leave me with a citation or any other documents at my dorm. I'm 17, so legally not an adult yet.  The EMS later arrive and take my blood pressure, heart rate, all that stuff. Everything was fine and they left. No one ever breathalyzed me.   Basically, I'm really worried about what happens next. I have to meet with a university administrator about my underage now and complete an alcohol program run by the university. But I'm more worried about what shows up on my record now. Is there anything I can do to get it off my record? I'm supposed to be starting ROTC in the fall, and something like this on my record can apparently be really bad for that. I've wanted to serve in the military for so long and I don't want to miss out on this opportunity before I even start."	Yes
will it just show what conviction you have or will it actually say that you spent time in prison/had a suspended jail sentence? I'm just worried for my future. I don't mind being punished for what I did, I deserve to be punished, but I want to start with clean slate at the end of it and improve my life going forward, I genuinely want that and don't want this 1 stupid mistake to tarnish my image forever?	Yes
I would like to appear in court and request my marijuana possession/paraphernalia tickets be reduced, in order to get this will I have to pass a drug test?	Yes
My spouse and I have chose to move back to our home state from LA.  In doing so we had to terminate our lease early.  Our lease was a basic printed out 1 page agreement with our deposit amount and monthly rent and the agreement the land lord would cut the grass as long as we had no animals using it.  When we gave him notice of our intent to terminate the lease he let us know he would keep the deposit.  We told him ok we understood and that since we were paid up to a point we would be moved out by then.    This past weekend my spouse and I moved a trailer full of belongings to our new home and upon return to the home in LA today my spouse found our washer and dryer missing and all our stuff rummaged through and pictures of my spouses daughter who passed away in the trash with other things.  Called the land lord and he said he had Aarons (who we did rent to own with) pick up the washer and dryer for us since we were leaving.... He then threw things out since we abandoned it...... Keep in mind we are paid up to a point that we agreed to leave we were gone for just over 24 hours moving one load of belongings.      These are not the first issues we have had. During our months at this home we paid 1300 a month.  The landlord on more than one occasion let himself in with no notice. He even did so why we were home and the kids were playing just unlocked the door and walked in.  He refused to fix a leaking AC unit that kept soaking the floor at times as well.  He has threatened to throw all our stuff away as well because he has someone who wants the place now...  Also Aarons should have never picked up our stuff for him as he is not on the agreement at all and has no say so on our account.  They disclosed to him as well when picking up the washer and dryer that since that was being forfeited they also needed our kids bunk beds back  that we had already moved and that we owe X amount etc... They disclosed personal information and picked up belongings with out verifying anything or permission to speak with him.  Do we have any action we can take against either the land lord or Aarons?  At this point we are trying to dig through trash to find anything else that was tossed.   The house is in the same or better shape than when we moved in as well.	Yes
My wife caught my 14 year old nephew molesting my 4 year old daughter last night. They were camping, and the kids were in a tent together.   They were naked and he was on top of her. My daughter said that he has been touching her, and that this is not the first time.   They are on their way to the children's hospital now. My wife said my daughter's labia is red, and that she says it hurts and hurts when she pees.   I am out of the damn country, on business.   I am curious to know what will potentially happen to my nephew. I want him to have consequences, but would prefer he get therapy or something.   I can't find much on a google search, it just looks like he will be charged with sexual assault and face a possibility of 10 years in jail.	Yes
So, I went on a date last week that ended up with me and the girl making out in my car. She had stated that she didn't want to have sex and I agreed. We made it pretty heavily for about twenty minutes and she started pulling on her clothes and said she wanted to go inside. I said okay and she kissed me and told me to text her when she got home. I got home and texted her and she responded hours later saying that she thought I was disgusting and never wanted to see me again. I just had a missed call from the police saying they wanted to talk to me about the incident. I have never been involved with the police ever. What do I do?	Yes
"About a month ago, my brother was arrested for stalking and peeping.  Today, he received a letter notifying him that the police department has a warrant for his arrest for ""entering without permission"", and he must contact the court to see what he needs to do.  The letter explicitly states that this is separate from the charges from a month ago.  Isn't it a bit odd that this was not included in the arrest from a month ago?"	Yes
I got into a fight at school with this girl. We had an argument and on that day, she posted on Facebook that she's was going to fight me the next day. Someone screenshot it and send it to me. Well the next day, at lunch, she was putting her hair up in a ponytail when she saw me. When the bell rung, I was walking my friend to her class when I saw her looking at me. She made it seem like she was just walking past me but I saw her friend watching and I knew she was going to throw the first punch. I was ready and she came at me. Well the police was going to charge me with an assault until I told him the whole story and showed him the screenshot of her threatening me. So I have a court day and it says crime/Traff misdemeanor. Never fought in high school. I think she was 17. No major injuries on both of us. I didn't get charged with an assault, got charged with disorderly conduct.	Yes
A legal adult I know is growing two marijuana plants for their own personal use in the house they are staying at. This grower does not own the home, nor are they in any tenancy relationship with the owner. The owner of this home is allowing them to live there as they know this person is not capable of being out on their own from lack of independence and some mental issues. The owner of the home is aware of the plants and is not fond of them, but is naive to the possible ramifications of allowing this to continue. I visited the home and could smell the marijuana upon approaching the door. I talked to the owners and they are not happy with the smell and liability, but feel helpless in this case for many reasons. It really is a messed up situation and I want to make sure the grower and home owners are aware of the possible legal ramifications if they are caught because they haven't researched it or been informed. I feel they, at the very least, need to understand what they are risking by continuing this behavior. I know that growing marijuana is not legal in Ohio for any reason, but I am having difficulty pinning down the possible charges that could occur and their penalties, could someone give me an idea of what they are looking at here?	Yes
My neightbor has spying on me for like 3 years and harassing me. He complains about my garbage cans and my dogs. The other day I turned on my tv with my tablet in my lap and saw my own face on the tv for a split second before it changed to the show. My neighbor is using the camera on my ipad and brodcasting it. I called the police but they said theres no evidence. Can a lawyer prove it and make him stop?	Yes
I live in Vancouver, BC. Isn't it a crime to post a fake Craigslist ad with my contact info.? If so, how do I go about making sure he gets arrested and convicted of this crime?	Yes
"Hi there, First time posting here and I'm hoping that it's helpful to my understanding of the system and what the circumstances mean. I'll try to keep it as simple as possible.  Location: CT and NY -CT is where the crime is taking place, NY is where the person responsible lives. Summary: An independent contractor, working for our company in the service industry, has been and continues to plan and execute the theft of at least $25,000. That amount is what we know of so far but it keeps getting larger. He's accepting and reporting (on weekly reports) that money is coming in (to make us think it's being collected and placed into the right account). In reality, he's having clients make out checks to him personally and depositing them into his own bank account. He's also accepting cash from clients for things that aren't being reported and further, he has clients paying for services without reporting that they exist. Again, in total that theft amounts at least $25,000.  The real question: Okay so we spoke to some police officers in CT and they said that once the warrant is out (which will take 4-6 week) they will contact the police in NY and see if they will also issue a warrant. Now, let's say there is a warrant out in CT and NY BUT they also said that they won't actually go and bring him into custody...Huh? There's an unbelievable amount of evidence we've compiled that should be more than enough to go out and bring this person in but what it seems that we're being told is ""he's basically free to be until he makes a mistake."" How can this be correct? I understand that some CT police don't want to go all the way to NY to arrest this person but, what if he's in the state? What if he happens to be in the same town? Will they take a call that says ""Here he is?"" The answer seems to be no, and my mind also seems to be blown that a criminal isn't being brought it and put through our legal system. I don't even know what the charges would be but maybe - grand larceny, fraud, damage to a business, forgery, like what would it take to mobilize and bring this person to justice? Are we just stuck with a warrant waiting for him to get pulled over for running a stop sign? There has to be an easier, more efficient, and just way to have him answer for his transgressions. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!"	Yes
I met my girlfriend in high school and we've been together for about a year now. Before she dated me she dated somebody else who had problems. They broke up because he physically abused her and cheated on her.  A while back, I want to say about four or five months ago, he began stalking her. Circumstance had it set that while they were dating, he activated some kind of software on her phone and was able to completely bug her. Anyone's voice or location could be visible/audible when in the vicinity of this phone. He used it to track her down and try god-knows-what. He hit her one time while I was at work. There was a police report and all this and that, and an emergency restraining order.   This is really only the spark-notes of it. There was a lot more going on. A lot of nights I went without sleep and jumping at every creek and bump in the night. Since then, however, (As far as we know) this bug as been disabled and we got her a new phone for the time being.  Recently, this phone broke and, after wiping her old phone clean (New iCloud account, all this Apple jargon that I can't decipher being an android man) she switched back to it. We're planning on moving here soon so getting these luxuries aren't primarily on our minds.  Now, since having been switched back to Phone A, this stalking continues. She lives with me now and we're planning to move out of state, so I feel like I have a better grasp on her safety. Still, these texts come and go of this stalker begging to see her, come drop off old memorabilia, just one last talk, etc etc. Through chance(?) he's ran into her while running errands, and threats of macing out of self defense were thrown around. He often texts me trying to get under my skin, but beyond that he's afraid of me and rightly so. My blood is boiling typing this out. Again the long nights of no sleep and investigating every minor sound and dog bark continue. I feel like I'm driving myself nuts. I always keep an ear out for any movement, vibration, whatever in this house. Thankfully she stays with good friends or my mother while I'm at work.  I'm scared and angry. What do we do?  Throwaway, because hey. This stalker scrambles for our social media at every chance.	Yes
I hooked up with a girl in a relationship and her ex-boyfriend has been stalking and harassing her and I separately, always appearing at places he thinks we will show up.  He has had multiple minor unprovoked physical altercations with her involving lots of yelling in public places with multiple witnesses.    Today I just discovered he has entirely filled my gas tank with salt, which can destroy my car.  He told her over the phone that he had already did this a couple weeks ago but had not actually done it at that point...  I saw him at a local concert last night and I think it set him off, because I looked in my gas tank today and it is completely full of salt.  I would report the crime immediately, but I am in Denton texas and have a warrant out for my arrest in Austin for a class B misdemeanor.  I am afraid they will also take me to jail, but I am a student and taking summer classes.  Will they take me in for my warrant?  Is this sufficient evidence to have him convicted?  Are the other altercations enough to file a restraining order?  Neither her nor I feel safe in this town anymore because of the things he has been doing.  I am an extremely poor student and in dire need of help so any advice is much appreciated.  My tentative plan is to go through all of my classes tomorrow and report the crime regardless of if they arrest me for my warrant or not... but at least I will not miss class, as I have multiple homeworks and quizzes every class day in summer school.  Is this a good plan?  Thank you	Yes
She's got BPD and bipolar with mental trauma from being molested as a toddler by her parents, and she's recently been put on new meds which caused all sorts of psychosis and delusions until they kicked in.  Three years ago, her 8 year old nephew was staying the night with her and bugging the he'll out of her. She put half a MG of klonopin in his drink so he would go to sleep. Her new meds are making her feel guilty for all her past wrongs, but she told her therapist about this and was told it has to be reported to the hotline on Monday.   We're in Arkansas, what can we expect? She's on disability and her mental health can't handle jail. I'm freaking out, she's calm.   During a bout of mania she told her sister, the boy's mother, a few weeks ago when she went to the hospital to try to be checked into behavioural health while her meds were asjusting. The mother didn't press charges, and those doctors didn't report it. What is going to happen? It's not like there's proof, and maybe the statute is up?	Yes
"7 of my friends went camping on a Monday night, I had work unfortunately. They were camping at a site where camping isn't allowed but many people camp there anyways. After being there for a few hours, a man and woman came to the camp site and held a gun(later revealed to probably be a pellet gun) to the back of my friends head. He started saying things like, ""Are you prepared to die?"" And remained there pointing the gun from person to person for about 10 minutes. From this I have found out his name and I am wondering what sort of action, preferably legal, we should take against him. Is there anything we can do considering they were camping illegally?"	Yes
So this is a bit of a shit storm my  gf got me into. As stated above we got into an argument and the cops were called. my gf is an alcoholic, and started to tell the cops about how i hit her in the past even though these were very false allegations. now i wasn't talked to or even approached by the police. she signed a waiver stating she didn't want to have me arrested. we received a letter in the mail yesterday from the local police dept trying to get her to contact a detective to gather evidence against me to get a warrant for a crime i didn't commit. she said she would call them and let them know she didn't want to press charges or anything against me. should i lawyer up? can a case be built against me if i wasn't even talked to that night and my gf doesn't want to pursue it?	Yes
"About 2 years ago I visited an escort at a hotel. Before I went in, I noticed there was a cop car parked at the edge of the parking lot. I thought they have no idea what I'm doing in there, so I just went ahead and went in. Afterwards, when I was driving away from the hotel, I noticed the cop car was behind me. He was driving behind me for a couple minutes or so, but then I turned and he went in a different direction. He did not stop me or anything. My guess is that the employees at the hotel reception desk were watching me on the cameras and called the cop as I was leaving. As I was walking out, I noticed a couple of them were standing looking at a screen and then one of them glanced at me and I am not sure if I am just being paranoid but I think I heard ""that's him"".  Is it likely the cop took my license plate number and put my name in an incident report saying they suspect I was visiting a prostitute even though they have no real evidence that's what I was doing? If so, can this information possibly be discovered by others in the future? And how long will it be kept?"	Yes
"Is it normal for a California court to fudge up your records?   I was supposed to have 2 previous arrests ""dismissed"" via expungement and well, they never did I guess. It took me being denied a really good job 3 years later to figure this out too.   I have the court documents that say my charges have here by been dismissed but my DOJ record is saying something different. What do I do? Do I have any sort of recourse against the court house for not getting that job. (I'm sure I don't, I'm just pretty broken up about it)  Thanks Legal Advice!"	Yes
"I was caught smoking marijuana in a park with 5 other people a few weeks ago by the police. They took our ID's and looked us up to see if we had clean records which we all did. They were nice and just told us to never return to the park because the people in the neighborhood were getting fed up of the amount of teenagers who come there to smoke weed. They said they were giving us warnings and it would appear on something called our ""drivers abstract"". Im not really sure what that is? Will it affect me when it come to employment or something?"	Yes
I carry a small pocket knife daily and i would like to know if i could get in legal trouble if i get in a situation where i absolutely have to defend myself while carrying said knife. Say i would only punch and/or kick, not using the knife at all. Would i get in trouble ?	Yes
Last July I was sentenced to two years supervised probation, an alcohol awareness class, and 100 hours of community service. Since then I have completed my hours and class. My probation officer said I am able, after the one year mark, to reappear in front of my judge to have my charges dropped. Although it is not a guarantee that the judge will agree to do so. I do not want to hire an attorney and put myself in (more of) a financial hole based on chance. Any advice or experiences that may help me as I go forward besides dress nice, be polite?  TLDR: Reappearing in court to have probation dropped, need advice on appearing in court by myself in front of judge.	Yes
Is there any ways I can fight this in court? They didnt find any actual pot but the pipe itself was dirty. Does that actually count as possession of marijuana in virginia? And if I Wasnt distributing the bowl to anyone and only had it for personal use, what would the correct charge and penalty be? Having trouble finding this information online.  I was given Asap and a 500$ fine but if theres any way I can get this reverted to a different charge and a lesser fine that would be really helpful.	Yes
I have weed possession on my record will the courts and judges definitely be aware of it when I go back in to court for another weed possession charge or what are the odds that this can fly under the radar 	Yes
So i met this girl at a club in Berlin and we instantly hit it off. I invited her to take a drink with me at the bar, she agreed and we drank the first sip together at the bar. She then introduced me to her brother, who was 15 years old, and all three of us started dancing. She started holding my hand and moving me closer to her. So i moved and she started dancing dirty with me. After a while i kissed her on the forehead and she just went mad, she took my to another area and we started kissing. She then just suddenly stop and told me she needs to look for her brother. I said okay and thought nothing of it. I returned to the dance floor and started dancing, and she then just found me, came up to me and started kissing me. I thought okay she must have found her brother and told him something so we went to the bathroom and started having sex, she gave me various sexual acts and never once said, implied, nor showed that she was not consenting to this, and told me explicitly to put it in. After we finished i went to take a drink and came back to check up on her. I found her still naked with vomit all over her. I went in cleaned and dressed her up and found her brother to take her home. After a couple of days i got arrested and now accused of a rape charge. She claims that i drugged her drink and went in on her in the bathroom and she started pushing me way and shouting at me. None of which has happened! I dont know anyone who was in the club so i dont have any witnesses who could testify that we were just kissing with her full consent. This is a nightmare i am living and could ruin my whole life. Just the accusation of rape has serious repercussions. What can i do to prove she was consenting, and how can i move forward ? Please help me r/legaladvice	Yes
"I am in the process of completing drug court. I have no priors before this. I understand that when I finish, the charges will get dismissed. But in the meantime, it required a guilty plea. Does that mean I've been convicted but sentencing has been put off? Or are the charges still in ""limbo"" so-to-speak?  I have [read about it online](https://www.littler.com/publication-press/publication/alabama-employers-may-no-longer-consider-certain-criminal-records) but it's talking about getting records expunged and the only mention of drug court is ""after successful completion of drug court.""  In the meantime, will my charges show up as a conviction on a background check? Can I pay to run a background check on myself and which ones do employers use in this area?  When I accepted the plea, my attorney explained some things of the plea agreement but wasn't sure the answer to this question. I haven't seen him since my plea date in court."	Yes
I exchanged nude photos with a girl online, her profile listed that she was 20 years old. After exchanging photos she said she was 16, I immediately stopped talking to her, she told her father, her father has threatened legal action. What is the precedent for something like this?	Yes
"So. Let it be known right off the bat that I was told by this minor that they were 18 years old on this mobile app called Grindr. Over the course of a few days we are talking, chatting, getting to know each other, the works. For about half a day they block me, but later unblock me saying they had to. Someone ""they had been with"" had caught them on grindr and he had to lay low. Weird, but as they are talking to me again, I assume all is well.  Anyway, as I am speaking to this supposed 18yo, I was also talking to other profiles. We decided to make this fun and invite a third person to this party. One particular profile seemed very interested and wanted to meet up but refused to send a face picture in response to my own picture and a picture of the 18yo. Eventually I tell this Faceless account to shove it after them giving me the run around. I was stupid. I sent Faceless my own face picture, as well as my cell number. I block them on grindr and just agree to meet the 18yo at a hotel they are already at because of a ""friend's party.""  I arrive at the hotel and am told to go somewhere. By this time I receive a Facebook message request. I ignore it. I continue driving around looking for 18yo. Don't find him. Eventually I get fed up and start recording on my phone of my current location, trying to get 18yo to give me better directions. Keep in mind this entire time I am texting 18yo over Facebook messenger, I have also sent the pics and videos of my location through FB messenger.  Then, the 18yo's messages bubble tells me that I can no longer reply to the conversation. I've been blocked. Huh, odd. I go to their FB profile and can still view it. I log into a secondary FB account and navigate to his profile, and that I cannot start a chat with him with this secondary account. The 18yo has not blocked me, but disabled messenger.  I finally look at my message requests, and find that this stranger has messaged me:  ""I'm calling [Local Police Force] right now. Reporting you for trying to have sex with a minor.""  Initially confuaed, but with a slow frightening realization, I book it. Haul ass off hotel grounds and take the long way home  This took place an hour and a half ago.  If what this stranger says is true, I could be charged with solicitation of a minor. I repeat again I was not aware that I was talking to a minor. No where in any of our conversations was there a number other than 18.  Redditors of r/legaladvise. Assuming that this"	Yes
I was arrested for possession of marijuana and paraphernalia, but I was caught with both plant matter and concentrate (dismeanor amounts), along with 3 pieces of paraphernalia (3 packs of rolling papers). As a result, I had multiple charges for these different items. Is it likely that the judge will drop the redundant charges or will I face harsher consequences for these different illegal items?	Yes
About two years ago when I was a freshman in college I got in some legal trouble. Basically ended up in the hospital super drunk, freaked out, accidentally injured a nurse while they were trying to restrain me. I woke up still intoxicated with a police officer instructing me to sign a piece of paper. I did that then I passed back out. When I next woke up there was a doctor there who told me what had happened and that the nurse I accidentally hurt didn't want to press charges.  I hired an attorney and found out (I believe my attorney told me) that the police officer was also trying to charge me with assault and battery. A few days later I showed up at the local court house with my attorney. He spoke to the judge who decided to get rid of the misdemeanor Minor in Consumption and battery charge and instead give me one charge of Disturbing the Peace. I informally plead guilty by telling my attorney to take the deal. I then paid a fine, and that was that. My attorney also mentioned that, because my battery charge hadn't been formally written up and filed yet, it wouldn't show up on my criminal record. Does that sound accurate and plausible?  Now, back to my main question: how can this all be on my file if I never remember having my fingerprints or a mugshot taken? They wouldn't have done that in the hospital, right? I would have had to have been booked into jail?  I'm also an Elementary Education major and I've taken two fingerprint checks, neither of which have come up with anything that the Board of Education found bad enough to bar me from teaching. Does that mean they didn't find anything, or that they don't care about my record?	Yes
I know someone who works at Walmart. They were fired for violating the patriot act according to Walmart. My Friend who I will name Bob(23)  is the Walmart worker. Bob's friend Stu is 16. Stu's dad wanted to send him some money but couldn't because he isn't 18. Instead Stu's dad sends the money to Bob, Bob then signs for the wired money while on break (isn't the issue). Stu also signs the wire transfer. Walmart then fires Bob for violating the Patriot Act and alleges money laundering. Stu was using the money to buy something at the store. Did Bob violate the patriot act?	Yes
I'm not exactly sure if this is the right thread for this, but I need some insight and don't know where else to go. My boyfriend and I went to hard summer this weekend, and on Saturday he got caught selling ecstasy pills and I got caught in the cross fire. Before entering the event he asking if I could bring in his ecstasy pills ( 7 pills , Oreos and jacks) for him, I said sure. We made it through security with the pills. About 15 mins later he asks for me to give him the pills , so I hand him the pills, and he walks towards the guy he was going to sell to. They do the sale and my boyfriend gets handcuffed immediately and seconds later I get handcuffed.  We got the exact same charges. Poss of controlled substance, transportation of controlled substance and conspiracy( 3 felonies). Now the only possible charge that is actually reasonable for me is possession because I did have his pills on me. The other 2 are complete BS because I was unaware of the sale and everything else. I literally just brought his pills inside the venue.  I really need some advice here on what to do. Does anyone know any good public defenders in San Bernardino ?   P.s. This was my first time in jail and ever getting arrested, I'm a full time college student and work full time Also please do not lecture me, I know I shouldn't even been around him if he was selling, I just didn't think about all the repercussions.  This is in San Bernardino California	Yes
I'm more curious than looking to aid in their dispute. The total of the reversed charges hits around $8,500. He's apparently claimed to two of them that his PayPal was hacked and someone stole over $100k from him, but went silent soon after that and has now deleted his Facebook account. PayPal seems to be working with my members, but they're claiming that even if they get their money back, they want to see charges filed. I can't say I disagree with them, someone like that should feel some kind of repercussions.	Yes
My uncle was a landscaper. He was working for someone that owns a family business company. They were working on a  yard and he needed to get something from the back of the truck. While he was standing behind the parked truck someone under the influence drove by and struck him . That was at 2pm yesterday. He was pronounced dead at the hospital around 3pm that day. His wife and children are obviously distraught. The man that hit him has prior d.u.i convictions. A couple of months ago my dad (his brother) passed away. My uncle was generous enough to help put in thousands for my dads funeral but with doing that his family is left with little to no money for my uncles funeral and other expenses. If the guy driving doesn't have a legal license or isn't insured are they at a loss? Is there any legal action they should try to take? 	Yes

A friend of mine is upset that I chose my current boyfriend over him. I am 17 in a state where the age of consent is 18. My boyfriend is over 18.  If everyone else denies it, what does my friend need to prove it?	Yes
When I was 17 or so I got an internal possession of alcohol violation, came with a $344 fine. Then when I was 19, i was just chilling with a few buddies at a small fire drinking a few beers and cops showed up for I have no idea why. Well I got a  second internal possession charge (after admitting to drinking which I should've avoided I now know but too late for that). That came with a $750 fine and a license suspension of 2 months. The event wasn't driving related whatsoever but I guess that's just how NH rolls, pretty unfortunate, lost my delivery driving job. Anyways, I'm 23 now turning 24 and it's still affecting me in slight ways. Two years ago worked for a company and would have been able to drive one of the trucks (making a few more bucks an hour) until the company found out it'd jack up their insurance having me on it, because of these unrelated to driving charges. My then boss was very skeptical because he thought I had been drinking and driving and said I should've been straight up with him until I cleared it up and told him the story. Anyways, couldn't drive there. Then this summer, i got a job landscaping and AGAIN am not able to be put on to my bosses insurance because it would jack his insurance up leading to me not being able to drive any of his company trucks. I for one think it's completely unfair that these nondriving related charges can affect me so much, but that's beside the point. Getting to the point, are these violations ever going to go away or stop affecting me? The officer who I argued with about my second violation said it would in no way affect me and all I'd get was a fine.	Yes
I have a friend who has a probation violation warrant out. He skipped out of dwai probation 3 years ago because his life was unstable. This was his first offense. Since then he's kept a steady job almost 2 years, started taking college courses and kept a stable apartment. He's ready to turn himself in and deal with the consequences. His goal is to get bail. Go to court. Hopefully be reinstated. Then comply with all probation rules and complete it. Any advice on to go about that? He has a lawyer who offered a flat rate of 2,000 for help. But he can't afford that and makes too much to qualify for a public defender.	Yes
So I was working at my dad's perfume store yesterday so he can take a day off. And I don't have that much experience, I occasionally fill in whenever he needs to take a day off for something. So yesterday I thought it was my lucky day cause I had two groups of people come in and buy nearly 500$ worth of items each but with credit cards. Now once again I don't have that much experience with this type of work. I just sold them the stuff but the procedure was the same as with any other group of people buying multiple items. Show them multiple stuff, bargain, and eventually they buy the stuff. I entered the price on the machine, they put in the card, they put in the pin, they signed the receipt and it was the end of that. Turns out both groups used stolen cards. So I get a call from my brother today saying both cards were stolen and we might not get the money for the stuff. But I pretty much followed the procedure I was told to, its just I don't know why we wouldn't get the money back.	Yes
"The State placed a restraining order on her to me about a year ago. During this year we have decided to ignore the order and remain living with each other.   I found out that she was cheating last week and the police got called from a third party, basically trying to ""help me"" and get her out of my house. She was arrested and released the next day.  On Friday 8/11, she kept calling me while I was at work because I changed the locks to the front door and she wanted to get in and get clothes, etc. I told her I wouldn't leave work. She said if I didn't come back immediately, she would come down to my job and make a scene. She said she would tell my boss about me stealing random items (I work in a grocery store).  I ended up driving back and had the police informed that I wanted a civil standby for her to get her things. They didn't show up immediately and she was screaming on the street, so to help my neighbors not hear any more I opened the front door. The police showed up and arrested her for being within 500 feet. She was released Monday.  I just want to know what I can do about her personal belongings. Can I carefully put them in boxes, not breaking any of them? And put them in the corner of my house so I don't see her things everywhere I look?  She is pregnant too, about 7 weeks. She told me that she will terminate it, but then jokingly said she should keep it so she can get child support from me. I told her if she were to have my child that I would take her to court the minute it was born and prove how unfit of a mother she is and take the child.  I don't have money for a lawyer but realize this might be the only route. Does r/legaladvice have any advice for me prior to contacting a lawyer?   I really appreciate it."	Yes
I was arrested in Big Bend in May (Federal checkpoint) for possession of less than a half ounce of marijuana. After being fingerprinted, photographed and waiting in the cell for two hours, I was released. The judge didn't accept the case, they said. No charges were filed, no citations were issued. I signed no documents and was not asked to reappear at a future date. Without asking too many questions, I got the hell out of there.  &amp;nbsp;  Naturally, I became very concerned for my record, and looked into getting the record expunged. I called several lawyers, both in my city of residence, as well as a few in west Texas.  &amp;nbsp;  However, before I got far, none of them could even find the arrest in the system. I figured at least the court/county that denied my case would have record of it, but they didn't. I also checked the DMV database ($3 fee), and it brought up nothing.  &amp;nbsp;  Can someone explain to me why this might be?	Yes
I'm unsure if there would be any drawbacks of just paying the ticket as I was not given a court date. A lawyer explained that I can plea not guilty, show up to community court, and be able to do community services and it will be cleared from my record. I'm not sure how true it is so I need all the info and advice I can get. I heard it can affect my financial aid too which I'm mostly worried about	Yes
Hello there, so for some time now I have been aware that my older brother (28) has opened up credit card accounts in my name using my social security number. I'm not sure how he could have done that, but in the past he had forged my dad's signature and spent $20k on a credit card opened up in my dad's name. I am 24 years old and live with my parents and occasionally I check my credit report because of student loans. I made an account with credit karma before my brother started the fraud, so that is really the only proof of my own identity. Great Lakes Student Borrower services doesn't even use my name tied with my social security, it is my brother's name now.   I tried confronting him about this two years ago and he has accused me of being on drugs and denied it all. I am pretty much 100 percent sure he is committing fraud against me, and the closer I get to finishing school and thinking about living on my own, the more I realize how screwed I am because of this identity fraud. I am a resident of the State of Wisconsin, my brother is now living in the State of Hawaii and I am suspect that he has also taken out a mortgage using my identity as well, any advice would be greatly appreciated.	Yes
So, this is a throw away account just in case because this deals with insurance, and I know little about it.  I posted in r/insurance and r/personalfinance too as I was referred.  A couple nights ago I was working an ON shift, and I typically park my car across in a lot that our company is allowed to use. This is downtown in a big city. Me, being a moron, left my spare set of keys and a spare debit card hidden in the center console. My shift ended somewhere around 7 am, and that's when I noticed my car was missing. Where it had been was replaced with a large pile of shattered window.     I called the police, and filed a police report. Then my dad (he handles the insurance and I pay him for it) filed a claim with our insurance guy. We have pretty good coverage, but the police have to search for the car for up to 14 days before the claim is considered I believe. Given the car was bought for about 7k, but certainly not nearly as valuable anymore, and there were things of value I could replace easily through insurance, I was not entirely upset.  Today, I was reviewing the cameras at my work out of curiosity. I noticed that my car started and took off at 330. I went backward in time and saw two people staring at it, looking around, and approach it at about 315. Their full faces are on camera, a little blurred, but identifying. The car window getting smashed was too dark to see, but there are companies with cameras next door.     What I would like to know is what would be my best option from here.    I can:    A. Report the footage to the officer.   B. Gather more footage and take my time.   C. Let the suits in Washington figure this out.    I do not want to do anything very illegal and obviously not commit insurance fraud, but I also would like to know my best decision financially.   I appreciate any and all advice.	Yes
"Hi guys, any help would really be appreciated. I'm going to be sentenced to 29 days in jail for carrying a loaded firearm in a public place. It is a deal offered by the DA for dropping two other infractions that happened at the same time with fines up to $3000. Here are some mitigating circumstances that may or may not help me.  -I'm a teacher and a very productive member of society -I have no criminal record, no priors -I was far away from anyone else, camping, when I was detained -I have 11 very-well written letters of reference  Here's the situation, my lawyer has determined the case to be unfightable (and I got a second opinion from a second attorney too, money going down the drain -__-) been trying to convince the DA to reduce my sentence with letters of reference, to no avail. Only positive thing is the the firearm will be returned to me, obviously I'm not a threat. So why the strict jailtime? The 29 days is pretty much set according to my lawyer; he also mentioned I can make a statement in court, but strongly advises against it because the judge may overrule not in my favor and request the firearms to continue to be withheld. Is there really nothing I can say during court to sway the judge?? Please help!!! The ""statement"" is literally the last thing I can do to avoid jailtime, I'm scared :( Anybody have any experience talking to the judge in court? Anybody know how much influence the judge has in deciding proper sentences? My lawyer told me that the strict jailtime punishment is meant to be something along the lines of ""setting an example"" for these crimes- which I feel is pretty cruel. I feel like going to jail will make me really bitter and turn me into a delinquent..."	Yes

Hello,  I live in the great state of Colorado, where you can get high legally in more ways than one!  Unfortunately that was not always the case, and in 2009 I received a possession charge.  It's really messing with my job (background checks) and would like to see what options I have.  It seems expunging would only work if I was under 18 (alas I was over 18 at the time) so I think my only option is to 'seal' the record.  I tried to talk to a few lawyers about this, even paid one... the result was just more confusion.  I tried talking to the assistant DA, they were not very helpful either.  It seems I need to wait 10 years, then file a bunch of paperwork, pay some money, and then the state will tell me if the record can be sealed or not...?  Can someone please help me understand the process for getting this sealed?    Thanks!!	Yes
When serving paperwork of a Notice of Court Hearing to a defendant in the case for a temporary restraining order, it must be done in person.   What happens if the individual has been elusive after numerous attempts? I am aware of the residence, yet the person is never there.   Can Substitute Service and Due Dilligence forms be used in this instance, or is hand-delivery the ONLY option? I would leave the docs with another adult at the residence.  The docs are: CH-100, CH-109, and CH-110.	Yes
"I just found 2 disconcertingly large marijuana plants growing hidden in a grove on the outskirts of my property where I rarely venture. I didn't plant them, and I have absolutely no idea how they got here. I know for a fact they weren't here in March.  Who do I talk to? Do I just tell the police and hope they believe me when I say I don't know how they got there? Or do I just destroy them myself? They're big enough that I'm afraid the police might think ""there's no way he didn't know these were here""  What do I do?"	Yes
I stole 2 packs of 9volt batteries, got caught, now i'm doing the Crime Accountability Program. This will cost me a total of $425.00USD but i avoid police and nothing will show up on my record.   My question is, since I was told i won't go to jail for this even if cops are called, if it would be cheaper to go to court and plead guilty? The fine is only $75.00, but the fee from C.A.P is $350.00. What should I do? I feel like a complete dumbass over this. No idea what I was even thinking.	Yes
Late Saturday night my downstairs neighbors called the police on my husband and I for arguing (the walls are thin here), we did not answer the door because the neighbors call the cops constantly over the most minor things like doing dishes, watching tv, walking around at night and so on, every time we HAVE answered the door in the past the officers simply tell us they got an anonymous complaint for noise, and that they couldn't hear anything, then they leave.  We stopped answering the door quite a while ago, because it's just an annoyance.  However when the police officers arrived Saturday night they MIGHT have heard my husband raising his voice, but we weren't in need of any sort of police assistance, it was just an argument, so we did not answer the door.  Anyway, today (Monday) I got a knock on my door in the morning while I was still in bed, then again at 6:00 PM, both times an officer not in uniform, but with a badge, had a clipboard with paperwork. The 2nd time I did try to answer the door but the officer was already leaving.  My question is this, what could they possibly want?  Could this be related to blatantly not answering the door on Saturday night over a noise complaint?  Or is this possibly a subpoena they are trying to serve on an unrelated case (last year someone attacked me and destroyed some of my property and he's still going through pre-trials)  Either way, I haven't gotten anything in the mail.  I'm just wondering what could be going on.  It's too late for me to call the district attorney's office to ask if this is about the court case I'm a victim in, and I'm scared it might not be about that and might be about that stupid argument my husband and I got into Saturday night....  Anxiety is eating me up about this.	Yes
"I recieved a felony DUI in Oregon last year. I served two months earlier this year and am out. I have a decent job now, however a couple ""dream jobs"" have opened up lately. Here is where I run into an issue. I do not know what to answer on the ""Have you been convicted of a felony (sometimes it asks for lower level crimes too, misdemeanor, etc) box. Now before you say to tell the truth, Oregon law EXPLICITLY does not allow that question. Oregon law HB 3025 states: This legislation prohibits an employer from requiring an applicant: to disclose on an employment application a criminal conviction; to disclose, prior to an initial interview, a criminal conviction; or if no interview is conducted, to disclose, prior to a conditional offer of employment, a criminal conviction. Portland (where I live) then takes it a step farther, basically stating that they must offer conditional employment before asking about a conviction. They are not even allowed to ask DURING the interview. They must first offer me a conditional offer of employment (cuz ya know, Oregon). After that, if they learn that I have a felony, they can only rescind if the felony directly applies to the line of work I would be in. So this leaves me in a weird spot. When filling out job applications, local companies and national companies (even ones with large legal divisions, think Amazon, various national mortgage agencies) ask that question. It is yes, or no, and you cannot proceed without selecting an answer. Do I tell the truth and have a 0% chance at getting the job, or do I lie since they are breaking a law by even asking that question? It gets even more complicated when looking at tax breaks for hiring felons. They get $2400 for hiring a felon within 1 year of his release date, and are protected by a federal bonding program where they can receive $5,000 fidelity bonds, free of charge, as an incentive to hire job seekers that do not qualify for commercial fidelity bonds. Some applications afterwards have you fill out a WOTC where it asks you questions about foodstamps, government assitance, and being a felon. If we decide that lying is the best course of action, do I then tell the truth on the WOTC part of the application to then not be considered a felon on the part of the application where I am being illegally discriminated against, but be considered a felon on the tax credit part where being a felon works to the companies advantage?  If anyone has any in depth knowledge of this law, or my best course of action, please advise."	Yes
10 years ago I traveled to a far away state I didn't live in and was caught with a small amount of marijuana and paraphernalia. Of course the court date for the charge was months after I was caught, and by that time I had already returned to my home state. I was also very poor at the time and could afford neither a lawyer, court fees and fines, or the money it would have cost to travel back to the state. Over the years I had forgotten about it, but now I have remembered and I am wondering what will happen if I hire a lawyer to deal with the charges. Lets say I hire a lawyer and go to court to deal with the charge. When they convict me, how will that conviction look on my record? Will it show up as a conviction in 2017? How will this impact background checks for jobs? I know most checks only look to see convictions that have have occurred in the past 5/7/10/etc years. Will the fact that I waited this long to deal with it make it look like a crime that was recently committed, and hurt my chances to pass background checks? I have had background checks done since I was originally charged with possession, and had the warrant issued against me, but these never showed up on any of the checks.	Yes

"This isn't anything dark, miss communication with someone on the phone who didn't like what I was saying so things turned to others and he must've reported it to the police, at this point in time I have no idea if he did or not. The police left phone mails asking to speak with me ""urgently"" do I need to report back to them or should I just see what it is regarding."	Yes
A while back I was experimenting with drugs and got into a situation where I got arrested for public intoxication and possession of marijuana. I live in Mississippi and am 18 years old. I have never faced such charges before and am just wondering what the possible outcomes could be? Fines, jail time, or even probation? I'm worried that it will carry jail time and can't find any information on these.	Yes
"Hello, here is my situation.   I was at a public beach on the 4th of July in Massachusetts. I was drinking with friends, and we noticed a few cops had appeared on the beach. Naturally, we shied away from said cops as we were already away from our stuff. One of our group members was not with us, and she was near all of the bags, especially mine. She was apparently questioned about the alcohol and such, and they dumped beers out of my bag. They did not stop at the beers, and searched through my entire bag, finding my wallet. They then searched my wallet and found my fake ID. I returned a few minutes later after the police had left, and was told all of this by the friend who had been questioned. Now, a week later, I receive a notice in the mail calling upon me to appear at a hearing in august to defend myself against these charges. The charges were being in possession of a fake ID, and some miscellanious charge that is specific to my municipality and that I figure I need to call in to ask for it to be identified. Was it legal for them to search my wallet? I was under the impression that police require consent or a warrant to search someone's property. I was not even present and therefore not complicit with their search.   To add to all of this, I turned 21 on the 5th......... and although that does not take away from the legal implications of this charge, there is an added ""fuck you"" factor because of that fact."	Yes
This is slightly personal, hence the throwaway, and this situation is based in South East Asia. So, I know that there will be a certain degree of difference but I just want to know what I can expect. Also note that I am not the embezzler  If a person has been embezzling money from the company and the company goes to the cops, will the tax records of the company be under scrutiny?   Also, if the some of the money embezzled has been used to buy houses listed under that person's kids names, will that money be recouped? Alternatively, is there any way to force the person to return the money without going to the police?	Yes
You own a product and something breaks on it. You go out and buy a new one and replace the part that's broke with the new one. You return the product to get your money back. Is this consider stealing? If not is this illegal?	Yes
Long story short my brother got charged with a class 4 felony possession, and a handful of misdemeanors. Was out on bond, kept using heroin, ended up getting arrested with another class 4 possession and another handful of misdemeanors. He is likely going to have a public defender. Do you think he will serve time? (This is Will county in Illinois)	Yes
This happened during the weekend, I had less than 1 gram of cocaine in my car, it was under my car seat and sometime during the drive it rolled out from under the seat. A cop pulled me over for a tail light not working and when he came to my window he noticed it, asked me to step out and then called for backup and searched my car and found it. I got arrested for possession of CDS and charged with a 3rd degree felony. I was released immediately as it was my first offense. I have received the court date for this Friday and I am not sure what to do. I am in US on a work visa, and have recently applied for an extension. I am scared on what to do, I have no experience in any legal matter and I am not sure on what the process will be. I really need advice on what to expect and how to prepare. I looked for lawyers online and made appointments with them, I searched online about first time offenses for possession it all looks so confusing, I have read about PTI(pre-trial intervention) and conditional suspended sentences, it says that if I can get either of those, the arrest records and can be expunged. Is it something I should bring it up with a lawyer ? Is it possible to get those sentences. I never did coke before ever, and I bought it just because I was curious and wanted to try it. I have no history of any arrests or any priors for that facet. Will I be jailed? will I be deported ? Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
It's just the morning after and I'm still a bit shaken over this, but not entirely sure which steps to take.  Last night my bf and I got into a fight over something trivial (he's currently staying with me while he sublets his apartment, until our new lease starts - yes I signed a lease with him).   During the argument I told him that I needed space and couldn't talk to him about this right now- I just wanted to be alone. He ended up locking me out of my room because I stupidly left the key inside and he took and hid my phone as well. When I was finally able to open the door he wouldn't let me through the doorway and ended up shoving me to the ground twice.  At some point- it's all a blur now, I make it past him and grab keys/phone and leave to take a walk.  I was on the phone with my best friend for the entirety of the walk, about 15 min. When I get back to the apt the front door is ajar, and my bedroom is locked. It took a while to open it because the lock had been damaged- when I finally got it open my entire room was trashed. There are several minor damages to the room, and after inventory my computer and a few other possessions (of low value) are missing.  I called the police and filed a report, can pick it up today and see if any charges can be pressed. They advised a restraining order (he's also known to be violent and had been in the past).  I'm at a friend's house now, as he still has copies of the apartment key. All of this puts me in a financial mess- we were signed to live together at the end of the month, obviously that's not happening but I'm signed onto that lease and have nowhere to go after 8/31.  What other actions can I take? Any hopes of getting my computer back or suing for damages?  TL;DR- got in a argument with bf, left him alone in apt, returned to find room trashed and computer stolen (and he put his hands on me).	Yes
My daughter, who is 16, rather foolishly allowed a guy to tie her up, tickle her, and videotape the whole thing, in return for $100. This guy has a business of some sort, but I can't tell if it's legitimate.  He has a business card but no website or anything, and this videotaping took place at his apartment.    I found out about this and called the number on the business card and spoke to someone.  At first the guy who answered was polite, and said that our permission was not needed because the video is not for public release.  But when I asked him to delete the video, he refused, and then hung up on me.    Is this considered producing child porn?  She was clothed (barely) but this was obviously sexual in nature.  Can I get him in trouble somehow?  I don't want other young girls to be victimized by this kind of abuse.    This is in California.	Yes
Hi, I am in VA and wanted to know the legality of this situation.  I talk to men on tinder and then direct them to my kik, where i sext and send nudes in return for money, usually $100 per session.  I have the money sent via e gift cards to my email.  Is this legal?	Yes
(VA) My friend let her boyfriend stay the night. She didn't know earlier that day he had committed a crime by going to his ex and stealing her things, hitting his ex, and so on. She also didn't know he had a preexisting record. A few days later he had to turn himself in. She was wondering if she would be in trouble for letting him stay the night? Could she be called in as a witness?	Yes
My exact location is NYC, but I'm just wondering in general, is there anything illegal about the content of r/sanctionedsuicide?  I stumbled upon it from a comment thread, and I feel very uneasy about it.  Especially underage folks writing out potential suicide notes, and, presumably, adults giving them advice on painless methods or telling them that they support their decision.  I fully understand that people can make their own decisions, but the Michelle Carter case comes to mind with some of the comments.  I obviously know nothing about the law when it comes to this, but I'm just curious.  Thanks.	Yes
When I was 16, I thought I was in an online 'relationship' with a 35 year old. I was in a bad place - I was lonely and sheltered. And he gave me lots of attention. I gave him naked pictures and videos to satisfy him. This went on for 3 years (met him online at 15, broke up at 18).   When we broke up, he texted me to tell me he'd released all my photos/videos. I told him I'm calling the police. He got cold feet and said he was only angry, and had done nothing. He revealed he had kids and would focus on them and leave me alone. Of course, he didn't stick to this - he continued to fuck with me, telling me I'd ruined his life etc. He was prone to obsessive anger. I became afraid, as I was just beginning my life.   I changed my name, my number and deleted all online profiles. I'm in my twenties now. I slowly came out of that shell and made a LinkedIn and Facebook. I forgot about him.  He found me again. I know it's him. He has the same patterns in typing and habit.  I got a text from a stranger (again in the middle of the night, asking me how I was. They gave a bogus name. So I said I was a Tom from another town. He apologised and left me alone.  The next night, he messages asking 'how wasn't your graduation tom?'. Which is too coincidental. I ask who it is - he replies that he knows who I really am, and tells me my actual name. He says I'm doing his head in, and God help me when he sees me. And that we will meet soon.  He doesn't respond to other messages.   Now I'm scared. I want to go to the police, but I'm afraid to set him off. He's been following me for 5 years. And I have little evidence of his grooming as I had to delete it all.  All I have are the threatening messages. And a picture of his face and dick. I don't have the pictures I sent him.  This guy has worked in law and he terrifies me. He has it in for me. I changed my name once, and went into hiding. I don't want to live in fear again. I just made something of myself...I'm just beginning my career. And I have these naked pictures hanging on a thread..  Can you please advise on what I ought to do?  **TLDR: I was groomed online at age 16-18 years old, by a man in his 30s. I do not have evidence of this, due to very intrusive parents and a will to move on. I changed my name and moved to a different city. The man was very obsessive, and has stalked me for 5 years, without my knowing. I know this as a stranger has made contact, displaying very similar patterns to the groomer. He is also very angry, and has threatened to hurt me. I am incredibly scared. I don't know what to do, as he has a huge stash of my naked pictures and videos. I am afraid he may release them if I trigger him. Please help**	Yes
Texas.  I have a bank account which was opened when I was 18 with my mother and step-father being co-signatures (big mistake). This means they have full access to my bank account. I used the account to deposit social security checks that I collected in my fathers name since he died. I'm told that I was eligible for the checks (around ~1800 each month) as long as I am in school full time. Since I graduated High School last month I don't believe I will see another one even though I am attending a 4-year University in the fall. If anybody can confirm this that would be great because my parents haven't given me a lot of details.  Anyway the checks had my name on it since I turned 18 and I endorsed them when depositing them into my account. I was told that the money would be used to pay for college, but I always knew that my mom took out a little each month to pay for general expenses. However I recently gained access to online banking (which they didn't allow me to view) where I have found out that they have taken a lot more than they said they had been. I found over 3,000 dollars in withdraws at an ATM in a casino...  Let me repeat that. They have withdrew over $3,000 dollars from my college savings account and used the money for gambling. I am beyond mad.  I also found over $9,000 has been transferred from the savings account into their general checking account. All of this has occurred in the 12 months since I turned 18 meaning that every dime that was even in the account was 100% mine since I received it as an adult with my name on the check. I realize the difficulties that pose in the situation since my parents are co-signatures on the account and therefore have the same right to the money as I do...  I confronted them yesterday and they acted offended that I question what they are doing with my money (!) and attempted to kick me out of the house. My mom is 100% convinced she is justified in taking my money and spending it on gambling and is completely outraged that I would object otherwise. My mom is a narc and my step-dad is just a dick who hates me. I see no way in getting them to pay back the money they took from me.  Ultimately, I understand that legally I probably don't have grounds to sue. Nor do I intend on suing my parents. If possible, I would like to get a lawyer to compose a document indicating that I believe they owe me this money and they should pay me otherwise I will take it to court. This would let them know that I am very serious about the matter because otherwise they will just ignore me.  I have since closed my accounts at that bank and withdrew all the money I had available.  What is upsetting is that this money was the only savings I had for college since my parents have refused to save their money for my college (they can't even keep their fingers out of money I saved). They will certainly offer me no financial assistance while in college so I am forced to take out $100k in loans to attend college. Side note: if I declare emancipation will that open me up for need-based financial aid considering my income is 0?  Anyway, thank you for reading this far. I am stuck in a very difficult situation and afraid I cannot reason with my parents. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
tldr; Someone came into my apt 3 separate times this week and stole varying amounts of candy each time. Apartment may have same locks and key for various units.  Kansas City, MO.  First off, let me start off with how my apartment building works. This is a fob entry building and you need a fob to get off any floor except the lobby. Which is why I believe it to be someone that lives in the building, namely my neighbor.  I have a roommate and we live in a small 2BR/2BA with a small entry way and living room. It's 6 regular steps to our living room, 14 to the kitchen, 15 and 17 to our rooms. I just want to show you how small it is. I came home Sunday from a 1 month trip visiting home while my roommate stayed here by herself. We have a candy bowl that I put candy in for guests and for ourselves.   I come home and see it's half full. Two days later, it's completely empty except for two pieces of candy. I ask my roommate what she did with it all, that's a lot of candy. She said she didn't touch it and her bf didn't touch it. We're both kind of freaked out but think it's stupid that anyone would come in and steal candy and nothing else. I chalk it up to a memory lapse or maybe I have carbon monoxide poisoning and did it, etc etc. I still called the front desk to let them know it was happening and refilled the candy bowl with reese's cups and hershey's kisses. I also talked to my next door neighbor and asked if he saw or heard anything recently. He said no, sorry, and closed the door. We just used a door jammer where even if unlocked, the door cannot be forced in. My 200lb brother couldn't even bust through it. I locked the doors and door jammed it every night until Thursday night, when I completely forgot to jam it.   I wake up Friday morning to go to work and all the bright, orange reese's are gone. I freak out, wake up my roommate and tell her to stop fucking with me cause it's not funny anymore. She told me she was awake all night until 5am, there's no way someone came in. Then she asked me if I woke up around 3am and I said no. She had heard someone in the living room/kitchen but thought it was me getting a snack. We call the front desk again and I head off to work around 9am.   My roommate heads off to work around 1pm and I got home around 3:30pm. Once again, the candy jar is completely empty except for the first two pieces they left the first time they stole our candy. So now they've escalated to daytime stealing. That is where I am left off night. Nothing has happened over the weekend. I called the police to report it over the phone but they want to physically come out and do a report. I went out of town and wasn't able to do it and my roommate worked all weekend. We also don't want to spook the thief because I really want to catch who is doing this. It's really freaking creepy and psychotic to just come in someones home to steal candy, just to fuck with us.   I believe it is the teenage boy because he is only 13, can't drive, and is on summer break. He also isn't the sweetest kid ever. I've seen him throw things and yelling racist obscenities at street walkers for no reason (we share the same window wall).  I had believed that perhaps someone has a masterkey or were picking our locks but my roommate actually talked to a tenant on our floor. The tenant said that when she first moved in, her key worked on three other units. I have already contacted the owner of my unit and let him know what was up and that he needs to come change my locks.  So, my problem is two part: this must be some sort of negligence/ security issue to have same lock for multiple units and how do I go about get this thief in jail or juvie. I am afraid that he will escalate from petty stealing to something worse. I don't want anyone else caught up in this after I move out. I am already hoping to do a stakeout tonight with my gopro recording as well as sleeping in the living room.   Thanks for sticking with the story and I apologize for my terrible writing. Any advice would be great, thanks!	Yes
I'm from Toronto.  i just found out that someone from Pennsylvania is dating a minor(16) even though he is 23.  I have texts between me and the 16yo, between the 16yo and the 23yo, and between the 16yo and others, as evidence.  This is obviously wrong, disgusting, and unlawful contact with a minor.  How can I report it to the police in McAdoo, PA?	Yes
I run at night because it's summer and can't afford to get a gym membership and I'm not a morning person. Because it's night, I run with pepper spray in one hand and a box cutter in the other. The blade on it isn't any longer than two inches-- very short. But im wondering if I would get in trouble if I got caught running around with an open box cutter, even if its only meant to (maybe) scare off predators while I try to scare off calories	Yes
"A friend of mine and I found ourselves where we were locked on my roof one night, both intoxicated and being very loud.  The cops ended up being called on us and to make a long story short the police had to kick down the front door to let us out.  My friend immediately was tackled and arrested due to the fact that when the police tried to grab his arm he pulled away and this was considered resisting arrest.  When it came to me I said minimal to the police, mostly, ""I would like a lawyer.""  The part of the police report that pertains to me is as follows, ""Officer ******* spoke with the second male and asked him for his identification. The male reused and indicated that he wanted an attorney.  Officer ****** advised him that he was not under arrest that he just needed to identify him.  The male again indicated that he wanted an attorney.  Officer ******* then placed the male in handcuffs, the male then identified himself as **** ********. Officer ****** advised Mr. ******** that he was not under arresst but was being detained during the course of the investigation and that if he cooperated he would be released. Mr. ******** stated ""screw you, I want a lawyer"".""    I recently received this summons in the mail with a disorderly conduct charge. My court date is in a couple weeks and I am wondering if it would be worth getting a lawyer or if there is anything else I should be doing to help myself in the situation. Any advice is appreciated."	Yes
New York here. Ill just state the whole situation, so on July 3rd, officer caught me &amp; friend urinating behind a car by the beach (no bathrooms nearby). We talk to him at the car and asks us for our ID, I stupidly give him my fake ID name as i am under  the legal drinking age. He starts to type in info and i realize how stupid that was so i give him my real info. Officer cuffs me &amp; pats me down (was never read rights?) and driven back to station . I was charged with PL 245.01 (exposure of a person), was told likely an ACD for ~6mo.  Just a few questions, is it recommended to get a lawyer for this or is it something i could handle? i only ask because in my position a lawyer would be hard to afford. Am i entitled to a court appointed defender/lawyer or anything of the sorts? also if the only charge was the exposure of a person is a judge able to see anything reguarding the fake ID.  Any help is appreciated &amp; sorry for the wall of text guys, just bugging out seeing as my court date is the 17th and trying to figure out what the next move is.	Yes
Cops discovered I had been using a fake tag for street parking near where I work. One day a cop approached my car and asked me if I had the fake tag, I said I didn't at the time. He stated that I wasn't in trouble and he just wants to get the tag back....... I agreed to just meet him on the streets I park around later in the week and hand it over to him. So yes, I did something very stupid. Since he knows I had the tag and claimed I still had it and knew about it, would it be best to give it to him? And finally, is there a good possibility I will be arrested for this...	Yes
So i was out the other night with a couple friends and not so wisely decided to bang out a couple doughnuts in an empty parking lot. Shortly after a cop rolled up and wrote me up for reckless driving. I am not sure weather or not i should hire a lawyer to fight this and court or what the cost would be to do so. Any help would be great, -Ryan	Yes
Like the title states when I was 19 I was an escort for about a year. I was groomed into it by a man I met online. Tony. When I met him I was under the impression he wanted to be my sugar daddy. Instead I was greeted by him and a couple of his girls at a nice hotel. One girl in particular was the star of the show. We were all taken care of by her. Her name was Mo. They promised up to 1,000$ a day for my services. I didn't have a choice I had nothing. We were forced to see up to 8 guys in a single day. Then cut our profit with Tony.  However eventually I came to my senses, took my cash and cut ties. It was incredibly corrupt. They remained bitter at me, sending the occasional threatening message. Very petty nothing worth worrying about. He had my real information such as my email &amp; full name.   Cut to about a year later and a former client sends me a news article. Seems Tony got greedy and started his own service. Except he had really fucked up. He was a third striker caught with an underage girl. Mo lured her in so she was also caught and they went to jail. I was completely removed from their life when they made these choices. Cut to three days ago. I get an email from a detective. He knows my full name. He wants to speak to me immediately. Wants to know everything I know. What the heck do I do!!! I'm terrified.	Yes
Are knives equipped with SpeedSafe® Assisted Opening by Kershaw legal in California?  I know that laws in California are fairly restrictive when it comes to knives, so I always stick to small everyday carry knives that you can only open using 2 hands. Recently I came across this one being sold in walmart in California: https://www.walmart.com/ip/Kershaw-Blur-S30V-Steel-Stonewashed-Knife/21980329, I was fairly surprised, given that it has some sort of assisted opening. I later asked few friends of mine from the police department, but I would also like to know the opinion of the lawyers. More about the technology is here: https://kershaw.kaiusaltd.com/technology  My question is specifically about this knife model, so I will appreciate if people only comment if they have specific knowledge or experience.  P.S. I don't know if mentioning a specific brand or retailer is a violation of the rules here, but I am not affiliated to any of them and not trying to promote or otherwise affect brand visibility.	Yes
So my buddy just called me, he had been on a dating app and been talking with this girl. She was posted as 19 and going to college in a few weeks and was just looking to mess around. Things happened and nudes were sent. After a few days she wanted to meet up and he was trying to figure out the logistics. Before that happened she told him she was actually just turning 17 in a few weeks. He said the hell with this deleted the nudes and cut contact. The next day he gets a call from a supposed lawyer and the lawyer said the father was an understanding guy and just wanted to talk to my buddy and figure out what happened. He got a weird vibe asked about the law firm and got vauge answers so he said he can't verify the lawyer he won't talk to him. Me and another buddy have been looking into the supposed lawyer and the name given doesn't show up on the MN and ND lists. I called the number and got a different last name that was a lawyer. The cellphone number doesn't match the lawfirms number. We are all confused and this smells of scamming... anyone have any similar situations or advice we would greatly appreciate it.	Yes
So I will keep this brief. Bought cigs for a friend since she is between paychecks. She told me I would have to buy them as her license was expired and the place we were at has legitimately given her shit for expired license before. She can not get her license renewed until she passes some court mandated course or whatever. I dont have all the details.   Anyways long story short. I Buy them for her and a cop sees me hand them to her after buying them. He checks her ID, sees the date, and then tells her that it is expired and that he would need a valid ID.   She says that is all she has and that I was driving. Cop looks at me and takes my license. He goes into his car and comes back out with a ticket for me to sign. Buying cigs for a minor...   The date clearly says born in 94 on her license but because its expired he apparently can ignore this?   Is there an easy way I can get this dismissed? I do not have the money for a lawyer as I recently had to pay for hernia surgery and I am tapped till the end of the year.   Can I get her to take her birth cert, SS card, and expired license with me up to the courthouse?	Yes
If someone writes 3000 worth of fraudulent checks from my bank account, what is the usual punishment for that? Also what is the standard statue of limitation? I live in IL btw.	Yes
"Firstly, I'm not as much looking for legal advice specifically but for anything that could help me in this situation. I don't want to give away my country of residence. I live in the EU, I hope this is enough information. Mods, if you think this post doesn't belong here, feel free to delete it. But it'd be nice, if you could point me in  a better direction. *I am afraid. Please hear me out.*  **TL;DR:** Found child-porn on my flatmates computer but don't want to call the police on him because  he is my friend and I may be in more trouble than him if the police searched our place. **TL;DR END**  The current situation: My flatmate and I live in my fathers house, I get to stay there for free, he pays a small rent.  It's not big but it's enough for two people. My dad lives in a house directly across the street  and we use his internet, more about that later.   Short introduction to my flatmate, let's call him Nick.  Nick is the personification of the term ""neckbeard"".  He has long hair, a beard on his neck, his room is always messy, he showers only once a week,  instead of a carpet he has worn boxers. He doesn't work, spends 90% of his time in front  of his gaming-rig and his mother pays all his expenses. He orders almost all of his food online  and in the rare case that he attempts to cook something by himself, the whole house smells horrible  and the kitchen is dirty (of course he doesn't clean up after himself). He takes my food  without asking. It has gotten so bad that he eats almost a third of it because he is to lazy to go  out end buy some himself. To top it of he owns a Katana-like sword. The only thing missing is a fedora. Sometimes he leaves the house for hours at weird times and never even gives a hint as to where he goes. Why did I let him move in with me? Despite all of the above, he actually is a very nice person and totally  oblivious to the fact that he is a neckbeard. Also, i didn't know how bad his neckbeardism was until  he moved in and we were friends for a long time.  Here is what made me suspicious of him and how I found the cp:  Clue 1: He once sent me a picture of a naked loli-girl (young anime girl for those who don't know what  ""loli"" means) and told me how cool it looked. The girl in the picture made a pose that concealed  her vagina and (probably non-existant) breasts. There was no real sexual aspect to it, the pose  was not sexual in any way. It was well drawn and actually looked pretty cool tbh. I also try to be  open minded, and loli isn't real.  Clue 2: He sometimes sends me memes about cp, but we have pretty dark humor.Even though the cp-memes  didn't really match the stuff we sent to each other normally, I didn't think too much of it.  Clue 3: Not really a clue, but it contributed to my actions: Nick has zero social awareness. He randomly puts his hand in his pants, blows his nose in his hand,  farts while talking to people and doesn't even realize that all the things he does may be disgusting. And of course the fact that he is a cliché neckbeard.  All of this made me think:""Well, if this isn't the perfect out-of-the-book pedophile."" And then I realized that he is using my fathers internet. My father once got (wrongly) accused  of being a pedophile by his crazy ex-girlfriend, therefore an investigation due to his internet access  being used to download cp could be more than dangerous for him.  I made a plan: Open Nicks Computer while he is away, get his harddrive, copy all of it's contents  to my own as fast as possible, put his PC back together and review the acquired data later.  I executed the plan, but didn't really think I would find anything. I just wanted to be sure.  What I found: *Several loli-pics. *A japanese loli-game. *A 15 minutes video of a ~ten year old girl masturbating (presumably) in front of a webcam.  I was horrified. I only watched a few seconds of the video, but I almost threw up on my keyboard.  I immediately deleted it.  After I calmed down a little I took my phone and wanted to call the police. But here are the problems:  *I now have cp on my harddrive. Even though I deleted it, it can be retrieved in case the police  decides to take my computer too. I could overwrite all free space on my disk (and thus making it  impossible to retrieve the deleted data), but that would be even more suspicious.  *Stealing someones personal files is probably illegal and evidence that was acquired trough illegal  means is often ignored by the court.  *I browsed some shady imageboards and accidentally stumbled over sexualised pictures of children. Not  even nude pictures, but little girls in swimwear doing poses and such. In case they can find out what  sites I visited in the past year, they may think I'm a pedo too.  *Sometimes I look and hentai-pictures online, so naturally I came across some loli material too. When  this happens I just ignore it as there is no real sexual appeal in it, but the police can't know that.  *I'm somewhat of a privacy freak. I use TOR browser, extra-long passwords and encrypt everything I can. One doesn't need much fantasy to turn this into just another pedo who is trying not to get caught.  *We laid our internet-cable from my fathers house to our house under the street. This was my dads idea  and probably is illegal.  *I used an encryption program to overwrite a few of my old hardrives so nobody can retrieve my old data.  The police will probably think there are hidden volumes with cp on them because there is no way to tell  the difference between a ""cleaned"" drive and and encrypted drive.  *I still kinda like Nick. He is just such a nice person and seems so helpless in his total ignorance  of everything. I don't think he would actually harm a child. And I don't want his mum to find out. She is  very sweet and protective of him and seeing her only child being locked away as a pedophile would break her  heart.  Long story short: If I called the police, my flatmate wouldn't be the only one having problems."	Yes
So I posted on Craigslist looking for women or couples who will let me jerk off in their panties/thongs (yes, I'm weird).  A guy emailed me about it, but when I asked if he would ask for or if he had his girl's permission this is what he said:  She wouldn't be into it. But she won't find out either. I've cum in her panties many times and put them back in her drawer. She's never known.  I've even used her when she's passed out drunk and cum on her face. She never knew.   Is there a way to report this? If so, how do I do it and is there a way to do it anonymously?  Will I have to talk to the police myself, or can I just submit the emails?  I'm kind of freaked out right now, and would like to avoid doing this publicly because I'm kind of embarrassed about my craigslist post/fetish...  All I have is his email address and the messages.  I have not yet responded to that last email	Yes
If an employer is doing a background check on me and I have a misdemeanor from 2013, does it show the court documents and the police report or just the charge?	Yes
My girlfriend with a mental condition (schizophrenia) has a friend who constantly makes her feel bad until she sends a sexually explicit image to her. If she doesn't respond to him (he lives in New York) then he berates her and curses at her.    This past day there were over 45 missed calls from him while we were spending time together. I didn't know she was doing this until she told me he was yelling again because she hadn't answered today, and I finally snapped and called him out on it. He eluded to having the images which led to my learning she had been doing this, and then spoke of how he got annoyed and mad at how she didn't send these images so he got mad. Today was the first day I learned of this. Once she learned I knew about what she did for him she cut herself so deeply she was in the ER and the other guy was unapologetic at his actions. I'm not sure if this has any legal grounds. Would it be helpful to call the police and report this? We are both 20 so are rather inexperienced. Apologies if this is written badly. I'm a mess.	Yes
**Only serious replies please, I know I screwed up**  Hello,   I was caught leaving a mall holding a $300 item. I desperately need advice.   One of my relatives needed to have repair done on an item at the Apple store. The wait time was about 2 hours. We submitted our information and decided to wait. I wanted headphones for myself and my husband. I took one pair, did not get caught and decided to wait in the queue to pay for the 2nd pair. While waiting I needed to go to the bathroom and I was in line to ask how much longer the wait. During that point I had a bit of an accident since my bladder is weak after giving birth recently. I was standing right by the exit and I was embarrassed. I decided to go to my car quickly, but I did not put down the item I planned on paying for. Prior to any of this I told my relative I need to go to the bathroom and I was checking on the queue before leaving. When the the leak first started I thought it might be a gush of blood since I am postpartum then I realized it was urine. I left the store holding the item.. I realized I had the item in hand and I didn't know if I should go back or not with urine dripping down my leg. I was embarrassed and decided I will get my extra clothing, come back, and act like I was there the whole time. I'm sorry for the TMI.   Outside the mall I was apprehended by a man dressed in casual clothes saying I was shoplifting, I told him and showed him the urine and a puddle was starting to form under me. I explained it was an error on my part but I was going to the car and planned to return which I know sounds bogus.. I gave him the item and said he could follow me to my car. I explained I was panicking about my situation. He started to get forceful and I resisted. There was no real proof he was security or anyone at that point.. despite that I still tried to explain myself and remain civil. I tried to get away from him. He caught up and put handcuffs on me and people in security outfits came at that point. I was arrested and taken to the local police department. It was written as at 4th degree for prosecution. This is my first offense and I am 36 years old with children. I was told this can get downgraded to the lower courts and etc. I'm not sure what to do at this point because I'm sure they can see on the footage I took the other item too.. I was not charged for it.	Yes
I've been on probation for the last three years. I got caught with a fair amount of weed a couple years ago and got put on 2 years deferred adjudication. I violated once last year, but got re-instated with one year added. Today I saw my probation which he said would be the last time. So my question is will I go before my judge before I'm off or what exactly happens now. My official off date is August 22.	Yes
"Hi, I have a question regarding FBI background checks.    I am applying for a job at a mortgage company and I would be required to take something called ""Safe Act exam"".  For this, an FBI background check will be done and I believe you cannot have a felony within the past 7 years.   2 years ago I was in court and pled guilty to a felony charge of burglary.  Though the crime happened when I was under 18 and it is sealed.    Would this felony show up on an FBI background check despite being sealed?  Am I wasting my time even applying for the job I am applying for?  Thanks in advance for answers"	Yes
"Police saw I had a fake or otherwise not mine, parking pass one day while I wasn't with my car. Long story short They found me a week later in my car about to leave it on the street in a 2hour parking. I didn't give it to them but I may have given them enough information to meet the low standard of probable cause. The officer wanted to meet with me later in the week so I could hand him the pass and, ""aren't in any trouble just want the pass"". I talked to two criminal attorneys that said to not meet or give up the pass to this guy. My thing is, during the initial talk I gave him my license to check and my cell phone #. If he does end up trying to call me my idea is to not answer. Not that the problem will necessarily go away but I don't want to give any more information to this guy. Thoughts?   If i get a criminal complaint, will be hiring a lawyer for the clerk hearing for sure."	Yes
I know similar questions have been asked before, but I know advice can vary by location as well. I was pulled over for driving on a suspended license, and completely spaced the court date. I'm fairly certain that means I will now have a bench warrant for failure to appear, in addition to having to take care of my original charge.   I work from home so the driving hasn't been an issue lately, but now I am trying to get another job -- and even if I don't drive (because of my license), I want to clear the warrant before applying, or at least be well on my way to taking care of it so I can explain it to any potential background checker.   I know the best thing is to get a lawyer, and that potentially a lawyer will offer a tiny bit of free advice -- but is the advice going to just essentially be that it's best to have a lawyer, and that I need to get it cleared ASAP? Because I know that, but I have no money (like, just enough to pay bills and probably set up a payment plan with the court if necessary). If I go to the court, or even just call, what happens next? I take care of a parent and kid so it would be really bad to go to jail. (Otherwise I'd just bit the bullet and go for a short period.)   TL;DR: What's the best bet for getting my warrant cleared, without spending time in jail, and can I do it on my own? How likely (approximately) is it that I'll get arrested if I go in on my own?	Yes
An officer came to my home to speak to me after I specifically told him on the phone that I wanted to speak to him the following day instead of the day that he called me. When we spoke he asked me a broad question to which I replied yes. He took that as an admission of guilt and said I was guilty to everything. Now a police report is going to be filed. Everything was in person, I never wrote a statement and there is no real solid evidence against me besides that I'm a suspect. This is about a texting harassment case.  Basically my question is what will be in this police report? Will he say I'm guilty even though I answered a broad question?  Montgomery County-MD	Yes
I am a victim of armed robbery that happened few weeks ago and tried my best to provide all the information that I could recall (their height, accent, color of the vehicle). Unfortunately, there is no physical evidence except the cameras on highway since it was very late and those as*ho**s covered their face with a scarf.  Borough detectives called me yesterday and they said they were able to find the vehicle and its owner that match with the descriptions that I gave. They said the vehicle's owner was once arrested for attempted burglary and the vehicle was actually following us. However, they told me that arresting the suspects and bringing them to the county jail/borough police station would be difficult tasks since they do not have an enough physical evidence. Isn't it possible to investigate the possible culprits if the detectives are confident enough? I am afraid that they will end up not getting arrested since I am pretty confident that the culprits ended up discarding all the evidences (wallets and a backpack) so that they can find a loophole to be exonerated, if they get caught.	Yes
My parents and I were recently involved into an armed robbery (two young thugs followed us from the casino after they saw my dad winning some money. They did not shoot us, but one of them threatened us with an actual handgun) and got a notification from the county detective that they got arrested few days ago. I am glad that these stupid thugs, as they committed armed robbery few more times before they got arrested, are caught and will serve their sentences. However, I am concerned whether my family would be able to get the money back or not. They stole approximately 4,000-5,000 dollars in total and threw away all of our wallets and my mom's backpack right after they robbed us.   PS. How much jail time would they have to serve if they were arrested for multiple cases of an armed robbery? I have been hearing a lot of different stories, from 5 years to even 20 years. I am pretty sure they cannot afford to have a lawyer.	Yes
"Today I was pulled over.  When the vehicle came to a stop I cracked the window to about 1/2in, enough to hear the officer's commands and hand over my identification.  The officer approached my driver's window and stood there.  Said nothing, then opened my driver's door.  I was flabbergasted, I asked him what right he had to open my door.  He replied, ""You didn't put the window down.""   As I see it, if I had something illegal in the door of my car, he would not have known about it until he opened the door.  Which seems to me like an illegal search.  Could someone weigh in on this?"	Yes
Can a screenshotted snapchat of a little bit of weed (like maybe an 8th) be enough for police to come do a search? I have been threatened by an ex and I would really like to know if this is possible. He says he will report the photo to the police.	Yes
I want to gift an old balisong i own to my nephew but he is 17 and i dont want him getting in trouble. Texas btw	Yes
"[14 Disposition](http://imgur.com/V3YMkwJ)  [14 Court Records](http://imgur.com/JPe0hXg)  [15 Disposition](http://imgur.com/phk75om)  [15 Court Records](http://imgur.com/8wEDBcW)  The violation concerns another forgery case from a different state in which the defendant took a plea deal and got 3 years probation and was then extradited to face a probation violation for the above cases.  From what I can tell there was a 60 month sentence and a 60 day sentence laid down to be served concurrently on 6/12. However the defendant was released from custody on the 14th and remains out. Then it seems on the 21st the case continues in some way. The probation seems to have been terminated unsuccessfully instead of revoked which I understand to be two different things, correct? Then where does the 60 months come from? Also what is ""pay or appear"" exactly?   Any help is greatly appreciated on the admittedly limited information I've provided."	Yes
Hi I'm 15 years old and three days ago received a citation for a curfew violation. I snuck out with two other friends and we did fireworks illegally at a neighborhood lake. When we accidentally exploded a firework that was supposed to be thrown underwater we ran far away into another neighborhood. On our way home a civilian started to follow us. We asked a neighbor for help because we were concerned and did not know what the suspicious car wanted. The cops came and witnesses reported us 'Trying to open car doors' (complete lie) we made it clear that we were just walking home. The neighbor that we asked for help happened to be apart of H.O.A and someone took pictures of us doing fireworks. So the cops knew we did fireworks but since I was not in possession of them I did not get a ticket. (My friend had the fireworks and ran before the cops came)   So I thought that I could just go and pay the fine but it turns out I actually have to go to court. My court date is a little while from now and I'm very worried. This is my first bad encounter with the police and do not know what to do. I'm afraid to answer if the judge asks what was I doing and I say fireworks he will charge me the maximum fine ($500)   What do I say or do? I just want to say that I was walking home. (Which I was) and not mention the fireworks. But I'm worried someone sent them the pictures. Please help.	Yes
Seeking some legal advice as well as wondering what to expect for my case.   Im 23, and I was arrested when I was 18 for possession of a controlled substance (one Xanax, a felony) in the state of Florida. I made bail, and didn't show up for my court date. A year and a half later, I turned myself in and three months later was released on probation. I violated my probation a month later and moved across state lines out of fear of going back to jail. This was almost four years ago, and I feel like it's time to go home and deal with my problem. I was a different person back then, and since I've been gone, I've had zero encounters with police and have been a productive member of society, got married, and became a chef. I'm wondering what to expect..   Is my best option to get a lawyer? What is that gonna cost me? I have some money saved, but only around $1,000. Is that enough? I'm hoping since I've completely turned my life around and it's been four years that a lawyer could get it thrown out, or at least get me off with probation/little to no jail time. I support my wife and myself and she wouldn't be able to make ends meet without me around. What should I do? How effective would a lawyer be in my situation? This is my only legal trouble as an adult, I got in trouble when I was 16 but had it dismissed. Any advice is greatly appreciated.   Thanks!	Yes
Hi. So I was charged with one count of felony embezzlement from my previous employer. I stole $429.12 which I know seems oddly specific, but I worked at an animal hospital and tried to make it seem like someone had returned merchandise for this amount and the returned the amount onto my debit card. I was desperate for money (I still am) and used it to pay bills, get my cars oil changed, gas, food...nothing really important at all. Well come the next day, my boss noticed that something was off with the transactions from the day before. She started asking all of us up front a lot of questions and I panicked. I left work right in the middle of my shift and drove away. I then called and texted her asking if we could meet somewhere out of the hospital. I told her I took the money and she seemed surprised actually. She said she would have to tell the owner of the hospital and she would let me know by Monday (8/28) what the owner decided to do. She never got back to me, so I called her the next day which was this morning to ask. She said she filed the report and thought there was a warrant out for my arrest. I freaked out and started sobbing because I've never been in legal trouble before and my record is clean up until now. I called the district attorneys office to see if the warrant was indeed true, and she said yes and to go to the magistrates office. I did, and they all seemed surprised but kind of nice about the whole thing. I was crying this whole time and didn't know the charge was embezzlement until they had me do fingerprints and talk to the magistrate. The magistrate released me on an unsecured bond of $1500, which means I got to walk away without paying anything. He set my preliminary court date for tomorrow at 9am. I am freaking out because I didn't have time nor the money to get an attorney. I called the public defenders office and they said it takes 5-10 days to get my application approved for one and that I can ask for one tomorrow at my hearing. The problem is I wanted a lawyer to help me tomorrow since I have no idea what I'm doing. My grandmother told me to plead not guilty since a felony like this will be on my record indefinitely and basically screw me out of any job prospects which I cannot afford to not work hence the whole embezzlement thing...I just don't know what to do. Any help or advice is appreciated as to what is going to happen tomorrow	Yes
"My friend [F25] was out drinking at bar with a few friends and acquaintances over this past weekend. She drove home very drunk and one of her ""friends"" followed her home and raped her in her apartment.    I want my friend to go to the police and file a report against this scum bag so he doesn't find another drunk victim to rape, because I just don't think this was his first time. She doesn't want to go to the police because she drove home drunk and is afraid of the consequences. Can she get charged with a DUI or a misdemeanor if she admits that she drove home drunk without any incidents? If we find out that it's unlikely, then I think she'll agree to file a report of rape against this guy. Once that question is mostly answered, we need to find out if there's enough ""evidence"" of the rape to actually do anything. She's really worried that it'll just be her word against his.   Thank you for any help/advice on this issue. It's such a sensitive situation and she nor I knew where to turn to for help."	Yes
Hey everyone, I was recently accepted into a neuroscience PhD program and I'm concerned about an upcoming background check. Around 5 years ago I was arrested with two felony counts of possession of a controlled substance. However, I was never convicted of anything and the case was dropped. During the application process, I correctly answered no when I was asked if I had ever been convicted of a crime. I never had arrest record expunged and I'm concerned that my offer will be removed due to being arrested. I'm hoping since I was never convicted of anything that they won't care, but I can't help but worry. I've already notified my current employer that I'm leaving and signed a lease on an apartment in the city I would be going to school in. If my admission offer gets pulled I will be screwed and have no idea what I would do. I'm wondering if I should preemptively explain my situation and how I've dealt with it would be of any benefit. I've also never been in trouble before or since.  Any advice or related anecdotes would be greatly appreciated. Also, I'd rather not post my location or where I would be attending school due to privacy issues. Thanks.	Yes
I was in a car accident a few weeks ago after buying a gram from a dealer.  The cops showed up to help despite both of the cars begin drivable, none of the airbags deployed, and only my car sustained damage.  The accident was my fault, just to be completely transparent. I was also not under the influence of any drugs.  One of the officers said he smelled marijuana in my car and told me he wouldn't bust me if I gave it to him.  I told him I didn't have any but gave in and gave him the gram of weed.  They then asked me to help him bust the dealer who sold me it so that they wouldn't charge me with a misdemeanor which I did, however, I was under the impression it would be a one time thing. He said I wouldn't want a misdemeanor so I should help him bust the dealer. I did that once and was just called back to do it again although I was told it would only be once.  This occurred in my old home town which is an hour or two away. I'm starting school soon and don't have much money so I can't afford to get up there with gas and tolls. I was wondering if I am obligated to do this again or what my rights are within this situation.	Yes
"Hi, last year I was charged with petit theft, around September (stupid, I know). I've been paying my fines on time and haven't been in any further trouble and don't plan to.   Today I received a letter for a ""notice of resetting hearing"". Does anyone know why this would happen? I was sentenced last year and my punishment was one day in jail (served) and a few hundred dollar fine, which I am paying and haven't missed any payments. The reset is set for August 23rd, so next month. One month before my sentencing last year.   Sorry I'm just a little flustered and nervous, I wanted this put behind me. If you have any questions I'll answer them."	Yes
I'm a minor in Virginia and a few months back I got caught with a guy I met off of Grindr who I was trying to buy meth from. At Juvenile and Domestics court, I was told he took the plea deal and everything was done and if they needed me, they would call me back. I just got a different subpoena today for circuit court. Between the time I thought everything was over with and the subpoena for circuit court I have traded pictures with other guys and hooked up with other guys as well.  I currently don't have any charges on me and was considered a victim in the case. Is it possible for them to place charges on me for hooking up with other guys without telling them my age?	Yes
I have been granted a temporary order of protection against an individual who is borderline delusional and 100% stalking me. The day before I changed my phone number, he sent me 89 texts alone (not counting Facebook messages, e-mails) and this person was also calling my home and cell phones from blocked/anonymous numbers.  I've changed the numbers and subscribed to TrapCall to prevent more anonymous calls, and had my phone company block his phone number and all numbers I know to be associated with him. A few weeks ago, I set my phone to automatically reject all calls with blocked called ID...the problem is, only the ones I answered showed up on my phone bill and those that did show up, are listed as restricted/withheld. The hearing to make the protective/no contact order permanent is scheduled for August 15... is there anyway to obtain this person's phone records to do it?  Also, this individual put a tracking app on my phone and has been monitoring every text, call and google search I make for who knows how long...except of course I can't prove it was him. This is so frustrating. The burden of proof should NOT be on the victim. Just looking for any suggestions or ideas that might help me prove to the judge why the order should be permanent. Thanks.	Yes
"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	Yes
I'll save you the time: was pulled over, police found a small amount of cannabis.  On top of getting a lawyer, any tips/links on how court works, what I should do etc?	Yes
I am posting this for someone, and I am unsure if the details provided or 100% accurate as well. They are how ever close to the truth.    Around this time last year a young man (I will call him person A) was killed in a hit run by another (I will call him person b) young man in my hometown while person a was walking home from work late at night. Person b then removed person A's body from underneath his car, moved his body away from the side of the road and sped off.   As the days followed he had help from his dad with cleaning his car, and then hid his vehicle at his uncles business. Person A is now out on a $50,000 personal bond, and has court dates coming up  Is there anything I can do to help her?    https://imgur.com/gallery/yz5b0	Yes
"[QLD, Australia]  I have pet rats, I know they're not everyone's favourite pet but I care about my pet rats very dearly (try imagine them how you would feel about your pet dog or cat). However I had to go to America for work related stuff and left my rats (2 female) in care of a person who I looked after their dog for 3 months+ when they were on holidays.  I was gone for about 3 weeks, I came back and instead of my rats being in their cage the person had put them in a plastic container with air holes in it. I asked why and they said it was because the rats developed lice- occasionally rats can get lice from things like bedding or saw dust, etc. Then after treatment they put them in the container to apparently limit the rats from potentially getting lice again.  However the container was moist from the rats spilling water and peeing in the container as rats do. Well lo and behold I put the rats back into their clean cage and didn't thing much about it because they didn't look sick. However I had the rats out in my living room for a run, one of them peed on a newspaper and there was a live maggot in the urine patch. I could not believe what happened. Then I picked both of them up at separate times and did the gross thing of ""checking them over"" and one had pus coming out of her urethra with a revolting and strong ammonia smell, while the one that had the maggot come out of her has an inflamed/gapping vag.  I have them both booked in for the vet tomorrow while I'm sincerely worried they're going to die, I know they're easily replacing animals but I don't want them to die and it's costly, also if there's no hope for them I'm going to have to get them put down because I don't want them to die slowly. Apparently they were left in moist plastic container for 2 and a half weeks which obviously caused like a thrush infection of horror on them. I consider this to be animal cruelty and don't know what to do.  I do have text messaging from the person telling me how long they put them in the container for."	Yes
I was just released from conuty jail in Monroe, MI for these charves. They took my blood test, which I agreed to, before I came in. I'm very scared and not sure what to so next. This is my first offense and I have no other criminal record. What can I expect to come of this on my court date? Am I going to jail?	Yes
Dunno what's really pertinent here but I have a record in two states living in a third. I'm a pretty stable schizo with two jobs and a BA. I've lived in my new city for 10mos and have been pulled over for nothing a dozen times since my two jobs are in a redlined neighborhood and a nice suburb. I received ~$200 pair of tickets for operating w/o insurance and driving on a suspended registration. I paid the tickets well ahead of deadline but came home to find info staying that a bench warrant was put out on me but apparently according to the clerk's website I'm good. So what's the deal with this type of situation. I'm not even clear on if these are simple tickets misdemeanors or whatever (WI). 	Yes
"I listed an item for sale on the app LetGo for $300. I received a full price offer and provided my PO Box for payment. Since then I've had several red flags.   * The buyer asked for my phone number for the check, and since we've been communicating via text. The buyer has used two different phone numbers.  * The buyer has yet to provide a delivery location. When I bring it up, I am told they will provide one once I receive the payment.   * The buyer revealed on Friday they sent a check via a tracked method and became very pushy that I cash the check over the weekend via an ATM or mobile deposit.  * The buyer states they want the item by Wednesday as the reason for the urgency.  * The cashier check that arrived was drafted from an Atlanta, GA local credit union, with a return address of Brooklyn, NY.  * The cashier check that arrived was for $1,850. The sale amount was $300.  Obviously this is a scam and more than likely the ""buyer"" is going to ask me to arrange shipment and then graciously let me keep the overage. Not going to happen.  Aside from not cashing the check what is my legal obligation at this point?  I've googled the credit union in GA and am considering calling them tomorrow to alert them.  In addition should I take the check to the police? Right now all i have is the check, the LetGo user information, and the two phone numbers the scammer used."	Yes
Roommate flew into a rage this evening about a lamp I broke and wound up punching me three times in the face. I did not return any strikes, he proceeded to call the cops.   I did not stick around for the police to arrive for the reason below, which is why I need advice.  I've been effectively homeless for the last 2 months, crashing on couches and paying people a pittance with no lease etc. I've spread the love across a number of couches so no one friend gets too sick of me. Being homeless is the result of me having been kicked out of previous living quarters during an event for which I am now on unsupervised probation.  The only condition of my probation is to notify them of address changes... Well they've been so frequent and entirely unofficial that I am technically in violation of my probation. Thus why I didn't stick around for the cops.  Having reached a safe location for the evening I was able to examine myself further and I probably have a broken nose, but have no insurance or funds for medical attention (and refuse to use the ER for shit like this, I'm not dying). I would absolutely like to file charges however I suspect I'm fucked on being able to do so because of the afforementioned probation issue.  Help please?	Yes
Let's say I know someone who backed their car into something but instead called their insurance and said it was a hit and run incident. Is there a way to report this anonymously?	Yes
I've been carrying this on my shoulders since Nov. 2015. The therapists know the entire situation, in depth, and even though I feel iffy about what to do, they still encourage me. It is not such a black and white/cookie cutter situation, it's also very twisted, and gross, and sick... So I'll spare you the details and make this brief.   I don't have money to hire a lawyer, but my current therapist told me to at least seek a free consultation with one. How do I do this? If the crime happened in another county, what do I need to do. What will happen if/when I finally press charges? What should I expect? I need to know so much, but I don't know what all to ask. Any advice will be greatly appreciated.	Yes
"So I pled ""no contest"" to a shoplifting charge I received after a night out drinking with buddies 3 hours away. I appeared in magistrate court and the judge cut the fine to $1 not including court cost, which I paid on the spot, but also had to pay $50 in resitutions to Sheetz. I wasn't given any information on how to do that when I was at the courthouse and haven't received any mail about it. What do I do? The magistrate judge said it wouldn't be difficult to get the charge expunged and wanted me to follow through with it quickly since I'm a medical student and this can affect my residency. How do I pay the restitutions? And is it necessary to have them paid by the time I file for expungement?"	Yes
"here is an update to anyone who is curious link (here) [https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/6mckz3/girlfriend_had_her_butt_grabed_by_a_mcdonalds/]. So today we filed a police report, the officer said that they would not go for any sexual battery type charge but rather a class C misdemeanor assault charge. That is honestly fine by me, i just want some form of punishment for ""Tyrone"" so he knows that it's not okay to grab women who don't want to be grabbed. They said they would review the tapes and im hoping to god that the cameras caught it, there is two cameras in the lobby but this was over at the drink station so they might not be able to see the physical contact that occurred. I also called the Mcdonalds corporate office and the lady seemed very understanding and polite and said that her supervisor would launch an investigation and review the tapes and contact the Franchise owner immediately. I told her that the police were already investigating and all that happened. We have no interest in sueing mcdonalds or the guy who did this, i just want him to maybe get a fine and lose his job.With that said i am tempted to call the DA's office once he is charged with the Class C assult to see if they could possibly bump it up to class B or something. Feel free to give any advice or ask questions, once this is all over i will post a final update."	Yes
The police officer blatantly lied in the police report and if I can locate the victim, I can prove it. The victim (a store clerk) didn't even speak English but the police report has sentences of things I supposedly said to him, including a death threat which I never made. If I can locate that store clerk and have him verify  1. he didn't understand what I was saying 2. as such, he didn't understand a death threat I never made 3. he was not scared for his life based on that death threat   then: 4. i'm not guilty of criminal threats, which is what i plead guilty to.  How to do that I don't know. I've emailed several lawyers and none respond. I imagine this doesn't fit within the confines of their usual churning out plea bargain framework so they don't want to bother with it.   Thanks for any help.	Yes
I'm in Ireland so this doesn't really regard me, but I saw that in Montana, intimidation is defined as follows:   &gt;(1) A person commits the offense of intimidation when, with the purpose to cause another to perform or to omit the performance of any act, the person communicates to another, under circumstances that reasonably tend to produce a fear that it will be carried out, a threat to perform without lawful authority any of the following acts:      (a) inflict physical harm on the person threatened or any other person;     (b) subject any person to physical confinement or restraint; or     (c) commit any felony.   My question is would a threat of violence, for example, count as self-defensive intimidation if it in turn provably prevented potential physical violence from taking place?  We're a few pints deep, and clearly this isn't urgent, but if someone could clear up this semi-drunken debate we're having it would be much appreciated.	Yes
Ok, I'm 18 and was being dropped off at my truck yesterday but got caught in heavy rain. Since my friend was dropping me off we decided to smoke a bowl while we waited for the rain to die down. So after about 5 minutes, the rain still hasn't let up and were literally just talking in his car. A cop with flashlight knocks on his window, and says he smells weed. At first we said I was just getting out and about to be on my way, but he cut us off and said give me all the weed in the car or I arrest you both. We both complied and gave it to him (maybe a gram between us).We told them he had all of the bud, but there's other things like grinders and bong. So we get out and stand in the rain while they search the car and go d nothing else. He pats us down and says look out for something in the mail. I asked if it was a fine or a court date or what and he said it's a fine. My question is, will it be like a citation where I can just go pay it and that be the end of it, or will it be court date for a charge, with the fine as punishment for that charge? I'm just trying to gauge how big of a deal this is	Yes
"Good morning all,  I've never been a big believer in ghosts. I believe in the afterlife, but not ghosts.  About a year ago I saw a post on Craigslist looking for a ""Supernatural tester"" to come to a womans house and test if it was haunted. She said she required some evidence of legitimacy to be hired. So I printed out a license that stated I was licensed to ""Ghoul Inspect"" by the United Paranormal Hunting Association(UPHA). Technically, this is true. But I had started UPHA about an hour after I saw the CL posting. So I licensed myself.   Anyway, I went to the (obviously not) ""haunted house"" and looked around. I said that there were no ghosts and only took half of what she offered(She offered $300 so I took $150). I figured this was a win/win/win in a kind of scumbag way but at the same time the girl said the other people who emailed wanted $900 and she *was going to pay it*. Plus she would have been told they were real.  Anyway, so I realized how amazing this is for money, so I did it to other people, all while making the operation look more and more legitimate.   At my best after bringing in two friends to help, I made $1700 from 12 people in a single week for about 10 hours worth of work.   Anyway so this is one of the two cases that worries me.   The first is this:  So about 3 months ago I met this Super Atheist and she lived with an older lady(Her aunt). Her aunt was quite wealthy(they own a local business in a ritzy part of Maine, you'd know it if you lived there) and she had inherited it. The aunt basically bankrolls this young girl. The Aunt was convinced she was being haunted by a ghost, but she didn't know who(though she had a few ideas which I won't divulge because of privacy). So the younger girl(Sara) wouldn't agree to call the more expensive ""paranormal investigators"" but called me because I charge $150 for initial investigations, and that was worth it to put the issue to rest.   So I went there, and here is the thing, I said the house *was* haunted. I needed the return business. I'm not proud, but I did some bad things. I moved items when they were in the bathroom, at one point I took a recorder and stuck it in her ACHV unit to make screaming/moaning noises. All in all, I'm a terrible person and I admit that.   Anyway, the woman passed and I went over to the house of Sara and said how sorry I am.  But Sara was now convinced that the house was haunted. I know how bad this is because this girl is an atheist with a near ivy-league degree in a STEM Field. My practice *really* fucked her up.   Not knowing what to do, I doubled down.   I did just about the worst thing I'd ever done and I took the spare key to the house she gave me and I paid a man to wait in the basement when she came home and then act as scary as possible(he also stole a painting, but I didn't tell him to do that). I thought he would just like pound the walls and then I could say we caught him and the ghost is gone, your aunt is at peace etc etc etc.  Instead this fucking idiot straight up ran after making some screaming noises in the basement and the *GIRL WAS HOME*. I mean he ran out of the basement, and she was him! She got scared out of her mind and then called me.  So I ditched it. I ended the whole practice, changed my number, etc. The ""address"" was just a PO box so I stopped paying for it.  That concerns me but it's on the backburner.  The second one is what worries me.  So after a few weeks had passed I got the service going on the DL and some girl said she needed help. Yadda yadda yadda, I did the standard procedure while mentioning that her daughter might be experiencing some hauntings.  This stupid bitch went out and paid for a $4,900 unofficial exorcism by an unlicensed priest!  So I don't know what to do. What if she comes after me? I never said to do that! Am I in the legal right here? Do I double down and endorse the exorcism?"	Yes
To start ... this isn't easy. It took me several days to gather the nerves to post this... please be forgiving. I'm a stupid teenager...   In October of 2016 I met a very friendly foreign exchange student. She came from southern Beijing and we really hit it off. She had never had a long term relationship and we dated until January. I was her first boyfriend, and it was her first year in America. We basically met the week she arrived. Eventually we broke up she was mean at times and it was hard for me to keep going. By march I had to go to the hospital. It was later said I had hepatitis b.   This girl comes from a region of China where many people are born with or contract this disease at a young age. They may be immune to its affects but they are carriers themselves. I've tried to hold many conversations with this person and she has stated that there is nothing wrong with her and that I was sick with strep most likely .... she's not the brightest. I still have her on Snapchat. Ever since I broke up with her she will snap herself with other presumably lovers. To spite me.   I know she's having sex, and I know she's most likely spreading disease. Is there anything I can do to stop her? I truly believe she is harming society.	Yes
Okay so I had my identity stolen from me and there was a welsfargo bank account open in my name and everything. I got the paper work and there are signatures with my name on the fraud check cashed and the fraudulent account opened . but the signatures arnt how I sign my name. And the account is negative $1800 what legal ground do I have 	Yes
Some background information:  My parents were going through a divorce a couple years back and I got into an argument with my dad that escalated and ultimately resulted in me being arrested for simple assault domestic violence charge. I was 17 at the time and was tried as an adult since this was a few years before this 2014 bill had passed:   https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/03/19/house-raises-juvenile-delinquent-age/VP9KkZXfccwnOJ4EIsNNaN/story.html  The charge was subsequently reduced to an infraction which I plead guilty to. Now that the juvenile delinquent age is 18, are those records from before I was 18 expunged?   I'm thinking about pursuing a medical career in the future and am afraid that the regretful events of my past may become an issue.	Yes
So I know someone who's dad is a sex offender, they were charged under [THIS](http://www.legislature.mi.gov/(S(5rtlyta3leraxlz35gqsryem))/mileg.aspx?page=GetObject&amp;objectname=mcl-750-520c) law. I know they were mentally incompetent. So does this mean the person they raped was between 13 and 16? I don't know if Im reading this right.	Yes
I have gotten a ticket in the past and just paid it online. With a citation it just tells me to appear in court but doesn't have a fee. What exactly happens when you appear in court? And could I just sign the back and mail it in, even though there isn't a fine/money order to mail with it? Also whats the difference between pleading guilty and no contest?	Yes
"Need advice due to conflicting info from fam/friends, also /r/personalfinance didn't like my post tagged with Employment.    I am of the opinion that since my former incarceration info is sealed that I may now maintain complete assurances that I have never been convicted of a crime or having been arrested. Anyone who Google searches may find old data, which is why some are telling me I should ""own up"" and be truthful if confronted about these in an interview. This is tantamount to waiving my rights which I think is a horrible idea.  Would an employer not be in gross violation of civil rights act and fair credit reporting act if it was even brought up in an interview?? How would I address this topic strongly and respectfully if confronted?  Wouldn't equal protection also mean my expungement would also apply to an employer for any other state in USA?  I am looking at my first few interviews soon since fully cleaning up my record and also earning my bachelors and I don't want to deal with nonsense."	Yes
So back in Feb 2017 I was very stupid and drove after drinking. I have a lawyer and he has looked at the video and everything and says that while the stop may be challenged that if I loose then I have to go through the trial and I could lose more because I was clearly drunk in the video. I've reviewed the evidence myself and I agree with him completely.  I am mostly just concerned about the First Offenders Program in general. I live in MD and never plan to drink or drive again. I don't mind doing the classes, or getting the evaluations, or joining AA because I was wrong and I could have really hurt someone or myself.  I am just wondering how this is going to look on my record.	Yes
My girlfriend went out to a casino this past Saturday night with a group of work friends. Apparently one of the guys in the group was annoyed at my girlfriend for getting cigarette smoke in his face. According to her, he grabbed her by the back of her neck and slammed her down onto the sidewalk. She came home with nasty gashes on her face and forehead. She's asleep at the moment, but as far as I know police were not called and she declined medical attention. An employee of the casino had her sign some sort of waiver which I'm assuming said she wouldn't bring legal action against the casino.   I have no interest in bringing action against the casino but in the morning I'm going to see if she will file a police report against the guy that did this to her. I also believe that the casino will have video surveillance of the incident as well as a copy of the waiver she signed. Will we need to file with the police who have jurisdiction over the area the casino was in? Looking for any advice on how to proceed...  Thank you	Yes
My dad was arrested last year in Fulton County, Georgia on a theft by taking misdemeanor. He found a phone and took it home to wait for someone to call to return it, but he forgot about for, left it in the car and the cops tracked it down. My dad gave the phone to the cops when they camped out in our neighborhood, but was arrested and taken to the Atlanta jail. My mom had to pay his $2970 bail to get him out the following morning and was told he will be receiving notice of a court date within three months. This happened two years ago and we are still waiting on a court date notification in the mail. Is this the normal process? Do we just have to wait? I read online about a 1 year statue of limitations on theft charges in Georgia to be charged, but I don't know if this applies to my dad. Since a year passed, can he still be charged or has he already been charged? We have a card that says to call the state court clerk after 3 months if we do not receive a court notification so we called three months after his arrest and they told us to continue to wait. Should we call back to get an update or will they tell us the same thing?	Yes
I'm in desperate need of some help.  I am a 19 year old male who lives in Australia and I'm in a really bad situation and I don't know what to do.  2 weeks ago my girlfriend came over to my place to hang out for the night. Everything started off ok and I became pretty drunk after a few hours and I remember she helped me into the bedroom. Then all I really remember is waking up to find her on top of me with my arms tied to the headboard. I shoved her off and asked her what the fuck she was doing. That's when she told me if I tell anyone she will report me for raping her.  I don't know what to do, I feel disgusting I feel ashamed I have become so severely depressed I don't want to live anymore.  I want to report, I badly want to report her. But I know she will say I did it.  What do I do?	Yes
"I caught a dui case in January of 2017. I was sentenced to a year probation and was told to get an alcohol assessment and I am required to follow the recommendations from the alcohol assessment. Below is my story.     Jan 26 2017 I had an appointment with a lady named Katie at Dawn Farms  for my alcohol assessment. I was court ordered to have an alcohol assessment. During the assessment, Katie recommended that I do 24 weeks of outpatient group therapy at dawn farms with a lady named Hannah on wednesdays from 2-3:30. Katie was training a young lady and explained the rules and asked if I had any questions regarding the assessment. She asked me to sign a piece of paper confirming everything that we went over and that I was to attend 24 weeks of outpatient meetings as well as attend 2 aa meetings per week.  I attended the 24 weeks with no issue. After the first 12 weeks, I didn't get a review over my performance or acknowledged on how I did. I was just given a piece of paper that I had to write new goals on and that was it. After completing the 24 weeks on July 12th 2017, Hannah mentioned to me that I could either continue to do the Wednesday's 2pm groups or switch to Thursday's.  There was never a discussion I had with anyone from Dawn Farms regarding another 12 weeks. The program has two phases, recovery group support and recovery support. One is 24 weeks and the other is 12. Not everyone does 36 weeks, or 24 weeks. Some people do 12 weeks but everyone signs the same form that states that in order to complete the Dawn farms program, you have to do 36 weeks. There are check marks next to both phases that you are recommended to do. My contract had the recovery support phase checked off and had it wrote by Katie in pen ""2 sets of 12=24 weeks"". I was not court ordered to complete the program, I was court ordered to get an assessment and to attend the recommended meetings that were given to me during the assessment. Every individual is different went it comes to the assessment. Katie might recommend something completely different than what another person might recommend, but she did my intake and no one else did. And since everyone is different, she assessed me based on the information I provided her and made the decision to give me 24 weeks of outpatient therapy. And That was her job but she no longer works there.  On July 14th I went to dawn farms at about 3:10 to speak with someone who could help me better understand why the piece of paper says something different than what was said to me from Hannah. A lady gave me a card and told me to speak to ray, who is the coordinator of the program.  I got ahold of ray at about 5pm and spoke with him about the issue. I explained to him the piece of paper and he said Katie may have screwed up with my intake. I told him that was not my fault, but we can't talk to her anyways because she no longer works there. Did she really screw up? These are done on an individual basis. He said that things may have changed from when I originally signed the paper in January. I told him that if that was the case then I was to sign a new form.  He told me that he wants to talk to his staff about this to make sure there are no loop holes like this again. This is not considered a loophole if this is something that they recommend to other people in treatment. This does not seem fair. Everyone who signs the same form would have to do 36 weeks. I was planning on signing up for classes at washtenaw community college. How am I suppose to plan things out for myself if there is a lack of communication and a lack of review after the 12 week period? He said that he would not write a letter saying that I completed the 36 weeks at dawn farms. I never asked him to write a letter to be dishonest and say that i did something I didn't do. I told him I want him to write a letter stating that I completed my 24 week recovery support group at dawn farm. I told him I would pick it up next week. My probation officer told me that I need to do whatever they tell me to do basically... but I did! I did the 24 weeks with no issue and out of no where they are telling me I need to do 12 more! Am I wrong for trying to fight this?    In terms of the dawn farms client handbook, it states that the staff will not lie to you or emotionally or physically abuse you. I feel like I was lied to and it's emotionally hurtful to know that I was mislead and it's causing me anxiety. I should feel good about being sober, not bad. I haven't had any screw ups since I've been at Dawn Farms.     Dawn farms website states ""Group therapy – Several group therapy options are offered that are designed to help clients with varying needs, levels of motivation and intensity of substance use problems. Groups range in duration from 8 to 24 weeks depending upon client needs and preference.""    If I signed a contract for leasing a vehicle for 24 months. That's what I would expect. I wouldn't expect the dealer to call me at the 24 month period to tell me that things changed and that it was actually a 36 month lease without me being aware."	Yes
Recently my sister's friend confronted her ex, and father of her child, and he made claims about wanting to kill my sister, strangling his other children, and made a bunch of other threatening comments. Her friend recorded this conversation on her phone and took it to the police but were advised to simply get restraining orders as his comments were structured as ultimatums instead of immediate threats. After looking into the cost we started a GoFundMe to afford two restraining orders and some security systems, along with other items for self-defense, and then started looking into meeting a district attorney.  Someone noticed the GFM campaign and suggested they both get protective orders, a form of restraining order as far as I can tell, as they're free of charge and essentially a do it yourself process. Based on what I've read only my sister's friend can get the protective order due to her relationship with them being on familial/formerly romantic terms, but someone told me he was able to get one simply because he was being frequently harassed by a customer at work and was even recommended to get one by a judge. Can my sister, who has no actual ties to him, get a protective order or will she have to go for an alternative restraining order?	Yes
Hello! In 2013, a friend was arrested for marijuana possession in New Jersey. This particular Police Department likes to post all drug related arrests on their FaceBook page. Well, here we are 4 years later, the charges were “Conditionally Discharged”, and this post is still up, and out there trackable with a quick Google search. My question, is there any way to have them remove this post? My friend is trying to get out of retail, and apply for a desk job, where they will likely Google their name. We have not yet contacted the department to have it down; I wanted to check here for the best ‘strategy’. Isn’t it time to move on from the past? Do the crime, pay the time, and move on. This one post may prevent someone from moving on with their life, and I don’t like the thought of that. Any chance they will be sympathetic without involving a lawyer?  I appreciate any help you can offer!	Yes

"So I met this guy when I was 17 (a couple months away form 18). He essentially groomed me and offered me xanax and alcohol and a place to stay when I was homeless. We got very intoxicated and passed out and when I regained consciousness is when the video takes place. I didn't know that I had this video in my possession and uncovered it when I was trying to clear space off my laptop. The video depicts the following:  &gt; Both of us are naked. We're playing around with my new camera phone and seeing how long it will take video. I am acting like a drunk 17 year old. Both of us are clearly identifiable in the video. There isn't any sexual intercourse in the video however I do reference sex with him and at one point in the video I say ""I am 17 and you are 27. I did not consent to this and you are making child porn."" From the video it looks like I was holding the phone most of the time excepting the couple times he tries to grab it and film me naked. It also appears as though he might be taking pictures or recording simultaneously on his phone.   Later on in our relationship I found a hard drive with a BUNCH of pornographic pictures and highly sexual conversations with people that he had never had relationships with. It was very clear he was suffering from a sexual addiction. Our initial contact led to a two-ish year ""relationship"" that ended in him abandoning me the day before my birthday. During this time he was highly abusive about my appearance and weight. We moved to the outer banks and lived there, away from my family, friends, or any acquaintances. When he abandoned me he managed to pack up all of our valuable possessions while he sent me a couple hours away to get my nails done for my birthday and then moved cross-country to California with his business partner without notice. This included walking out on our recently co-signed car which he purchased using the entirety of my savings. I was left with a large number of animals to care for including reptiles, fish, dogs, and cats. Immediately and with precision he  1. cancelled all our joint accounts 2. blocked me on all social media 3. set up a forwarding address 4. blocked my phone number 5. gave notice to the landlord that *both* of us would be moving out immediately  It was obviously premeditated.  Even after he left he started talking to me again a few months later. He initiated sexual exchanges over skype and email pictures (because he refused to text me). He played games and led me along emotionally and then ask for a bunch of nudes. He would even mention the idea of coming back and ""visiting."" He later went on to get caught masturbating at work (by no intent of mine) while sending it to me and ceased communication after he was fired.  To this day I haven't really been in a position to take any action against him and for years I've been too emotional traumatized to see the situation clearly. When I found the video and watched it I was disgusted by how childish and intoxicated I was and am moved to take action. I feel violated, lied to, and really this event has turned my life upside down. My credit is still destroyed by the repossession and have daily anxiety.  I'm ready to take action against him. I feel like I was a minor who was very intentionally groomed. Where do I start? I currently reside in Oregon and he is located in California (I have a last known address and I can track him down). Can I report him to the police where the video was taken and will they likely take any action? I was 17 and underage (although within a couple months of 18) but clearly was groomed, given substances, and taken advantage of by a much older individual. We are both married now, this isn't a revenge thing. I don't want anything except for him to accept some kind of consequence for his wrongdoings. Thank you."	Yes

Hello Reddit,  I am a 21 year old male with no prior criminal record living in New York. I was recently charged with petit larceny for stealing a pair of sunglasses from a store I worked at. I returned the glasses the next day without ever being asked to because I didn't feel right taking them. Later that day I was pulled aside by Loss Prevention and told they have everything on camera. They brought me down to a detainment cell where I waited for the police and was given a field arrest for petit larceny. I am very nervous and afraid for myself because I wasn't raised to do things like this. I hope I didn't mess my future up.  My questions are these:  1) Will this stay on my record?  2) If so, how can I get it taken off 3) What implications does this hold for my future? 4) As a college student I don't have very much money, is a court appointed lawyer good enough to handle this? 5) What course of action should I take when handling this situation?	Yes
So I have an account on plenty of fish and I met a girl on there who was claiming to be 19, I'm 21 so I messaged her. We exchanged numbers and she started texting me. Eventually she started sending me nudes and speaking to me sexually she also asked for some and I sent one. We had planned on meeting up but then she told me she was actually 17 but we could have sex. I replied that we absolutely could not do anything like that and immediately deleted all the pictures she sent me along with all other messages and her number. I also reported her account to POF. She would message me occasionally after that but would get one word answers and communications eventually ceased. Then I get a call from her dad saying he saw all the messages and he's going to have me arrested. So I explain the situation which he should already know if he really had the messages. Now he's telling me that if I don't pay him $500 he's going to report me to the police. I don't know what to do. I don't have $500. Please help.	Yes
"Is it illegal to lie about your name and gender, and claim that photos found online are ""you"" in order to receive nudes?  Everyone over 18. Photos were not shared or sold to anyone else."	Yes
My roommate got caught with so an eighth of marijuana while getting pulled over the other day, he was about to get his medical card this next week. He so far hasn't been charged but was taken to the police station. If he gets put on probation can he still get a medical card without any issues? I saw that the supreme court here passed a law saying that probation can't stop medical patients (http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/arizona/politics/2015/04/07/medical-marijuana-arizona-supreme-court/25416337/) but I can't seem to get anything about getting the card after being caught by the police.   Can anyone help me out on this?	Yes
I'm in Florida.   So I was arrested for failure to appear. While incarcerated the jail didn't give me my medicine and I had a seizure from withdrawal from Zoloft.   I broke my finger and had to had two surgeries, then the wound became infected while again incarcerated for failure to appear.   It's a shit sandwich. But is the county/jail responsible for my seizure, broken finger, two surgeries bill?	Yes
So my friend is currently in a holding cell awaiting court at 1:30, she was caught with 3.7 grams of Molly, an ounce of shrooms, 3 ecastcy pills and under 30 grams of weed. My questions are, will I be able to post bail for her? Since it's her first offense can she get an ibond? What can I do to make sure she doesn't land in jail?	Yes
it's a really long and complex ordeal i'm going through and it's been a long day. Basically would they have a case, what could happen to me, etc.   longer version is way overly complicated and I don't think all of those details matter for just the bare bones advice I'm asking for.   so the details I feel are important are  1) She does not want any of that to happen 2) She is 18 and is still my girlfriend  really about it. I don't know what exactly to do. my brother (not a laywer at all) insists that they can't actually do anything because who the hell would prosecute me over something like this  but I'm still unsure of what to do. I just want a happy life with her.	Yes
For background information, my friend and i are both 17 going to be 18 soon.  To start the story off my friend and i were smoking a blunt on the side of the road when a cop pulled up behind us and walked to the door. After making eye contact with the officer he opened my door (drivers side) and asked us to get out and put us against the wall. After that we were patted down and put into the cop car. About 2 more cop cars came and they started searching my vehicle where they found about 2 grams of weed. When suddenly the officer pulled out 3/4ths of an Ecstasy pill and asked me to identify what it was. We were eventually taken to the local station where they filled out the paperwork and than after about 6 hours transported to downtown. my friend and i were both charged with the marijuana but i was charged with controlled substance on top of that. This is my first offense of any kind. But, on the police report they stated that when the police were patting us down they found weed on us which isn't true. The only thing on me was my wallet and my friend had nothing on him at all. They also stated that we were going door to door selling weed, that they found the X pill in a pill bottle with my name on it which also is not true. There was a pill bottle with my name on it but it had marijuana in it. they also stated that when we went to the local station we were being questioned by detectives the whole time but in reality we were put into singular cells and chained up the entirety of the time there. if i'm being completely honest i really am unsure of what's gong to happen. Is my life over? Is it even possible for me to have an ending that will be relatively okay? Also, I'm enrolled in an EMT program for this upcoming senior year and we have to do a background check and i suppose that's over for me? i appreciate whatever advice you can give.	Yes
My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	Yes
My gf works in hospitality, she closed out her drawer and made her drop into the safe at work which then got stuck and did not make it into the safe. After she had left her coworker came and stole the envelope out of the safe. They have cameras and caught him on camera doing this. He is denying it and will be taking a lie detector test. The owner of the business told her that if he doesn't fess up she will be responsible for paying him back. Im trying to figure out what we need to do. Apparently this is a problem with the safe and she has always made sure to check to make sure her drops made it into the safe, apparently this time is got stuck on the side and she did not notice it when checking and thought it made into the safe. I'm just worried that if he does not fess up etc that they will try to hold her paycheck, it was around one thousand dollars stolen and she does not have the money to pay them back.	Yes
Title pretty much explains it all. I pay all of my living and school expenses, while my parents pay my phone and insurance (which is changing after this.) I claimed myself on my tax returns last year, meaning my parents couldn't claim me. They proceeded to file an amended return on my behalf (without my knowledge/permission,) which caused me to owe the IRS $1200+, and my return to be garnished this year. They refuse to pay it. My mother also broke into my bank account yesterday, and transferred my savings into her account. When I called the bank to report fraud, she shut my phone off. I am planning to walk there myself (they hid the keys from me... yes, they're abusive narcs with whom I will be going NC when I move in a few weeks,) and my mom is saying she will report me as a missing person. Help!	Yes
So I was driving home from my weekly UA and classes as required after last DUI (wouldnt have even been in that town if not for these obligations). Sober all day, and days prior to that.  For some reason I seizured, passed out, etc behind the wheel not 10 minutes after meeting my PO.  Single vehicle accident, hit a curb.  Eneded up goin to the hospital to get checked since I was frightened I may have had a seizure or something Consented that I'd do the state test via blood and UE.  Nothing to hide.  All came back clean for everything.  I wasnt worried, just thought I'd get driving under suspension...Well this cop finds an empty package of Kratom which was not consumed anytime prior to the accident. He writes me a DUi (which I've had a few guilties of but learned my leason)...With this additional charge I could face substantial jail time even though I was not in anyway intoxicated.  I was never given sobriety tests, read rights etc.  This cop may have just ruined my life right as was rebuilding it, so pissed!  Any advice?	Yes
A while back I was arrested for public intoxication and possession of marijuana. I have court in the morning and have no idea the outcome. I'm only 18 and have no idea how these things go. Should I plead guilty and just accept the consequences or not guilty so I can try and get an attorney? And if I don't end up with an attorney would they give me one? How does this work?	Yes
"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	Yes
Someone filmed me having sex through my window. My university conducted interviews to get more information, and I have the transcripts from those interviews which pretty clearly point to who was responsible for taking the video. Is there any action I can take against that person? Can I take action against the people who viewed the video and didn't report it? Should I take it to the police? Does it matter that I don't have access to the video?	Yes
"This is a very long story but I will try to make it as simple as possible.   My husband is being asked to speak to a detective in a case against his brother ""Joe"".  We don't live near Joe, but another sibling does and is on Joe side saying that everything his ex-wife is saying is untrue.  Basically Joe is accused of molesting his five year old daughter. Supposedly, according to his ex-wife he has already lost custody of his daughter, but the court hasn't decided what will happen to their son.   When my husband was a little boy Joe molested him, and even though that's all in the past now, Joe's ex-wife is asking my husband to speak to a detective about it because she thinks it could help her case.  The problem is we don't know who's telling the truth. Joe says the court didn't take his daughter away, that it's a pending investigation, and his daughter was coached to say the things she did. According to his ex-wife she's worried that he'll molest their son too, but because he isn't  a named victim at this time the court might not take away parental visits.  My husband's having a hard time deciding what to do, because if Joe's ex-wife is telling the truth he wants to help protect his nephew. But if Joe is telling the truth he doesn't want to ruin his life. Also, if my husband makes a statement this will definitely divided the family as obviously everyone seems to believe Joe.  My question is if there's anyway that we can know, since we don't live near them, what actual evidence there are in the case. If my husband speaks to detective is he legally allowed to lie to my husband about the case?  Joe is a known liar... but his ex-wife can be cunning.  Is it possible that my husband's statement would really hold so much value?  Please help."	Yes
I got back after a long day and the first thing I wanted to do was take my bra off.   I was already in the middle of changing out of my work clothes by the time I realized my roommate left the shades open. I immediately went over and closed them.   Two days later a friend of mine contacted me to say a friend of his sent him and a few others pictures of me undressed that looked like they'd been taken from outside my apartment.   I did some checking around and learned this creep lives in the building next door to me, and considering the pictures, likely has a view directly into my place.   Now the photo has been passed around a considerable amount, two other people have contacted me to warn me it was sent to them and check if I knew the photos had been taken.  I'm mortified and feel violated. I haven't confronted the guy who took the original pictures. I asked the people who knew him (none of my friends knew him that well) and they all said he's a douche bag, a bit of a misogynist, but they'd never known him to be dangerous or anything like that.   I'm not sure what to do but I'd like to be able to do something. Taking the pictures of me without my knowledge is bad enough, but sending them around(?!) that must cross some legal line, right?	Yes
Hello Reddit,   Is it legal for a 16 year old to file a restraining order on a physically, verbally, and emotionally abusive 18 year old sibling?	Yes
Hi all,  I met with an escort at a hotel she was residing in. I went to her room and she met me in a towel, as I requested, and then she kissed me following me entering the room. She asked for her money and I told her I had none. She then proceeded to kick me out. As I was driving away she texted me my licence plate and told me she would call the police. I told her I would contact the hotel she was staying in and she told me to kiss goodbye to my car.  Any legal advice?  Extra Info: I texted her the day before asking for a 30min meet. I intended to meet her at this point. In the morning she didnt reply and I assumed it was off, it was only an hour before she confirmed. I requested a certain outfit from her but I didn't intend to carry out any services because I felt I was doing something wrong, so I brought no money. I do not know what brought me to her residence.  Truthfully guys, I'm kinda scared of this getting out and she has my licence plate for my car.  - I am new to this sub, so please help me if I have made a mistake anywhere, thank you.	Yes
"Asking on behalf of a friend who doesn't really know what to do and is so shell shocked by the situation they don't seem to be thinking straight. I'll give the facts as they have been told to me.  I'll start out by saying all of these events have occurred and this friend has never been and has yet to be officially charged of any crime.    -A friend has been accused of sex with a minor, but neither the name of the accuser, the accuser's parents or the prosecutor have been given to this friend or their lawyer.  -Event supposedly took place in a different city while on a trip with family and SO. -The police came to their home to investigate this accusation and arrested said friend.  -During the raid, the police took the xbox, the modem and computer, did not take the hard drive or various flash drives that were within plain sight. -Friend has been required to check in weekly with their police department. -Friend was not required to give up his passport. -Friend has alibi for the time this event was supposed to have taken place, however a time line was established where they went to the store and was not with family or SO for a small period of time. This was told to the police by SO.  -Friend is not currently working, though there appears to be no reason not to.  -Police contacted friend's boss and told them that what the friend is accused of and recommended they be terminated. -Friend has no internet or cell phone access- not sure if personal choice or mandated. -Due to ""Lack of evidence"" Friend was informed that the case has been ""Postponed indefinitely"" however, they haven't had clear confirmation that they don't need to check in every week, so they still are and Friend's SO received a phone call yesterday by investigators asking for more information on the statement they gave at time of arrest. -Friend and SO had an upcoming trip planned and were told they could probably check in remotely, but no clear instruction given on how or that it was OK. Trip has since been cancelled.  -Friend is STILL not working and now lives with this hanging over them.   My question is: What sort of things should their lawyer be fighting for on their behalf? Don't they have the right to know who the accused is or at least the accused's representative? Can the lawyer file for something or ANYTHING to free them from the oppression of this uncertainty hanging over their head? Can they have this wrapped up or thrown out or something so that my friend can at least move forward and live a fairly normal life? From my point of view, it appears that their lawyer has done literally nothing and said there is nothing they can do.""  Furthermore, as all believe this case to be untrue, and indeed lack of evidence seems to support this, how can friend strike back or stand up for themselves so as to minimize damage to their character and reputation within the community?  I am of the belief that my friend needs a new lawyer, I would like to advise them to get a new one, but wanted to see if anyone could tell me how their lawyer is failing them first."	Yes
Hello please help if you can! My fiancé now 27 got into an altercation with his child's mother when he was 19 and because of that they gave him a felony and made him register as an predatory offender for 10 years. Years have gone by and all has been fine. 6 months ago he got his first dui. They put him on probation for two years. In bad luck he recently became homeless and did not have a valid address for two months. The officer called him and told him to check in yesterday because they haven't heard from him since may. So he went in today and they arrested him. Now they are charging him with a felony and his court is in 48 hours (Thursday). We can't afford a lawyer, already told the people he was homeless. I am so scared what's going to happen! We are in the state of Minnesota. Please give advice or help I am so worried!!! -Gypsy	Yes
"So the person sent it via Facebook messenger and even sent me a screenshot of to whom of my friends he sent it. I'm in a relationship with this person. So yeh this is your typical, revenge porn or nonconsensual porn. So far, 4 people on that screenshot have reached out to me. He sent it to many people I guess but they haven't seen it yet probably because of Facebook's ""message requests"" feature.   I trusted him so much. I was in love when those photos were taken and sent to him. I don't regret doing it. What I regret is trusting the wrong person.  Please help me on how I can file a legal case while I'm here in Ph and he's in the US. He's an American. I have all of his threats on my phone as proof."	Yes
"I realize that this is probably a lost cause, but whatever.  For context, my girlfriends brother, called Eric for this story, works in a family-owned restaurant in a mountain town in Colorado. My GF, called Jane for this story, was going to the town to meet up with her brother, as they hardly ever see each other. He is 27, Jane is 17. Eric has been working in a restaurant to finance his wedding to his fiancé, Jordan (fake name). He also works in ski patrol during the winter and does odd jobs around the town during the summer.  The incident began when Jane arrived in town. Jane and Jordan were waiting outside the restaurant for Eric to get off his shift, and both of them go inside to ask Eric how long he has remaining in his shift before he's off. Jane goes to wait outside while Jordan talks to the manager. Jordan comes back outside, apparently looking really creeped out and distraught. Jane asks what happened, Jordan says the manager asked how old Jane was, saying ""what is she? 19? 20?"" Jordan relies and says, ""no, she's 17, why?""  The manager responds with ""well when she's wearing shorts like that she might as well be 20. She's got an ass like a 20 year old"" and then made a gesture where he made a circle with his thumb and index finger, and inserted his other index finger into the hole repeatedly. (This is obviously a sex gesture).  It should be noted here that the manager of the restaurant is not the owner, and is a 42 year old man.   Jane and Jordan wait for Eric to get off work, and when he does, they tell him of the situation. Eric replies with ""I'm going to fucking beat his ass."" (Eric is very protective of Jane. For the first 6 months of our relationship, our dates were always me and Jane… and Eric. Were like brother now though.)   Jane and Jordan tried to hold him back from going into the restaurant, but they're small girls while Eric is 6'4"" 250 lbs of pure muscle. He walked back into the restaurant, and Jane and Jordan followed him. He asked the manager what he said about his sister, and he, strangely, told Eric exactly what he said, with gesture and all, and added at the end ""she's a dirty little girl, isn't she Eric?"" And winked after the last question.  Eric uppercutted the manager so hard he left the floor briefly before hitting the ground. The manger was driven to the hospital by Eric, and has a concussion, a broken cheekbone, and brief amnesia.  I should say now that this is all 2nd hand. I didn't witness any of this, but Jane and Jordan saw all of it and relayed it to me.  Is there anything they can do to keep Eric out of jail and not bankrupt him/the entire family? Thanks all!"	Yes
A few days ago me and a friend got citations for possession of alcohol on a public beach in NJ. We had one empty can out, in a cup, which apparently is reason enough to get this. When the cop took us to his car, he wrote down my name incorrectly, and also the address where I live is wrong (but the town is right), as is my phone number. My DOB, however is correct (I am 20 but we didn't get tagged with MIPs). My friend's info is entirely correct except for his last name, which is off by one letter (but his address, etc is correct).   Do I show up to the court summons on the ticket? It says that failure to appear may result in a warrant being issued for my arrest. However, no such person with the name on the ticket exists (the first and last names are off by one letter). Will they be able to find me? What do I do?	Yes
Hello everyone. I have a friend, she is 17. She lives in a Muslim household that greatly restricts her freedom. She is not allowed to leave the house for anything but work or school. She's had a history of self-harm, eating disorder, and various mental illness. Her parents have actively berated her for these issues, saying 'you're a disgrace to this family' 'you ruined our lives' etc. She's gotten in trouble for sneaking out and smoking cigarettes, sure, not right, but the punishment was a closed hand beating every time. She was caught trying to sneak out last night, and in a weird trance, told her mother everything she's done. She admitted to not believing in God, having multiple boyfriends (which is not allowed), and still smoking.    Now, her father, who is a pilot, is away for now, and she wants to get out before he comes home. There's been multiple instances of the mother having to stand between her and the father to stop further harm being done to her. Her life is genuinely in danger, as not believing in God is about the worst thing she could've said.   What should be done here? She wants to run away and call the police, will they help? Or will they send her back, as she has no markings from any previous beatings. Any other course of action to take here? Sorry if this isn't the right sub.	Yes
We've been in the process of moving out for about a week now. Our house is just about empty. Yestersay, our neighbors came over to help up move the heavier furniture. In our living room, on a desk that's still there, I had a wooden stand with a large foot long dagger on it. I know for a fact the dagger was still there at the time. My father bought this dagger for me from a flea market when I was a little kid, and it is very sentimental to me. We've searched our house and what little is left in it, and we've just finished searching our new home in case someone had packed and moved it but forgot, but the knife is nowhere to be seen. This points to one of my neighbors having stolen it. If this is true, what kind of legal action can I pursue  in trying to get my property back?	Yes
So I had a long time business relationship with a supplier. A couple years ago we had a dispute on a payment, long story short I refused to pay them for the particular purchase and its somewhat a complex situation involving multiple parties. I have since continued to do business with them.   For a recent purchase I provided them with my credit card information. I then learned several days later that they charged my card for the prior disputed balance despite having received clearly written messages we are disputing the amount, and certainly we did not authorize them to use this particular card for it.  I know the basic way to solve this is with simple court over the original value, but I want to know if they committed a crime by using my credit card for a purchase I did not authorize, and if so if I can use this as a way to convince them to return the funds?  My business is in Pennsylvania and they are located in New York.   Thanks for your assistance.	Yes
I received an order of protection and have no idea what the consequences are if it's not removed, or worse, made permanent. The order came from Family Court - which I understand is a civil matter. So does an order of protection from family court show up on criminal background checks? Are there different types of restraining order such that some do show up on background checks whereas others don't?	Yes
Hi legaladvice,  Last night I was out with friends and drank a bit too much. Called for an Uber car, a driver pulled up to the spot we were waiting at and claimed he was from Uber.  I gave him my address and he claimed the ride would be $75 when it should have only been $25 max. He agreed to $25 and asked for my debit card and runs it through his limo company's app, asking me to sign. I did not sign. I wake up this morning to a charge for $75. Ive already called my bank and explained that:  1) I was overcharged 2) I did not agree to $75  3) If there is a signature, it is not mine.  Ive already started the dispute process. Will they side with me?	Yes
My grandpa who doesn't speak english and never opened an account without my parents and uncles received a mail saying he had to pay 5.5k to a known bank nationwide. We called today and was able to let them know about his situation and told us that someone opened an account and credit card under his name. They are currently investigating this issue.  What I need help is preventing the culprit from opening other bank accounts (he may have opened other accounts still) cause he probably had my grandpas ssn.	Yes
"Hey everyone, this is happening right now, but this is all the information I have.  So I was in the military, I was recently discharged and now have a pretty good job which I dont want to disclose for obvious reasons. A female military member I served with is trying to claim I sexually assaulted her so she can get money from disability for PTSD.  What is my best course of action right now?

"I was charged with attempted larceny in a building. A 1 year misdemeanor. The prosecutor has said if I do not tale their plea at my pre trial they will make it a larceny in a building charge, a 4 year felony, the charge stems from accusations of me stealing a phone. The only evidence is the police report and the witness testimony from a nurse and a doctor. In neither of the testimonies do they say they saw me take anything, it is all assumption because ""i was the only one in the room"".  At the same time my lawyer is advising me not to take the plea deal because i would then have to lie and say I did take the phone, but at the same time im not gonna face a felony charge for taking it to trial.  Any advice would be great, thanks."	Yes
Throwaway for obvious reasons.   TLDR at end.   Was arrested late may 2017 in Santa Barbara County , CA for 2 misdemeanor drug possession charges. One read 'Possession of controlled substance' and the other 'Possession of controlled substance without prescription'.   Got Court tomorrow and wondering what I should expect for an outcome. Private lawyer.   The two substances were (1) SINGLE LSD TAB and ~15 KLONOPIN 2MG PILLS (prescription benzo).   The way I was arrested tells as follows -   Sitting in car looking up food store location with my buddy. Im in driver he is passenger. We have a single tall open beer can in the center front cup holder. I have my LSD, KLONOPIN and a bag of MAGIC MUSHROOMS in the side compartment of the front driver door. We are apparently illegally parked / pulled off to the side of the road in a residential area. Keys are in ignition, engine running. It is late, between 12-1am at this point.    A cop knocks on the window and asks what we are doing, we proceed to tell him we are looking for a directions. He then sees the open beer can in the car and tells us to step out of the car. Asks to search and I say yes. Finds all drugs and asks who they are. Tell him my buddy left them there. He arrests me on the spot for having them in the car on drivers side. Spend night in jail (~14 hours), and get out and move on.   What should I expect as a reasonable outcome w my private lawyer? This is my first time offense , I've never previously been arrested. Is there any specific way I should handle myself in court? Also, why didnt the officer charge me for the magic mushrooms/ open beer? I was being very nice and cooperative during the entire time, maybe that helped?  TL;DR  I got arrested in SB, CA for possession of controlled sub and possession of controlled sub no prescrip. First time offense with a private lawyer. What can I expect at my court date tomorrow?	Yes
They are not answering their phones.  I have the title so it's still technically my car and if they won't pay for it, then would I be able to report to the police that they have stolen it?    Or would I get in trouble for that? I mean technically if you are supposed to pay for something but then u don't it is stealing.	Yes
I wasnt there but 2 of my very close friends were arrested last night for possession of marijuana. What happened was my first 2 friends drove back into this neighborhood with no houses built yet, just places for them to be built. The first car saw them and let them know, and then when the 2nd car with 4 people stopped at the stop sign within view of the cops they turned their lights out and back on (not 100% what happened here.) After they turned the cops flip their lights on and they come to the vehicle, make everyone roll down their windows and take their id's and proceed to detain them and then go on to search the car, find a bag of weed in one friends bag as well as  a bong, lighter, etc and the other one who had no weed only a scale and possibly lighters/rolling papers. The 2 who owned the bags (1 was the car owner) were taken into the police car and arrested and we found that they were charged with possession of marijuana under 2oz and are currently on bail for $500 a piece. They released my other 2 friends who were in the car with them and they were able to take the car. We are going to talk to a lawyer asap and try to get them out of there as well. Is there any way they can get out of this considering they had no probable cause and never asked to search the vehicle. This is in Montgomery County, Tx, US.	Yes
(I'm going to apologize for this wall of text, but I really need to get this out there. We need help ,and I can't find anywhere else on reddit to ask these questions.)  I'm in need of some serious help here. I'm 23 and out of the house, but I have sisters back at home. We were all adopted. To give you some back story: I have 2 other sisters, 17 and 18. They live in NJ while I'm in Ohio. Yesterday they visited and while we were alone, my 18 year old sister said she needed to speak with me. Long story short, she had confirmed my long-term suspicion: my father is a creep, and is sexually harassing her, to put it lightly. I've been *slightly* suspicious for a while now, after he made some off-handed remarks to me and a couple incidents of inappropriate touching. I gave him the benefit of the doubt with the touching; I always just assumed it was an accident when it happened. It turns out that he had been making the very same comments to her, only it and the touching has gotten more extreme to the point where she is petrified of being alone with him in the house.   That being said, my obvious first reaction is to get her out of the house. I have an apartment with my SO and we are both willing to have her here. Getting her here isn't too much of an issue. We do have a problem though: her bank account. I don't remember the details, but she said that the *only* way she is able to withdraw money is with our parents present until she's 21. We're afraid that, since dad has control over the account, he will withdraw all of her money. Yes, he would do that to her. Is there any way around that policy? Can we talk to the bank and explain the situation and can they make an exception based off that? Also, since she is 18, there obviously isn't a problem with where she goes. But like I said before, my other sister is 17. If I got her out of the house and dad got angry, could I be arrested for kidnapping? I just want all my bases covered.   And here's a second thing: what do we do about HIM? My sister has done what she can, I think. She has contacted the police on a few ocassions. They brought him in for questioning, but nothing came of it. The problem is that our father uses his clout of being an ex-police officer of 20 years to get him by in this situation. It doesn't help that my sister has had a habit of over reactions and exaggerations (this is obviously not one of them). It seems that local law enforcement will do nothing major for her now. There's also the fact that she's tried to bring this up to our mother. As I said in the title, no one, not even our mother, believes her. Dad is smart, and always makes sure that his creepiness can be masked to look like something completely innocent. Understandably, mom has always given him the benefit of the doubt (along with everyone else), despite warning signs that even she is aware of (ex: dad sometimes watches things like documentaries of crimes of women being raped (seriously dad, what the fuck). Mom tells him repeatedly to turn those things off. She doesn't seem to put 2 and 2 together). That being said...what the hell am I supposed to do about this? Is there nothing that can be done? Will he never be punished for this?  This is how it's starting to look to me, and I can't believe it.   If anyone has any answers, or even just advice, please tell me. I'm coming to my wit's end.	Yes
There is a 2 point enhancement on a Federal Sentencing Guidelines if the instant of the crime was committed while person was on any other sentence.    What if the person was 6 months off Probation when the Federal Offense was committed?  Would that 2 point enhancement still be valid?    Thanks	Yes
What should I expect to Do? 	Yes
"So, I'm scared, as you can tell by the title. Why? I live in Idaho and they're very strict with their laws containing marijuana. I was driving home from work at 12am, on a Sunday and was extremely tired. Someone (I wasn't paying much attention to anyone following me as I was just trying to get home and go to sleep) was following me home and called me in as a DUI because I was swerving on the road. I get home and get ready to snuggle in my bed from a long 8 hour shift when I hear a knock on the door. Now, I live with my parents so the first thing I did was run to my parents room and tell them there was someone knocking on our door but i told them it didn't sound as if it was a cop. (I thought it was our neighbor.) My parents go to the door and they ask for me. I come to the door and they flash a flashlight at me and ask if I am drinking or have been drinking. I reply ""no, I just got off work and I'm tired"" they ask me a couple other questions and then finally told me that they knew I wasn't under the influence. They didn't give me a sobriety test either. I explained that I was tired from a long shift which caused me to swerve on the road. THIS IS WHERE IT WENT DOWN. He asked for my drivers license and walked to my car with me. I opened my door and he immediately says my car reeks of marijuana. I act somewhat dumb knowing I had some from a previous incident. He asks if he can search my car (me being dumb, let's him search) he finds a little purse with a bag of marijuana (a gram or less) and my grinder (which I bought at a 18+ tabacoo shop.) Also, I'm 18 if that helps with anything. He then says he won't arrest me as it's minor and he has better things to do. He understood that I was a good kid and said he hopes to see me in a few years with a badge on and promised that he wouldn't judge me for this. I'm going to school for criminal justice (yes, I know. Stupid discussion making on my part. I already know and have already knocked myself down for it. All I can do is learn from this.) I have nothing on my adult record (I had diversion when I was 15 for alcohol but finished the program.) He then wrote me a citation for possession of marijuana and possession of phara. There was also a date on the citation as to when I need to call the clerk of justice to schedule a court date. I'm so scared as I've already mentioned. I want to be a detective/profiler and I'm currently going to school for criminal justice as my major and psychology as my minor. I work two jobs and also volunteer for my community to help better my experience when I want to apply for a future job. Just have a couple questions I feel I need answered to relive my stress/anxiety I'm having. Some you may or may not know the answers to but if you've had previous experience with these charges, your experience and knowledge would be very appreciated. What should I expect at my court date? I'm going to plea guilty (I can't afford a lawyer and I really just don't think it'll help me in the long run.) Would it be considered my second offense since I got diversion when I was 15? Or would it be considered my first offense as I'm now an ""adult?"" Should I be taking online or in person drug and alcohol classes to be proactive about my charges before I appear in court? Would that look good to the judge or be a waste of time and money? Will I go to jail? (Super scared about this.) Since it's my first adult offense, could it play out that I go to court and he/she just issues me a fine to pay and I move on with my life? (I know that's very unlikely but I'm just trying to hope for a light in this darkness.) Would I likely be going on unsupervised probation or supervised probation for these charges? I was also going to bring any further information that would show I'm not just some stoner who doesn't do anything with their life like - my two scholarships I recently received my senior year of high school, a copy of my diploma showing I graduated high school, my top scholar reward I received from my school, proof of my high GPA? It could mean nothing to him or her but would it help me in any factor? Any additional advice would be greatly appreciated. I'm nervous, scared, and ashamed. I don't need to hear that I made a mistake. I'm very aware and won't be repeating this mistake ever again. I talked to a couple people at my school and they said it won't effect my schooling. I know it's just marijuana but it's my career that I'm scared for. It wasn't worth it. My future/career is so much more important. Thank you for taking the time to read. I hope it made some sense. I'm nervously typing."	Yes
"Not too long ago, my bf and I had gotten into an argument in regards to something, it had escalated a bit but not never to the point of me being fearful for myself.  We squabbled, I drove away with his things and he had jumped back from the car door and ended up putting a ding on the backside of my car.   We ended up eventually resolving our issues but not before exchanging a few words in our home which we share together.   We had spent a great 5 days after the fact, being happy, issue being resolved, celebrating our anniversary, and doing everything together as we always do.  About 5 days after the fact, we ended up having another one where I had told him it was over between us, which isn't what I wanted, but I was forced to because work had temporarily gotten involved with our last one and told me to make a choice.   He ended up getting angry and leaving, but not before exchanging words and hitting the dry wall, causing damage as he left.  I ended up calling the police, thinking that it would blow over, and he would be told to cool it and not be so stupid.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case, as many years ago he had a very bad domestic case, in which he ended up doing some weekend time and house arrest. Mind you, this was a terrible part of his life where he had issues with drugs and alcohol, he had made threats, and used a knife to destroy vehicle property, while he was intoxicated. So this was nothing like it, as he has never shown violence against me nor have I ever been fearful of him or for my safety.   We've built a life together, and although he has some temperament issues, he works hard, always making sure my needs come above his, that our dogs are happy and safe. Never letting the lack of money affect us, as he makes sure there's food in the house and bills are paid if I'm struggling with money at work.   He's my best friend, and I his, and we've always been able to tackle anything given that we did it together, we've been unstoppable, for lack of a better word.   But back on track, I ended up getting interviewed and asked questions by an investigator in regards to the fight, they had asked me the same questions 10 different ways, they weren't very nice about it either, and had made me sign something that I wouldn't recant, and if I did, I would be charged.   So now, because of this, and all these questions about our past fights regarding this matter, and exchanges of words, he's being charged with mischief x2, uttering threats to cause death, and assault.   I never wanted any of this, and had even told the investigator that. He had told me it's too late and they had everything they needed.  I had told them that I'm not fearful, and that he wouldn't do anything to ever hurt me, because he wouldn't.  I even mentioned that he can come see our dogs whenever he wants and not have any restrictions, as he is truly a great man that just struggles with some issues at times, and he deserves to see his boys.  But most importantly, I never wanted to get him in trouble, I love him, and want us to fix our problems, because he is the love of my life, no matter the circumstance.   Unfortunately, as of now, he isn't allowed to contact me directly or indirectly, or see our boys without having his surety present.  My question is, what can I do to make this easier on us?  He had admitted to the mischief, but the alleged threats and assault, he refused to comment on. Mind you, he has never laid his hand on me. But in an argument, even a shoulder bump, or a chest bump can be treated as an assault.   I was told by an officer that I can call the crown and ask to have the restrictions changed, but will they do it? Will they just try to use it against him? Can I recant my statement without being punished? How do I fix this before it breaks our family? Is there anything I can do?  Lastly I ask that you please do not post judgemental responses, or tell me that I'm a victim, it takes two to tango so to speak, and there are two sides to every story.  He's an incredible man and I love and cherish him dearly, I'm also a strong and independent woman who's capable of handling herself, I'm hardly PC, and don't much care for sympathy in the way of, ""Get away from him, you're a victim and deserve to be treated like a queen"" etc.   Thank you."	Yes
So here's the deal, I was dead set on going to an event in the UK at the end of July, now I can't go for several reasons, both economical as well as the fact that I'll be going to a marriage.   I haven't ordered a flight yet, but I did book and pay for a hotel months ago and it was non-refundable, I'm not sure whether or not I should reach out to the hotel and ask for a refund since it's still weeks left and last year, all hotels were pretty much booked full and they can probably still get it back, but in case of a policy against such things, am I doing anything legally wrong if I were to do a chargeback via the bank? The card I paid with isn't eligible any longer also.	No
My contract ends on August 7th and on July 2nd, my landlord asked me whether I want to sign another contract or move out. I said I cannot decide just yet and we did not talk for one week. Last night (July 9th), he suddenly told me I have one day to make up my mind, if I don't respond today, he's going to assume that I will move out and my contract will not be renewed. His argument is it takes just as much time for him to get a new tenant as it takes for me to find a new house (which is utterly bs because his house is 1km away from the uni). How come I only get 1 week to find a new house and he gets a whole month to find a new tenant? Any legal document that can help me win this case?	No
On July 9th, my dad died, it was sudden and although expected was still unexpected.   On July 11th, his wife since 2003 arranged his funeral and service and during that time explained to my brother and I that my dad's 401k was recently being transferred to a new finance company but that the old finance company was saying that they never received the paperwork. She was working the issue between the old and new companies.   On July 15th, we had a service, it was there that she started to freak out about the house because it was not willed to her, it was willed to my brother and I. The home was purchased in 2002 prior to the marriage. She was told us that she was unsure who the executor was during that convo. She also asked that I purchase his truck that had a $10k bank bill in good standing.   On July 17th, I went to the house to drop off the truck I borrowed, her and her adult daughter handed the will to me and told me to read it. It says that the home goes to my brother and I 50/50 and that she is to stay in the home until she dies. No mention of who pays the hoa dues, property tax etc. She was very upset because she only receives $1600 a month through SSD and a stipend from my dad's life insurance. I figured but did not say 'well we'll charge her to live here at whatever the property tax and hoa dues equate too, which would be $750 a month. She now tells me that the 401k has been transferred to the new company but no one will return her calls.   Emotional moment, I give zero shits about any of this stuff. My dad died. But I do want to move through the process and basically get there new normal figured out.   Back to July 17th, she tells me meet that the executor is a close cousin, my dad's niece and wife is unhappy about this because she doesn't believe executor will be fair. I tell her it's a piece of paper and there is really no way to mess around with it. Executor is a fair person, was not given any significant assets in the will, she has zero skin in the game.   Later that evening, wife's daughter calls me and is very upset because the will says that the executor was supposed to arrange the funeral and wife had done it without even inviting or extending courtesy to executor. She is also upset that my brother and I may charge 'rent' to her mom, she feels that my brother and I should pay $330 a month for hoa dues and $4k a year for property taxes. I simply said 'well, I really need to see the 401k distribution to see where I am financially'   July 18th, wife calls me and says we can't charge her to live there, a lawyer says so and she only has to pay hoa dues but we're on the hook for property taxes. I said okay, have you notified executor, she hadn't so I did because this is bullshit.   Executor did not know she was named because wife had told her right after my dad died that wife was. Apparently, my dad had drafted a new will prior to death but it was never signed and she was asking around to family how to get that will invoked, it gave her portion of the house and left items to daughter. I told wife that this will needs to be given to executor so she can begin the process, wife tells me that she has hired a probate lawyer and has been instructed to not give executor the will. She then tells me that the $10k truck bill and $2k credit card will have to paid by executor and that she has gone to the bank and closed out or taken my dad off the checking and savings accounts. She says the physical items left in the will for my brother and I are community property and she doesn't have to hand it over, we're talking about stuff my dad had looooong before he ever this lady and stuff that my family brought over from Italy in 1920 when they became citizens. Still no word on the 401k.   I'm at a fucking loss here. Wtaf.   I'm ready to hire a lawyer for my family because this lady is sneaky as shit.   Like I said, whatever the will says it will be followed, my brother and I don't care. There is an issue with us paying for the property tax though, neither of us can afford it. We both have houses of our own with incredibly high property tax (Yay king county), we both have 2 small kids, I'm not married. We both do alright in life but it's not like we have money lying around wanting to be spent on someone that isn't even a relative.   Can she really live there and my brother and I have to foot the bill? What if she remarries, what if she moves in her jobless daughter, her jobless husband and kid, do you we pay for that too?   Can she really remove the executor just because she doesn't like it? Can she withhold the 401k distribution? Can she really drag this out?  My dad was not a rich man, he lived simple, had a paid off home, some 401k and some things that were important to him. So we aren't talking a million dollars here. To me this is ludicrous.	No
"I originally posted this in /r/boston and was directed here instead.  I took a look at my electric bill this morning, and noticed that SFE Energy (one of those companies that goes door-to-door to discuss energy options) has apparently been providing my energy through Eversource since November. I usually just login, see the amount due, and pay online without taking a look at the finer details of my bill. Last week I did look at my bill, and noticed SFE was listed as my energy provider. I distinctly remember them coming to my door around October or November last year, and I freely admit to talking with one guy, asking my name, etc, but after 5 minutes or so I told them I wasn't interested. I kept the original agreement, incomplete and unsigned, and shredded it later that day. I called them to inquire, they had no email address for me on file, have never mailed/emailed me before, and they finally emailed me with a copy of my ""original"" agreement only, and the signature is forged.  Since my initial post earlier this morning, I have spoke to one of their customer service reps over the phone, and was asked to forward over proof of my signature such as from my license, which I have now done. What's the best course of action to take? Obviously, I want to be removed from their services, but I do have any recourse to be reimbursed for the money that was spent on their services? Is there a police report to be filed against the rep for the forgery?"	No
A little backstory: I bought a fixer upper in 2015 for a great price with my parents help co signing. They have paid nothing toward closing, the mortgage, or anything ever. Just had their signatures. I had a baby, went through pretty bad postpartum depression, didn't work, didn't pay my bills correctly and got behind on my mortgage for about 6 months. With some help from my boyfriends family, we got everything back on track and have paid on time since. My father was understandably stressed as we all were because paying your mortgage late isn't good, I know that. So he has been wanting us to sell it or refinance to get his name off the mortgage. I'm in no position to refinance and I agreed that we need to put it on the market-when we get most of it fixed up. We bought the house with equity and once it's sold we should be looking at a profit of anywhere between 15-30k depending on how much we put into it. He wants us to sell right now even though we're in the middle of a few big projects and when I say right now, he wants it listed ASAP. He said that he and  his lawyer are prepared to essentially 'evict' us if we don't do what he wants us to. Can this even happen? I just went through all of my paperwork from closing on the house and from what I can see if anything we are all equal owners. My mom is 100 percent behind me but obviously wants to keep the peace among everyone as well. So with all that said, does anyone have any insight to this? I'm thinking about contacting a local lawyer myself but I'm not sure how good that will do.	No
I’m in some deep shit.   I asked someone for a rental application. They sent a document which I filled out and signed. This turned out to be a lease agreement which I’m now on the hook for. I just signed a sublease agreement with someone else. Now I’m on the hook at two places. What can I do? 	No
I have been living at this property for over a year. My lease was supposed to be ending June 19th but on the 14th I decided it wasn't worth the price of paying for a moving truck, a security deposit for another place, and storage room for holding some of my things. So I decided to renew my lease and went into the leasing office to sign the agreement. On the leasing agreement where the security deposit came up it says that I renewed my lease so I don't owe a new SD, and it was signed by an employee there. I have had no problems until last week when my rent was due for the month August.   My usual rent is $495 but it doubled this past month because my landlord said I owed a new SD. When I questioned them they said they used my old security deposit to renovate the house and common areas, and that I had signed a new lease instead of renewing my last contract.    Thing is there were no damages to the common areas. No holes, no need for carpet changes, etc because no one spent any times in those areas. I also have proof that they knew I was renewing my leased based on the agreement signed by an employee/realtor there.    I am questioning the legality of them charging me for another security deposit even though I renewed my lease.   Any advice is welcome   Tl;dr: landlord says I signed a new lease so I need to pay for another security deposit but I have proof that it is a renewal of the lease	No

"I'll try to make this as in a nutshell as possible, and be watching the comments for any questions needing more information. Grandparent's left will for all belongings to go to my father. Uncle rarely ever visited them. Grandfather passed about 3 months ago. Uncle for whatever reason is executor of the estate. Grandmother has hardcore alzheimer's, is in bad shape (bed sore, can't feed herself) and staying at uncle's personal care home.  Uncle wants to keep her away from hospice cause ""feels like she has a while more to live"" -his words. He is getting paid any money she gets from herself and my grandfather's pension, including he stated another $1K per month for her to stay at his home. He plans on selling my grandparent's estate in order to pay for the cost of her staying there.... AKA he will get everything in cash from my father when in reality nothing was left to him. Father said he doesn't have enough cash to hire a lawyer currently, though I feel as if he's milking the estate he should be reported to having my Grandmother still at his home since she should not at all be at a care home and needs to if so be in actually nursing home with actual nurses. The care home is all run by my Uncle's side of the family.   Any advice here would be wonderful as no clue where to start calling or looking for help on this matter. My father wanted my grandparent's house to move into and didn't want to have to sell everything especially the house for my Uncle to end up taking everything when he's never been around for years. (Plus Uncle came into the house today taking bags of stuff, didn't tell us he was going or what he took, as my father installed cameras around the property).  Also, this is just outside Pittsburgh if that helps with any information on who I would contact on any of this. Thank you guys again for your time. I lurk a lot but really needed advice this time myself."	No
I sold my first ever car with a broken transmission to some guy who claimed to own a scrap yard and told me he was going to scrap it. This appears to have never happened and now the car I haven't seen in 2+ years has been impounded by the city of Houston. It says I am the REGISTERED owner and also says there is a registered lien holder as well. I do not want to be on the hook for a $20 daily storage fee and the tow. What can I do to help make sure the city knows I am NOT the owner of the car still? I signed this title over to this guy at the scrap yard, who from my understanding was supposed to SCRAP the title but he did not. This is in Houston, Texas. I do not have a copy of the bill of sale right now and I'm currently looking for it	No

In my last apartment, they had to give me 3 days notice. This sounds to me like they can enter whenever they want for whatever reason.	No
Today while driving a vehicle hit a wooden block that was in his lane and it shot directly into my windshield (did not bounce along the way). I only have liability insurance so will be paying $400 out of pocket on the windshield replacement. Do I have any grounds for seeking reimbursement from the vehicle at fault? They continued on and did not stop but I took photos of their license and have a witness in my vehicle.	No
"My husbands previous employer is wanting him to pay to have the office rekeyed because he did not have them sign off that the key was returned. My husband left all of his keys on his desk on his last day. It was only him and the owner there that day, and the front office person who is now contacting him after 7 months was not.  For a little more explanation, my husband used to work for a small office, he had to leave due to our daughters health issues and constant hospital trips...his former boss lost his mind when he told him his plan to leave. He resorted to calling him names, and berating him for hours at a time in his last two weeks about how he is ""not a man"" and it's the ""wife's job to stay at home"" among other even worse things. My husband didn't want to cause a scene or stoop to his level so he pretty much just put up with it until it was his last day. His boss kept saying that ""he would be back"" and when my husband actually tried to hand him the keys he refused. So instead, he left them on his cleaned out desk."	No
Our landlord has charged us a $100 fee for denying access to our apartment for contractors to do repairs. They claim the contractirs sent them a bill because we denied access, and they passed the bill for rescheduling on to us.   We did not deny them access, we were not home at the time, and our superintendent has a key to out apartment, so they could have let them in if needed. The day before we had called our superintendent IF it was possible to reschedule to another day, but she said she wasn't sure and would look into it. After returning home to find no work had been done, we assumed all was well and the work would be rescheduled.  Our superintendent agrees with us that we only made a request, and did not deny access, however the property manager has ignored our argument and attempted to take the fee out of our deposit and last months rent interest. We have had no luck speaking with anybody who can resolve this issues, we just get passed from secretary to answering machine.  We have contacted legal aid and out universities legal department, but don't meet the criteria for them to help us, and we can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars to resolve a $100 issue. Any suggestions on where to go from here for advice would be great, we are in Ontario Canada if that helps. Thanks	No
I stayed in Montreal last month and found bed bugs there. I took every heat treating precaution the intent recommended on my stuff (in retrospect why didn't I just throw everything away? It was probably just $400 worth of items) but I just found a baby bed bug in my sheets at home today and I have bites.   I've contacted an exterminator to get an inspection and treatment plan, but I made the mistake of putting in the notes on their Web form that I think I brought them back from a trip.   Is there a chance this could somehow be used by my landlord to hold me liable if bugs start turning up in the other 7 units in my building? Am I required to report it to my landlord/property management company if I'm having my apartment treated for bed bugs? Even if I THINK I brought the bugs home from a trip and made a statement to that effect, is that proof? What can I do to protect myself here?    (And no, of course I don't have Renter's insurance, I'm a dumb poor millennial.)	No
Me and my wife bought a house in a neighborhood last summer. This neighborhood had a home owners association. However, the seller of the home said that the HOA had practically dissolved when the former president and treasurer moved, and no one had been paying their dues for the past few years.      We were provided with a copy of the original covenants for the association and they state it was originally created in 1998. I believe I read somewhere that a HOA is only good for a certain amount of years until it needs to be re-registered with the county or something. I want to say it was 15 years? Which would mean this one has expired. I need clarification on this part.      A few months after we moved in last year, someone comes to our door claiming to be the newly elected president of the HOA that they reformed in a community meeting to get it back running. And that we owed 50 dollars for the years dues. They handed me a piece of paper that looks like it was typed up in 5 minutes in Microsoft word, complete with cheesy looking word art, and at least 5 spelling errors throughout. It basically said the HOA was back up and running, this was the name of the new president, and I owed 50 dollars.      I ask them what the dues would be used for. They said just to cut the community area between the homes that isn't owned by anyone. Its a flat field that the homes circle around. I told them that sounded fine, but I would like to have a copy of the new covenents and a breakdown of the expenditures.      These were never provided to me, and I never paid. Nothing was said again about it until last week I get a letter on my door saying the 50 dollar dues are due again for this year, and also had written at the bottom that I owed 100 total for last year as well.      Over the course of the past year, the area they said they would cut has grown out of control, over 4 feet tall in some spots overgrown grass and bushes. Completely unkept. The only thing they said they would do, they did not do.      There are 46 homes in the neighboorood total. At 50 dollars each, that's 2300 a year they should be getting, just to cut about an acre of grass, and they couldn't do that even.      On this new letter though, they put a note at the bottom that says they can put a lien on my home if I do not pay.      After talking with a few neighbors, during the few years that the HOA dissolved and no one was paying dues, a few people with riding mowers in the neighborhood chipped in together to cut the common area. So it was getting cut when we didn't have a HOA.      So now, a new, seemingly unofficial HOA has formed, asking for more money than I feel is necessary for a small area to be maintained, and even then, cant maintain it. I feel like there shouldn't be a HOA and we can just continue cutting the area like before. I have a riding mower and would be happy to help cut the area if I didn't have to pay. And I also wouldn't mind paying, if they actually did the 1 small thing they said they would do.      So with all that said, my main question is how much pull do these people have? If the old HOA dissolved, can they just start one up like this? Can I opt out? Do I have to pay if I do not receive any covenants or budget report?	No
So I have a condition called POTS (posterial orthostatic tacacaridia syndrome) and was just fired from my job because of it. It causes me to pass out when I go from sitting to standing sometimes. It's happened three times at work over the past year and they decided that it's not okay for them to have me around anymore. I am a club volleyball coach and I was wondering if it's legal to fire me over this. I'm unconscious for about 30 min and am still able to work after I wake up. Is there something that can be done? Any response would be appreciated even if it's completely okay for them to do this. 	No
I've never posted here before or really even browsed because I've not run into legal issues that I did not know how to handle or where to turn locally for advice. I've recently been presented with some hard hitting information about my ex wife and her new husband involving a sex crime. Can you guys recommend a good custody attorney, I need to do something for my childrenswell being and my peace of mind. Ideally I want full custody instead of the joint we have now. I know that won't happen unless something drastic has happened, and to my knowledge it has not come to that yet.   As of right now I have a little information to go off of as to the depth of my situation but I will do my due diligence and dig deeper, quietly.   I need a good referral in he Kansas City area, I'd like to speak with an attorney to go over my options and lay out some costs and a potential plan of action. Thank you all in advance for the help.  I don't have unlimited finances but when it comes to my kids I'll make it work somehow.	No
"Hi. I'm a 19-year-old undergrad student at a university, and it doesn't have any specific rules about teacher/student relationships other than something about acting in the best interest of students, or something like that. It doesn't say no, and it doesn't say yes.   I'm slightly nervous about posting because I don't have the slightest clue of what the *right* thing to do in this situation is.  The department that I am in does foster close mentor/mentee relationships with teachers, which have been the most meaningful and amazing relationships in my life.   This professor is new and does not have tenure, and he's more than twice my age. I got really close with him over the past year, and I trusted him, and he was there for me. Sometimes it felt like he was crossing professional boundaries, but I ignored it because he'd been really great otherwise. He made me feel like I was intelligent and seemed like he really wanted me to get ahead. Then, at the end of the academic year, I started having a really hard time in my life because of family issues and financial issues, breaking up with my SO, and just issues of being a stupid college kid, making mistakes and taking on too much work. I ended up having a couple of shitty weeks culminating into a couple of really, really bad nights in terms of mental health. I turned to my professor for guidance, cuz I really trusted him. And it really felt like he helped and was there for me, like, he just let me cry and vent in his office and gave me a big hug. I've also had teachers before who have been like family to me when my family couldn't be there, so I didn't think this was any different.   Long story short, that night he invited me back to his house for drinks, and I would have refused if I was in a better headspace, but I think that the most important thing on my mind was not feeling alone. I was stupid and naive and I really do know that, and I knew that this seemed off, and I should have said no. But I also had this other part of me that was weak, and that felt really special that this guy I looked up to and respected trusted me enough, thought I was mature enough, to have drinks with him. So I went home with him. I explained to him that when it comes to drinks, I'm a lightweight. One glass of wine and I'm set. But at his place, he would fill my glass when it wasn't empty, and I thought that was weird, but he seemed his usual self otherwise. And I should have stopped drinking, and I don't know why I didn't. I kind of do, but, anyway, you get the picture, we had sex. I never really said no, but I never really said yes, either. He checked in and the middle and said something along the lines of ""you don't seem okay"" and I said I wasn't, but that was the end of that conversation.   It didn't happen on school grounds. Ever since then though, he's the last thing on my mind before I go to bed, and I just haven't been myself. All of my other problems are fine now, it's just there's this thing, and I'm bitter and angry all the time and I'm dreading going back to school and having to see him all of the time, and take his classes that are required courses. I can't tell if it's my fault or if it's his fault. I have a therapist, and I've had the same one for years, and she's wonderful, and I have support systems and all of that junk, but I still don't feel better, and it's been three months. I have these stupid nightmares that just replay it, and I don't really get it, because it wasn't violent or anything, and I wasn't really forced to do anything. I could have left. But also I still feel like shit, and used, it doesn't feel like the kind of shitty feeling of regret after a one night stand at a frat party.   We talked about it after, and he said he knew he shouldn't have done it and that he was sorry. Whatever.   I have facebook messages that show that we planned to meet and get coffee. I know the date it happened and I know this is something that he has at least attempted with other girls. He has a pattern of getting a little protegé and making them uncomfortable. I don't think they would help though.  So, I thought maybe getting legal advice could help. I don't know if I want to do anything, I don't want to ruin someone's life over me being a naive idiot. But I guess if I could have some kind of idea of what my options are, that might help and make me feel more in control?   I'm sorry if I gave too many details, but I feel like the tone of the situation might have been important to convey?  TLDR; The details are important I think but if I condense it... A trusted professor without tenure got me drunk, or I got myself drunk, and we had sex, and now life seems grey-er and I don't wanna go back to school next month. What can I do? What can he do if I try to do something about it?    Thank you all so much in advance."	No
Throwaway account to keep sharing my story from backfiring  I'm at my wits end. I'm drained, emotionally, mentally, financially. I miss my daughters every day. I'm missing events that I'm supposed to be notified of but never am. I get a measly 48 hrs to see them every two weeks and that's when things go good. When they go bad I don't see them for a month. A month without them is hell and I can only imagine what its like for a 6 and 4 year old. My 6 year old is my saving grace, she loves me with her whole heart, as I do her. When her mom tells her to say bad things about me, she has my back. I'm so proud of her for that but I also fear the repercussions she will face against her mother who has such hatred towards me.  I have 5 daughters ranging from 27 to 4. Ive made mistakes in my life, but I've never faltered in my love for my girls.  My ex wife has made it her goal to wipe me from this earth. She's pushed and pushed with no repercussions at all, shes cut my already small visitation a hour and a half short for the past 3 months. She has gone so far as to falsely accuse me of sexually abusing our children. She's lied to the judge, police and her lawyer. She makes false claims that my home is unfit, that I have no furniture or food. That I make the girls sleep in a mattress on the floor with me. All false, my girls have their own room at my house and each a bed. She's made claims of me using no car seats when I transport them which is also false. My lawyer has stated that the summary I have against her from dcf cant be brought up in court yet. Her lawyer seems to always be two steps ahead of mine. Shes even trying to fight to get my home, a home that I had before we were even married and she never lived in when we were. I can't even afford the amount of child support that she was awarded but I give 65% of my laborers check to her every week yet its never enough.  This past weekend, my appointed time sharing weekend, I was late to pick up the girls due to traffic coming from work. I gave her notice yet she hid the girls from me. I begged to see them, sent several texts and drove a hour to try and get them on Friday night and Saturday morning. She falsely accused me of being drunk and/or high Friday and that not enough time lapsed for the girls to be save with me.  I know she will continue to do everything in her power to keep me from having an active role in our daughters lives.  I'm lost, I need advice on what I can do to see her be reprimanded for her continued contempt of court and perjury. The longful litigation of this has been a total financial burden and has drained me. This has been going on for over 3 years. I'm drowning in attorney fees and it seems like I'm getting nowhere. I need help!	No
"My boyfriend and I decided we were ready to start house hunting; we found a place we liked and put in an offer, after some negotiation it was accepted. Initially, I was involved in all the documents with our real estate agent (a friend of the family) when drafting offers, and I met with the mortgage broker, but other than that, my boyfriend has been the one handling everything with the agent/broker/lawyer.  About a week ago, my boyfriend said that the broker advised leaving me off the ""mortgage documents"" because I was unemployed and he was the primary bacon maker.  He works in emergency response, I'm a game designer about to start my own company, but am currently unemployed until after the house is settled - one big life change at a time. Anyway, that made sense to me; I will have no active income at the time of the move (already put in notice at my current job).  What he has come to explain to me more fully is that I will not be on any of the formal documents; we renegotiated the offer one last time (for some work to be completed before the closing date, as recommended by our home inspector) to be drafted by the end of today, but my boyfriend now tells me that I will not be a part of those documents and only he will be signing them; that it was the recommendation of the mortgage broker. He explained that, if I were to be included in the documents, any of my debts would add to his and he would no longer be approved for the mortgage at all.  It is true that I have a $400 balance on my credit card, but that is my only debt in the world (his credit card balance is somewhere around $3000).  My boyfriend also said that a lawyer could draft a document stating that I was an equal owner of the property, even if my name doesn't go on the documents he is signing and sending off today.  My question is, does all of this sound legit? Is my $400 debt enough to write me out of the whole deal? Could a document like that be prepared after-the-fact? In Canada, there is a bit of a boost for home buyers tax returns (the year they purchase) - would I still be eligible for this if my name is not technically on the offer, bank documents, or deed to the property?  Thanks all - sorry if this doesn't make sense or if I don't know what I'm talking about!"	No
I'm 16, was adopted from fostercare about 3 years ago. It was one of the worst decisions I've ever made and I'm now looking for a way out. Anyway, absolutely any way that can sever ties between my adopted parent and make it so I can live else where. I have multiple places I could live if I wasn't legally obligated to live here. I've looked into emancipation and it doesn't look easy and/or possible. I've tried CPS (trust me it was justified) and they left I shit you not. And now I'm just looking for a way out, does anyone have advice?	No

United States, Michigan  I am 24.  At this point in my life I have severe mental illness.   I have enough control that I can hold down a job, but I can feel myself getting worse.  I don't want to get to the day where I'm going to do something stupid and there's nothing to stop me. I want to talk to my parents about having myself redeclared under their guardianship so they can legally tell me what to do.    What term is used to have a parent reobtain legal control their child over the age of 18? I would like to do some research on the topic.  If anyone has knowledge of the system in Michigan I would greatly appreciate it.  Thank you for your time and help	No
So I'm here just wondering what would happen.  If my child's father decided he wanted to be involved in our daughters life (which I would very much promote) and I let him take her to the park but he decided not to give her back, what would happen?  I would really like to know legally where I would stand if this situation was to ever arise, from hearsay all I know is that this would be classed as kidnapping as he doesn't have any parental rights because he isn't on the birth certificate.  Crucial information.  He isn't on the birth certificate. (He wasn't there for signing)  I'm in the UK.	No
My 27 y/o brother was in a car accident last Thursday. It's pretty serious. He has some fractures, broken bones, and a severe head trauma that has caused him to fall into a coma. He is currently in stable but serious condition in a neuro ICU room.  My family and I have been left in shambles because of my brother's accident. We are trying to collect all of his things to store away since we know he's going to be in recovery for a long while.   My brother is 27, unmarried, and living with room mates. According to the police station and tow company, the vehicle cannot be released nor the items removed by anyone but my brother or his power of attorney. The storage rental place said the same thing as well.    my brother did not have a living will or other documents pertaining to if he were to be unable to make his own decisions. We can't access any of his personal belongings to get necessary items like his keys and glasses. We aren't allowed the code to access his unit despite my brother having the same last name as my brother.   Is there ANYTHING we can do to be able to access my brother's belongings, there are several very important and sentimental items that will be lost forever or stolen if we don't get access and some of that means a lot to my brother and I.   If it helps, my mom, my father, and I all signed at least one medical document since the accident. My father is handling the insurance and health insurance portion, my mom is going back home to Florida because she still has a job and needs to keep it so it leaves my dad and I as the remaining two who can take responsibility but I'm fully ready to let my dad handle the legal aspect of my brother's recovery.

Not sure if this is the best place to post this, but I am having issues with my ex-landlord. I live in WA state. This is posted in TFBL too.  I moved out of my old apartment on June 12th. No issues. Lease was up June 28th. I got my move out statement from my ex-landlord, and he is demanding I pay to replace the carpets. I have asked for documentation, like receipts and pictures, and the likes of that, for the past almost 2 months and the documentation he has supplied has either been incorrect, or not what I have asked for (i.e. pictures of the carpets, and he sends me pictures of behind the fridge) He is charging over $2,000 to replace carpets for about 550 sqft. He gave me the original receipt for the carpets which would make them about 9 years old, and then went on to state the carpets were 17 years old, and had 20 years of life, and then said the carpets were actually 9 years old.   My biggest problem, is that he broke the lease, and allowed a new tenant to move in on the 16th of June, and did not include that in the move out receipt as well had no intention of prorating the rent. He says the new tenant moved in on the 20th, and he had quote for the new carpets done on the 20th as well. He sent me a new statement and explanation this week, and stated he has not yet replaced the carpets, and hasn't even treated the carpets or done anything besides a basic cleaning between tenants. He stated he is replacing the carpets while the new tenant is in the unit in August. He can't provide proof that I damaged the carpets (I have pictures of the carpets, they were fine, free from stains and other damage) and now the new tenant has had the opportunity to damage the carpets. Basically what it comes down to is that I don't think he can charge me for any maintenance, or repairs, etc. that happen after a new lease is effect? Should I take this to small claims court instead of continuing to try and settle this?  Any help or advice is appreciated. I am at my wits end with this guy.	No
"Good afternoon!  Several weeks ago, I was pulled over.  When the officer had approached my car initially, he said he pulled me over because I was close to the middle dotted line (195, highway with 2 lanes going one way, two the other way, separated by a rather large grassy median) and had pulled me over to make sure I was OK to drive.  I'm assuming as if I was drunk, or under the influence.  The stop continues, the person I was in the car with got picked up on a warrant (irrelevant to me, I'd believe).  He came back to the car after arresting my friend, and notifies me that he has written me a ticket.  He did not explain the ticket, but handed it to me as the final interaction (basically, call the court if you have any questions, here it is, bye).  When I looked at the ticket after leaving the place I was stopped, it had said ""Unsafe Lane Change"".  Which didn't make sense because when he initially pulled out, I was not changing lanes.  Anywho, I got to the court, talked with the prosecutor, and he had told me the ticket was actually for not keeping in the right lane (keep right, pass left).  There was a bit of traffic at the time.  I was in the left lane with a stream of other cars also staying in the left lane, and I didn't have the opportunity to get into the right lane until further down the road when the officer had made his way behind me.  So, all in all, I think I was given the ticket erroneously.    Anyways, I need advice on how to obtain what information that would help support my case.  I would like to avoid hiring a lawyer, as I'm pretty low in the funds department, and if I can represent myself, that would be a very awesome alternative.  Thank you and please let me know if I can provide any other information."	No
I recently bought a used Subaru with 118k miles, with the knowledge that a high mileage service need to be performed on it. Before I bought it, I called my local Subaru dealer to see if they had any service info on the specific vehicle. They looked up the VIN and confirmed that they had performed all the work on the car for the past 50k miles. They listed off the past couple years of services that they had done on the car, and nothing major came up, just typical stuff like spark plugs, oil changes, etc. I bought the car, and took it in yesterday to have the service performed, and I get a call from them saying it has a misfire requiring the replacement of the entire valve train, totaling $3,200, in addition to the other service. The mechanic told me that they pulled up the service history, and just a month ago it had been brought in for spark plugs when they diagnosed the misfire. The previous owner traded it in because of that, to an unrelated Ford dealer.  The misfire is in the service history that was not disclosed to me when I checked with them before I purchased it. I'm not sure if the $3,200 quote would be in the history, but I can find out. The call may have been recorded but I don't know where I'd check. Is there anything here that can help me?	No
My boyfriend is the person in question. His parents had an extremely messy divorce 8 years ago; they have had joint custody (physical and legal) since then, with the kids switching houses every week. The legal battle has been going on all of the past 8 years. The parents are very hostile, and they hardly speak to each other.  His dad is a hedonistic, power-obsessed monster, and he's been consistently emotionally abusive. He is also an attorney, which is what worries me. His mom didn't work during the marriage, but she's since started her own business helping autistic children. She's not without her faults, but she truly cares and wants the best for him.  Recently, things have escalated greatly. My boyfriend is transgender, and he came out to his parents very recently. His mom is very supportive. His dad is not.  His mom had a major lung surgery earlier today in Boston (we live in North Carolina). My boyfriend is staying with his dad. His dad has taken away his phone, computer, and car, and he's not allowing him to leave the house.  I've talked to him on the house phone, and he's very scared and doesn't feel safe. He talked to his mom who said that they could fly him up to Boston tomorrow, but his dad has said he can't go. He doesn't want to live with his dad; he's repeatedly said that it's not healthy for him to be in that house anymore.  I'm seventeen years old. I have no idea what to do. First step is getting him to Boston. It's his mom's week, so I don't think his dad can stop him. Then there's the custody piece. This might have an easy answer, but I have no idea. Please any help is enormously appreciated; thank you so much.	No
Does anyone have any examples for custody or visitation agreements for parents where one abuses substances?   Back story: other parent has been abusing OTC medication for a year, no test exists for this substance, but it alters mood. Also has mental health issues. Currently have an order for supervised visits, but that may not last long term, and I'd like to come up with something we're both sort of okay with instead of having a court decide.  I encourage a relationship, and the child's other parent wants one, but I'm not sure how much/what kind of visitation they should have other than supervised. Other parent uses sporadically, so I'm concerned the child could die if the other parent uses while watching the child alone.	No
I'll try to keep it short:  I moved out of an apartment and left it without damages beyond normal wear and tear (documented on video and was told so verbally by an office employee during walkthrough).  The rental company later sent me a bill for about $600 of damages.  I wrote them and let them know that the apartment was left in good  condition and that I disputed the charges.   After I sent notice that I wouldn't pay and was disputing the charges, they sent a reply saying they would just send the account to collections.  My question is: Can they sell this disputed debt straight to a third party or do they first have to go to small claims court and win a judgement first?	No
My brother is afraid of being evicted. Essentially what happened was, my brother heard fighting downstairs where his landlords live. The whole house start shaking and he heard the wife gasping for air. Then she'd yell for him to stop that he was killing her. My brother opened the door and yelled downstairs to stop, she's a woman, etc.   The landlord then threatened my brother that he'd kill him instead. My brother yelled back to come try it, etc. my brother realized his temper got the better of him and closed the door and called 911. The police, ambulance, fire trucks, etc came. Strangely, they didn't question my brother.   Of course, now my brother is scared of being evicted as backlash for calling the police on the woman beating landlord.  Does he have anything to protect himself from eviction? Can he somehow extend the time needed to get a place if it comes to that? What happens now if the landlord decides to evict him?	No
Location: Alabama  My ex just served me with court papers saying I owe her $15k in back child support. I got hurt on the job several years ago and she knows I can't pay. She's just upset that I am filing for full custody and so now she's trying to get back at me. I just got a part time job a couple of months ago but didn't work for years trying to get disability.   Can the judge make me pay or send me to jail when I haven't even been working all this time? The child support was set when I had a job but that was in 2010. What happens if I can't pay? 	No
I'm 21 years old and I'm in the process of starting up a online retail company.  After searching online I found a website design and hosting company. Requested a call and the sales person I spoke to gave a good sales pitch and I was eager to go ahead.  I described the website I wanted at length and he said that this would not be an issue and stated that £4,500 would be sufficient and this is their 'silver design package'. After some deliberating and further discussion with him I went ahead and paid for the first of three installments. They sent me a design brief to fill in for them to be able to start designing the website. NOTE: I did not fill in this design brief, so no designs will have been carried out and nothing has been done by them apart from set up an account for me on their site.  I was struggling with the terminology of the form as relatively new to website design so called their support desk, and at first had to wait 7 days to talk to some. When they got around to phoning me there were several language barriers as English was not their first language. So I went away from, losing some confidence in the overall process.  I was then contacted by the salesman saying that after a further review of my website functionalities the design cost would actually be around £10,000.  Basically to summarise, I dealt with their technical team a few more times and each time left me feeling less and less confident in their abilities so I sent an email to the original salesman asking for a refund, but hinting that I would be back, but that I need the money for another venture and that the website would have to take a back seat, but when I did come back I would upgrade the package. Hoping that this would act as an incentive for them to refund me.  I received a reply stating that after speaking to the managers they would like me to comply with the terms and conditions and pay the additional £3,000. So initially this completely took me off guard, as I did tick the terms and conditions and I thought I would have to pay. After rereading the t&amp;cs, nowhere does it state that the full sum must be paid, only that if it is not paid, they are allowed to freeze the service. Also that no refund of the initial installment for the service will be given. They are also under french jurisdiction as I later found out. So after some research this is what I replied with:  Hi Zak,  I understand where you are coming from, but I would argue that the terms and conditions are void, based on the fact that in our correspondence prior to payment we discussed the entire website including the affiliate section and you proposed the silver design package, stating it would be sufficient. If there were concerns regarding the complexity of the website, these could have been expanded on before the finalised quote.  Regarding the actual design of the website and use of £1,500, no actual work has carried out as I have not submit the design brief. I appreciate that you may deduct some expenses from the £1,500 to cover your time, but aside from that very little has happened.  It would not be unreasonable for me to state that the item I purchased is not up to the ‘expected standard’ and therefore a refund within a 2-year period is required from French Consumer Legal Guarantees. From what I've stated above and based on the following:  The technical support team took 10 working days to transfer my domain to GODADDY. I raised 5 separate tickets asking them for an update on the process, with only 1 receiving a response. The ticket was eventually closed when they gave me the login to GANDI. Stating that I would have to carry out the domain transfer myself, but on your website it states that a domain transfer should take 72 hours.  The original support ticket did not request a domain transfer as I asked how it's possible to get a refund on a domain name. This was not answered and they instead sent me a link for a domain transfer. I know that for a ‘.co.uk’ site all that is required is the IPS tag change, so for it to take 10 working days for them to respond is completely unreasonable and leaves me with little faith in their response time.  I also experienced great difficulty in conveying my website idea to the designer I spoke with, albeit partly down to language barriers. It was my understanding that the website design had been fully understood before making payment, but your designer had very little knowledge of it.  I hope we can resolve this mater in a way that leaves us both satisfied.    I'm still waiting a response, but if anyone has any advice on how I should proceed with this and if I have any legal ground to stand on in court that would be much appreciated. Just as a young man looking to start up a business, I feel like they were almost trying a scare tactic just to get me to pay straight away and as they havent actually provided me a service, and there has only been 6 emails back and forth between us, it just feels like sharp practice.

Hi there, so I'm kinda at a loss here. My mom's apartment management just gave her an eviction notice last Friday and she doesn't know if she should pay rent or not. Apparently ESCROW needs a 30 day notice to put rent money in there, but she is waiting until the courts get involved before leaving. What should I do? State is Ohio by the way.	No
relevant to australian law.  Long, exhausting series of events kept as short as possible.  My car was incorrectly repossessed. During the repossession the car was damaged (as per the marks in the road), I was belittled and insulted by the repo agent as well as the tow truck operator.  I was provided no documentation and no identification.  Upon calling the leasing company, they've said it was incorrectly repossessed. I've requested documentation regarding how and why this happened and they send me an email saying the vehicle can be picked up. 3 hours away in a different state.  I've called them again today and asked for a follow up - they've acknowledged they've received my email and I asked him to get me a response by the end of the day as it's now been a week i've been without transport.  He said hes not going to guarantee something he cant follow through on, as he's busy with other work.  I also asked for an update on the time taken to get the car back to me, they said i have to keep waiting or organise a truck myself.  So i call the company thats currently holding the vehicle, and they tell me they will call me back.   In between all of this, i've been in touch with varying states of legal aid, and compensation aid and i've had no help - i get told to call someone else, who tells me to call someone else, who loops me back to the first person.  I'm frustrated, defeated and still carless.   This has made a terrible impression at my new workplace and I'm fear of losing my job if im unable to keep asking friends and family for help getting to and from work.   I'm backed into a corner and dont know what to do next.   someone please help me.	No
"Throwaway here.  About five months ago, we moved into a house that has five bedrooms with one bigger master bedroom/bath, and four other roughly equally sized rooms. Five people moved into this house initially, with myself and my SO living in the master bedroom.   After we signed the lease (with only four of us on it, myself, SO, and two others) we tried to come to an agreement on who would pay what on how the rent was divided, all done through a group message. Because the top two incomes on the lease weren't enough, we needed a cosigner on the lease, which my family member stepped in to be. What we eventually decided on, was that SO and I would pay 460 for the master, and each upstairs bedroom would be 410. I would also subsidize the cost of the upstairs bedroom that was going unoccupied by paying an additional 410 a month, with the explicitly defined understanding that if we ever filled that fifth bedroom with a sixth person, that person would be paying the 410 instead and no one that is staying in an upstairs bedroom for 410 has their rent changed at all.  Everyone in the group message, in writing, agreed to this. I have screenshots.   Now we've picked up a sixth roommate, and the roommates have begun talking about renegotiating the spread of the rent. I brought up the screenshotted conversation and agreement we made months earlier that everyone agreed to, and two of the roommates said that this was now ""unfair"" and we should renegotiate. The other roommate flat out rejected all of our negotiations for various reasons, and ultimately said if we couldn't come to an agreeable resolution, he would be moving out at the end of the month. In writing, I asked if he was going to move his stuff out, stop residing at the residence, and stop paying rent, even though his name was the one on the lease, and he said yes, so now I have written confirmation.  The other roommates are also unhappy with the fact that we want to stick with the original agreement we all agreed to, but they have not threatened to move out.  If he does end up moving out, I'm afraid the cosigner and I will be held responsible for paying for this guy's rent while he gets off scot free to live wherever else he chooses. If we don't pay it, then we get evicted within 3 days of the rent being due.   Currently looking, but there so far don't seem to be any prospects that are taking over his room.  What options do I have? Am I shit out of luck? If he moves out, violating the terms of the lease, can I pay his portion for the rest of the lease and go after him for it in small claims? I legitimately don't know, and it doesn't look like a compromise will be reached any time soon. Any help would be appreciated."	No
"I [searched the web](https://www.google.com/search?q=broken+window+landlord+or+tenant+responsibility) and this seems to be a quite common point of contention between landlords and tenants. The answers are pretty clear, along the lines of *""you break it, you buy it""*.  My landlord is having none of it, he just uses the argument of a 5-year-old: *""I don't care what happened, it was good when I gave it to you.""*  FWIW, the apartment is on the 3rd floor of a mid-rise and the cracked pane is on the outside. I'm not sure why it cracked; could have been thermal stress, shaking from the train tracks, a disoriented bird or whatever but I clearly didn't/couldn't break it. The landlord actually isn't arguing otherwise either, he just doesn't care. He pulled a similar one on me before with a leaking food disposer which I ended up replacing myself since he refused to pay for it using the same logic.  What can I tell him?"	No
"My landlady told me I had 2 hours to move out with no prior notice. When I refused, she grabbed my head and tried to drag me out of the house and told her husband she was going to kill me. I bit her arm in self defence and she beat my head with the tv remote that was in her hand at the time then dropped the remote on my floor. I called the police as I feared for my life and when she heard me calling the cops she too called them. When the cops arrived she said that I initiated the attack by going for her arm with my teeth and she was grabbing my hair to get me off. The cops said the mark isn't in a self defence position for a headlock and helped her evict me that night. When I wrote to her asking for my deposit back a few days later she then made allegations of assault against me to the police and I had to go for a voluntary interview at the police station. After hearing my version of events the police decided to take no further action and told me that next time I should insist on signing a tenancy agreement (I was a lodger and had none). When I received no reply to my letter for my deposit back I then wrote a formal letter before action. She responded by saying that I couldn't have my deposit and outstanding rent returned because I hadn't given a months notice and I assaulted her (even though I couldn't give notice because she kicked me out with less than a days notice and she assaulted me first) and demanded £1000 for damages (time taken off work for blood tests etc). I went to the citizens advice bureau and they said that I am owed my deposit back and she has no case as the police has decided to take no further action but I'd like a second opinion from the good people of Reddit pls...  My landlady has told me in the past of how she used to get into fights in school and came home from her honeymoon with a black eye because she got into a fight in a nightclub. She used to be a size 20 but lost about 10 stone just before her wedding but she is still a large lady. Her husband is also very large. On the other hand, I am a small skinny Asian with no spine who would rather cry in my room than attack somebody. Her words to the police were something along the lines of ""she latched onto my arm with her teeth and bit down"" which sounds pretty far fetched imo. I just think you've got to be a special type of crazy to attack somebody twice your size by biting them while their husband is downstairs...  Is there any chance at all that she could get money out of me for ""damages"" or wages lost? We both drew blood so I count us even and I don't want to take her to court or anything either. I don't want her money, I just want my deposit back and then move on and forget her."	No
I applied for my drivers license and have a scheduled appointment for the driving test, and everything seems to be in order, no hold ups or issues. After getting back home and looking over the huge packet that came with my parent taught drivers ed I realized that I did not complete all the classroom hours required for the license, I noticed my mistake but the DMV doesn't seem to notice the problem. What do I do? For more info, I turned 18 this April.	No
Hello, My mom had a bill from her dentist which was sent to collections. The dentist told her she would have to pay both the bill and the collections fee. So my mom pay the fee through the collections, but has not received a bill for the fee the dentist hired for collections. Will she receive a notice about this or is everything set? She no longer goes to this dentist.	No
I have a lease that expires on the 1st.  In California, if my lease is up, do I have to inform my landlord that I'm moving out?   I didn't renew my lease and now they are threatening to take rent for next month even though I didn't agree to go month to month or even extend.	No
So I just turned 18 on July 6th. But I got a speeding ticket a few weeks prior. Being underage, he took my license as insurance and gave me a court date of August 2. Now that I'm 18, can I still even be punished for a crime committed as a minor or am I pretty much showing up to be sent home right away? I'm pretty sure that not much will happen to me because he said I might get court ordered supervision or something but I don't even think that will happen. I live in Cook County Illinois by the way. Any help will be appreciated	No
A few months ago these complaints started, its a rough guess its a neighbor across the road who's girlfriend works nights assumingly and the vehicle may wake her up during Daytime hours.  The Vehicle in question is a Rx-8 with a slightly modified exhaust which didn't increase make it significantly louder, but the nosey person across the road made note to start the complaints after the maintenance was done.  Basically everything has been done to keep the idles low, and putt around to not offend anyone but the person keeps complaining saying its disturbing them, and we're at risk at being fined from Strata Council, due to this.  We don't know who it is exactly making the complaints so we're at a impass attempting to work it out, but will request a Council hearing regarding it so they can hear our side since the emails we've sent stating we've done everything possible to adhere and respect everyone's space.   ~~ My question is, is the Strata going to be basing this off local bylaws because those are enforcable with Sound measurements instead of just petty he said - she said statements about something annoying someone, when there are many loud noises in the complex and other vehicles and motorcycles just as loud that consistently go about and should be just as much of a offender.  It feels like we're being targetted just because of basically unknown reasons and the Strata is taking the side of the person filing complaint after complaint.  The vehicle is also only driven in daylight hours generally 12pm-6pm and never at night or early in the morning.  http://www.rdno.ca/bylaws/BL_2581.pdf  Is the information I found on local bylaws for sound enforcement, but could use some advice the best way to go about tackling this issue.

"Lets say a US born citizen travels abroad, returns to the US. Enters customs at the airport. The customs agent starts berating him over having his passport in a leather passport protector when he handed it over. He apologizes, takes it out, hands it back. Customs agent proceeds to lecture... and lecture... and lecture... US citizen says ""I don't know if you're just having a bad day or what, but you're going overboard here over a passport in a leather case""  Customs agent freaks out, calls over his supervisor, takes citizen into secondary inspection.

-_- About a month ago I rented a room in a house. The house has 2 other tenants and the landlord also lives on the property. Things were dodgy at first and now they are getting downright ridiculous. The first things I noticed after I moved in was that there were no faucets on the bathtub/shower. I didn't think to check them before I moved in so I figured whatever that's on me, we have to use a freaking wrench to turn on the water.   Anyway, that was strike one. Last week the lock on my bedroom door stopped working, the doorknob turns but the latch doesn't move so I have to use a knife to open my door from the inside and there is no way to lock it when I leave, I have to tape the lock so I don't get locked up and it leaves all my belongings vulnerable. The landlord has been bellyaching about having to go to walkmart to get another lock but has yet to do anything about it. Strike two.  Last Friday, I went to take a shower and there was no hot water. The gas was shut off. The landlord claims he hasn't had money to pay for the hot water because the tenant that lives in the basement hasn't paid rent in 7 months and he's short on cash. Strike three. Which i'm pretty sure hes lying about because I saw someones belongings in the living room 2 weeks ago and i'm pretty sure it was someone moving IN to the basement as it was no one moving in upstairs.    This guy really seems like a piece of human excrement and i'm pretty sure he's spending his money on something else other than the house. I mean its a house, he has three tenants, the guy shouldn't be short on cash at all.   So anyway, at this point i'm ready to try to get out of my lease and find another place. I mean if he can't pay gas now, in the summer, whats going to happen in the winter? Not to mention him being nonchalant about me not being able to lock my door. Do you guys think I have a case to get out of my lease? Him being responsible for the gas is in my lease agreement, is this a breach? If so, is there a chance he would be responsible for my moving costs?  Any advice is appreciated. This is Pennsylvania by the way.	No
10 years ago a roommate and I rented an apartment in Boston, for years I thought my old landlord had given our security deposit back to my old roommate and I failed to follow up with him and get it.   Now it has become clear that the landlord never actually gave either of us the security deposit back.   Is there *any* chance at all it would be possible to get the security deposit back after all these years?	No
Had a bad interaction with an employee. Attempted to 1 star review the company saying that some staff are not very welcoming to new community members. It was replied to by the owner who explained I have been trying to contact most of his employees outside of work hours for things not related to work(turns out this part was true, but he left out the part that I had no idea they worked there, and they it was through either dating apps or fetlife). I replied to defend myself from the accusation and the review was deleted. I bough a bunch of dislikes because im petty and it was cheap, how much if any trouble can I get in	No
I’ve tried to find information about this online, but everything I’ve found assumes that I’m bringing a car with me.  I currently have a NC drivers license and a car with liability and collision insurance. However, when I move to Chicago I will not be bringing the car with me. I am going to have it put in my brother’s name and have him keep it for about a month to make sure I will not need it, at which point he has agreed to sell it for me.  My license doesn’t expire for another four years, and I don’t want it to expire. I want to have it transferred to Illinois when I move to Chicago and establish residency there, but I don’t know if I have to have a car or car insurance to transfer my license from NC to IL. I am planning on cancelling my car insurance before I go also, but I would like to be able to rent a car in the city whenever I need one, and am not sure if I have to have insurance before I can drive at all, even if I do not have a car.  So my question is, can I transfer my NC license to IL without a car or insurance?	No
as I dont fully understand the legal speak of the executive order, does the order impact a person who comes from Iranian parents [and therefore is technically an Iranian national via father], but doesn't actually hold an Iranian passport himself, has never been to Iran and is a Canadian citizen?	No
Is there ever an actual legal distinction between these options when filling out forms, and if so, when? What, if any, consequences are there to marking single instead of divorced?  Three examples:  * I imagine that my massage therapist doesn't really need to know I'm divorced, and even if she'd like to know that, I don't think there are any legal consequences for lying on a medical intake form. * On census forms, it maybe makes sense to mark divorced, since the whole point of a census is to gather demographic information, but while by law I am required to fill out the census, I don't see any avenue by which the census would a) know if I lied or b) be able to do anything about it. * On a credit application, I could see it being fraud if I didn't report legal obligations that reduced my available income (alimony, child support), but some states award 'palimony' and you don't have to have ever been married to owe child support, so as long as I disclosed those obligations, it doesn't seem like lying to check single instead of divorced.  I put [WA] for LocationBot, but this is really a general question and I'd be interested in hearing answers to locations other than the US if it differs. And there is no particular situation I'm in prompting me to ask, it's just a combination of:  * plain curiosity. * I'm really sick of something that happened years ago being considered the fourth-most defining characteristic about me (it's often after full name, birthdate, gender). * pedantic irritation about how it's always a radio button instead of a check list even though I am technically both single because I'm not married and divorced because I used to be married, and if I were to re-marry, I would be both married and divorced and it would still be a radio button, unless by dint of getting re-married I am somehow magically 'un-divorced' in the eyes of the form gods.

"I went with a friend to his custody hearing yesterday, and I have an odd feeling about the situation.  He had cancer 18 years ago, and has been on SSI/SSDI after they overdosed him with Chemo and he was paralyzed. After years of physical therapy, he can now walk short distances with a cane, but is still very limited and had his disability reviewed/reapproved just 6 months ago.  During the case the Judge has been pressing him by asking things like ""Well you can still sit at a desk and answer phones right?"" And now she wants to see his Soc. Award because she is considering ordering child support based off of minimum wage instead of his actual ~$700 full disability income.  Is this a violation of the ADA at all? He was declared disabled by SSI/SSDI, but can the judge overrule this and charge child support because SHE thinks he can work, even though he has a full disability declaration?"	No
My rent is $1200 a month. I recently requested the apartment install a washer and dryer in my unit, which according to them, is $40 a month added to rent. It took them a month to get the washer and dryer installed, and I ever signed a new lease or any paperwork indicating that I agree to pay for the washer and dryer. The last rent bill included the cost for the washer and dryer. Can they arbitrarily increase the billable amount of my rent without me ever signing anything agreeing to pay for it? I get that I requested the washer and dryer, but they forgot to send me a new lease to sign (their mistake, not mine).	No
I went no contact with my mother about 6 months ago after years of dealing with her violent alcoholism, her undermining my choices as a parent, her blatant favoritism and targeting of my children, and the straw that broke the camel's back, her running a background check on my SO in an attempt to persuade me to break up with him. I just received a certified letter from her asking me to contact her to set up visitation for her and my children. It didn't explicitly say anything about her taking further steps, but it seems like that's the direction she's trying to move. If she does take me to court for visitation what sort of information would be pertinent to document? Are her chances of winning high? (We live in Nevada) I can get several character witnesses on my side if I need to. I'm just not sure if I'm blowing this out of proportion. Thanks in advance for any advice. ETA- should I respond to her letter and reiterate my stance on her visiting the children?	No
"Thanks for checking out the post.  Here's the story: My landlord lives outside of the country and I am only allowed to pay via chase quickpay basically.   Apparently there was an issue this month and I might have accidentally set the payment to be sent on the first of August instead of July.  I don't get a receipt or anything saying that she's received the quickpay so nothing was out of the ordinary.    Last night on the 26th the landlords son wrote me saying that he doesn't see payment on the bank statement so I owe an additional $1200 in late fees ""per the lease.""  Now, they could be cool and say ""ya we all over looked it.  Lets work something out."" Instead of just waiting until an arbitrary day when they just notice they didn't receive a couple thousand dollars.    My question is what sort of notice should be given or can a landlord just wait the entire month before letting you know that you're late?  I feel like they can intentionally wait just to penalize a tenant more.  I'm considering not paying because I do not believe this is ""reasonable,"" but I could be wrong.  I do not have a history of paying late.  Its a nice neighborhood and we're good tenants its just that to wait until the total is $1200 over half the price of rent seems ridiculous.   What are my options?"	No
When in reality the dog got loose and I was chasing the dog.  It is infuriating that they charged me for something that I did not have any control over. My small dog(rat terrier mix) is not dangerous but not smart either.  And I would not let her off leash on purpose because she will surely get hit by a car. I tried to reason with them but they would not listen.  How can I fight this?	No
First off let me state, me and my ex have a pretty good relationship, except shes very controlling and wants her way. Besides that she's an amazing mother and friend.  We're in the process of divorce and she keeps saying that she wants sole legal custody so she can make sure peyton attends the right schools and isn't raised into religion (family drama caused yhay issue)   So at first i agreed, nothing is finalized but after talking to a family friend who is works in a law firm she told me it was a terrible idea because I'd be essential giving up all rights as a father.   I love being a father and I don't want to give up my rights, but I'm extremely confused..  Any advice is greatly appreciated.	No
"http://i.imgur.com/tfYD2ih.jpg  This is the notice. Like I said, I don't smoke so it doesn't affect me, but I am curious I guess and probably because when this management company took over, they had pushed what ""reasonable notice"" is when dealing with other things that require entering our apartments that are non emergency."

So August is my last month of my apartment lease. I begin my new lease on the 11th and I'm required to only pay for the time I'll be in for that month (20 days instead of the entire 31 days of August).  But the place I'm **currently** in is forcing me to pay 100% of the rent even though I am forced to be fully moved out by the 18th.  Is this legal?  Thank you in advance.	No
My kids (9 and 8) are doing a dermatology study on a cream of some sort. When the dr approached us we were told they would each receive $650 for about 16 weeks of study, using meds and getting blood drawn. We discussed this with them and they wanted to do it. Upon signing the paperwork we noticed that it said the payment would be $500 for each. My wife talked to the Drs tech about it and she was assured that the payment was $650 and that it would be changed. Fast forward until now and we are being told it is actually only $500 and that we signed for that amount. Drs office isn't willing to do anything about it. Do I have any legal action I can take or are my kids just screwed for trusting them the staff in the beginning?	No
Hi everybody! First off...I really appreciate anyone who reads this and can possibly give me any ideas/sources to check out. I'm posting this on behalf of my roommate who is/was the sole leaseholder on our apt. and am just going to give a quick background before I jump into my questions...  As mentioned, I never signed the lease at our apt. we lived here happily for over 4 years, the owner/our landlord came to us a few months ago and said he would be selling the building, so we *might* have to start looking for a new place. As he didn't know whether or not the new owner wanted to keep renting the space. It is an older building that has a business on the main  floor, one in the rear, and our 2 bdrm apt upstairs.   We were notified when it sold, our old landlord had the leaseholder sign off on a form that basically said our tenancy with him was finished, he would cash our last months rent and from there we would have to deal with the new landlord to figure out what was going down. Fine. Straightforward enough.   The new owner didn't contact us...our old landlords realtor called once and said (note she does not represent the new owner) that the new owner wanted to essentially jack the rent by over $500 a month (which laws recently changed in our province and that isnt even legal) so we said no, we werent interested in pursuing that, and that we would start looking for a new place. Sidenote: we live in Toronto...there is a legit housing crisis and we have been searching high and low, the whole house is packed and ready to go at a moments notice as soon as we find ANYTHING.   So 2 months passed...the new landlord never contacted us, never stopped by, never mailed anything, didnt give us any paperwork regarding ANYTHING, and he randomly showed up at the door last week...saying we had to be out by preferably the 15th...worst case scenario? The end of the month.  We have two offers in on new places that we are waiting to hear back from presently...BUT   he just knocked at the door right now, basically saying that we owe him $3,000 (aka the two months rent we had no one to pay rent to since he was basically a ghost)....we have not signed anything...the tenants at the store downstairs also have had no contact with him until this past week, and told us that they hadnt paid any rent in three months...  Does this guy have legal grounds to come to the door out of nowhere and demand this money even though there's been no sign or him at all for over two months and we havent signed anything at all?  Something feels off....  Thanks for reading and any potential advice as to how to proceed. I dont want to rip anyone off AT ALL...We have been VERY good tenants here...But it just feels odd.	No
The kids are 9 and 15. Dad has every other weekend plus mutually agreed upon time. Mom is an alcoholic, usually in varying stages of recovery and relapse. She does have a parole officer and a record for beating up Dad.   She had an episode at the beginning of June and the kids have been living with Dad since, every other weekend with Mom. The PO was involved and she was to get treatment, but last i heard she didnt start said treatment until last week. She has a track record of asking for extra money from Dad for the kids or for herself. Sometimes she will take money for the kids and not spend it on them. The little one wanted to do softball in the spring, for instance. Dad gave her money, softball never happened. The little one also has some alarming anger issues (some sexual abuse years ago by the adult child of Dad's then girlfriend), and Mom hasn't kept him in counseling as agreed.   The big kid plans to move in with Dad, so there's bound to be some court in the near future, but what are the chances that Dad could get custody of the little one, too? I've heard that Minnesota is very friendly to Moms in custody cases. Dad isn't perfect by any means; he got a DUI a couple years back, but has no further record. I'm not sure the little one would say he wants to live with Dad (rules and chores and things).	No
I share a home in New York State with my significant other of six years. We have lived in our home for almost four years. We are not married so my SO bought the house and everything is in his name (mortgage, insurance, taxes, deed, and so on). He and I came up with an agreed upon figure that I would contribute every month towards the mortgage and expenses. The mortgage is about $1,600 every month and I contribute $700.   Because I am contributing to our home I'm starting to feel as though I should legally own part of the house. My biggest fear is that if my SO, heaven forbid, dies that I will have no legal right to our home.   Where should we start? Would it be better for my SO to leave me the house in a will?   Thanks in advance.	No
I'm moving out of my place in DC this weekend. The landlord emailed me asking whether I'd scheduled the house to be professionally defleaed and deticked as well as professionally cleaned because of my service animal. I was caught off guard by this and checked my lease. Tucked away was a clause that backs up what my landlord is requesting:   &gt; If Tenant has a service pet, Tenant agrees to pay the cost of having the property defleaed and deticked by a professional exterminator, and if carpeted, the carpeting shampooed and deodorized by a professional cleaner, at the termination of occupancy    This is the first place I've ever rented and it is entirely my fault for not reading my lease in detail.   That being said, I looked up [DC statute] (https://beta.code.dccouncil.us/dc/council/code/sections/7-1006.html) to see whether what he was requesting is legal. Under my interpretation of § 7–1006, landlords can't charge any extra fees for service animals beyond property damage. Am I mistaken in interpreting this?    Beyond that, though, I did some [google searching](http://www.realpropertymgt.com/landlord-center/tenants-pets/) and found multiple landlord/tenant sites that say that landlords cannot charge for cleaning fees for service animals beyond property damage.    Considering my dog did not have fleas or ticks during my stay at the house (which I have vet records to prove) nor does the house have carpeting, I don't believe I should be obligated to pay for extermination or cleaning. Am I wrong? Any advice would be great. Thanks.	No
I have a friend who is a minor who lives in the UAE (united arab emirates) whose parents just divorced. They are all citizens of the US and not of the UAE. There may be some up-coming custody issues and what court system they would take place in would completely change the outcome. So the question is where would the decision take place? In the US where they are citizens, or in the UAE where they live most of the year?	No
So my apartment complex put out a notice on my door on (possibly the evening of) August 2nd (without knocking or notifying me!) that I need to put up my fire extinguisher on the morning of August 3rd, or else I will be billed $100 for not cooperating. This is way too short of a notice, considering they never said anything about it before, and I couldn't check yesterday as it was raining all day so I just had no reason to go outside and see this notice. (Besides, what if I was out of town?!) I put out the extinguisher on the evening of August 3rd, but I'm guessing they'll say that it was too late, though I haven't talked to them as they are closed for today. So I want to find out what I can do about it, as I really believe this can't be legal, or at least morally correct to put out such a message on such short notice and expect people to pay.	No
Confused because it's my first time renting a condo with two other roommates. All three of us are supposed to have the first month, last month, and security deposit wired to the owner's bank account which totals $6,000. My roommate suggested that everyone send him the money in which case he would do one transfer. My question is: what is the safest way in which I can send money to him where I could possibly take him to small claims were he to potentially scam me of the money (I don't know him all that well).	No
I'm not sure if this is the correct subreddit or if there's a better one to post under. Background is, I live in UT, divorced, 50/50 custody. 3 children, 2 teens and an 8 year old. My child just came to me with pictures of text conversations and pictures of the edible gummy marijuana that her Dad is using. Marijuana is illegal in UT and its really upset my kids. I am so far out of my element here. I don't know a soul who does drugs, let alone what to do since their Dad is now using them.   I have several concerns. First off, apparently the kids even know who is selling him them. My feelings on marijuana aside (I do beleive it should be legalized), I don't want someone who is obtaining a currently illegal drug and selling them around my kids. Second issue, aparently the 5 times he's admitted to being stoned the kids were with him. Add to the fact he just lost his job, and these seem like red flags to me.    Do I call the police for this? He seems in a downward spiral and no, a conversation won't work. He has no family here and the latest job he lost was working for a friend so I imagine he's low on a support network right now. Would the police even care about drug use with marijuana? He won't see a therapist of any kind, doesn't believe in them. But he needs some type of wake up call.	No
During the recent storms in Kansas City, my basement got flooded. I have homeowners insurance through Travelers. They have a claim adjuster who called and is setting up appointments, mine is next week. Had carpeted basement, I vacuumed up all the water in the basement. Called Servpro to quote me how much the clean up would be, and it was $1300. About $2000 of clothes got wet and musty, and a $4000 Sony Projector from a long time ago got fried. Im having an estiamte done for new carpetting and a general contractor is coming to quote me on the repair to drywall, paint and door. My insurance covers $5000 of water damage. Do i need to provide estimates to the adjuster? I have itemized the clothing and gotten the proximate value of each item, took photos of the clothes; is there anything else that I need to make sure i Get $5000 to clean up the mess? I have never dealt with insurance claim adjusters and am worried I will get screwed. Please help!	No
I bought a house beside a church parking lot that the church goers rarely use because there is a closer parking lot, so there's usually no need for anyone to use this back lot. Since living here a year I've seen prostitution (front row view right from my kitchen window while cooking), drug deals, teenagers doing donuts driving dangerously close to my house in the lot, people setting off large fireworks, all sorts of things. Yesterday was the kicker. I had to risk physical harm approaching a vehicle with an overdosing driver that still had his foot on the gas headed straight for my house where my daughter was inside to prevent him from plowing into it.   I plan to speak to the church's pastor and see if we can find a solution but I wanted to ask here first if anyone has any advice to offer. Is a mostly abandoned lot considered an attractive nuisance, and do I have any recourse to keep my family safe if they can't help resolve this? Thanks in advance!	No
I will contact lawyers, but wondering if anyone here has a general idea of how to proceed? She left me without any warning or explanation, and I want to file for divorce. We have a shared checking acct with only a small amount of money, but I have mutual funds/retirement savings in my own name (that I had before we got married, but they've accumulated a lot of wealth in the years we've been together). Will she be entitled to money from my retirement account in settling this?  Any idea of how to serve her papers in another country? I have no idea how the divorce process works. Does she need to be there in person?  Thanks.	No
Hello. So I was planning on moving to Nebraska and signed a lease through the mail. Rent amount is $375 a month. (Shared house) in no longer moving to Nebraska since I found work else where. I told the landlord my intentions and they told me they will try to find someone to take over my lease. Is there any serious consequences if I don't pay the rent? I'm afraid of being stuck paying for this rent when I can't afford it.  Please serious advice will be appreciated.  Thanks! 	No
Hello Reddit, I'm a New Yorker that lives in a HOA. For the past 20 years my family is paid the association dues. The issue is out of the 54 homes that are in this community eleven homes don't pay the homeowners association dues.  After Consulting with the board of my HOA they said they've began the process of taking these homeowners to court. This is been an exhausting process that is taken a long time. I was wondering what could take so long to litigate these matters.  Now I live in New York City and I know it is definitely more homeowner, and tenant friendly, I just can't believe that there's no recourse except to put a lien on someone's house and if they ever decide to sell then the association gets their money.   Basically is there a way to expedite this process currently we have one lawyer doing these cases. Would hiring better Law Firm help?	No
"https://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/faq_mealperiods.htm For reference.  The law, as I interpret it: If I don't get a lunch within the 1st 5 hours of work, they need to pay me an extra hour's worth of pay. So if I get to work at 6 AM, work until 1 PM, get a 30 minute lunch then, then keep working till 5:30, they need to pay(All numbers pre-tax):  1) 6 AM to 1 PM - 7 hours of straight pay. Say $20/hour for a total of $140   2) Nothing from 1 PM to 1:30 PM - Unpaid lunch   3) 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM - 1 hour of straight pay. Another $20/hour, total of $20   4) 2:30 PM to 5:30 PM - 3 hours of overtime @$30/hour  - Total of $90   5) Since I didn't get my lunch at the correct hour, one more hour of pay at regular time - $20    I learned about point 5 recently, and did the math - it ties out to within the dollar on pre-tax amounts if 1-4 are included, but 5 is nowhere to be seen. Am I correct in thinking that they're missing that pay?  Additional details, since so much about labor law is in the details:  1) I work for a bank   2) I'm salary non-exempt   3) I'm in an operations position   4) I don't oversee anyone   5) I'm not in the entertainment industry     Standard: If correct, the usual advice seems to be ""Go file a complaint with the labor board, be prepared for retaliation."" My current plan is this: I have a mentor who's midway up the food chain without a dog in the fight. I'd like to give the company a chance to fix it themselves. I figure I can talk with him, see if he can get a review of pay going, and hopefully everything will be fixed without needing to go to the labor board. Else, off to the labor board I go, most likely.   Is anything wrong about my reasoning? Have I made any fatal mistakes anywhere? Is my interpretation of the law incorrect? (The law in question I'm looking at is also on the break room board)  Thank you!"	No

Today has not been a good day.   For the last two years I've been dating a mentally unstable girl, and for the past couple days she for reasons unknown to me ghosted me and refused to talk to me. So today I went over to talk to her and see what was up,  and she looked me in the eye while laughing and telling me that last night she had sex with someone and cheated on me.  I was obviously angry as all hell, I punched the bed and squeezed her arm in anger (she was sitting in my arms). I calmly asked who it was with, she rolled her eyes saying she wont say. I asked for my things back and left. I knew my best bet would be to just block her, not post anything and be the bigger person.  She's now posting things saying I'm abusive and beat her when I never would and may report me to the cops.   I'm really scared, I'm 18, about to go to college and I'm terrified my life could get fucked over for something I never did.	No
"I bought a gun online via an auction. The auction's title, picture and description were for the ""middle model"" of this particular gun style. I was shipped the baseline model, and accepted it at my gun store (called an FFL, you must go to one of these to pick up a gun). This store charges $30 to do all the paperwork so that I could receive the gun (such as a background check). This is great, and completely fair.   When I got home i noticed the gun was not the advertised model. There are very minor differences on the outside of the gun, you would have to break in down and look at the internals to notice the differences. It was like I ordered a V8 mistang, but was shipped a V6, and I had to pay $30 to drive it off the lot.   The shipping store is willing to pay for the gun to be returned, but is not paying the $30 transfer fee I paid to my local gun store. I asked they do pay for it, because it was their mistake they listed the wrong item. The owner confirmed it was their fault that the advertisement was wrong.   Im considering canceling the charge, and telling them to come pick up the gun whenever they want (it is a 2 hour drive for them). Unless they decide to pay back that $30 in addition to the price of the gun.  Basically, I lost money because of their mistake. And they expect me to go out of my way to ship a gun back to them, which I have not done and is probably a little tough to do.   They have also tied up ~$450 of my money due to this. Should I just cancel the charge because I didnt get what I ordered, and make them come get it?"	No
When I was 17 I worked at a theme park, and my mom had access to my bank account at the time, I still am not sure I could have kept my money from her, it was in my name. I am 18 now and I cannot open a new bank account, how can I fix this situation and never let my mother touch my money again? [NJ]	No
I need to remove two adults from my rental agreement. I am the primary renter. I do have them named on the rental agreement as tenants. They are living with us on a verbal agreement of $500 per month that covers all bills except for food. They get free use of the house, and the master suite because of the attached private bathroom. Tenants are my wife's parents.  I'm not sure if it's legal to order them out if they haven't broken any aspect of the rental agreement that I'm aware of. The relationship has simply deteriorated the the point that every day is either silence or yelling between my wife and her parents. We have three children, and I'm concerned about how this will affect them, and frankly I don't trust the in-laws to not mistreat my children or damage my property out of spite.  Can I remove them from my home? If so: Do I evict, serve a notice to quit, or something else?  Thanks	No
Hello,  I was terminated from my job on April 24th this year.  I knew my health insurance was good through June 1st in which case I used it.  Since then, I thought my family was uninsured while I wait for benefits from my new job but I've received an updated insurance card from a new insurance company (Aetna switched to United Health Care) and my wife called them and they did, in fact, say that all of my benefits are active.  I have also never received any termination paperwork or COBRA information in the mail to this day.  My question is can I still use these benefits even though I think the company has no idea that they are paying for them?  (They are an extremely unorganized company with nobody looking over financial matters, so I think I may be slipping through the cracks.)	No
I live in California, client is in Europe. We only had email agreements to do a 3k video project. The resulting video was not professional quality. It was so low quality it started going viral a bit since filmmakers were enthusiastically denouncing every aspect of it.  I gave the client a full refund, but now I have this video which to me is a silly (and expensive) reminder of a project gone terribly wrong. Can I make it public on YouTube? I removed all reference to the company in the Title/Description, and note that the client is not affiliated with it and was given a full refund. But the video itself still contains their name/brand.  Is this fine to publish, or can I be sued for liable, brand infringement, or some other offense I'm unaware of. At this point I feel like it's mine, I paid for it, and should be able to publish it. I even refunded the fee for the script, which their whole team had signed off on and already paid for. I had hoped to retain them so was being nice there, and then they bailed.	No
Ex is self-employed. Ex has zero parenting time (his choice). The last time the amount was changed was over 9 years ago.  I requested a modification, and when he received the notice, he threatened to kidnap the kids away from me.   I am disabled, have zero income (other than the child support), and we are living in extreme poverty (3 people).   Since he said that I called up and cancelled the modification. I have no way to prove that he makes oodles of money; I know he fudged the numbers last time. He lives alone in a high-rent district; He travels frequently out-of-state and internationally; he lives in a very-high-income place;   I guess I'm afraid of him going in front of the judge and saying that since he has so much more money than i do that he is better able to provide for the kids and therefore they should be with him all the time.  Also One more question: Department of Revenue refuses to send the support to me when he sends it to them: I get the money as a lump sum, never in a consistent manner.   I know he sends the same amount, on a consistent basis, as i have witnessed this, and also multiple times when he went out of state he left the money orders with me to mail in for him once a week.   Can i get them to pass the money to me on a consistent basis? Because of their inconsistency I got a warning when I turned my rent in a few days late.	No
"We have a small ""buffer"" between my fence and the fence separating my house from the 2 half lots beside me. Neighbor informed me he was paying to have the trees cut and brush cleared from that area. I'm not 100 percent sure, but the ""buffer"" may belong to me. I like the trees as they mostly block the 2 houses I could see from my back porch, he does not and says the city will issue a citation to have the area cleared. We have only been here a few months, so I can't verify that information as accurate or not.  Also, first reddit post. Correct me if I've made some formatting errors.  Thanks"	No

I live in NYS.  My car was stolen while I was at work an involved in an accident before I could report it stolen. The their hit another car and fled on foot.   My question is, am I liable even though I wasn't driving? The insurance company is telling me that I'd have to prove that I didn't give my keys to someone. It's a keyless ignition car, so there was no physical evidence of theft when we recovered it (there wouldn't be, they essentially hacked a computer).  But this doesn't sound right to me, if I'm the defendant in a civil suit, can't I use he negative defense of superseding cause, since I wasn't driving the car? How can you prove a negative? (That I didn't give my keys to someone)  Thanks for taking the time to read and respond!	No

Florida, if it matters.  I'm helping my Ex with a suit against his HOA. They have not done by right by him or the community that's made his living conditions miserable for the last 5 years. I'm talking toilet water flooding in from upstairs, not repairing it correctly, mold and mildew, constant construction, unprofessional management, not overseeing renovations, and many many other things that are not part of my question. :)  What's the best way for us to prepare our evidence for you? These events took place throughout the 5 years. It will consist of mostly pictures, video, and emails with a few paragraphs explaining what happened.  I looked into some of the software that companies are marketing for you. But the ones that look good cost money for a one-off use and are desktop-only, no cloud or collaboration.  I believe the best method is organized by time and event with everything associated attached. However there is a lot of it and it's easy to get it confused. My first though was to make a Google Slides presentation for each event as it would be a way to easily present the information and can be exported into multiple or a single PDF.   How does that sound? What would you like from a client? I want to make this as easy and possible for the lawyer.	No
Today I was driving and got pulled over, I wasn't breaking any traffic laws and going the speed limit in traffic. There was an officer running what I assume was speed radar from the emergency turn-around, who pulled out about 4 cars behind me, and proceeded to pull me over. He confirmed my identity upon coming to my window, and told me the reason he pulled me over was because my license had come up as suspended, which was accurate. I provided him with my work privelages and he let me continue on my drive.  I am not in any legal trouble nor did I receive any ticket, but I am very confused - I did not break any traffic laws, nor was ever followed by this officer for him to run my plates. How was he able to see my license was suspended? Is there technology on officers that lets them automatically scan and flag license plates going by even at those high speeds? Also, is it legal to run plates like that without any suspicious reasoning? I felt very violated that I got pulled over going down the road - I understand my plates run as suspended with privelages, but I didn't break any traffic laws or do anything to give any officer suspicion to that.  Like I said again, I am not in any legal trouble, nor was the officer anything but polite to me, I just had some questions about the entire interaction! I've passed several police like that going to/from work before and this had never happened to me before. Thank you!	No
My fiance and I decided to move in together as her lease had expired and she had moved to a month to month. We met with her landlady (who until recently had previously lived upstairs) and signed a new 9 month lease (07/05/17). She made some revisions in pen and told us she would scan it and e-mail us a copy. The next day we were having an issue with the new upstairs neighbor and had to talk to them about space and noise. We messaged the landlady to let her know what happened on (07/08/17) and she told us we could talk about it on 07/13/17. Instead she stopped by the house when I was not home and served my finance with a 20 day end of rental notice. (which in Washington is all they need to end a month to month.) I asked her what happened to our lease and she said because we were unhappy she voided it and no longer wants us to rent there. Neither myself or my finance agreed to voiding the lease but she says she did and that her lawyer destroyed it. I am scrambling to put finances together so that we have a place moving forward, but this whole this is putting my finance and her 2 kids in immediate jeopardy. What should I do here?	No
I'll preface this by pointing out that I have not yet spoken to a bankruptcy lawyer or an accountant about this, and am just looking for some direction about my next step before I commit to spending anything more.  I'll post a TL;DR at the end.  I am a carpenter with 15 years experience who decided 2.5 years ago to start up my own small contracting company.  The way I saw it, business in my area was really picking up and I had a solid small group of skilled guys willing to work with me to build something new.  I also had my father, himself a contractor since before I was born, giving me advice and even providing startup cash.  It seemed like a great idea at the time and I did make some food money for a while.  Fast forward to about 8 months ago.  My wife was pregnant with our first and after a couple of bad rental homes (one infested with bedbugs) I had an opportunity to buy a foreclosure at a ridiculously low price that needed some work.  At the time the company was between jobs, but I had about 35k in the bank for starting cash on my next contract due to start in January.  Now, I should add that I never took any accounting courses in college and that for the first year I had my father's office manager doing my books part time until things got so busy she couldn't anymore and I had to switch to quickbooks and manage it myself.  After getting nailed on taxes the year before for having made about 40k in pure profit over the year I decided on December 31st to take out the down payment for my house in the form of a bonus, the gross of which equalled about 30k.  What i did not realize, since I had never before run into any issue with cashflow, was that my payroll tax was not withdrawn until the end of the quarter, so I had not included it when I figured how much to withdraw.    Anyways, I ended up very short when it came time to pay the tax and I now owe the IRS about 17k.  To make matters worse, that contract ended up being a huge loser, and I can't even be sure I will be able to pay my suppliers and subcontractors when it is all said and done.  I project coming up about 2k short after getting the retainage at closeout, and then I still owe the IRS 17k.  So at 19k in debt (at best, it's probably more) and no cash and no future contracts (I stopped bidding when my crew of guys fell apart because of iniuries and other issues and it came down to me alone working to finish the job) I am wondering if I should talk to a bankruptcy lawyer or if there are other options that I should pursue.    At this point I just want to shut down the company and go back to working as a carpenter, since there is serious demand for carpenters and basically none available and I could land a solid job in a day.  I also want to pay my debts and leave the opening to use the LLC for small side projects and such, but I just don't know if that's possible at this point.  I really fucked up and have learned a lot about accounting since but it is too little too late.  I really want to avoid any serious problems with the IRS and am trying to set up a payment plan that I can afford. What should I do?  TL;DR: one stupid accounting mistake and a bad contract have landed my LLC at about $19k in debt with no cash and no future revenue, 17k of that owed to the IRS.  Do I talk to a bankruptcy lawyer?	No
So my neighbor owns the lot behind our house. The lot seems to be used not so often and they're home is on the lot behind another neighbor's house (they own a lot of land). Anyway, the lot behind my property is overgrown. No big deal, don't really care about that, my only issue is they have black berry bushes that are growing over the fence and into our back yard. Can I cut the branches that are in our yard without worrying about any legal repercussions?	No

In October 2016 I was let go from my job. When leaving, I asked about my 26 hours of unused PTO. They referred me to the company's HR department. This is a large company that does business in many states. It is a mail order pharmacy. When I called, they said that in Kansas they don't pay unused PTO. But I don't think that's accurate. I don't think that's accurate because when my girlfriend owned a business that went out of business, a former employee of hers sued her for unused vacation time. I'm just confused with the law is and what I should do. Your help is greatly appreciated!	No
Ok, so a few months back I met this white girl from GSU on Tinder. I fucked her ONCE but nothing serious and haven't heard from her since. Now she messaged me on Facebook and says that she's pregnant and that I'm the father which is BS and she wants me to pay for the expenses and pay child support. She's a huge slut and has probably slept with dozens of guys and there's no way I'm the father I used a fucking condom. Anyways I'm broke and here on a scholarship and can't afford nothing and even if I could I wouldn't as I'm not the father. She said she'll get a lawyer even though I don't know how her redneck ass can afford one. So how can I deal with this bitch?????	No
Hello r/legaladvice,   I am from NY. I established an S corp with my business partner. I am a minority share holder in the corporation, and my partner is the majority. He just recently got divorced(?) even though a lot of what he is saying is not matching up. I have an EIN number if that matters for anything. I am looking to get out of this partnership. I still have the contract which states everything that I said above. I placed about ~$7500 into the business. I currently reside in a different county than he does, so I am thinking about taking him to court, because he won't buy me out of the partnership. Should I take this man to court, because supposedly he is getting divorce.   Personally, I fell out with this man and I am not sure if he is even telling me the truth.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks!	No
Hello r/legaladvice. I feel like I'm starting to become a regular on this sub ever since I bought my house. Long story short, my neighbor will call the police if ANY leaves from my tree or ANY grass blades from me cutting my grass go into her yard (yes, she stands out there and watches me cut the grass).  Last week we talked  to one another with a police officers presence so we can try and work something out. Basically, the moment she sees a leaf in her yard, she gets pissed. I told her I'm not home all the time to constantly monitor every single fucking leaf that falls from my tree. Oh, the tree is on the OPPOSITE side of the yard from her. My yard is not littered with leaves and the police even said that my yard looks fine but she persists on calling the police out every time anything comes into her yard.  I have done my research on the situation, as dumb as I think it is, but once a leaf falls from a tree, I'm not liable for what happens to it. That's what internet articles say at least. Could anybody produce any sort of Pennsylvania state legal documentation that says that leaves falling from a tree is not a crime? Lol. I can't believe I am even here asking this but I'm getting really sick of the police coming out for everything I do outside. I just want to present it to the police/neighbor so it stops.	No
So a week or so ago, the septic tank backed up into our basement. We live in a three unit apartment building. He was quick about getting a plumber there and cleaners to clean up the mess. But I've come home today to find that he's charged us for the services. Apparently the plumbers found baby wipes in the septic tank and the landlord is assuming, because we're the only unit with a female tenant, that it was us.   Can he do that? The septic tank, as far as i can tell is shared between all three units.	No
"This is quite a long one.  Please excuse poor grammar. So 5 years ago I started custody on my son.  At the time he was 8.  While this started his mother refused to go to any court dates till she was handed with a contempt of court months later.  So during the next 2 years there were over 100 days of missed parenting time.  Our judge had enough of us constantly being in front of him.  None of this was due to me.  I had always done everything that was asked of me.  During this time his mother was charged with 7 drug felonies. She was allowed to use a 7411. Which means if she successfully completed her terms. That she would be charged with possession of non-narcotic.  During this time she had moved 90 miles away. And we had to meet half way which she despised doing.  Ok so now this is where the story picks up.  So on a Tuesday before my weekend I get a call from CPS.  I tell them that I will inform my lawyer and we will meet.  I work nights so mother goes to pick my son up.  The next day I ask my son what CPS was in regards to. And he says ""none of your business"".  Me and my son were really close prior to me starting custody.   We spent time together when she wanted a babysitter.  So we go to my parents house.  I tell him that he can go sot at his desk. For being disrespectful to his grandmother the weekend prior and me just then.  He wanted to get up so I tell him that he could write a report that his school was offering for extra credit.  He chose not to so I told him to continue to sit.  He was allowed to get up but I told him no TV.  He ends up watching TV with my father.  I tell him to sit back down he says no and what are you going to do about it.  I get up and I pit my hand on his ear and he walks in front of me and sits down.  Say an hour passes and I tell him he is done being punished.  We watch some soccer and go about our day.  Next day we all go to see Ghostbusters.  He has a younger brother and my ex's son who I raised since he was 1.  After we go to my house and they all play and go to the park.  We drop him off later that day.  So on the following Thursday I get a call from a detective and am told I am being accused of breaking my sons arm.  So when he was age 6 &amp; 7.  He had broke his arm in the same spot.  Now that January he had broke it for 3rd time throwing a dodgeball at school.  I call my lawyer.  And he says normally I would say not to talk to them but in your case we should.  We go and meet with him and tells me the allegations. The story was that  got mad at him and dragged him from one room to the other and threw him into the wall rebreaking his arm.  There are no accessible walls in the room.  Running a pornographic household.   For having a sex talk with a 13 &amp;12 year old.  Showing a Playboy and having a serious talk with them.  Both mother's had agreed and known about prior to use sitting down.  And then of course my wet preserved specimens were brought up.  Oh and I did this when CPS already had a investigation from her call the week prior. So during all this my children have been interviewed multiple time prior.  I have never hit my children.  I dont even yell at them.  So I go to court and I end up losing custody of my son.  If more back story is need on why I will provide.  But basically my court appointed lawyer set it for a bench trial.  And I was deemed unfit.  I did switch to my regular lawyer but the deck was already stacked. So during this time about 3 months later.  I find out I am being criminally prosecuted.   I get depressed about everything and stop going to work and make some overall bad choices.  One was having sex and getting a woman pregnant.   My youngest son was 9 and I had no plans on having any other children.   Well this woman is an addict.  While pregnant she was taking pills.  She goes to jail and then rehab then to methadone clinic then back to jail. All in her 1st 6 months.  So the baby is born. He maconian comes back positive for opiates.  CPS is involved. They find no reason to continue since she had a prescription for her last pregnancy.   Which was like 5 years prior.  Oh yea she signed rights away to her first son to her mother.  And gave her 2nd son up for adoption.  So CPS tells her that if she lives with me that they will be involved and want them out of my home.  So I still see my daughter when the mother would come over.  Till I ask for some things she took from the home.  I had bought everything for our daughter but was for the home.  The mother was essentially couch bouncing with our daughter. We stop having physical contact after this fight as she wasnt welcome in my home.  Over the course of her firat 16 months CPS had been involved 4 times.  One alleged incident involved her boyfriend shaking the baby.  These were always dismissed regardless of my concerns.   When we go for custody.   She received sole legal custody and I was denied parenting time.  I was also denied parenting time for my son. The reason was alleged abuse.  Even though the criminal charges were dismissed against me.  So last week CPS gets ahold of me and tells me the new case.  That the house she lives at is selling drugs.  Unknown number of people living there.  She smoked weed at 630 and at 1030 was in a single car rollover. 300ft of skid mark.  She was taken to jail for dui, driving suspended and child endangerment.  So today when I called they told me that our daughter was placed with her mother.  They are petitioning to remove custody from her and place her with the grandmother.  I have fought for my children endlessly. And continue to be disregarded.  Do I have any options?"	No
Our landlord scheduled for exterior brick work to be done on the apartment I live in and work started before we were notified and able to remove personal property from our balcony, resulting in concrete dust covering our edible plants making them inedible (at least $500 in herb, tomato, other veggie plants [purchase price of plants not potential price of grown produce, not including labor cost in care]) as well as damaging furniture on the balcony that can't be washed. Landlord says that they are not liable at all, and that renter's insurance is our only option (which I do have, more than enough to cover damages). Is the landlord responsible to compensate for damages? How about the dust that got into our apartment since the windows were open and we were gone without any advance notification of the work starting? Do we have a case for compensation with that part of our property being completely unusable? Any case for health damages for inhalation of concrete/brick dust?  Long story short- we were notified about the work after the damage is done. Are we responsible to cover the damages or do we have a case for compensation for property, cleanliness, and/or health?  Live in North Dakota if that is relevant for laws or anything. Thanks!	No

Okay so this is a UK based company. I just received a P45 letter stating that my last day of work was at the start of April. I'm on 0 hours so I usually only work the summer holidays and Christmas. I will now be free to work often but due to an abundance of staff I will remain on 0 hours. However I worked in May and received my pay fine, the letter does state my last payment which I received last month. I am covering shifts this month and I am due to work very shortly so I'm unsure how I have somehow 'left'. I'm concerned that I now won't get paid for the shifts coming up but it's odd how it states I left in April but then mentions my June pay which came from May. As it's a weekend I can't get hold of anyone and I'm unsure what to do. Can a large employer remove you without notice?	No
I (LL) signed a tenant on 6/29 for a move in of 7/21. However, my partner and I are no longer able to move in at the location (her dad's) we were supposed to be going to because of some personal issues going on with the family that happened rather abruptly.  Is this allowed? Am I liable for anything? I feel awful for having to do it, but I am in a tight spot here. Any help is super appreciated!	No
Small-time punk rock band based in Monmouth NJ here.  So long story short, my band recorded an album a couple months ago with a drummer we'd been running for the past year. 9 out of the 11 songs on the album (yet to be released) were already written before we added him to the lineup, so he would technically have writing credits on those 2 remaining songs.    The issue is that due to a myriad of reasons, we kicked him out a few weeks after recording. It was not very amicable, but he said at the end of the day it was okay to use his studio recordings on the album as long as he got proper credit. But now, on the precipice of this release, he wants his fair claim on the copyright to the album.    Two of the members of our band, which includes me, feel it is not worth the hassle to fight for full ownership of the songs against him. The other two members want to keep him out of the copyright at all costs, but still credit him textually.    I have no legal background and probably phrased some things incorrectly regarding copyrights, but my question is what are the ousted drummer's options for fighting us, and what are our options defending against his claim, if that's what we have to do? Thanks in advance.	No
"In October, our roof started leaking. We live in a townhome, and the roof is covered under the HOA. They sent roofers out who ""fixed"" it.   It has leaked 5 times since then. Each time it gets fixed. Today during a heavy downpour it was leaking AGAIN. Same spot every time. I want the ceiling opened and checked for mold, as well as repainted. The carpeting should also be checked for mold, since there are times it has leaked and we have not been home to put towels down. Can we make the HOA provide this?  The water also rained down on an (expensive) printer that may need to be replaced, is there any way to get them to replace it?   The roof is approximately 17 years old. Rumor has it that the HOA knows they will need to start to replace them, but does not have the money to do so. What can we do. We live in Florida and it's the summer now so heavy rainstorms are an every day occurrence. We just want it fixed properly."	No
"... My friend is not on the mortage though and she and her sister made a verbal agreement that as long as my friend pays the property taxes, the sister will pay the mortage. My friend and her 13 year old daughter are the ones who live in the house. They had a disagreement over a recent kitchen remodel job and now the sister is now telling my friend that she has to pack her things and leave in a week and ""get out of her house"" or she'll call the police. The sister also will show up unannounced (even though she lives 7 hours away), and go through my friends stuff and throw her stuff away. My friend has a bank statement showing the transfer of the $95,000, but she's not on any of the house/ownership docs. What can my friend do/what are her rights?

" Background info that you need to know: My dad has physically abused me for basically my entire life, and my mom their entire marriage (has become a lot less frequent in the later years of their marriage, but he still threatens her with a raised hand. Also, she has kind of learned not to speak out against him because she understands the physical threat that he poses to her). Up until recently I just took the abuse and did nothing about it, but over the past year and a half or so I've been standing up for myself and threatening to dial 9-1-1 if he stepped closer (first time I did this was when he was threatening to beat me with a bat because i accidentally lost one of his papers -- locked the door and put the phone up to the window so he could see) and even using my own strength to stop him from hitting me - not hitting back, just using my arms to hold his down.  Also, my dad has been financially abusive his entire life. My mother works 5 days a week and makes almost as much money as he does on top of the countless hours of housework that she does and the abuse that she has to go through from him, and still she is barely ever allowed to spend money on anything for herself. Every penny she spends is policed by my dad and he goes so far as to make her return things that he does not approve of. He barely gives me any money to spend (probably has given me on average like 5 bucks every 2 months -- he hasn't even given me a birthday present or a graduation present or anything), which isn't such a big deal on its own and honestly it may seem like I'm complaining about a first-world problem and sound like a little brat but what makes it awful is that he did not allow my sisters and me to get jobs while each of us were in high school (although with some convincing I managed to get permission to get one near the end of my senior year of high school, but I couldn't find a job all throughout the summer), so basically we all wanted money to spend but he would not let us work nor would he give us money. He's even been known to take money from us that we received from other family members on special occasions, which is why we've learned to hide our money even around our own house.  Also, he makes every decision in the household for both himself and my mother and she plays a very small role in any of those decisions if any at all, even though she is a breadwinner just like he is. He threatens her with physical abuse or raises his voice at her if she doesn't comply with what he chooses to do, and eventually she just gives in like always.  I planned to move into my college dorm (university is in NJ) on the 31st of September to start my freshman year of college. The payment for my first semester costs, including tuition and housing and everything, is due on the 17th of August, and it's not small amount of money that I can pull out of nowhere in 7 days. --------------------------------------  So, over the past few months, things have been getting pretty heated between me and my dad. I don't see him much during the day, but on the occasion that I'd still be awake when he came back from work, we'd usually fight about something, and the fights have been getting more and more frequent.  Tonight, my whole family was in the car on the way back from an event, and he asks me about my roommate, and somehow, like always, one thing leads to another and we're arguing with each other again. He says to me ""Ok, well if this is how it's going to be, then we're not going to be paying for your college. You're on your own."" I told him to stop using the word ""we"" as if my mom had any choice to make in the first place -- I told him to say what he truly meant and use the word ""I"", because everyone knows it's only him that makes any big decision like that ever and speaks on behalf of both my parents. Even though my mom makes her own money, if she wanted to pay for my college fees, she wouldn't be able to because my dad would not allow her -- or at least she feels too threatened to try anything like that. We usually have this argument and it blows over in a few days, except this time I went even further and told him that he basically ruined my life and called him out for physically, mentally, and emotionally abusing me throughout my entire life and doing the same to my mother throughout their entire marriage. This got him especially upset, and as we were coming out of the car, he rushed to the back, clearly very angry, and I knew straight away what he was about to try and do, so I locked the door and punched in 9-1-1 on my phone and showed him. Eventually, I got out of the car safely, but he would not let me back in.   So yeah, after much threatening over the years, my dad had finally kicked me out of the house for the first time ever. I called up one of my friends but by the time he got to my house (about 2 hours ago) my mom told me she wanted me to come in and just say sorry to my dad, but there was no way I was going back inside there, so I just left for a little and my friend and I hungout and I planned to stay over his house for the night like he had offered, but my mom wanted me back home and had convinced my dad to let me stay, so I just went back. And now here I am, typing all of this that literally just happened and my dad's upstairs and things are extremely heated between us and this is the first time that I'm actually legitimately concerned about what's going to happen in my future after a threat from my dad, because our argument tonight actually went way beyond the level that it usually does.  I still have to get a new phone and laptop for college which my dad had promised me, so that's also a problem, because I doubt he's going to be paying for those things any time soon. I'm going to ask my mom to help me out on her own without my dad but I know it's possible she might not agree because she would not even think of going against my dad's word. As I mentioned before, the payment is due on the 17th of August and I do not think between now and then that my dad will change his mind about paying for it, and even if he does, I do not want to remain under his fiscal control like my sisters have all throughout their college years, because they go through hell whenever they want to make a decision about their lives and I don't want to put myself in that situation. I'm completely lost, I have no clue what to do. Please help.  P.S. sorry if there's a lot of useless information in here, I just wanted to put the stuff about my dad because it seemed to me like a lot of it was illegal and it might help. Also, I'm just a complete mess of emotions and my thoughts are running crazy right now."	No
Hey legal helpers, my brother-in-law just moved to the USA a week ago and is approved for his Green Card but we're still waiting for it to be sent along.  In any case, he got unexpected Misdemeanor citation when he was caught swimming at a county quarry by sheriffs in Iowa. Does anyone have any experience in guessing how this could affect his immigration status? His record is very clean excluding this one screw up.  Thank you much for any advice or ideas!	No

"I'm a male student doing an internship for a year, I moved into this new place on the 1st of July with 2 other male interns. I'm just gonna lay out a general overview, give an indication of how much of a weird attitude my landlord has had since we moved in, and then go into why I'm worried he'll evict me.   - Theres 5 interns (all girls, split into 2 flats of 2 girls, and 1 of 1 girl) living in the same block. When we moved in he asked them all if they knew us, and if we were messy boys, straight away, didnt ask if the girls were messy, he already had an incredible bias towards us for no reason.  - The property is a new renovated house split into flats, we were assured it would be 100% done, I visited months ago and there were loads of builders and work was almost done (now its obvious it was just a show to make us think it was almost done), the day we moved in things were JUST being finished. There was a GIANT hole in the back garden, with a huge fire going in it (they were burning plastic, EVERYTHING in it, bad smoke and fumes) for the first 2-3 days when we moved in, fire service had to be called to put it out. - A key point is that the property was advertised with bike storage. I moved up, had my bike with him, and politely asked him if I could store it in the house untill the storage was up (I promised not to use it, keep front wheel off, literally just leave it in a corner of my room not resting against the wall) he was fine with it, have multiple witnesses of him agreeing to it. He also allowed me to move my desk in as theres no desk in my room (again loads of people saw it, and he saw me move it in) - He's yet to give us a third key for a house of 3 people, I don't have a key and have to make sure someone is in or steal their key, after 3 weeks.  - There's no bins (outside waste removal) so he told us to double bag and store waste inside untill bins arrived.   Okay so here’s what happened recently.  - He messaged us saying the key was done and he would drop it off tomorrow, this was last Thursday. - He entered our place and carried a full inspection on the Friday (went into all our rooms), now I don't take saying he'll ""drop a key off' as a notice of inspection. (this was on a Friday, I work long hours from 7:30am to 6pm, my room is usually tidy, and this was the first time he’d inspected, everything else in the place was tidy)  This is what he complained about before saying he'd take it out of our deposits.   - We had bin bags in the kitchen as we couldn’t take it outside or put in garden (its a messy worksite) so the place smelt abit, but was obviously under control.  - My room had some plates in from the night before (no mould, literally had them from the night before) which he claimed were mouldy - I had a pile of clothes in a bag in the corner to wash when I got home  - There was a box of open muffins on the couch from breakfast that morning(yes he complained about that) - I had a pile of packing (plastic wrapping) and some stuff had fallen out of my bin (a yoghurt pot) but no damage to anything, was empty.  - The bike was in my room, not lent against the wall, obviously not used, front wheel off, clean as a whistle (he saw me move it in).  He told me to remove the bike immediately (even after advertising with bike storage, and allowing me it in the house until storage was ready), tidy up, and threatened to take our deposits. I spoke with my housemates and replied that he had no ground to take our deposits, and that I would be speaking to citizen’s advice bureau if he continued. He replied in a very threatening manner, and said things were getting serious now and I would be getting an email from him.  I tidied up, there’s no damage to ANYTHING, I removed the bike (now have an £800 bike tied to a tree in the garden, love it). I sent him a message apologising, and that the place was tidy, he’s ignored my messages. He sent the group chat a message saying he’d drop the key off on Sunday (he didn’t) then he came in on Monday whilst we were at work (loads of signs he did) and didn’t drop key off or say anything. Another thing which is funny, my girlfriend is living in the 1bed flat upstairs, he told her not to come round or talk to “the boys”.   Sorry this is messy, I’ll edit over time."	No
Hi!  I work for a company in Philadelphia. I'm salaried and paid every two weeks. Last pay period the checks were delayed a week and when I received my check I noticed NO taxes were taken out. The amount of the check was for my take home pay. I complained and a few days later the proper check was issued with my salary and taxes taken out to give me the take home pay amount. At the same time, other employees paychecks have bounced. Now, again, my paycheck is delayed.  I want to quit this job and get my owed paycheck, plus the paycheck for the last week I worked.  I plan on quitting today or tomorrow because as of now I've worked three weeks for free and my boss doesn't seem like he's going to pay me.   How can I go about attempting to legally collect my owed pay?	No
"I am from Ohio, I recently took a trip to California to meet a guy online. I'm young and stupid I know. He continuously asked me to come see him and explained he had the money to pay expenses, I have a job and a small amount of savings, but it wasn't in my budget to make a trip so he insisted he would pay.  He wanted me to visit and explained that he would cover the cost for me to get back home, and pay for any expenses while I visited. I have this conversation saved from skype logs. I also state several times that I don't really have the cash to spend on any expenses if I do come, and he said he would pay for everything no problem, accommodations and the flight back, so I agreed.  The day of my flight to California I texted him to confirm that he could still host me, still wanted me to come, and could still afford everything. I even told him if money was an issue for him we could reschedule and I could meet him another time.  I got on my flight, and when I landed and called him he told me his check didn't go through, and that I was on my own. I have his address, his full name, as well as some of his family members added on Facebook.  I have incurred costs from a hotel, as well as a very expensive flight back home 2 days later. I had planned to stay 2 weeks, but since he would not even agree to meet out of embarrassment I decided to leave ASAP.  Could I legally take him to court because he agreed over text and email? I had asked him multiple times, as late as before I even boarded the plane to make sure he still wanted me to come and was able to host me during my stay.   I wouldn't have got on the plane if he had just told me he didn't have the money. I'm incredibly upset by the whole situation and at this point I just want the money back for the 2 nights at the hotel and the flight back home.   Would suing him in small claims be realistic or do verbal or text agreements not hold up in small claims court?   I have him plenty of oppurtunities to speak up and potentially mitigate and costs I would incur but he literally waited until he knew I was on my way. The last text I got before landing was ""are you ok the plane?"" To which I told him I was boarding. I honestly think the guy did it purposefully. Do I have a chance at winning a suit against him if I file? The total cost for the 2 nights and the flight was $976.40."	No
Located in Oregon. Over a year ago I tried to file a restraining order against an ex boyfriend I had recently dumped. I'm going to try to recall exactly what info I gave before, and update on what's progressed since then -- it was denied last time, and I'm pregnant and expecting a daughter, and given his highly inappropriate behavior towards me I want to keep my family safe from him. I have moved twice since then as well.    I also want to state up front I will reference him harassing me on social media a lot -- I want to say I have changed my name multiple times on mediums I can not afford to delete (work purposes), I have made new social media platforms and blocked all his known accounts on all of them and have tweaked all privacy settings to the max. I have *no* public social media any more, strictly reviewed friends lists on all of them, etc. I can't get rid of things like my work email address and he's utilized those too -- like I said, I block him, but he uses different and new accounts to contact me so there's nothing I can do but avoid them. He still finds ways to contact me persistently by making new accounts and tracking my new social media accounts down through known friends and family . For work purposes I kind of have to have the basics like twitter/FB/instagram, but all are privacy locked within an inch of their life and not connected to one another.      This ex was super emotionally abusive to me -- controlling, manipulative, tried to tell me I *couldn't* break up with him, threatening self harm and suicide when he didn't get his way, pressuring me into sex stuff I wasn't comfortable with or into snorting adderal (something I did not like and have never done since.) After months of emotional abuse, it escalated to what I told the court about: He screamed and berated me for about 18 hours while refusing to let me leave my apartment or call anyone, and kept me silent by threatening to tell the police I had marijuana in my possession if I screamed or anything. He threw things at me during this time, told me I was a piece of shit and to kill myself and that I was worthless. I begged him to leave and offered him money for a cab, for a hotel, for gas, anything, and he wouldn't go. He also eventually implied if I had sex with him he'd be on his way, so I did that willingly but not because I wanted to, but I was too scared to tell the police that, or about the pressures to do drugs in the past.     I also told the court that for months following he's been making new accounts and contacting me-- telling me I'm being immature and to talk to him sometimes, other times just adding me with no message at all. I told him repeatedly to stop because he was upsetting and gas lighting me and he just flat out won't. When I tried to file a restraining order, they told me he didn't pose a real threat to me so like sorry he makes you sad but suck it up.    Smash cut to a year later after that rejection. 5 months ago, he found and added a new comment to a BDSM 'contract' he had us make together while we were dating, telling me it was fucking good work and that he was going to use it with his new dom. I told him clearly again to never contact me and to fuck off. He does. Until a few days ago, when he adds me on a new Instagram account, featuring him wearing his fetishwear of choice, womens clothing. The creepiest thing?? In the past week, he's posted photos *I * took of him, or that he took wearing my girly clothing, or in my apartment from years ago while we were dating. He added me. I used the messenger feature and told him he was being gross and to delete the pictures. He basically said they 'mean a lot to him' but that he will (I checked today -- they're still up. Ew.) He also claimed he didn't search out my account, that he 'added all of his contacts' (on his fetish account? sure. Also, I checked, he has 0 new followers /followees, so bullllllshittttt.)     He has stuff on me that would ruin my life it it came out so I can't publicly out his account, as satisfying as it would be. I still rely on my parents for financial and emotional support and he knows things and has evidence of things that I dont want to explain , but that would effectively make them cut me off immediately in every way.    I have been trying to record all interaction we have, and tell people close to me every time it happens . I want to try to file another restraining order -- is there a point, or am I going to get the same hand-wavey answer as before? Should I send a cease + desist? Will that do anything, and how do I do that? I can't afford a lawyer.     I know I sound pathetic and poor and whatever, I just really would like some answers and to not be told I'm overreacting. Thank you.	No
Tx- my husband is telling me that in the next 45 mins he is going to kick me out while pregnant and take off with our son and he does not care that I have nowhere to live and no food which I need to maintain nutrition for our child while in the womb...he says he is going to literally drive me somewhere and kick me out of the car and lock the door. I'm so scared, can I call the cops for this or is this legal for him to do?	No

"TLDR; The Mormon church uses deceptive, dishonest, and manipulative tactics to convince people to join the church and solicit donations.  Can the church be sued (possibly for fraud) to recover donations.  First of all, I realize that this is a complete long shot and probably not feasible given the protections religions enjoy in the U.S.  However, if a company in the U.S. convinces consumers to purchase its products by significantly misrepresenting those products, the company could be guilty of fraud and held responsible accordingly.  I see a corollary with the Mormon church in that it has consistently misled its members about key aspects of the religion which affect the ability of members to make an informed decision on whether or not to donate to the church.  Also, to be clear, these donations are considered obligatory by the Mormon church, the minimum acceptable amount is 10% of income, and members are told that they must pay these donations (tithing) before they pay for rent or even food for their children.  The consequence for not paying tithing is that members cannot go to the temple, which means that they cannot go to super awesome Mormon heaven (Celestial Kingdom) and therefore cannot be with their families after they die.  Some of the things not taught by Mormon church leaders in the past and generally disparaged as anti-Mormon lies include the facts that 1) Joseph Smith translated the Book of Mormon by staring at a rock in a hat, 2) Joseph Smith married other men's wives and teenage girls as young as fourteen, 3) Joseph Smith completely botched the translation of an Egyptian papyrus when writing the Book of Abraham, 4) Joseph Smith told contradictory versions of his First Vision experience, 5) Joseph Smith was incarcerated legitimately based on violations of the law (the church teaches that Joseph Smith was arrested on ""trumped up charges"", 6) Polygamy continued to be practiced even after the church publicly declared that it had ceased to practice polygamy, etc.    The list could continue for quite a while, but the point I want to make is that the church has been very dishonest with members in the past.  Additionally, missionaries provide partial and misinformation to investigators so that they will join the church without understanding it.  As a result, many people joined the church and many members paid tithing who would not have otherwise done so if they were fully informed about the church.  In my mind, this constitutes fraud and it seems like the church's victims should be eligible for restitution.  Incidentally, after many decades of trying to cover up the truth, the Mormon church published some essays a couple years ago that acknowledged the six points listed above as well as other issues (www.mormonessays.com).  Consequently, it is quite simple to demonstrate dishonesty and duplicity by church leaders in the past because they deny the very things acknowledged in the essays.   Given the above information, is there any legal angle that might be reasonably successful in the recovery of donations to the Mormon church?"	No
Good evening,  Apologies if this has been answered already or with a simple google search but I come here because my fiancé and I are in a bit of a weird situation.   My sisters significant other wants to gift us a house for our wedding present but doesn't want to do so for a few years (he said it was until they moved for some reason ). My fiancé and I want to make sure that within these few years prior to being gifted the house that he doesn't turn around and kick us out for any old reason.   Tl;dr : can we have a contract written up where we can live in a house rent free and upon an agreed upon date be gifted the house	No
I just noticed that another website probably copied one of my site's more popular posts (responsible for about 20% of my traffic). Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:  - The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.  - It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective  - This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.  - I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains. This kinda adds insult to injury.  Now since I can't proof anything I don't want to throw around accusations, but it all seems pretty clear to me. I'm placed higher on google, so I doubt I'm losing too much traffic to them because of this, though it may be some, but it's more about the principle. I link to their site because I like their service and recommend it to my readers, and they steal my content and a chunk of traffic.  So, what do you think I can/should do about this?  My first instinct was to write them an email, politely requesting they link to my site since its contents my interest their readers of that particular article, but maybe you have a better idea?  Thanks in advance for your input :-)	No
So I'm signing a lease on a 4 bedroom house with a group of 5 people (myself included). The master bedroom of said house is very spacious and can easily accommodate 2 people. However, the landlord says he wants a max of 4 people living in the house and that 5 people is just too much. My group and I are pretty desperate to find housing before school starts and we don't have many choices left willing to take us. So I told him that there will only be 4 people...signing the lease. I was planning on making a separate contract with the 5th person not on the lease.  Legally, is this possible and could I get away with not telling the landlord that the 5th person is living with us as well or would major problems arise?	No
Hi!  Our wedding is being held out of state in TN in a few months. We would like our friend to officiate the ceremony. I have read that some online ordinations aren't being accepted (Universal Life Church). We plan to use AMM, but was hoping to get a legal opinion as to if this would be valid.   AMM lists the legal info for solomizing a marriage on their website:  https://theamm.org/minister-licensing/tennessee/  Any help is appreciated. Thanks!	No
Does the natural life span of the carpet used count for anything? Carpet normally last 5-7 years and I feel as if they are just using me to pay to replace it. That charged near $1500 dollars for the carpet replacement of a 800 sq ft apartment in a average sized city in Oregon.   They failed to acknowledge my 300 dollar cat deposit I signed for and paid as well when they charged me.  I PAID a 750 dollar deposit I PAID a 300 dollar pet deposit  That are charging me 1500 and only taking in account our deposit not the pet deposit That seem to have conveniently forgot that.    Is there anything I can do in this situation to make stop them from charging is the full amount?	No
"He and his roommate don't really get along; he told me signed an agreement that he would pay to live there on a month to month basis. the roommate deals with the landlord and he deals with the roommate as his ""landlord"".  Well, long story short, they end up not liking each other and the roommate now tells my friend he has a couple of days to get out and find a new place. She's asking for him to get out and give him the keys to his room. Even threatening to change the locks and call the cops. As far as I know; my friend has been up to date with rent. Is this legal? My friends working right now and he's scared he's going to go home any not be able to get in with the keys he has? What can he do then?   Call the cops and tell him the situation, can he sue for being thrown out of his apartment? He's a good guy; I have no reason to believe he did anything terrible that warranted him being kicked out so quick. But then again I don't know the whole story"	No
Before moving in to our new house my brother had agreed to pay rent of 400 dollars a month. We gave him 2 free months as courtesy for doing some move work and minor housework at the new and old house and so far he has only paid for the months of March and April. He is now behind 3 months and says he will pay rent after a long discussion but now I do not feel comfortable with him being around more than ever because his temperament has only gotten worse since our discussion.  Even if he does pay what steps must I take to properly evict him and just to soothe my paranoia, what can I do if things get violent without being on the wrong side of the law.  Also just to highlight my frustration he is 35 and I am 25 but has the temperament of a 12 year old.	No
My step-daughter and wife signed a lease in February of 2017 in order to reserve a spot for her for the Fall of this year. Some shit happened, and it isn't in her best interest to go back to school there so she won't even be living in that city or going to school there.     The apartment complex is telling her that she is responsible for re-letting the apartment and if she does not, she is still responsible for the monthly rent, and thus me and my wife as well.    I haven't seen the lease yet, but am working on getting a copy. Is there anyway out of this thing? She never took possession.	No
Imagine that you are a volunteer premed working in a free clinic that serves a large immigrant population. Your duties include taking the patients’ medical history. Today you are working with an elderly patient who does not speak English and the adult son is translating for his mother. You notice that he is answering many of the questions for her without translating. During the conversation, the son tells you that if his mother has cancer he does not want her to know because the news “will kill her”. He says that in his family he speaks for the elderly mother and does not want a translator. How will you approach this situation?	No
Location: Indiana, Ohio, Kentucky, and maybe Florida  Background: When my 2nd? cousin went to apply for a credit card, we found they had a number of loans in default from several years ago when they were under 18. We're about 90% sure their biological father stole their identity and have already filed a police report and they frozen their credit. They're on their way back to some semblance of normalcy, but the new issue is they have a large number of half siblings from their biological father, my shitty cousin. We aren't entirely sure how many, but my uncle, his dad, had met 17 of them, though relatives estimate around 25 to 30 altogether scattered through various states.  Problem: We realized if my cousin had stolen his oldest child's identity, it was likely he had done so to his other children as well. Unfortunately, as none of the others lived in that town, there was nothing the police could do to help. He works under the table to dodge child support, and can only be reached at a PO box in Indianapolis. Unfortunately, he would only respond to his dad. (After walking out on his family, he made it clear he wouldn't be around them. We decided to keep inviting them and he never forgave us for wronging him so horribly, but his dad was out of the picture at the time) Unfortunately, his dad was recently arrested  for selling meth and decided to skip town on bail.  Is there any way we could try to track down the other kids to let the mothers know to check? I know this whole thing sounds absurd, and quite frankly I would rather not air out family laundry online, but it would be inexcusable to allow him to rob his kids.	No
That is California, not Canada.  I purchased my condo about 4 years ago and I've been consistently receiving first-class mail addressed to what is apparently a business the previous owner ran. I usually tossed them but opened a few out of curiosity and they apparently owe import taxes to the state.  I've sent the agency emails stating it's the old resident and in fact, a quick google easily finds their new address. I've also called and left a message stating the same yet the letters keep coming and today, I received a certified letter (addressed to their business name with my address) which I rejected.  Is there the possibility they'll place a lien on my property? Or anything else? Or am I ok to continue ignoring the notices? Thank you.	No
What should i do about this?  I got pulled over doing 100 mph in a 65 mph zone in New jersey.   I'm 17 years old.   I have court in 6 days ON MY BIRTHDAY. Fuck my life.	No
I'm a university student who will be living off-campus for the first time; I am signing a lease for an apartment with some of my friends (we are all going to be on separate leases, just living in the same apartment). I have looked through the lease pretty carefully and I'm pretty content with all the terms. I have not heard anything bad about the management from friends who have previously lived in the complex, so I am not worried that they will try to screw me over at all.  I am just coming here looking for advice on what to expect, what my rights as a tenant are, and whether there is anything specific I should do before signing and moving in. Thanks!  Location is Indiana.	No
"I am in awe that there is a subreddit for legal advice. August 1st will mark a year since I've seen my daughter. Her mother for no reason other than to hurt me stopped ""letting"" me see my daughter. We have never been to court for custody or child support and I am not concerned with having to pay child support. My daughter is now 6, ive missed her birthday Christmas thanksgiving first say of school!!! Easter Halloween new years everything. I've texted and pleaded with her mother to try and co parent with me. Ive asked Her several times why she is doing this and I've never gotten a reply. The only reply I've ever gotten is her telling me if I want to see my daughter I had to pay the last few months of child support which was 5 months after my ex stopped letting me see her. I live in Georgia, sorry I know I should mention that. I could keep on literally all night long but I have always done everything I could for my daughter. I've been employed the entire time, always split everything with my ex, took my daughter to school (picked up daughter from ex's house and took her to daycare) every morning, she stayed with me on the weekends and some nights during the week. My daughter and I were so close it absolutely wrecks me to think that maybe she thinks I'm not there because I don't love her. I have no idea what she's been telling my daughter but my daughter and I love each other more than anything in the world. She made me promise I wouldn't leave her there and I would come back the last time I saw her. I have not been able to be myself for a year now, such a huge part of my life and heart missing. Thank you so much for any advice I have been lost about this and have always hoped her mother would stop doing this. can anyone tell me what I need to do and how it would go? Thank you so much!!"	No
8 block complex served by 4 garages. Towed within an hour of being there. They have a sign that says have to go to some of the restaurants to get a parking validation immediately and only valid for 3 hours.  Went to a different restaurant first and then was going to get drinks at the one next door on the list. Apparently I was followed by someone and then they towed.  My argument would be immediately isn't defined in terms of time. Walking from the farthest garage to the farthest restaurant takes 20 minutes in the complex. Gonna try to get a hearing in front of justice of the peace to file a dispute on the tow using immediately as not a time. Think I have a chance?	No
Not sure what to do. He was supposed to drop off the keys to me yesterday, and instead texted me that he would be returning my deposit because his partners had decided to sell the house and they are now in escrow. I mentioned legal action, which I cannot afford, and he didn't care and told me not to threaten him. On Tuesday I will now be homeless with an entire apartment worth of stuff with no plave to go. What is my best option here?	No
"My girlfriend and I moved into our new place last weekend, and we had the movers before we had the key.  It was agreed between all parties that the unit would be suitable for move-in on 7/7.  When we obtained the key, we immediately realized that the entire apartment smelled of smoke, the hardwood floors were covered with dirt, the carpet was filthy, the dishwasher was falling out of the carpentry, there was rat feces behind the fridge and on the back of the fridge, the bathroom sink was broken, there was mold on the ceiling of the living room and bathroom, and the piping for the tub needed to be replaced (this was not found out until the next day).  Since we were in a hurry, we did not get a copy of our lease.  And since the movers had arrived and were being paid by the hour, we started moving items into a dirty apartment.  When we went into the office, we are told that we cannot look at any lease until the Apartment Manager returns from vacation (next tuesday).  This is our first issue about the situation.  A plumber came last night and opened the walls to see that there was a non-lethal methane leak that was taking place and that the pipes from the top down needed to be replaced.  The lady quoted the maintenance guy for $500, and the leasing office refused to pay the amount; they stated that they could fix it themselves.  We went up to the office within 3 days after moving in to request to terminate the lease and the lady behind the counter chuckled at my girlfriend and replied with a sarcastic, ""mmmkay"".    I realize that we made some serious poor decisions, but I want to know what my best moves would be here.  Thank you in advance for your assistance."	No
When looking for car insurance recently I decided to see if using slightly different descriptions of my profession impacted the quotes the companies gave me online. It did, but I noticed that after getting a few quotes my quotes increased, even when the information I provided remained constant. This lead me to suspect that the companies I was recieving quotes from are using information from the cookies on my browser to increase their quotes for insurance... Is this even legal? I am in the EU if that helps...	No
Hello,  So today my 11 year old daughter came in upset with a paper notice from the office that included at the bottom in bold that minors under the age of 16 were not allowed in the common areas without parental supervision.   I was able to turn up some websites that say this is a no-no (per the Federal Fair Housing Act) but no solid case information that I could cite to the office.   I've already called HUD and the WA State Fair Housing Commission as well as the corporate office of these apartments.   The manager claimed she had taken fair housing classes and that this was totally legal, but it smells like bullshit to me.   Outside of the fact that my kids like the outside more than me or my wife, and that we're not helicopter parents, is there anything we can do here?	No
I just got home today, and there was a letter wedged in my screen door that had a bunch of information on it describing our termination of tenancy. The thing is, my house isn't rented, we bought the house, and the name that the letter was directed to wasn't ours, although it was our address. Is this a scam? Should i just ignore it?	No
One of my roommates is moving out on August 5th. She hasn't been the most courteous person through the leaving process. A few days ago, we got the utility/internet bill and everyone was told their money was due yesterday so I can pay the bill on time. The roommate in question hasn't paid yet and hasn't answered my texts following up.   I can't cut her off from utilities, but it's not illegal in my state to cut her from from internet. If she isn't paying her share, it's stealing, and I don't want that. The internet is in my name only, so no issues cutting her off from that perspective, whether that be changing the wifi password, blacklisting her devices via MAC, etc. However, the router currently being used is hers. This is where I fear any kind of legal complications. Am I subject to any legal ramification if I change the wifi password? It's my internet, but her router.  Due to budgeting, I can't afford to buy a new router until she moves out, so buying a new one isn't an immediate option.	No
A few weeks ago I bought something online.  The seller hasn't shipped and refuses to refund.  It it extortion if I tell the seller I will call my bank and do a chargeback if they don't ship or refund by a specific date and time?	No
"A few weeks ago my wife went to the mechanical room in the basement of our condo and found a water line spraying water everywhere.  She shut of the source but by then a good portion of the basement had about an inch of water.  We have damage to carpet and door trim.   I was out of town but I called the property manager and he had a restoration company.   They immediately came out and dried out the basement.  When I came home I looked at the situation and could easily see that the water feed to the refrigerator had chew marks on it.  Obviously my cat had been chewing on the small plastic line and probably got the scare of her life when it burst.    The property manager has been managing the damage and repairs.  I spoke with my insurance company and they confirmed that this would be covered under the Condo Corporations insurance.  This is where it gets a bit complicated.    The total for repairs is around $4,500 and the deductible for the Condo insurance is $5,000.  The restoration company has listed the cause of the failure as a leak in the supply line to the refrigerator.  I have my own home owners insurance which has extra ""Additional Coverage, Contingent Insurance and Special Assessment coverage's""  I informed my insurance company that I would be getting an assessment from the Condo Corporation for $4,500 and they responded with:  ""The bylaw says: ‘In the event a claim is made under any insurance policy of the Corporation and the Board, in its sole discretion and acting reasonably, determines that the Owner (or members of his family, his tenants or members of their families, his invitees, contractors or licensees) is responsible for the loss or damage that gave rise to the claim, the Corporation may recover the deductible portion of the claim refund from that Owner and such amount shall be recoverable by the Corporation as a contribution due to the Corporation from the Owner for the amount of the deductible and all costs, charges and liabilities associated therewith, and with the collection thereof, incurred by the Corporation.”     For AB condo claims, when a unit owner is “responsible’ for a loss, it means the loss  is due to the  owner’s act or omission.  This condo was built in 2016 and pipe that leads to fridge ruptured. We don’t see that it is your responsibility at this time but please forward us the assessment that you get from the Condo Corp and we will discuss how we will respond.""  Should I inform my insurance company that this was the fault of a cat or push the Condo Corporation to pay the $4,500?"	No
I've lived here for over a year, and I've been paying 2100 every month without fail. Recently I came home to find notice of foreclosure. I called my landlord, john* and asked what was going on. John told me he let the property go off, and has not paid the mortgage for at least six months. What can I do about this? Can I get all my rent back? What is the process of foreclosure when you're renting? I've no idea what to do next.  (LI, NY)	No
Hello, Sorry if this is in the wrong location and hopefully its not too long winded.  I recently purchased a condo in Mid June in St. Louis County Missouri.  I was aware from the previous owner that our decks were being replaced by the Condo Association sometime this summer.  I received A letter approximately 2 weeks ago which states the following:  &gt;Dear Homeowners, &gt;The Board of Directors would like to notify everyone in Buildings *** and *** that the deck replacement will begin Monday, August 7, 2017, weather permitting.  We ask that everything be removed and stored inside your unit during this time.  Thank you in advance for your patience as we complete this building improvement.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact our office.  My deck was taken off on the 7th (though is not yet complete).  When I was speaking with my neighbor they informed me that the last time the decks were replaced they were required to pay for the top boards and the price would be ~300 - $500.  Should this be true, I never received any information on any replacement cost either from the previous owner (whom I have spoken with and they were unaware of the cost) nor in written / verbal form in the information that I was provided from the condo association when I moved in.    My question is, do I have to pay for this?  What course of action do I have for this as its an unexpected cost that I could pay for but I'd rather not if I don't have to.    Thanks for reading!	No
I revceived a phonecall yesterday about a $72.97 charge for a water bill from a complex I lived at back in 2010. I had to break the lease but paid the appropriate fees to do so and never heard anything since. The date on the statement they emailed to me (upon my request) is dated 10/25/2010. It's my understanding that statute of limitations in GA is 6 years for things like this.   First, am I correct in the notion that they are too late to collect on a water bill regardless of if was valid at the time or not? I've got no way to verify this amount that I know of.  Secondly, if they are too late, how do I go about clearing this with the CA and the credit bureau?	No
I am writing a memoir and doing my best to prevent any sort of defamation of character accusations before I send a chapter of my book to an online publisher. The people I am writing about include the two multimillionaire business owners (one had since passed away, one is the head of a largely recognizable brand) and a person in academia involved in highly unethical practices.   I have already read about the legal topic and done things like change names, stick to facts, not opinions, and stay in my own point of view, not jump to what another person felt or was thinking.  I have emails and articles to backup that what I am saying is true. However, for my own peace of mind, I would like a lawyer to read my chapter and suggest to me if any edits need to be made to further protect myself.   I do not have a lot of money, (less than $1000 in the bank). Is this something that I might be able to get a pro bono consultation for? Where would be the best place to look for a lawyer that would review my chapter? Does it make a difference if I look for someone who specializes in whistleblower law, literary/creative arts law, or first amendment law?  I am 60 minutes from Chicago, if it makes a difference. Thank you in advance for your help.	No
I signed a lease for a place which had a broken floor in the closet, but the landlord stated that it would be fixed by the move in (date X). I came in about 5 days after X with some of my stuff, but the floor hadn't been fixed.  I asked the landlord to get it fixed, which was done about 9 days after X. I asked the landlord for the refund for the 9 days, but the landlord now wants me to move out before the month end instead.  He's offering full refund, but at this point, finding another place and moving into it is difficult. Do I have any other options?	No
My sister passed away recently under some pretty bothersome circumstances, and my family is in the midst of a lawsuit-turned-settlement regarding the case. Everything is about to be finalized, but we were recently notified that my father is legally entitled to inquire about his potential share of the settlement.  My father is a deadbeat. He has had **zero** contact with my family for at least 15 years. Even with the advent of social media, he's never made any attempt to contact any of us via email, Facebook, etc. He never paid child support and owes tens of thousands of dollars. He's been to jail multiple times over this. When my sister passed, he never made any attempt to contact us and get details surrounding the circumstances. He didn't show any interest or concern over the situation.   Emotional stuff aside, I can't imagine how he'd be entitled to any money. My mother is the sole executor of my sister's estate, and literally every single part of this legal process has been under her discretion and supervision. My father's name is attached to absolutely **nothing** related to this lawsuit, my sister, and this family at this point.	No
My family were refugees. Vietnamese boat people. We stayed in a refugee camp in Hong Kong until we were accepted to the United States in 1994. Now we are proud citizens, truly living the American dream. Along the way her paperwork all showed a different age. It started from the beginning when we first left Vietnam. She doesn't remember much of the details of what caused the error on her paperwork but since it was already processed, she just wanted to move along. Now, it is starting to be a problem because she is getting older and should be retiring soon but her paperwork says she is younger than she really is. Therefore this is affecting her retirement as well as ability to work according to her false age. Is this something that a lawyer can fix? Thank you everybody!	No
"I found a place I could live in on the 25th of Jul.  I gave a deposit of one month's rent (+$5) for landlady to give me right of first refusal, returnable if I don't get the place.  Due to several delays on her part I am unable to move in until 9 Aug.  On 9 Aug I pay her first and last month's rent in addition to security already paid.  She gives me keys.  She requests I move in at night so the neighbors don't see.  This morning she tells me it's not going to work out and I need to get the things I have in there out and give her back the keys and she will give me back all of my money.  This evening I emptied my stuff from the apartment and hand her keys as she hands me cash.  As I am counting it out she says ""Oh your security deposit is in escrow and I will get it for you on Monday.""  I had her sign an IOU for the month's rent, plus money I spent on cleaning the carpet.  If she does not come up with the cash on Monday what should my next steps be?"	No
Hello everyone,  Long time lurker (on other accounts), first time poster here.  I live in a building that has developed a substantial mold problem. We've contacted our landlord but the repairs they've provided have not been sufficient.  My roommates and I have tested the mold ourselves (DIY kit via Amazon) and confirmed dangerous spores in our apartment.  I'm looking for recommendations on organizations to contact and get some student lawyers to assist me in this case and do some work with the landlord and company on my behalf. If it's not pro-bono, ok fine, but I just need to be pointed in the right direction.  There are websites I've found initially, but I don't really know what to trust (I've never had to do any kind of legal battling myself). Like [Lawyer's Committee For Better Housing](http://lcbh.org/) and [Center for Renter's Rights](https://www.renters-rights.com/chicago/). (Any advice related to these sites would be helpful).  If you'd like additional details regarding the situation, I will provide what I can. Thank you for your time.	No
I have lived my house in downtown San Jose for nearly a year. My friend was the lease holder but is moving out and is helping one of my roommates acquire the new lease. We have a really good deal.  She does not want me living in the house for the next year and wants me gone. Mainly because I have a dog and use the garage (I pay for both). I don't make very much money and cant afford anything close in the area. To make matters worse I am hoping to start a new full time, better pay job very soon. Is there ANYTHING I can do? Please let me know. I no longer have a home base to go back to and don't have very much money.	No
"Hi there, my friend recently purchased ""African Black Soap"" from Shea Butter. She followed the directions for using the soap and it caused her to have chemical burns. She has been treated by a doctor who indeed said they are chemical burns. The ingredients seem to be a lie as well. Is there a lawsuit here? If so what is it?"	No
"My parents were married for over 10 years, but have been divorced now for almost 15. Recently my father was hospitalized and somehow my mother found out about it, came to the hospital and present herself as his ""wife"". She still uses his last name.   This caused some confusion as I was already there making decisions. I am his oldest child and his next immediate next of kin. Once I found out what she was doing I asked her to leave and requested the hospital not allow her back in but this has gotten me to thinking- how can I prevent this from happening in the future? Do I need to carry a copy of their divorce decree with me at all times? Is there something similar to a will my dad needs to have done clarifying that I'm his next of kin? He doesn't have a will now, and doesn't really have any assets to speak of, which is why I think he's never taken care of getting one."	No
Hello. The company I work for requires a yearly hands-on competency test. This year, they have mandated that if you miss your testing time, and don’t give 24 hour notice, you will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction. Obviously, it is illegal for an employer to deduct wages without approval; however, my employer seems to think they’ve found a way around that. There is an online test that you must take beforehand, in which 100% is required. The very first question is along the lines of, “I agree that if I miss my hands-on test, I will be penalized a $50 payroll deduction”. To me, this sounds as though they are forcing you to agree to a payroll deduction in order for you to stay employed. Is this legal? If not, any advice on how to approach management with my concern? I do not want to agree to this, as I can think of multiple scenarios where I may have to miss my test, and be unable to give 24 hours notice. Thank you for your help.	No
I'm posting this on behalf of my girlfriend to find some answers. My girlfriend (23) is a single mother of a 3 (almost 4) year old. Her daughters father went to prison a few months before she was born (Child Sex Offender). He's now being released fairly early cause of a new law in California to let non-violent criminals out, something along those lines. My girlfriend didn't look for any government assistance or legal help during these 4 years. She's received no financial support from her baby daddy or his family and raised her daughter on her own with help from her own family. The father isn't even on the birth certificate.   It's tough for her right now. She has 2 jobs but doesn't make nearly as  close to what she needs. Her parents don't financially assist her aside from helping her pay for insurance. Now her baby daddy's family is buying him a house and car when he gets out of prison. She freaking out cause she has a car payment, credit card payment, rent, etc. while trying to support her daughter working minimum wage at 1 job and works event scheduling at the other. So fairly inconsistent.   I always tried pushing her to find legal advice, but she terrible looking for help, especially with this situation. Her baby daddy's mom promised to send money her way for support but never did. Now with him getting out of prison, she wants to take action against him. I can go a bit more in depth if needed.	No
I'm in New York, and live in an HOA (home owners association) that has a clause in the CC&amp;R that disputes are to be resolved through arbitration. So I filed a claim, but the other party was able to halt the arbitration process by simply refusing to cooperate in the arbitration and not pay the initial deposits.  It seems that my legal recourse is to pursue litigation, and part of me is wondering if I should have just pursued litigation as opposed to arbitration to begin with. I'm now out the few thousand dollars it costs to initiate arbitration, whereas litigation costs under $100 (I'm representing myself).  I'm thinking that next time I should just start with litigation.

"My roommate and I are interns in VA. We signed a 3-month lease for May 25-Aug 25, and our lease says   &gt;""If your current lease expires and no renewal or extension more than three months has been signed, then you will be considered as being on a 60-day option. The rent during the option period will be current MTM rate for the apartment.""  Today I realized we haven't provided a move-out notice. I immediately went to  the office and submitted a notice, but I'm curious if there are any avenues we can take to escape the extra charges since we didn't receive a reminder to renew/terminate our lease. The manager said that they typically provide courtesy reminders 3 months out, but she admitted that we fell through the cracks because we signed a 3 month lease.  I have another question.  I asked the manager for a move-out checklist. She casually mentioned that there is no list and that we ""just need to clean the apartment"". When I pressed her about ""clean""--specifically if I had to clean the carpets--she admitted that we need to have the carpets professionally cleaned and provide a receipt. I cannot clean the carpets myself.  Am I legally obligated to professionally clean the carpets? The lease does not require professional cleaning.   This really frustrates me because the previous cleaners clearly weren't that professional: I've found several strands of long hair in my room and the living room. Neither my roommate nor I have pets or wear shoes into the spartan unit (air mattresses are our biggest pieces of furniture), so I'd really like to avoid a professional cleaning.  Thanks"	No
Hi!  Our lease renewal is coming up in less than 3 weeks. We want to stay in the apartment as it's well located and nice. We contacted the landlord recently about renewing the lease and she's responded that the rent would increase by $180 (9% increase). The apartment is in California.  My understanding is that a landlord as to provide a 30 days notice before a rent increase of less than 10%, 60 days notice otherwise. Does that also apply in the case of a lease renewal coming up? Can I do anything to pay the new price later than 3 weeks from now?  Ideally I would like to reduce the increase, can we use this in our favor?  Thanks!	No
I finally moved out from the apartment and all my belongings were safe and sound. Before the move out period, however, she made some insults and neglected her duty of keeping the place clean.   She's asking me about $500 for the extra week's stay, $150 for the labor for installation, and electricity bill that came when she specified that previous one was the last one I had to pay.  Now, none of these were written on the paper and I don't think I am legally required to make these payments. She still hasn't apologized and what not. Should I just move on with my life and not pay her a cent? (I did pay for the door cost and transportation for the door)  She originally tried to rip me off by adding personal purchases onto the recipt and overcharging the whole cost and now she's down to all minimums.	No
Hi everyone, I (22f) have a question on how my husband and i should handle child support. So my husband is the military and we stationed in VA, he was recently contacted by social services about a former girlfriend who claims to have had his kid. Now we haven't done a paternity test yet, (we will have one done in about 2wks), but we are 98% the kid is his due to timing. So since we are pretty sure, my husband contacted the woman and spoke to her and discussed what it is she wanted for support and they both agreed to a few terms once the paternity test is completed and positive. So here is my question. The kid and mom are in TN and we are in VA, how do we go about through the court systems to sign something that states what we have agreed on since we are in different states?	No
So the shower was accidentally left on, which wouldn't be a problem because no matter how much water the shower put out, it should always just go down the drain anyway… Except the drain was blocked in the apartment. So the entire apartment ended up flooding, costing a couple hundred to have it dried out due to the flood. Since I didn't block the drain up, can I hold the apartment complex liable for this damage? Can I sue in small claims?	No
"Hey there!  I moved out of my house in Atlanta about 2 months ago and just received the security deposit back. My three room mates gave me their portion ($500) and I wrote the check. During the year that we lived there one of the room mates stole a large amount of items from the rest of us, both personal items and house hold consumables we bought, even after we would confront them (at least 10 times). Upon receiving the deposit the rest of us decided not to fully refund their portion of the deposit. I have moved out of the city and they are now threatening to sue me. I think the likelihood of them actually doing that is very low, but i just wanted to see legally if they had a case.  In the moveout agreement it says, "" all parties agree the deposit will be refunded to (redacted) as she wrote the deposit check. And she is responsible to disburse accordingly.""  Thanks in advance for the help! If you need any other details feel free to ask."	No
"Roommates and I moved out and the landlord is asking for money for repairs to damages because the deposit we provided prior to move in is ""not enough"". Are we legally obligated to pay her the deficit? Below is the list she compiled and she is claiming that we owe her ~500. Do we need to pay her for the cleaning and wear and tear that she listed? We live in the state of CA. She charged us 1600 in the beginning, how are we supposed to know what 1600 covers and that the damages she's claiming are worth $470?

My ex husband will be paying me child support starting next month. I am trying to do some long range planning to see if it is feasible to stay in my current residence.   This year my CCTB payments are $1800 a month. When it comes to file next year will I include the child support payments as part of my i come to calculate my payments?    Thanks for any advice or answer. 	No
I'm renting an apartment through a management company. The least list my name, the agent's name of the management company, and the independent owner of the property (I guess the company manages properties for clients who own them). However, only me and the agent has sign, and this concludes the contract according to the agent. Should I ask the agent to ask the landlord to sign before I send in the deposit, or is it standard for only the agent to sign?	No
My dad abused me to the point where I had so much adrenaline pumped I could barely even feel the physical pain with household items used as weapons against me. I don't think I need to go into the details, but this was in a country with basically non existent child protection laws and I decided not to go to the embassy on the basis that it would be better to request aid in Canada.(and I was too scared to)  The abuse hasn't happened after a bit more than a week of being in Canada, but is there anything I can/should legally do? I don't want to mess up anyone's life, but since he's betrayed my trust so many times and significantly affected me, I don't want him to go unpunished.  Yes, I am under his(and my mother's) custody and I am living with them.	No
I want to make a clothing company that my get me into legal trouble and was wondering if I could be sued or if I'm fine. For example the company supreme has a plain white shirt that says supreme within a box, would I get in legal trouble if I made a similar shirt that said sub-par? The reason I think I will get in trouble is because The North Face company sued a company called the South Butt and switch their sign. So I just want to know if they would be able to sued?	No
"My older sister has always had mood and mental troubles, but they are getting steadily worse as she ages. I'm getting very, very worried about her and I think it's time to step in with her common-law spouse and get her help (whether she agrees to it or not). She has a small child (age 4) in her care to worry about, as well.  Some of the things going on with her: 1. She thinks I call up her sister in law and brag about how I tell everyone that she didn't breastfeed her kid, that her and her partners are only common-law and not officially married, and that she's a cam girl. I have never met this person and I have no idea how to get into contact with her. 2. She thinks there are cameras and microphones in her home, placed by her in laws to spy on her. 3. She sits around all day looking at people's social media profiles, applying make up, and taking selfies. 4. She picks at zits until she tears up her skin and scars herself. She bleaches, dyes, bleaches, and dyes her hair until it's fried. 5. She stopped speaking to me before the birth of her second child (the 4 year old) because I casually asked her about her birth plan and she formed a delusion that I was going to send social services to the hospital to take her baby. 6. She ruined her relationship with her common law spouse, and blames it on him ""being into trannies."" 7. She has a certificate in assisting in a health field, but refuses to work. She insists she needs more certifications to make more money. When she interned in her field, she posted on social media about how disgusting the patients were. 8. She thinks everyone is jealous of her, out to get her, and constantly talking about her. 9. She thinks a guy she romantically rejected in high school (as in 20 years ago) installed a key logger on her computer to spy on her for revenge.  She lives in a different state than me (Colorado) and is not communicating with me after her last aggressive, delusional episode. How can I get her to a psychiatrist or in for an involuntary psychiatric hold (if that's what it takes)?  tl;dr: My older sister in Colorado is delusional and has a small child in her care. I might need to force psychiatric help on her. How?"	No
Moved into a new house this past weekend. Noticed that the bathroom mirror to the 1st floor bathroom and 2nd floor bathroom were taken. Called the seller and she says that because they're decorative, she had a right to take them. Also noticed a couple wall light fixtures missing. What do I do? Do I take her to small claims court? Nothing in the sales contract mentions her taking the mirrors or light fixtures . Are bathroom mirrors considered decorative?	No
Hi there. Me and my two roommates live with our landlord. The lease states that we are to divide all utility bills evenly BUT, there recently has been a piping leak that has caused the gas bill to skyrocket. The landlord wanted us to split that very high bill but me and my two other roommates refused because it does not seem fair to be penalized for faulty piping and house infrastructure. The landlord has now contracted plumbers to fix the issue but gave no warning on how long the repairs would take and that we would have no running water or working toilets. She has made the house a hostile environment and my roommates and I want out of the lease. Is there any way this can be done?	No
"I'm considering suing my doctor for medical malpractice. This doctor works out of  ""Clinic Name LLC.""  What do I need to know in regards to the LLC at the end of the clinic name? Does this mean I cannot sue him for malpractice or is he protected from lawsuits because he works at this clinic?"	No
"I previously made a /advice thread a few weeks ago asking how to approach this situation.  Background info:  We moved in to a new construction home in May. Our next door neighbors have been in their home for around two years. They have a split rail fence along the property line. We had the builder include a split rail fence around our property as part of the purchase of our home. The builder connected our fence to the existing fence our neighbor has on our shared property line.  We received an email several weeks ago from our neighbors asking us to pay a half portion of the cost of the fence they have had up for two years (the part of the fence we are sharing). They are asking for $625.50.  As suggested in the /advice thread, we responded to the neighbors stating that we would not be retroactively paying for the cost of the shared portion of the fence.  We would however contribute to 50% of any maintenance and repairs.  We wrote a super friendly email.  Fast forward to today, and we receive a super passive aggressive email from the neighbors:  *Thanks for the disappointing reply about the cost sharing. The argument of an established structure ""for quite some time"" is without basis. All of the construction here is new, and per the covenants, fencing should be completed within 6 months of move in. That pretty much dictates that the first people here have to get the job done and work with the adjoining neighbors once they arrive. Our landscaping was done last September, which isn’t exactly “quite some time” ago. The point is, you are benefiting from the fence now and you own some responsibility for the expense. When you enclose your property in part by utilizing another's fence, that is on the shared property line, you are expected to reimburse the neighbor for half of the expense for the part you are using. That does include future maintenance as well. There are a couple of Colorado Statutes that speak to the concept. Would you mind if we removed our shared section? That could create some liability for you given your deep uncovered window wells. We were not part of your negotiations with the builder and can only look to you as the owners benefitting from the fence. Certainly, Builder only charged you for the actual linear feet that they installed. They have nothing to do with our shared linear footage. You have every right to ask the people behind you to contribute half of what you paid Builder, directly or indirectly, for that common fence. No one can force you to do the right thing even if it does come at the expense of having good relationships with the people within this wonderful neighborhood. Hopefully, we can discuss further.*  So my questions: 1. Do such statutes that she referenced actually exist?  I can't find any. 2. If so, is our neighbor right, and do we have to pay? 3. What did we do in our former lives to deserve this person as a neighbor? 4. What would you do?  We don't want them throwing antifreeze tainted meat at our dog.  Thanks for reading this far, and I appreciate any advice that you might have!"	No
"Quick summary because this has a long explanation: I was not paid for 20+ hours of work for a restaurant, under the guise of it being a ""working interview.""  I live in VA.  Is this legal?  It's been one year since the interview happened, is it too late to do anything about it?   BACKGROUND:  Last year, I had interest in applying to a local (and highly praised) burger shop, just working in the kitchen making burgers, cleaning tables, etc.  The people that own this shop also own an extremely popular fancy restaurant.  I'm serious.  Everything that comes out of that kitchen looks like food porn.  All the people that eat there take pictures of their food when it comes out. And it's crazy expensive, all produce they use is local and they change their menu all the time based on what is available during the season or whatever.  So anyways, I am told that I have to complete 2 ""working"" interviews for these sister restaurants.  One at the burger place, one at the fancy place.  Each one had different tasks, for example the burger place did things I described earlier whereas fancy restaurant involved bussing tables, sorting silverware, etc.  Also, as you can probably tell, the fancy restaurant was a much more stressful environment and all the people that work there are pretty much professional chefs or adults.  There were a few other teens, (I was 16 at this time), but being surrounded by all these people was definitely intimidating.  More so than the laid back but still busy burger shop.  Right.  So I finish my working interview at burger shop.  I worked open to close, roughly 10 hours.  I completed the exact amount of work as the other people working that day, and was probably working 10x harder than them, considering the whole point was to demonstrate how well I worked, so I wanted to do a good job.  End of the day, I don't get paid except for splitting tips, which probably amounted to around $7.  The manager of burger shop tells me I will most likely be hired but it is ultimately up to people who own both places to decide.  I then work another ~10 hour shift at the fancy restaurant.  Now, people working here (well at the position I was applying for) are bussing tables and thus get paid below minimum wage but split tips to compensate, and with each table having bills averaging over $300, this adds up relatively well.  I did not get paid this day either, but they added me on to a list of other people bussing that night, so I assumed I would get the same tips they did? Never got those either.  Figured maybe after I was officially hired I would get them.  The end of the day, the chefs at the restaurant give me a mini interview, said I worked well, and they would give me a call.  They also said that they are known to be lazy and not call people and they ""like to see persistance"" i.e. me calling them and pestering them to give me the job if they don't call me within a week. Eye roll.  I'd like to add that this was not a competitive interview, I performed extremely well and wasn't competing against anyone else for the position.  These people literally just could not be bothered to call me.  They wanted to see me reach out. Also, I was applying to burger shop, but they had me work at both places because (very rarely) they will have people that typically work at one place work the other for a shift depending on scheduling and such.  So the fact that I worked 20+ hours with no pay is extremely annoying to me and I almost feel like that place just uses it to get free labor out of people which is off-putting considering how successful the business is and it almost seems like a bullying situation(for lack of better way to describe it.).  I ended up trying to contact the owners of the restaurant like told to (said to text her) and I didn't even get any reply, which I thought was rude.  If I didn't get the job, at least tell me.  At that point I stopped bothering to reach out just due to how disgusted I was by the people that ran the business.  I looked up if working interviews are legal in VA and from what I can tell you're required to be paid.  I would've pressed the matter if I had known this, but I was so excited at the prospects of a new job for this successful place that I sort of overlooked it.  Now, one year has gone by and I am actually kind of salty and realize how ""abusive"" they were. I feel taken advantage of. The problem is, it's one year later.  Am i too late to try and get any payment out of this? I feel stupid for not doing anything about it sooner but was wondering if I can now."	No
Landlord did a last inspection before we move out on September first and said that damage to the bathroom floor caused by repairs that were not done when reported and Jo ventilation to Bambi floors in the bathroom and a dirty stove is tantamount to us owing her twenty thousand dollars for repairs on a trailer who's total value can't possibly exceed four thousand dollars as it's a piece of shit. What do I say to her?  Tldr:landlords a crazy bitch and wants five times the value of a the trailer I rent for damage that's not my fault nor my reasonability.	No
"So hey guys, I live in NYC, which I know has very strong tenant laws and I've already contacted some pro-bono help but I want to know if there's anything I should bring up or if I can even insert this one thing.   So I rent a room in an apartment, my landlord has been... difficult to say the least, in the time I've been here he's:  -changed the locks on me without prior notice (I ended up jacking a key because the bottom locks were unlocked, and I have pictures of the old locks on the table) -I've come home to the electricity being off (which was blamed on me)  -There was an issue with bedbugs he refused to address (even though I had proof they were in the building and he was alerted by the Supervisor of the building) which I had to spend my own money getting foggers and cimexa to take care of (I have pictures of bedbugs) -He's entered my room without my permission or prior notification and 'cleaned' it, for I don't know what reason.  -He has refused repeatedly to give me rental receipts, I've asked for months, he refuses to give them to me. Which is why I fell behind on rent in the first place, because I lost my food stamps when I wasn't able to provide evidence of how much i was paying for rent and was denied state insurance. I have proof that my files were complete except for the rental proof.   Now here's the tricky part, which I don't know if it's worth mentioning or not. So my landlord's behavior has been a bit... odd. When I moved in originally, he mentioned that he ""didn't want me bringing boys over"" and that he was in a legal battle with his niece who lived there who for all intents and purposes was generally really nice to me. He had her removed. I'm not sure what happened there... though he claimed that she tried to poison him.   After, he got really clingy to me, like I figured whatever, possibly just a lonely old man. I kind of put him off and tried to... ease my way out of conversations with him. And then a few weeks later he asked me if I would go out with him for his birthday (note: he's like in his 60s+ and I'm a 22 year old female) and I politely declined.   After that I had the bedbugs issue which he turned the conversation to how ""I didn't communicate enough"" and how he felt personally insulted that I,""didn't say hello in the morning or at night"" and wasn't,""communicating enough"" and how we're supposed to be,""like family""   Honestly.... it kind of seems like a lot of his behavior stems from the fact that he feels insulted that I won't act as his pseudo girlfriend or whatever, I'm not sure if it's worth bringing up though.   Anyways thanks guys."	No
"Throwaway acc.   I currently work for a company making a low wage for the area that I'm living in. A (shockingly high) 40% of my income is put towards my rent. The other 60% is split between food, utilities, gas, student loan payments and the remainder going towards personal interests and very little going towards savings.  Anyways, I was given a ""promotion"" 7 months ago (only in responsibility, not in title or salary) and part of the position required that I receive professional training that totaled $1900. I was asked by a manager that I take the class (over the phone, then the classes sent to me via email). My company has a 1 and 2 year payback plan. Over $2500 is a 2 year payback and under is a 1 year payback. So if I leave within the next 5 months, I'm being told I'm required to pay back the full $1900.  Can they legally require me to pay back the training cost when it was asked that I take the course so I was able to fulfill the duties of the ""promotion"" I was given? Unfortunately, this would be a prohibiting factor of me leaving this company unless I were to receive a signing bonus elsewhere. I do not have even half of the money to pay back.   I live in VA and the company was incorporated in PA and all of our legal documents say they are governed under the law of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania."	No
"I moved into a upper unit of a duplex in March on a one year lease. There have been no problems with the unit aside from the continuous, excessive barking that happens every single night. My landlord owns both my unit and the one below, along with a couple of other duplexes in the lot.   The downstairs neighbors' bedroom is directly below mine; they have at least 3 chihuahuas  which bark at different times during the day, but always at night beginning approximately 9 P.M. and intermittently barking for 5-10 minutes at a time from that time until around 8 A.M. the next day. I have a couple of private youtube videos of the barking but the sub does not allow it to be posted so if anyone is interested in seeing what I am talking about feel free to PM me for the link.  I do not know what causes them to bark at these times precisely but that is the case. They are placed into the bedroom with some of the tenants and their barking can be loudly and clearly heard above where my bedroom is. I have spoken to the tenants who are not interested in resolving the problem. I sent an email and texts to the landlord where I informed her of the issue and asked her to tell the tenants to keep the dog in the living room or kitchen at night so I can't hear the barking right under my bed at night.  The tenants told the landlord that the dog (not dogs) was a ""comfort animal"" and so it needs to sleep with the tenant. She ten suggested to me to buy an area rug. I switched my bedroom and study room and I could still hear the barking.   I have started to keep a log as well as recording the worst of the barking on my phone.  Question is where to go from here. At this point I just want to move out and find a place where there is not a barking dog. However, I do not know if I am justified enough in breaking the lease due to this issue.   I am planning to send my landlord a certified letter formally informing her of the issue along with a short log of times the dog has barked and bitly shortlinks to the videos I have placed on youtube for her to watch; and requesting for her remedy the situation by having the dogs stay in the living room during the county mandated quiet hours. If she refuses to do anything about it then sending another letter letting her know I may have to move out due to a constructive eviction as she has been unable or unwilling to maintain a reasonably quiet atmosphere in the unit.  I don't know if I am going in too hard and fast with that approach; any thoughts on it?"	No
"Long story short. California case. Husband had temporary restraining order placed on him, and I filed for divorce. He has a charge of domestic violence. Actual restraining order was not granted. (Judge HATED my attorney.) Judge ordered a ton of things, including a social services investigation on our child. Husband and I worked things out, don't live together but want to stay married. I filed a form for dismissal of the divorce, and was told all upcoming hearings would be dropped. Guess they weren't because I got a letter saying we are being ""sanctioned"" for not appearing  and are due in court to discuss dismissal.. What the hell does this mean? What will likely happen? I'm terrified of this judge, he is extremely powerful. I've never been so terrified of someone in my life. Can someone please give me an idea to what this all means? (Please no judgments on the fact that I'm with my husband still. It would take me days to write out our whole story.) Thank you."	No
"I am trying to divorce my abusive spouse. We've been married 12 years and have a six year old daughter. He has been physically violent for years and has continued to stalk me pretty aggressively throughout our separation. I moved out in Nov. 2016 and officially filed with the courts in Feb. 2017 pro se. He counter petitioned and as I did not have an attorney I was bullied into giving majority custody to him of our daughter. This has proved to be a bad decision as he does not care for her emotional well being and she is now seeing a therapist. He also continues to break the morality clause in our custody orders. I have gone to authorities to attempt to get a Protective Order against him, once with a bruise from him on my body, and they stated that as we are still married and have a child together they thought it best to deny. I have had to fight to get a criminal trespass warning for my home. Since I decided to leave I have been seeing someone else. My boyfriend has been hit multiple times and charges were pressed but they never went anywhere. The local police told him he should just stop seeing me and that I'm getting what I deserve bc I shouldn't be seeing someone while I'm still technically married. On top of physical stalking, he works in IT security and cyber stalks me constantly. He hacks into ALL of my online accounts, wipes or locks out my phone (which he is not on the account or any of my accounts), gets into my bank accounts, paypal etc, and has begun hacking into the network where I work and messing with my payroll stuff as well as posting inappropriate pictures for all of my coworkers to see. Meanwhile, no one will listen to me or acknowledge whats going on no matter what I report. He even reads all my text messages, etc, tracks my whereabouts constantly, and does petty things like driving by my house and setting of my car alarm in the middle of the night. He has recently been diagnosed as having borderline personality disorder after a suicide attempt and I feel he is unfit to parent our child. However, I cant afford a retainer for an attorney. I now pay approximately 45% of my income to him for child support, insurance for our daughter, daycare for her while shes with him, and other medical fees each month. My check is already small so this has left me on the brink of homelessness even though I work full time and clean houses on the side. He tells our child awful things like I don't love her and I'm a quote ""fucking whore"" etc constantly which has been very detrimental to her. At this point I'm at my wits end. I feel like no one is listening and I have no where to turn. I would love to free myself and my daughter from this abuse and unsustainable situation, but I don't know what to do. Could anyone tell me how long he can ride this out without signing divorce papers since he counter petitioned? What can I do to lower the amount I pay to him as I am in such dire straits and he makes a few thousand a month more than I do already? Without everything coming out I currently bring home less than a minimum wage employee and cant find an attorney willing to help"	No
Yesterday I got a speeding ticket going back home to Central Arkansas from a trip to Bentonville with my girlfriend. My car was totalled in a flood a few weeks ago, so we took her car, and she wanted me to drive back home. The officer clocked me going 91 in a 70 (which I don't exactly believe I really don't think I exceeded anything more than 87ish). Im 18 years old. My court date is September 11th in London, Arkansas, but I will be in college at UofA and at the moment I have no transportation to the courthouse. Most importantly, I have not told my parents about the ticket yet. Is there any way that they will find out if I don't tell them? The officer said something about asking the judge about waiving a civil penalty and the ticket won't go on my record. I know this post is a mess and confusing, TL;DR: I'm an 18 year old who was pulled over for going 21 over in girlfriend's car, need to know approximately how much the ticket will be, if my parents will find out, any advice about how to be prepared for my court date and how to make the ticket not go on my record.

I told this landlord I wanted the apartment and she took it off the market for approxamitely 2 weeks. The rent is 1100 a month and I gave her my security deposit of that much. I changed my mind about moving in as I found a cheaper option and I would have had to double rent for a month and a half. Is there any legal way to get my deposit back or have I lost the  money? This is all happening in missouri.  This was the email my potential landlord sent:  Not only have you wasted my time but you’ve cost me income. You did not take responsibility to know when your current lease ended. On July 11th when asked in writing, you confirmed you DID want to take possession on July 15th as previously agreed to verbally. On July 12th you informed me you don’t. Your current lease termination date should have been considered before you committed to take possession of my apartment July 15th when you gave me your deposit on June 29th. The unit was available July 1st and I compromised and split the month with you. From June 29th to July 12th, you still have not provided the requested information to complete your application.  I have now lost, at the least, one month’s full rent of $1,100. I’ve paid for two background checks at $25 each due to the information you provided for your social security number was incorrect. Both of our time is valuable and I’ve spent at least 8 hours dealing with this issue. All totaled I’m out, at least, $1,150 and I need to begin the entire process over.  For the above reasons, your deposit is forfeited.   This email is accurate, except the listing was off for 14 days, not a month.  Thanks for any insight.	No
Today my wife and I had a hearing regarding my step daughter. The court commissioner said we needed to research the afcc family court review green book. She didn't provide much more detail beyond that. Would anyone know what she is referring to?	No
"My landlord set up posters mentioning they were doing ""green"" upgrades to apartments throughout the week for things like LED bulbs and eco shower heads. I originally thought these were optional, opt-in upgrades but it turns out they were ""required"".  I came home to find two people from another company replaced things in my apartment to make it more eco friendly. Don't get me wrong, I would have loved the eco products installed. But I had no idea they were coming or that they entered until after the fact.   Now, technically my landlord sent an email telling me the day they were going to come in. I disregarded it since I thought it was optional, but noticed it wasn't when I went an read the email.   Even though they gave 48hr notice, the Chicago RLTO https://chicagocode.org/5/5-12/ under 5-12-050 specifically lists reasons a Landlord may enter, and the eco upgrades aren't covered under any of them.  Do I have a case? My understanding is I have potential relief of two-months rent or contract termination. But maybe I don't fully understand that section."	No
Advice?  I normally would be somewhat okay with this as it is a short period of time, but upon the threat that if the door was locked she would break in I am worried about keeping her things here.	No
"A few weeks ago a co-worker of mine (I am a supervisor) got into a yelling match with me over me asking him to do something he didn't want to do. He did not directly threaten me verbally at this point, but he is twice my size and was attempting to intimidate me; including him coming up close to me and asking ""You wanna say something to me?"" In a threatening tone.  I contacted our director, and the other supervisor, to alert them to this. The other supervisor comes in because they live close and I was very much under the impression I was not safe at work. The co-worker that threatened me returned; thinking I was out of the office, he began to brag about how he was about to come back in and attack me.   At this, I ask him to leave for the day and all hell breaks loose. He and the other supervisor start screaming at one another, as myself and other had to hold the two back from one another or there would have been a fight. Finally he leaves the office, and having heard what happened, our director comes in to speak with him. Our director leaves, the asshole who threatened me got to work the rest of the shift. I was promised that the situation would be resolved and I was more than happy to be patient. Weeks have passed and literally nothing has been done, even the bare minimum that the director promised.   Now when have HR coming in tomorrow with an eye to fire all three of us involved. I'm at my ropes end with this company, and I've been told by a few people that if I'm fired that I'd be in my right to sue them. Is there any truth to that?"	No
I'm renting an apartment in New Jersey with a few other people. I learned that the utilities (except for internet) are all billed to our landlord, not one of the other tenants. We all give money for utilities to one of the tenants, who then gives the money to the landlord so she can pay the bill...seems like a weird situation, I'd prefer to have utilities in one of our names, but I guess it's okay.  However, I saw a screenshot of how she sends the amount - it's a notice from the utility company with our address and the amount owed, but it doesn't have any other information (like the billing cycle, when the amount is due, a breakdown for water/gas/electricity). Do we have a legal right to see all of that information? Because basically what she gives us isn't the bill itself.  One thing I just thought of is that in the lease it says the landlord will pay for the water bill - without seeing a breakdown of the costs, we may not be able to ensure that she's paying for water, right?	No
"I filed a preliminary protection order against a man for me and my son. I spoke with the judge explained what happened and she granted the protection order and marked the box with the most strict form of protection available which  states the respondent is to ""have no contact of anykind” with me or my son. In our city there are no other types of protection orders and there is no space for a note more specific instructions like a distance the respondent is supposed to be within.  My son's mother has taken our son to stay at the home of the respondent. After calling the police twice the police have shown up to the house and told me even though they are in the same house together the respondent has not violated the order. The first day they said they promised to stay on opposite parts of the house. The second day the same supervisor in charge contacted me and said he checked on my son and determined he was ""safe"" and that I was not to call anymore.  Not sure what to do but go request to see the judge in the morning and have her wrote a specific instructions for ""no contact of any kind"" on the protection order somewhere."	No
"He has been told by one of the tenants verbally that he needs to give us notice. He sent two of the four of us a message once that he was going to be by. There has probably been a dozen times in the last few months he just comes by, sometimes to fix things, sometimes to pick up a check left on the fridge by one tenet, sometimes no real reason and we only find out because he's opened the windows (he has a thing for fresh air in any apartment he owns, always talking about fresh air is good in good weather).   Just recently one roommate moved out and he just came by yesterday to show the apartment to someone, I was prepping making dinner for my girlfriend. If he'd shown up an hour later he'd be in the middle of my date (other roommates were working). We could have been up to other stuff in my room for all he'd know just blindly showing up, and me and my girlfriend in our 30s are not cool with that possibility, real mood killer when you hear a knock then Hello as he walks in using his keys, not even waiting for anyone to get to the door.   Once, right after I moved in some six months ago, he walked into my room as I was sleeping (10 am on my day off, I was sleeping in). He was there to fix the faulty door lock on my door. He thought I was at work and apologized and said he'd come back another day as I scrambled out of bed in my boxers to find out what was going on. I just fixed the lock myself (misaligned door strike).   Another time I was shaving in my boxers and he just walked into the place, bathroom door open and visible if you come in the door. I'd just showered, nobody in the place, opened door and window to defog the mirror. I'm just standing there with my face covered in shaving cream wearing boxers looking at him like ""wtf?"" he acted like it was nothing.   I sent him a text today explaining if he wants to come work on something we love that but he needs to give us 24h notice. I explained if he'd shown up a little later he'd be in the middle of my date and we knew we had the place to ourselves. So I have text documentation of me telling him not to do that.   He did not write back, usually he writes back right away or within an hour if he's busy with his office job.   The place is month to month, I figure this is just how he is and he might just evict me in a couple months to be able to keep doing it.   Besides ""just move"" (financially difficult at the moment) what should I do past sending what I wrote this morning to him?"	No
"I live in Washington (in the Seattle area) and I am about to sign a lease on a 1 bd apartment. While I was reading the lease I noticed that my guests are limited to visiting no more than 8 times in 90 days, or I will be charged $100. This clause seems overly harsh to me as it means that I couldn't even have my boyfriend over for dinner more than once every other week. Is this reasonable? Should I actually expect to be charged if my family visits more than every other week?   The exact phrasing of the lease is:   ""This agreement is non- transferable. Resident shall not assign, sublet, allow long term guests or permit the use of the premises for any purpose other than as a private dwelling solely for the use of Resident consisting exclusively of the following persons: u/sing-of-Artemis . Resident shall not operate a business or childcare service from the premises. Additional person(s) desiring to take up residency in the dwelling must be approved through the Resident Approval Process. Said persons must execute a Rental/Lease Agreement, and shall not occupy the premises until the Rental/Lease Agreement is accepted in writing by the Managing Agent/Landlord. Any person who visits and/or resides on the premises for 8 days or more in any ninety (90) day period shall be considered an Unauthorized Resident and Authorized Resident will be subject to an additional rental charge of $100.00 per day per Unauthorized Resident. If the Unauthorized Resident fails to apply and qualify for tenancy or sign a written Rental/Lease Agreement, they shall be deemed an Unauthorized Resident and all Residents in the unit will be subject to eviction.""

Hi. My husband and I, married 11 years. I am thinking of leaving my husband. He originally purchased the house before we married, but I have significantly improved it, ie repainting, tuck pointing, re-grouting, and basically building 2 new rooms out of a sleep out. I don't want it to get messy, I guess I just want to know where I stand if leave.  As he owned the house before we married, do I have any claim on it? I am worried as we have 3 children. I am happy to  move somewhere else, but I don't quite know how to move forward.	No
My start-up has been talking with company 1 about partnering up for the past couple of weeks.  Meanwhile company 2 approached us for the soon the same thing.  They are talking about some kind of agreement that halts negotiations with company 1 if they want to continue.  What is the legal name for this type of agreement?  Does it exist as something normal? 	No
We had a hornets nest on our patio for a week. They scheduled pest control to come take it out which they did. Now all of the hornets that were out of the nest when they took it out came back and are pissed. They have found a crack in the door near the old nest and are inflatrating my apartment. There are a small handful in here now. I'm allergic and am worried. I called the office and they said they can't do anything except send pest control back but they won't be back until next week. Do they have any legal obligation to help me immediately?	No
Me and my roommate are on a month to month lease.  Been here 2 years.  Both names on the lease.  Can I sign a new lease with the landlord so it's just my name on the lease without my roommate knowing?  And if I can, am I allowed to evict her?  I pay all of the rent and she pays me back.  I don't care about the money, just want her gone.  Thank you	No
I'm in a huge pickle. My roommate and I regretfully signed a 3 year lease. Upon moving in, we have noticed that there were many fixes needed to be made. Some the LL did do, and some they deemed our responsibility. But because of these many requests, it seems that they are getting more angered, and this is reflected very clearly in their emails to us. Now, they want to fine us for things that we did not do, nor do they have proof that we did it. IE, we informed them on a mosquito infestation on our lot, which they stated was our responsibility. So we sweeped the place of all the feces, piled up leaves, misc dirt etc. And now he is claiming we cut and destroyed their plants across the wall. We do not have proof of the plants before. But they are now wanting to charge us for professional services to replant it, with gross exaggeration of how bountiful it was. Is he legally able to make us pay for the replanting fees if he does not have proof that we destroyed his plants?  So in addition to this, a lot of other things had happened that made us feel unsafe in our home.   From our attorney friends and peers reading our lease, they have told us that the lease seems illegal with how much liability they are putting on the tenants and that it is ununconcionable and won't be  upheld in court. We want to be able to terminate the lease and are willing to pay the standard MD fee of paying rent until the unit is rented out. However, since that lease does not state a termination requirement, are we able to do so?   Thank you so much. This problem has given me so much distress :(	No
So we're in a conflict with my neighbor. There is a tree on his property but all the branches grow out on our side and it leaks sap all over ours cars in the driveway. They're constantly covered in thick sap. Asked him to cut it down he said no. So my plan is to cut all the branches that hang over my property line. I'm going to sheer all the limbs off tomorrow. Is that against the law?  Thanx in advance for any advice.	No
So I own a condo that I purchased in 2009.  Due to being so far underwater, our only realistic option is to rent it out.  The association says they have already reached the maximum number of rental units for the development.  Do I have any legal action that I can take to allow me to rent it out?  Some other information that may or may not be useful:  It's a co-op, not a traditional condo development.  There are 500 units and I am a 1/500th owner.  There is no builder or administrative ownership stake.  This rule (maximum number of rentals) is relatively new.  It seemed to have passed very easily, however any time a resident brings up something that they want to change, they tell us that the vote has to be affirmative for 60% of the owners in the development.  We have never had more than 200 total votes cast.  Apparently, they can change the bylaws when they want to, but not when we want to.  The association is just, in general, a nightmare.  There are currently unoccupied rental units in the development.  However because they have 'approved' the maximum number of units, I can't list mine.	No
My registration expired in January, I was issued a ticket at the end of June, so about 6 months expired. Car is registered to my husband, but I mostly drive it. Neither of us noticed the expired registration.  A week after the ticket was issued I went to the DMV to get new registration. I called the court this morning and they said if I came by with my new registration and court summons, I could pre pay and not go to court. Well I went all the way down there, and then they told me that I can't pre-pay (and they muttered something about misdemeanor amongst themselves) and said I have to attend court.   My court date is next Tuesday. Of course I am going to attend, but now I am very worried. Is this a big deal? Do I need a traffic lawyer? Should I plead not guilty?   I checked on Virginia DMV and I couldn't find any license demerit points associated with this infraction. I assume I will be fined but I have no idea what to expect.	No
Hi, my grandmother rented her house out through a management company to some tenants. They left saying that the house was 'unsuitable for living' citing various minor things that had broken while they were here (e.g. a sliding shower door came off the track). They sent the management company a letter saying that if we gave them the full security deposit, they would not take us to court over being forced to live in those conditions.  The house had suffered major damage due to a large pet they were not supposed to have breaking through porch screens and destroying blinds etc. We spent way more than the deposit fixing this damage.   They moved out in December 2017. We didn't think they had a case so we told our management company not to release the deposit. We moved in in January 2018 so we are no longer with the management company.  Eight months later: We asked the management company what happened and they said the tenant's lawyer never contacted them. They said they would reach out to the tenants again. The management company called us later saying that they would offer for the tenant to keep half of the deposit and for us to keep half of the deposit.   Today they called and said that the tenant refused this deal and that my grandmother is going to have to appear in court to fight it, or hire an attorney to fight for her.   My grandmother is inclined to do whatever is easiest to avoid a problem, but I worry the management company is lying to her. The company is acting a little suspicious and I think they may have already released the deposit to the tenants to avoid a problem. (For reference, it's a small company of 2 people). At no time during their tenancy (or now) did we have any contact with the tenants. We know their names but we don't have any contact information with them. We have never met them.  Sorry for the long post, I tried to keep things vague because I have 1 question:  Is the dispute really between the tenants and my grandmother, or is it between the tenants and the management company?	No

I received a letter from our landlord today (fairly large apartment building) claiming that multiple other residents have filed complaints about us having marijuana  smell coming from our apartment on two occasions. They note that no smoking of any kind is allowed anywhere on the property and that according to a human rights tribunal decision landlords are now permitted to give a single written warning to a tenant on the issue and a second occurrence would require automatic lease termination and that the matter must be rectified by tomorrrow.  Now this is extremely unsettling to my husband and I for multiple reasons. First neither of us or any of our guest have ever smoked anything in or around the building and definitely not in our apartment. Also I am currently 8 months pregnant and we are scheduled to move out of our current apartment into another apartment run by the same management a few weeks after my due date. I am very concerned because we seem to have no way to prove our case, not only that, it would greatly effect our lives to have our lease terminated for this reason since it would mean us not being able to move into our new place at the end of september, and it would most likely prevent us from being able to find a new place to move into since the vacancy rate in our city is already about 0.5% so landlords can be extremely picky. I will obviously be talking with the building manager/landlord as soon as possible, however this is really stressing me out as I don't know how I am supposed to prove that I haven't been smoking and there seems to be nothing stopping these people from complaining again since they have done so in the past. The other detail to note is our apartment is next to the elevator which I have noticed the smell of marijuana in before.  Any suggestions as so how we should approach this would be greatly appreciated.	No
"Hi I'm 30 and my parents are divorced as my mom left our family for a man. My sister is 20 and in undergraduate school.My dad pays 2000 a month in child support to my mom which covers more than enough for her tuition.

"My Ford F250 flooded in the Louisiana flooding in August 2016.  I called and turned the claim into insurance company immediately.  An adjuster came out and gave a “basic” estimate and said the mechanic shop we chose to take it to would check it over more and see what else needed to be done.  The shop and the adjuster decided it could be “FIXED” instead of totaled out. Small things were done here and there to ""fix"" the truck but it never ran right again and when I would get it back it would break again days after leaving the shop. I decided that the Ford dealership was apparently not going to be able to resolve anything as this had been months of back and forth so it was then brought to a diesel mechanic shop, after finally finding one that would accept the job (most places would not even accept the truck because ""it should have been totaled""). The diesel mechanic said, as the others did, that this was a vehicle that needed to be totaled, he told me and he told the insurance company multiple times. They always denied totaling the vehicle because they ""Goggled it and it could be fixed"".  I submitted a claim to the Louisiana Dept of Insurance and after a month they decided it a closed case as there was ""no proof that water got into the engine"" and caused the truck to be damaged beyond repair.    Now this is where I am completely lost, I have a ""totaled' vehicle (even though the insurance company refuses to total it, it is still just a sitting hunk of truck). It now sits at the mechanic shop because it will need to be towed away and this man has been nice enough to let it stay there as we were in the middle of disputes with the insurance company. His next ""fix"" will cost 5k and may or may not fix this truck, his thinking is more likely NOT. I am completely tapped as I have bought a ""cheap"" car to get me by and it is constantly needing this or that done to it as it is a 1986. BUT my 250 is still financed through the bank and pay off is over 22k.  Is there anything that I could do to try to get out from under this truck? It's ruined so it is not worth anything at all but still has a 22k price tag on it. I have considered letting it be repossessed but that sounds like the worst idea possible for my credit. I just don't know if there is anyway at all to get out of this without ruining my credit, I am now in a huge financial bind with no vehicle and no where to turn. Any advice would be great"	No

Hello I really need a question answered. I am a student living in AK and am renting rooms in a house owned by a family member. The previous tenants will be moving out soon and I've been informed by a mutual friend they don't intend to clean before they go. The owner/rent collector has not been charging a security deposit, so any time someone has moved out, I get stuck cleaning the mess they leave behind. Would it be legal of me to hire a cleaner and send them the bill for it? The owner sent them notice that he expects that things be clean and keys/garage door openers returned before they leave. Some extra info: I have not been living in the rest of the house since they gave notice. I keep to my part of the house, so I haven't contributed to the filth the kitchen and other communal spaces have become. Please help, I don't want to spend another week cleaning up after lazy tenants.... I'm happy to answer any extra questions.	No
I'm not sure if this is appropriate for this sub but I figured it couldn't hurt to try!  I rent in Chicago and my apartment building has had problems with theft from our mail room in the past. To remedy this, the landlord installed a locked Dropbox that UPS and FedEx drop packages off in (because they do not have keys to the mail room). USPS does not deliver to the drop box, they put packages in the mail room which kind of makes you wonder what's the point of the box I guess.  The box would be fine, except the only people who have keys to it are the landlord himself, who lives over an hour away in the suburbs and his son, who lives in the building, and they never seem to check the box on a daily basis. I have to order a lot of supplies for work that is time sensitive and I will pay for fast shipping or use Prime, and yet I never actually have my packages in my hands when I pay to have them in my hands.  I have come to the end of my rope today because I broke my glasses and had a replacement pair overnighted to me. My eyesight is incredibly poor and I'm close to useless without them. My package was delivered Monday. It is now Friday and the package still hasn't been taken out and given to me. I've texted the landlord's son multiple times asking him to please check the box (it's a 30 second walk from his apartment) because I very much NEED these glasses. I called him and no answer. I called/texted the landlord and he said he'd talk to him (that was Wednesday).   Despite the landlord and his son being hard to deal with, I still like where I live, the rent is fair and it's a good area and nice apartment. I just want my packages. Is there any way to go about solving this issue in a more firm manner that doesn't involve my landlord hating me so I can continue to renew? Thanks!	No
We moved into a pet friendly community recently. We were shown a model unit before signing the lease, so we didn't get to see the actual place we were going to move into. In our lease, it states that the landlady has the right to show the tenant's apartment to prospective signers, but when we asked about seeing the place, we were denied. They justified it by saying that only applies to some of their properties. They promised that the place would be cleaned before we moved in and that it would be like new. They even said they would replace the carpets! (But only if they were in need of repair.)   We had just dealt with our last place not being given to us after signing, (current tenant wouldn't move out) and our current lease was non-renewable at this point, so we were running out of time quickly. (We live in a college town.) We signed the lease since we liked the size and price, and hoped for the best.  Now we're moved in and it's fucking miserable. There's dirt and pet hair collecting in every corner of the carpets and it's causing my husband unbearable allergies. We asked if the last tenants had pets, and were told no. Bullshit. I realize that we could fight to get the carpets replaced, but I don't have faith in these people anymore. We just want to get out and search for a non pet friendly place. We would've done that in the first place had we known how bad the allergic reaction would be.   TL;DR: Landlady wouldn't show us the apartment despite her ability to do so as stated in our lease, but we were promised a clean apartment. Now we're moved in and it's a shit hole. Can I back out?	No
"I live in student housing. The air conditioning hasn't been working in my apartment all summer. My roommates and I have tried multiple times to get things fixed. Sometimes maintenance comes and does nothing, other times they come and ""fix"" the issue for a couple hours and then the A/C stops working again. It is currently 84 degrees in my apartment. I'm wondering what I can do legally to attempt to get a refund on my rent for this month. Thankfully it is the last month of my lease, but I don't feel that it's fair for me to have to pay rent when it's literally hotter inside my apartment than it is outside. What should I do to try and get a refund?"	No
I own in a really strict HOA and the renters nextdoor have it in their head that I am somehow connected to some fines they got (I am not connected in any way). They have signed me up for PornHub, put my phone number and email on Craigslist in an explicit ad, and stared down visitors to my home who later mentioned it to me (I never told visitors of the issues.)  The landlord and property management company are non-responsive. The HOA is monitoring the situation.  I have made police reports and reports to the HOA where it made sense.  Is there something else I should do? Can I take another approach, like civil court?	No
"Hello all.   I signed a year long lease for a two bedroom apartment in Maryland in October of last year. I moved in with my sister at the time. She wanted to move back home in April, so she signed a deletion form the next day at the leasing office to have her name removed from the lease. The people at the office told her she was good to go.   My girlfriend signed an addition form to have her name placed on the lease in place of my sisters. We were also told by the leasing office that we were good to go.   She moved her stuff in after my sister moved out.   Now, in July, we were three days late to pay our rent. I did not realize that they would retaliate so heavily.   Rent was due on 7/4. I paid the rent, along with the late fee (and ""court fees"", which I was unaware at the time what that even meant) on 7/7. It was paid through the online portal. My account shows a zero balance. I checked my mail today and found a complaint from my apartment written on 7/19, with a court date listed for 7/27, for failure to pay rent and with the full amount of rent listed as still due. The tenants listed on the summons are myself, and my sister, who's name should have been deleted from the lease MONTHS ago.   What are my options? If my account is fully paid, do I really need to waste my time going to court? This is my first time being late to pay ANYTHING and I'm shocked that they still want me to appear to court when my account is currently paid in full. I am currently the only employee at my job and it is incredibly difficult for me to take time off, let alone at such short notice. Can I have the case closed without having to appear? And if I do have to appear, would my sister have to as well?"	No

Hi /r/legaladvice, do you like to hear about easements?  My dad has a piece of land in the middle of nowhere, Minnesota. The local power company has power lines running along the road and claims a prescriptive easement. They offered money to everyone along the road to sign something which I think makes their easement explicit, but my dad felt they didn't offer him enough and refused. This document, in addition to the power lines already there, added the ability for them to run broadband.  In response to his refusal, they sent him a letter basically stating they have a prescriptive easement and they're just going to do whatever they want. Then they sent contractors to clear about 50-60 fully grown trees, probably averaging 50 feet in height, from around the power line. I'd estimate they cleared about 40 feet away from the line.  I searched the sub and found some stuff about title insurance and filing a claim with them, although it seemed that utility easements are likely to be exempt. Do you have any other advice for courses of action he could take? Thanks in advance.	No
"Hi legaladvice peeps,  Because my current sublease ends on 7/31, a few weeks ago I signed for a new apartment beginning 8/1. Put a deposit of several thousand dollars down, paid for cashier's checks, began to start changing utilities and scheduling movers and days off from work (all with an 8/1 move date in mind).   Suddenly, our broker informs us that the only ""safe"" move-in date is August 7, because the current tenants announced their intention to squat. Essentially, tenants are waiting for their lease paperwork to be finalized with another apartment, but the apartment isn't available August 1st, and they can't be bothered to find themselves a hotel and storage space for the interim period. But the landlord has no intention of granting them a month-on-month lease, tenants were informed with proper amount of notice that their lease was expiring 8/31, etc. Their rationale is ""One of us is pregnant, and it's very stressful for us, so we aren't going to move until we are ready.""  We have informed the broker + landlord that moving in after August 1 is pretty unacceptable -- we will lose over a thousand dollars because my roommate-to-be will have to cancel her sublet arrangement at her current apartment (which she was set to move from on 8/1), and I will have to move in with her for some undefined amount of time (from 1 to 15 days, approximately). I will have to pay moving fees twice, take days off from work, and I've already had to cancel professional trips between the dates of 8/1-8/15.   We have informed the landlord of all of this, and they basically said they would try their best to motivate the tenants to leave on time. I suggested that they could try reimbursing our expenses via the current tenants' security deposit, or notify them that even one day stayed past 7/31 will lead LL to proceed against them.  The lease we signed includes a clause saying that the landlord isn't liable for failure to give tenant the unit at beginning of term - basically, it says LL's only obligation in this scenario is to prorate rent for each day they can't give possession, which they have already offered to do. As explained above, however, this situation will cause us to pay rent twice in August.    NYC housing-educated people, what are our options in this case? We still would like to move into this apartment, but it would also be useful to know if this can be used as leverage to cancel a lease, in a worst-case scenario where tenants squat for more than 2 weeks. Also, I'm curious about precedent for this scenario, and what landlords are typically liable for in a case of holdover tenants + signing a lease on property that they can't actually give possession for"	No
Long story but this is the short version. My miniture dachshund bit a neighbour. At first they gave us a 14 day eviction. I protested that 14 days was not enough time so they extended it to a month. Now my property manager is saying that we can stay until the end of our lease (which ends November 31). This is now not an eviction but a request. I have never been late with my rent. What would happen if I just keep on paying my rent and dont move?  Eapecially if my dog hasn't bitten anyone during the next 4 months. Would they have grounds to evict still? I live in Alberta Canada.	No
"I found out today that the ""adu"" apartment I have been renting for the past 15 months is not a legal apartment and was not approved by the city. The owners were not supposed to put a kitchen in and it was only supposed to be extra housing. A code inspector came by for another matter and figured it out. I have to be out by the end of the month. Can my landlord who rented the apartment to me fraudulently be held accountable? I'm moving with basically no notice in an extremely expensive city. Thanks for any advice. I live in Portland, Oregon."	No
So my husband left me basically overnight for a coworker of his. I've tried to be nice and let him see our son and even take him to his house that he shares with his new girlfriend.  My problem is that he will not see him unless he can take our son there and I'm uncomfortable with this because I don't know where they live or what the house is like therefore I have no idea where my 3 year old is when he's with his dad. His girlfriend is only 18 (he's 26) and has friends over etc. I don't know any of these people so I'm uncomfortable with it.  I have no money for a lawyer yet don't qualify for legal aid. I don't know what to do. I understand I can do a temporary custody order but I don't know how fast those are effective or how to fill out the forms or anything... any help would be appreciated I'm lost. 	No
Shady Landlady Issues  -FYI  We had some trash we were going to remove on the 4th of August, it was stated if she could get it removed significantly sooner - we would be willing to eat the cost out of the deposit.   Trash was picked up on the 3rd, invoice itself was created on the second - which I recall from GAAP, this is not a good rule of thumb.  Invoice contains NO breakdown, NO sign of gst, NO backup whatsoever.  What are my options?	No
For some god forsaken reason my neighbor has decided to put up what I can only assume is industrial strength flood lights along their property line facing directly at my home.  They are probably 200ft away but extremely bright, well beyond the normal light produced by the average flood light.   I have tried to ask politely if they could use bulbs  that aren't as bright, or change the direction slightly so they aren't shining directly into my home at night. They have refused and told me it's not their problem.  Could I legally build panels covered in reflective material in front of my property to reflect and reduce the light that is shining on my property? I have tried blackout curtains but they do not completely block the light.  I obviously don't want to do this if it isn't legal, but at this point I don't know what to do.   I live in a rural area, so I'm not sure what specific laws would even be applied that I could look into, or if light pollution is even something that can be considered a nuisance. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.	No
"So this has a ton of backstory, but I guess its all important.   My mother got me diagnosed with Autism syndrome at a very young age. She believes vaccines caused my Autism, and had to go through EIGHT DIFFERENT doctors to actually get me diagnosed. (I am convinced you can get anyone diagnosed with anything, especially when they are young and do what their parents instruct them to do during evaluations)  When I turned 18 I started having to do stuff like pay taxes and etc. I was working full time while going to highschool. I had a very strong social life with many friends, and was well liked throughout school. I am the opposite of what you would call ""Autistic"" and when I did eventually explain my situation to my school, they offered to help me get my diagnoses fixed. Even the special ed director quietly told me ""I'm not legally allowed to say this for sure, but you do not come off as autistic at all""  Anyways, I came across something that led me to believe I was receiving SSI for my disability. I confronted my mother about this on 3 separate occasions. The first two times she denied it. The third time she says that I used to receive a minuscule amount (less than 300 a year) I had called the SS office and they confirmed I was receiving disability, but could not specify how much.  The nearest SS office was a bit of a drive from me, and I did not have my license, so I couldn't get there any time soon, especially with working on graduating highschool and work on top of that. Everything I do/get I do on my own, buying food, clothes, my asthma medicine. The only thing I didn't pay for was rent. I never had any help with getting a permit or learning how to drive.  When I finally got an appointment set up and a ride to the SS office, my mother caught wind of it. 3 days later I am kicked out (2 hours after my graduation) and move to Texas with my father. Now that im here I am getting all sorts of shit done, and just recently went to the SS office. I received a statement of Disability benefits and realized I have been receiving $532 a month since early 2015. With my mother listed as my beneficiary.  This money has 100% NOT been being used for me or my wellbeing. And she has been collecting it for a full year after I turned 18. on top of that apparently she did something to disable the payments after she got last months payment (the month after I got kicked out) So I no longer receive the SSI ( something I shouldn't have even been receiving in the first place)  Do I have any legal recourse??? Is there any way I can prove she used these funds  fraudulently? I know that she will fight in court, she is insane and not the smartest person, but very stubborn. I didn't pay rent while I lived with her, and wonder if she will say thats what she used SSI for? (even though she is married to someone that makes over 100k a year, and she just started working full time for the first time since I was a kid, and only because my stepdad forced her to)  She blatantly lied to me that I recieved SSI, and this is mindblowing.  Sorry if this post is all mumbo jumbo, I just learned all of this withing the last 30 minutes and my mind is in a million places right now. If I didn't explain something well enough just ask and I will be happy to elaborate."	No
Notified landlord we wouldn't be continuing lease in April. From that point he was very unfriendly.   Lease was set to end July 31st, just a few days ago. We moved out at the end of May but did not turn in keys until early July. We had a few belongings in there but nothing major. We originally asked if we could do a walk thru with him and then turn in the keys. He said no, just to leave the keys in a specific drawer.   I asked at the end of June if he would consider keeping the security deposit for the last month's rent because we had cleaned the unit and it honestly was in the condition we had acquired it. He said absolutely not and threatened me. I said I didn't intend to default on rent but he had been in the unit and had been showing it, to me it seemed like a descent proposition.  I paid rent in full. A few days later we went to do a final walk thru (ourselves) and touch up anything, and leave the keys. We noticed the pool and mail key were gone off the counter. We hadn't placed them on the designated spot. He said after the keys were turns in he would switch electric back to his name. He didn't do so until 5 days later when I messaged him about it.   I sent an email with our forwarding address for the depost, which we had asked him multiple times if he was happy with the unit. He said he wouldn't assess it until the keys were turned in.   Once they were he said he knows there was smoking in the unit. That he smelled it in February. He claims I told him that my SO is a smoker. I am appalled and floored because this isn't true at all! He said it smells like smoke. It's like well that's interesting because our clothes, my car, his car, and our home done smell like smoke. Neither of us are smokers.   There were also two large stains in the carpet when we moved in. We were told by his brother in law, who showed us the unit (Landlord lives outside of Ohio), that they were from a previous tenants and there had been attempts to clean it but they were set in the pads and would resurface.   He said the deep stains were so bad that the steam cleaner guy said he would have to return a few times and if it wouldn't come out then he's patch it.   When I reminded landlord of this, he said no the stain in the spare bedroom wasn't there and that's where your plants were.   I never have heard of plants staining carpet so bad it needed to be cut out? And we had a rug under our plants. We had rugs over the carpet stains because nobody wants to look at them!!   Side note-- he lives out of state; he has his brother in law help out but he isn't listed on the lease as a contact. We signed the lease on line, never received a mailed copy. He showed the unit while we still had belongings in there and never told us when he was entering the unit.   We haven't received an itemized list of the use of the deposit. I had a feeling he would do something like this when I asked him of he would accept the deposit for last month's rent and he said no, that leaves nothing to cover damages or cleaning. He recently said, no wonder you asked so many times about me using the deposit for your rent since you smoked in there and stained the carpets. It's upsetting because that's not true. And I only asked once.   Help please!!!	No
I can find all the steps involved in both processes, obviously changing your name on your birth certificate is much longer and more involved. Are there advantages to doing it that way?   If we decided to move abroad and buy property, apply for visas or file our taxes in anther country, would only assuming his name become a hindrance?  Thank you!	No
Feeling torn about this and just looking for perspective. I work at a private hospital. On our internal email server (no external communications outside of the building), a department head's secretary (by way of the CEO it turns out) forwarded an email, explaining that the hospital held a position against the ACA and encouraged staff to contact their legislators in support of repeal. The email also request that once the employee contacted their representative(s), they should respond to the email so that the CEO could have a record of support for stats. Surely this isn't legal? It's one thing to encourage staff to contact legislators WITH THEIR OWN OPINION. It's a whole other issue when there is a possibility of discrimination based on participation. Just looking for thoughts.	No
Her ex's only visitation rights are one 2-hour supervised visit per month, and he hasn't paid child support nor requested to see the child in 6 months. He is apparently extremely verbally abusive and narcissistic (compares himself to a god, etc.) and will undoubtedly dispute it when he receives notice due to his pride. Will he have a chance in court? I hate the thought that some horrible person can affect my life so negatively if he's somehow able to say we can't move and I miss out on a great opportunity for myself and my new family.  I am begging anyone for any insight, my wedding is set for less than 2 months from now...	No
I was laid off in mid June, and I'm curious about several things, including my annual reviews (I was laid off at the same time that our managers were supposed to go over reviews with us) as well as anything related to why I was laid off.  I sent my company a request based off of [Oregon Revised Statute 652.750](https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/bills_laws/lawsstatutes/2016orLaw0115.pdf), but they only sent me my non-compete and a secrecy agreement that I had signed.  I'm not sure what to expect.  I don't know what my personnel files consists of, but I want to make sure I get everything I can (including ones I'm unaware that exist, if that makes sense.)  How can I make sure they give me everything that I have rightful access to?  Thanks!	No
Location: Tippecanoe County, Indiana (West Lafayette, zip code 47906)  Hello fellow Redditers,  I am having an issue with a girl I subleased my apartment to. It is an unofficial sublease and management does not know about it. There is a clause in the lease stating unofficial subleases are not allowed.  Basically what is happening is my tenant is 2 weeks late on rent and is avoiding any questions about it. I paid rent to my landlord, but have not been reimbursed for it. She is also ignoring my calls and texts, or says she is at work and cannot take my calls. She also lacks the common courtesy to return my calls once she gets off work. I have no idea what to do in this situation.    Additionally, the lease ends on August 2nd 2017 and if she is not moved out and has the keys turned in to the management, there is a $250 a day holdover charge. What options do I have to fix this situation?   There are agreements that have been made over text that I have a record of. However, I need advice on how to handle this predicament currently, and possibly legally in the future.  Thank you for your advice!	No
So I had just started working at papa johns and on my 4th day or so I had to leave early for a family emergency, they didn't even let me leave early even though I told them I had to drive 2 and a half hours for a family emergency and then my car got stolen when I got to the city I had to go to. The general manager was texting me the whole week prior telling me when to come into work, so I texted her the day my car got stolen letting her know the situation, this was Thursday and my next shift was Saturday. I realize my mistake was not calling after I had not received any texts but at the time I was too stressed to deal with that situation. So upon returning I find out I'm getting fired for a no call no show because she wanted me to call her not text her. What can I do about this? Small claims?	No
FWWUARRKK. ok so just recently I was reviewing a lease online that I was going to potentially sign, only after a small negotiation of price and an earlier move in date between me and the property manager. I was checking to see if the property manager had updated the price in my lease and saw that he had not. As I was reading the page of the lease that had the stated price and move in date, my mouse disappeared and I did the ol' shake it around and click a couple times to retrieve the cursor and ended up clicking the e-sign and continue button. The page of the lease strictly states I agree to the price and move in date.  so my question is (1) are there any laws allowing for me to remove my e signature within a specified time period? (2) since my current lease ends 11 days before the start of this lease, essentially giving me nowhere to stay, should I attempt to use this to have them make an amendment to the lease? (3) really what are my options here or am I just screwed?	No
" Hello, throwaway for obvious reasons. There has been some recent shady dealing at my friend's apartment building. I'm seeking advice for them and other tenants.  1. Summary of Known Wrong-Doings (some have been re-occurring for tenants' entire stay, some occasional)  -Potential future tenants referred upcoming vacant units by existing tenants. Potential tenants toured unit and wrote deposit checks to Building Manager. Signed receipts given to potential tenants with Building Owner info in heading. Building Manager cashed to personal account with no intent to lease. -Building Manager also has access to all tenants personal info/SS#'s, and requested same info from referred potential tenants under false pretenses. -Fees such as parking, security deposits, etc. requested as cash payed directly to Building Manager, sometimes with same signed receipt. -Rent requested in cash payed directly to Building Manager, for various reason given, with signed receipt.  2. Background / Context  Ex-Apartment Building Manager (live-in) did all showings/lease paperwork/maintenance requests/received rent/fees at the building - I assume employee of the Building Owner, not co-owner, contractor, etc. Shortly after learning of some of the above actions (not sure if there were any past incidents), the owners notified tenants the Manager was ""resigning,"" but did not acknowledge any wrong-doing or give any reason why, seemingly to distance themselves from manager.  Owners have been only rude and defensive. They have also accused some tenants who were misled to by the Manager of possibly being in cahoots and threatened taking action against them, legal or eviction (is this illegal?).   -Update: Owner has served a notice to vacate to at least one tenant who's deposit/last month was taken by Manager. They have all amounts included in the lease and a receipt for at least one of the fees.  3. Questions  Is the Manager liable as an individual for their actions, or are the Owners/management company liable as a business entity for their employee's actions? Is there any way for referred potential tenants to get their money back besides small claims? Would they seek from Manager as individual or Owner?  Don't businesses have insurance or contingency for their employee's wrongdoings that could cover this reimbursement? Would a lawyer work on contingency fee in the case of something like this? Is the Owner's lack of notification of criminal actions to tenants or unwillingness to reimburse potential tenants itself an unlawful act?  4. Organization?  Building has 40+ units. Above info is from network of approx only 6 units, learned from just chance encounters, so I would expect more people have had things happen to them or people they may have referred to move in.  Would it be a good idea to survey how many tenants have been potentially scammed in some way and if wrongdoing is widespread possibly take legal action as a group? This would at minimum connect those screwed over the most. Surveying/organizing would have to happen anonymously of course. In my state it is illegal to prevent tenants from posting info in public area, or meeting/organizing on their own.  Maybe just slide informational flyers under doors, with an invite to an anonymous forum/chat group to survey experiences? Any recommendations for a private chat/forum easy to set up greatly appreciated. Any advice also appreciated. Thanks."	No
"Hi guys,  Purchased my first home in November that was supposedly remodeled and have been hit with non-stop issues. Not sure if I have a litigation case against the sellers, inspector or both. Here are some of the issues I've had the deal with in the span of about 8 months:  - Major amount of exposed Asbestos in attic. Seller denied knowing (despite contractor saying it had been there a while) and inspector claimed ""no access to attic"" despite easy access all around the premises both inside and outside. 10k to clean up.  - Plumbing issues. The drainage leading to sewer is so rooted I had to pay to unclog the toilets twice (clear out, which cost 1k each time) and then install a device to help with roots which was 4k.   - Central air. The whole system setup was just unbelievably haphazard.  3 ton unit outside with 2 .5 coil (contractor who I hired to fix everything said had never seen this before). It also was setup so that the emergency drainage duct was being used rather than primary and had gotten so bad that I was a few weeks away from water coming through the ceiling of the house. Inspector said in report system was fine. 4k to fix configuration.   The selling agent, sellers, and inspector have gone MIA and would really like to know if I have a case here. I specifically bought a home that was remodeled under the notion I wouldn't have to put significant amount of money into it, at least early on. It's basically been the exact opposite and has become a project home, with over 20k spent in fixes within 8 months of ownership.  Do I have options?   Thank you."	No
"I am a landlord in Illinois and this is the first time I've run into this problem and am unsure of how to proceed. Here is the background and current situation.   My parents were renting a house out and after my father's death I took over the account. The tenant has been living in my unit for the past year give or take a month. The lease is over end of the month IIRC. I'm not entirely sure on this part as even though they have a lease with me they never returned a signed copy to me even though I have asked for it multiple times (I have the original lease template but not the signed lease with dates and what not). I know they have the lease because I handed it to them personally. The lease states that they must pay the rent at the beginning of the month but he contacted me and said that he and my father had an agreement where he could pay the rent in two separate portions one in the middle of the month and one at the end. Now I was not too thrilled about this arrangement but my mother informed me that such an unorthodox payment scheme was indeed what they had verbally agreed to when my father was alive.   Now this has not been much of a problem for the last year or so as we always received two checks at the beginning of the month, both post dated one for the middle and one for the end. He has always been somewhat bad with his payments because if I deposit the checks even one day late/early they would bounce and I would have to drive over there to pick it up in cash. But this month I didn't receive any checks at all. When I contacted the tenant about this (end of week 1) he said they were in the mail. So I gave it a week to show up in the mail. No checks so I said forget that I'll drive over there and pick them up (it is now week 2 at this point). Then I was informed that he was out of town and no one would be home until week 3. I stupidly waited till week 3 before attempting to collect the checks again. He then stated that his loan officer told him not to spend any money until they were approved for a loan (the f? never heard that one before). I pressed him again drove out there, no one answered the door, no check. I don't want to keep driving out there if no one is going to answer because it's a bit of a drive. I ask him to have the checks ready for Monday of week 4 (last week of the month, it's currently Sunday). I even said he could post date it for the end of the month like he usually does (this time the check is supposed to be for the entire rent plus late fee). He basically said no and that if I showed up either no one would be home or he simply would not give me a check because his hands are ""tied"" until the weekend whatever the hell that's supposed to mean (also the weekend would put us at literally the 29/30th). He also refused to post date it stating that last time he post dated it the check was deposited a day early and he was hit with an overdraft fee (again not really my problem because I'm not the one who can't pay rent). So now it' basically the end of the month, dude's been living there for free all month and is now refusing payment. I'm going to be out in the area tomorrow (Monday) so I'm thinking of serving an eviction notice but am unsure of the legalities behind it. Also because I don't actually have a copy of the signed lease I'm not entirely sure what my options are. I would like to get him out of the house and get paid for the past month.  TL;DR Tenant is refusing to pay rent and has been living for free in rental unit. Can I evict him without a signed copy of the lease and is there a way to still get paid for the month?"	No
"Firstly, yes I realize I fucked up and what I did was dumb. I did it out of spite and anger which makes it's doubly a bad decision.  **Location:** Texas, USA  **Quick Background:** I rented an apartment from an acquaintance who uses a particular management company. After some weeks I realised that I needed to move outside of the country and asked to end the lease early. The contract stated that I could do that without fees if I found a replacement tenant. So, I tried to and the company managing the property made my life hell for many weeks by doing every shady thing possible to make sure I failed (lying to prospective tenants, turning others away without reason, etc). In the end the landlord, who was being lied to by them as well stepped in and told them to stop fucking around and they finally relented and accepted a tenant. They were hoping I would leave without finding one so they can charge me to find a replacement tenant instead.  Once I moved out, I was very angry and wrote a few negative reviews online using my own accounts and some others. I knew a tenant review doesn't hurt, so I proceeded to write reviews as if I was a property owner who worked with them and the management company stole from me, charged my tenant fees without informing me, and so on. Unfortunately one of the accounts I used is my personal account (dumb x 2), so it can easily be identified as me trying to hurt their reputation by creating a false story.   **Current Situation:** I currently live abroad and will not be back in the states until December. A few days my parents received notice from the Constable that I was being sued. I wasn't positive it was them, but had a feeling so I quickly took down the review that was most damaging and the one that is under my name directly. Yesterday I got a hold of the constable and he confirmed this managing company is indeed the one suing me. He gave me the details for their lawyers, who I called and left a message for saying I am currently abroad and they can contact me via email.  There are still a couple of facebook reviews that are up, but not exactly 'false'. And another false review on google, but that one cannot be linked to me. I intend to take those down, but am not sure whether to do it now or after they contact me.  I have not been served yet, as I am abroad. Not sure if they can and/or are planning to serve me in another way and if I should be avoiding this at all?  My biggest question is - should I contact the management company directly saying something along the lines of ""I've been notified that you are suing me. I can only assume that it is for the 2 facebook reviews you do not agree with. If that is it, please withdraw your lawsuit and I will take down any reviews that were made by me"" ?  I am not sure if they want to hurt me financially or just want me to take down the negative reviews - which I am happy to do as I now realize it was a dumb thing to do, even if they are a less than honest company who tried to screw me over.  Any advice is much appreciated."	No
"2014 I went to court filed for custody. My oldest I was able to keep. She was living with me anyway since cys got involved due to drugs in the house and some abuse. At the time my youngest who was 15 at the time also had a live in 19 year old BF. The constable found him in the closet in her bedroom. This all went to court including the constable. Why they let her stay with her mom I don't know.  At the time they said she was old enough to decide. She liked to party with her mom and now she's in rehab. Butler county juvenile has her in for the second time. The first time she went in she was 18 and she was still in high school. I was paying support to her mom. I stopped paying support to her mom since she was not living there. Soon as I did that butler came at me for support. She got out and I was paying the arrears for that while again paying her mom. The arrears were paid off and then my support juSt stopped because washington county domestic relations emancipated her as she was 18 and graduated. The week they stopped the support she ran to butler saying she was hot for drugs. THE WEEK MY SUPPORT ENDED! I figured this would happen. Anyway I enjoyed about a month of not paying support and just got the letter from butler setting up suppprt for ""the minor"". I am in the process of getting an attourney and would like some advice. She is now 19 and butler says they can make me pay support while she is there until she is 21. I'm trying to stay calm. "	No
I have had many interactions with Home Depot's customer service over the 4th of July weekend. They tried to overcharge me two a half times over a $500 order. In the end I had to beg a friend's family member to make 6+ trips to the store that is serveral miles  away using  a 4 seater car, instead of the company's delivery truck that should have arrived 48 after the order was placed.   I contacted the home depot's customer  support after 96 hours of not hearing from them and I was told by them I had to come into the store, which was the only way for me to pick up even just half of the merchandise that I was overcharged for because they did not have enough in stock. They gave me a small discount in the store and I returned home less then 1/3 of my total order due to my noticing of  a large discrepancy on the pricing of the item in question when I was checking on it on my tablet on the website whilst in store.  The next morning I  re opened neutral negotiations with my growing antagonist and calmly asked for why there was such a discrepancy and why I was overcharged, not informed of a delay in shipping or even contacted at all. After 3 hours of contacting their support rep and getting nowhere I ended up ordering the same exact gardening supplies on my friends Amazon prime and informed Home Depot that I wanted a full refund on all the merchandise that I had not received. Although my original payment method at home depot's website was a credit card instead of refunding the money to my card, I just received a call this morning asking me to come into the store in person to receive the refund. Why would they do this rather then just refund my card?  All I am doing is a little legal (as of this year) gardening and I am not white and they were all Caucasian, so to me it seems a little bit sketchy. Any opinions ?	No
My wife and I signed an apartment lease that ends at the end of July.  We recently bought a home and moved into the home in early June.  We did this knowing that we would still be paying our last month's rent in July.  We moved the majority of our things when we moved into our home but left a few things that were not necessities in the apartment and planned on getting them before July was up.  We went by our apartment this past Wednesday and got a few loads of the things that were left.  We noticed that the pest control had come by and sprayed that day.  Today we went back to get the remainder of our things and when we walked in the apartment we noticed several lights were on and our stuff had been rummaged through and several things were missing.  There is no sign of forced entry so we knew it had to be somebody with a key.  We called and spoke with security to explain what happened.  He called and spoke with the apartment management and got back with us.  He informed us that management had let a cleaning lady in our apartment to start cleaning and this cleaning lady assumed that the previous tenants had already moved out and everything left in the apartment was free for all.  Property management never notified us or asked us if it was ok for this to happen.  He told us that our things are in a storage shed at the apartment complex and we will be able to get them back tomorrow.  We have no idea what all exactly was in the apartment before this cleaning lady entered so we're just supposed to take their word that everything that was taken will be in this storage shed tomorrow?  What rights do we have here?  Thanks in advance.	No
I know laws are ambiguous in defining 'normal wear and tear', but the problem I'm facing is that the apartment complex wants to charge us for carpet replacement due to the contrast between used carpeting and carpet that was covered by furniture for 2 years, as can be seen [Here](https://i.imgur.com/VvGATds.jpg). Note, the light making a window outline seems to exaggerate the contrast, but you can still see what they're talking about. We didn't do anything crazy to the carpet, just lived on it. I'm sure a better vacuum wouldn't have hurt, but still.   Further, they replaced all of the carpeting, but said they only charged us for the rooms they said needed to be replaced. Is this just 'out of the kindness of their hearts', or did they replace it all then try to make some of that money back?   Additionally, we were told we could get it professionally cleaned and show a receipt or they could do it for $50 upon move out. I feel a good bit of the contrast would've been alleviated (though likely still existent) had the carpets been steam cleaned, but this never happened as we intended on paying them the $50 to do so. Does that play a role in this at all?  Thank you!	No
I'll try to keep this brief.  My parents' divorce paperwork from 1989 in MO says that my father is supposed to pay for my wedding, if I have one. My mother says it is in there because she is very poor (she works for a non-profit), and my father's very wealthy, (He retired at 40).  While my father and I aren't super close, we're not estranged either. I live in CA so we see each other once a year, unless there's a major family event. I didn't know about this being in my parents' divorce agreement, so I'd saved up the money to pay for my dream wedding myself, but when I called my mother to tell her about my engagement, she immediately brought it up, even sent me pictures of that section of their divorce paperwork.  I'm not sure whether or not to ask him to honor that part of the divorce agreeement, but my mother is practically SALIVATING about it. (Their divorce wasn't exactly amicable.)  So while I'm weighing other options, I figured I'd ask so I have a clearer view of the situation. Is something like this enforceable? And if it is, what are the steps for pursuing it if he refuses when asked? If I don't ask him to pay for my wedding, and just pay for it myself, does my mother have the option of going after my dad?	No
21 year old child living in parents home. Child has quit college and is not paying rent. Child is not following rules of the home, such as chores and cleaning up after themselves, and has recently become destructive(smashed outdoor grill and threw others property away)as well as verbally abusive towards minor child in the home.   How would one go about removing him from the home? Is it possible to do so without causing him to have a criminal record? Thank you.	No
My aunt is getting quite old and wants to set up a Living Trust and Will.  Both are quite straight forward as she wants to give everything to her daughter however she does have an estranged son that she no longer communicates with and wishes to ensure that he does not receive anything..  would LegalZoom be acceptable for this or would it be best to consult a lawyer.  also what would the expected cost be for a Living Trust and Will?	No
We are in Ontario Canada and have been looking at places in Toronto, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario.  We signed one buyers representation agreement with an agent in the Toronto area when we were looking to lease a place in Toronto. We just moved to Toronto on July 1st and ended up finding a place without the agent.  The agent marked on file that he is helping us out for the Toronto central, east and west area. He says he only works in the Toronto area and Windsor is about 4 to 5 hours drive away.  In Windsor we are signing with another agent and purchased offer was accepted yesterday evening.  Today we are planning to send acknowledgment forms, sign buyer representation with the Windsor agent and so on.  I am wondering if there will be any problem with the previous agent trying to take the new ones commission or anything.  Any info helps!   ** TL;DR: Signing buyers representation with two different agents in two two different cities about 4 to 5 hours away from each other.  Neither of them work in the others duristiction but are in the same province. Any problems here?  **	No
Last Spring I signed a lease, with three other guys at a brand new apartment near my college. The apartment was still under construction and we were assured that it would be open by next semester. Today I received an email and phone call informing me that the apartment will be unable to open by the set date of September 2nd, but rather will be ready by December 29th. Now im given two options by the apartment:  Option 1- cancel the lease and receive the security deposit back, and have to find a different apartment to stay at 5 weeks before school starts.  Option 2- dont cancel the lease, move in on December 29th (if its even ready by then), and receive a $1500 concession for staying with them. id also need to find an apartment to stay at for 4 months.   I really don't know my options here, all around its terrible. there is no apartment up there that i can stay at for 4 months without having to terminate a lease, also the 1500 doesn't even come close to what 4 months of rent would be up there. i was thinking i could maybe try and get them to pay the cancellation fee for an apartment, but i don't think they'd do that.  p.s. if there is a better subreddit for this question please let me know, thanks	No
"I live in CO. I have a roommate who is subletting for another roommate who moved to Nevada for a job offer. This roommate is not on the lease and the subletting roommate foolishly didn't have her sign anything regarding the room she would stay in. Our lease is up the 31st of July and she has not paid rent, has eaten our food (we have proof), has thrown away and broken our dishes (have proof), and has no job or even made an attempt to find a job. She also has a history of mental illness, stealing, hurting herself and other people according to her friends and family.   She recently threatened myself and the subletting roommate with legal consequences if we try and kick her out. According to her, we have no legal grounds to have her removed from the premises. She stated if we let her stay there until near the end of the month that she wouldn't cause any problems or ""damage property"". Personally I feel like she is blackmailing us. I don't feel safe in my own apartment living with a mentally unstable person who will steal my food and possibly other things when I am gone.  She has been living here since Mid-May.  What can I do?"	No
My sister is a Canadian citizen who married a US citizen over a year ago.  They had a child about 7 months ago, born in Canada.  She tried to cross the border yesterday with the aforementioned family and she was denied, because they believed her to be emigrating to the states, which in a way she was, but she wasn't aware of how strict the process to emigrate was.  Her husband has a job in the states and he had to go, but she had to stay here.  As far as I know, being denied from the border already puts her on a list which makes it harder to enter.  She's been living long-distance from her husband for a very long time already, she was very excited to finally have the family together and after returning early this morning she has been crying on and off all day, I haven't really seen her this torn before.  Is there anything she can do at this point?      Any and all information would be extremely helpful.  Thank you ahead of time.	No
I'm just curious if I have any recourse against them. They charged me for blind replacement (cited reason was broken) and i know for a fact it wasn't broken because I never once opened my window or touched my blinds. Do I have any recourse? Anything I could throw at them to make them prove that the stuff was broken before charging me for it? I know it's a long shot but they're trying to rape me for ever dollar I have it seems like and I don't have much. I was very meticulous and diligent about cleaning and checking everything when I left. Nothing was broken and everything was clean. 	No
Okay so pretty much we are renting to own. 4 window units came with the trailer, already installed etc., well the new managers have been throwing hissy fits to point of yelling profanities at my household. My fiancé finally put one of the units in the yard. Anyone know if its legal for them take off with shit like that or anything we can do? Owner of the park will not return calls.	No
My friends and I love watching movies and making fun of them. It was suggested that we make a YouTube series of us doing this, and so I did some reasearch at this seems like it could be a fun hobby. I was going to have us sitting around with mics, and then show the movie as we are watching it at the bottom of the screen. It occurs to me though that the movie is under copyright, but I don't know exactly what that protects.  So what does the copyright prevent me from doing. Can I show the movie? If not, is there another way to do it that will make it legal?  Thank you in advance.	No
I was fired from my job as a health inspector at a county government in Illinois. I was told it was because I was not performing to expectations. I was on a 6 month probationary period and at 5 1/2 months through it, and would not have protection from the union until 6 months. I am gay and was part of a harassment investigation against the director of the division, who is also the person who terminated me.   I work very little with my bosses (the director and assistant director of the division), and instead work closely with senior people who work as trainers. In the 5.5 months I received no formal performance review or corrective action.   I was part of a harassment investigation, against the director of the division as I witnessed him say something sexist to another coworker. This was the second harassment investigation against the director.   There were two other employees, a heterosexual female and heterosexual male, who finished the 6 month probationary period, but I know took longer to train based on responsibilities: They were not allowed to do certain inspections or responsibilities until 5-7 months after hire, where I was allowed to do them at 4 months from hire.   Every single person who trained me has said that I have been performing at or above expectations and better than the two other recent hires.   The other employees, who encouraged me to do this, have said I was fired because the director did not like gay men (or women).   Do I have a case for retaliation since I was fired being part of a harassment investigation? Do I have a case for wrongful termination since there was little to no documentation about corrective action and heterosexual employees, who performed worse than me were retained.   If I do have a case, what do I do next?	No
My landlord verbally agreed to release me from my lease and told me he'd follow up in writing. I expected an official document of some sort, but instead I got the following email:  &gt;Per your request, here is a quick note to document our agreement.. We have agreed that we will release you from all future lease obligations. In the next few days, please [...instructions for returning keys],  **Is this enough to release me from my lease, or do I need to request something more?** My limited knowledge of contract law says this is enough, but my gut tells me to be wary.	No
Specific legal question (So you don't have to dig for it): Are there any specific laws or previous court cases regarding similar situations that will provide useful information to us in moving forward in this dispute with our landlords?  My wife has a number of disabilities and mental conditions which have been diagnosed over years of work with various health and mental health providers.  These issues include, but are not limited to: PTSD Borderline Personality Disorder Codependency disorder Depression Anxiety  This situation revolves around my wife's psychiatrist prescribing her an emotional support animal due to her issues becoming unmanageable with medication. She reached the point that if I did not come home from work to get her out of bed she would stay there until I got home.  Since obtaining the animal just one week ago, my wife's condition has improved drastically.  Our landlords are demanding that we remove the animal. I've provided a dated timeline, and I would like to request any advice or specific laws/regulations pertaining to our situation. We reside in Indiana. We live in the country in an area with farms, but our mailing address is out of a nearby large city.  I have reached out to an attorney and I am awaiting an initial consultation so I can begin directing communication to my attorney, but I thought I would see how /r/legaladvice feels about the situation. Thank you for reading - I'll be skipping a tl;dr as I'm not sure how to condense this with enough details for solid advice.  -----  June 27, 2017 - My wife was prescribed emotional support animal by Bloomington Meadows Hospital.  “The above requires an emotional support animal - This is a medical requirement for her health”.  Due to the nature of ESAs, we delayed speaking to our landlord as our hope was to find an animal that would require no accommodations. We already had pets allowed in our lease, on a per-pet monthly fee of $25/month.  July 13th, approximately two weeks after the initial prescription, we made the decision to purchase a Kunekune pig. The reason for this decision are:  Comparatively long life - 10-15 years, comparable to a dog or cat. Small stature (100-200 lbs, 2’ tall, fully grown after three years, likely well after our lease terminates with the church) Cost of veterinary services - Pig vaccines are widely available at feed stores, and even having them applied by a veterinarian is under $40 every six months. Apart from vaccinations, watching their food, and hoof trimming, they require no additional special medical care. Intelligence - They are just as intelligent and capable as dogs, and are easy to train. Wife’s personal needs - As this is for emotional support, we wanted an animal that would be both bonded with her and independent enough to not need constant attention. Pigs can be as independent as cats, but love human attention as much as dogs. This was an acceptable in-between. Allergy Concerns - While ESA’s aren’t provided the same rights as service dogs with regards to public access, we wanted an animal not likely to raise allergy concerns in the event we recieved written permission to bring him into public areas such as the mall. Cat and dog allergies are common, mostly due to their saliva and fur. Kunekune and pig allergies are much less rare, and typically only involve being allergic to ingestion of the meat.  2:00 p.m. - Sent our landlords (Who happen to be a church), an email regarding my wife’s prescription, explaining some of the situation, and stating that we are understanding that we are responsible for certain liabilities with the animal. I also provided a copy of the prescription along with an offer to sign any additional legal documents requested by the church.  July 16th, 2017 - We went to Ohio and obtained the emotional support animal.  July 17th, 2017 10:00 a.m. - Landlord secretary replied as she was out of the office the previous week. She said she would contact the board for us and asked for information on the animal.  2:00 p.m. - I responded with the requested information.  3:00 p.m. - Landlord secretary asked if we had any certifications from any organizations (CertaPet, etc) regarding the animal.  4:00 p.m. - Landlord secretary stated that she believed that we required the landlord’s permission for any emotional support animal due to insurance, etc.  4:00 p.m. - I replied to the 3:00 p.m. email stating that online certification programs were primarily scams, as only a medical professional can prescribe an emotional support animal. I then sent a second email letting the landlord secretary know to alert me to any insurance issues. It was my hope that with us already paying the $150/month additional pet fees that there would be enough available to cover any insurance cost adjustments, considering we would be responsible for any damaged caused by the emotional support animal. I also sent a third email to elaborate on the nondestructive nature of the Kunekune, and to express hope that their insurance would only have dog breed restrictions.  9:00 p.m. - I sent an email with a photo of my wife and the pig to demonstrate the emotional support animal’s small size.  July 18th, 2017 - 9:30 a.m. - Landlord secretary responded stating that the animal’s current size is irrelevant to their concerns.  July 20th, 2017 - 5:30 p.m. - I sent an email asking about the inspection date under our current pet policy, and gave details on the upcoming rent payments.  8:15 p.m. - Landlord secretary sent an email stating that local code prevented us from having the animal, and demanding the eviction of the prescribed emotional support animal.  Landlord secretary also stated that they had made several consultations, including an attorney, and informed us incorrectly that we would be responsible for any legal fees as per item number 23 in our lease. Item 23 specifically states that the party that loses the legal dispute would make those payments.  9:00 p.m. - I responded by attempting to explain and educate regarding the law and emotional support animals. I also researched the city’s ordinances, and noted that the line regarding pigs specifically named a specific species. I made several other attempts to dissuade the church from what would be a waste of church funds. I also alerted the church that I would be seeking an attorney and could provide contact information in the future if this course was unavoidable.  July 21, 2017 2:45 p.m. - Landlord secretary emailed me and provided multiple counter points to my previous response. I was also informed there will be an inspection on Monday, July 23rd, in order to ensure we have removed the animal. I was also instructed to keep all communication with the church written. Landlord secretary also attached the zoning ordinance regarding pigs in non farm zoned areas. However, this ordinance was from a small town nearby that is not the city which is the home's address.  5:00 p.m. - I responded stating that we would not be removing the pig, due to it being a legally prescribed animal protected by law. I also stated that due to their pursuit of the situation we would be providing contact information for our attorney.  I also informed the landlord secretary that as per previous situations involving my wife’s mental state, I would be forced to take off work on Monday, July 23rd, if they insisted upon attempting to inspect the house on a day I worked. I offered to schedule for July 29th instead. I also stated that I would reach out to the small town as I was confused as to which ordinances affect our home. Our home has a mailing address in a major city, and is also in an area with several farms as it is outside the main city limits and therefore there are already farm animals in the area.  I also apologized for any legal misinterpretations or misrepresentations I offered, and explained that I would be providing our attorney’s contact information after an initial consultation and filing some paperwork as I did not wish to further discuss items which are not my place of expertise.  I also provided another reminder in regards to rent for August, and asked if due to their previous statement on documentation if they would prefer I mailed the checks. If that is the case, I can not guarantee they will arrive by the 10th. If this is the method they would prefer, then I believe that would be permission to be late with checks (Within reason) without incurring the $65 late fee.  6:15 p.m. - I submitted a complaint to HUD for discrimination.	No
"As title says, I have lived in my house for just under a year. I began noticing an area in the back corner of my backyard was slowly eroding away every time it rained, and more recently the hole has grown to a very large size. In my closing documentation, it states that proper drainage was installed ""per Home Owner Warranty Act"" however clearly this is not the case, as every time it rains the water is slowly taking the earth away with it.    I have reached out to the builder with basically no luck, and all they have offered to do is fill the hole in with dirt for a ""cheaper"" price than what the going rate would be for a local contractor, but mentioned nothing about fixing the root cause, which is improper drainage. I brought out another independent contractor to evaluate the situation, and he pretty much told me the situation was pretty bad and gave me a quote for several thousand dollars to fix.    Do I have legal grounds to bring a lawsuit upon the builder? It has been under a year and this problem was brought on strictly due to there not being proper drainage in my lawn. Additionally, as the ground has eroded away, large chunks of concrete have been revealed, alluding to the builder just throwing all sorts of rubbish into the ground in order to build up the level of the yard during construction phase.    Any help will be appreciated."	No
Hi. My sister is 15 years old and I'm 24. I live on my own and have a stable job. Our mother recently remarried to a decent man, but he has three kids (18M, 17M, 13F) from an earlier marriage. The two oldest are constantly picking on my sister. They take stuff from her, go through her drawers, keep tampons and pads from her, feed her hamster things it shouldn't eat, the list goes on and on.   She's so broken up about this. I've tried talking to my mom and her husband about it, but they just brush it off as my sister overreacting and trying to get mom's new husband in trouble, which isn't true.   So, what I'm wondering is if it's legal for me to let her stay at my place? I won't be taking her out of state or keep her from seeing her family. Our mother will still be her guardian.   It's my sister who's suggested this, but I just want to make sure this is on the up and up. I don't want to get in trouble, but I desperately want to help my sister.   Thanks in advance!	No
I'm going to summarize a long story to ask this question; Over a year ago now I prepaid a firm to declare bankruptcy. Things seemed fine until I gave them the full amount in advance for the service. Then they disappeared for a month and when I finally did get a hold of them, they strung me along for another several months and refused to give my money back. Eventually after I reported them to the better business bureau, they agreed to pay 1/3 of the money back, but that was a month and a half ago and they still haven't sent the check... What can I do next to recover this money? This is in Ohio. Thank you!	No

I had a very, very bad experience with a dental  surgery the other day. Woke up during surgery, surgeon held me down and finished procedure with me wide awake, no pain meds, and left the room.

Hello all. My girlfriend and I recently rented an apartment in Atlanta, GA and have been living in it for the last 8 days. The apartment has gone from great to terrible in that short amount of time. I will list out the issues we have faced since our move in and will provide more detail if needed.  1. Potential gas leak. I informed the customer service manager of a potential gas leak in my apartment as both my gf and I smelt a strange gas-ish odor when using both the gas stove and gas-heated water. I reported this issue to them around noon of yesterday, but no maintenance personnel were sent out to investigate despite this being a potential serious issue. Concerned for our safety, I contacted the local fire department who sent out a fire unit to investigate my apartment. They found no gas leaks, but did uncover some other serious issues that I will list below.  2. Indoor AC/Water heating unit. When the fire department came to investigate the potential leak, they removed a locked maintenance door inside of my apartment. The maintenance room was locked and only the maintenance staff has the ability to look inside. After removing the door, the fire lieutenant informed me that the unit was incredibly old and that it has several code violations such as exposed wiring, no cover over the wiring, and cut wires which are just hanging out. Not to mention, the unit looks to be at least 20 years old and has never been maintained- it is truly disgusting with trash, dirt, and bugs everywhere and leads me into some of my next concerns. When the fire unit was here, they cut power to the unit and also turned the gas off to the stove and hot water as it seems they deemed it a large enough safety risk.   3. BUGS. Since we have moved in, we have seen 5 nymph cockroaches in our apartment. I say nymph because these roaches are small as if there is a nest in the area. We also photographed one of them and have identified it as a nymph German cockroach, which, from what I've read on the internet regarding infestations, basically means this complex is overrun and there is very little that can be done to eliminate the issue. I have no doubt that many of the bugs come from the maintenance room as it is truly dirty in every sense of the word. There are also cracks in the wall behind the stove which could also be an easy entrance for bugs.  4. Black mold. When the fire department came, they moved the stove to test for gas leaks. No gas leaks were found, but there appears to be black mold on the wall.   5. Bathroom faucet leak. The bathroom faucet is leaking from the wall where the faucet is attached. I have no doubt there is water damage behind the tub.  On move-in day, none of these issues were identified. We tested the stove and water and did not smell gas, we did not look in the maintenance door as it was locked and seems to always be locked unless a maintenance personnel comes to open it, we saw no bugs as they likely had no reason to come out as the apartment was vacant with no major food sources, we could not look behind the stove because it was nearly impossible to move (3 firemen were needed to move it from the wall), and the bathroom faucet did not seem to leak (at least not noticeably).  At this point, I believe the apartment is beyond repair. Management is very unresponsive here. There is always a line at the customer service office with people complaining (yesterday it seemed everyone was going on about their AC not working), so it's no doubt maintenance staff are overwhelmed, but that doesn't excuse the lack of concern for issues as serious as these.  Maintenance staff did finally get around to our unit this morning around 9 AM and told me that they will try to have the entire indoor AC/water heating unit replace, but that it will take at least a week for it to arrive. In the mean time, he flipped the power and gas back on to the stove and water heater and told me that it was safe to use- this completely contradicts the fire department as they obviously deemed it serious enough to turn off. He also told me that he will try to address the mold, however, I don't understand how he could address it without tearing the entire kitchen apart.  My girlfriend and I think it's best that we terminate the lease early and get out before anything else major happens. We have submitted a written termination request, but the management is trying to charge us outrageous fees for early termination. In the lease it seems there is no grace period if we are unsatisfied with the unit, and it seems there is a 60 day notice needed for the early termination which we will have to pay rent for the entire 60 days and then also pay another months rent as liquidated damages for early termination. The customer service manager yesterday quoted me around $2600 in total for the early termination which is absolutely insane.  I understand that we signed the lease and I did read through it before hand of course, but we had no idea that the apartment was in this condition and I don't believe some of our issues could have been identified without living in the complex. At this point, we are willing to write it off as a learning experience, but what I need to know is if there are any additional steps we can take to possibly get some of the early termination cost waved as many of these issues seem serious?   Is there anyone I can contact to help with a situation like this? I've contacted the fire department and am going to go get a copy of the report today and I've also contacted the local inspectors and am trying to get someone out here to confirm the code violations found by the fire department.  At this point my girlfriend and I are miserable and only want this nightmare to be over. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you.	No
My income is bitcoin-based, so I had some difficulty proving that I made 40x my rent to potential landlords.   Ultimately, my broker was able to negotiate a deal with one landlord to get an apartment that I love, but to make certain I paid on time, the landlord requested that I pay first and last month, plus the deposit up front (I paid my broker's fee in BTC) and then give him 22 checks, each dated for the month they were to be used. My agent says this is normal when people have unusual incomes or a history of not paying on time.  I moved in on July 14.  On Monday, the landlord deposited all 22 checks.  Fortunately, I had just over $80k in my account so the checks didn't bounce, but I was planning to use most of that money to pay a vendor. I'm now going to have to liquidate more BTC, which I was trying to avoid doing right after the split.  The landlord claims he was within his rights to cash all the checks, even though they were dated in the future. He said bitcoins were too risky and that he helped me out by making sure I have a place to live for the next two years. Can I sue the landlord to get my money back?	No
My uncle (54) is a severe alcoholic, and he's had this problem for many years. A family therapist has told us not to enable his drinking, so when he checked himself out of rehab against doctor's orders, my grandfather (80's) would not go to pick him up. My uncle paid another patient who was getting discharged that day to take him to get his car, and he went straight to grandma and grandpa's house to confront them. They would not let him inside the house, so he spent the entire night drinking vodka in their front yard. In the morning my grandma had to go to a doctor's appointment. As soon as the garage door was opened, my uncle attacked grandpa, shoving him up against the wall and screaming in his face. Grandma and grandpa got in their car and fled. Uncle searched until he found the spare key and let himself into the house. He has been there ever since.  My grandparents were too scared to go home, so they went to their lake cabin in another city. Uncle refuses to leave their house and is just in there drinking and eating all their food. This has been going on for over a week now. I told my grandparents that I wanted to call an elder abuse hotline or the police to get my uncle out of their home. My grandma screamed at me that I had better not do that, and that she will just tell the cops that he is allowed to be there and that he didn't hit anyone. She says she will not ruin his life.  Obviously, this situation can not go on like this but I am at a loss what to do. Do we really have no legal recourse if grandma lies to the police?  Are there any resources for people in our position?	No
Around 11 pm last night I was caught going 100 on a 55 mph highway (way too fast, I know), given a misdemeanor and a court date.   I've never been to court before and I am freaking out. I have a job and commute to two colleges, so more than anything I'm afraid of having my license suspended for 30 days.   What are the chances of a suspended license and should I get an lawyer?   Thank you for the help.	No
TLDR:  Guy bought property with terms:  if HST, then (price “HST Included”), else (certificate on closing).  Expected to receive input tax credit on HST; Property wasn’t subject to HST; No HST paid. Given certificate on closing; Guy still tries to claim HST input tax credit; CRA says no; Guy argues with CRA; still no; Guy sues seller.    The facts (If you want to read more. It’s dense and I warned you).  My friend &amp; her husband (both retired) sold a piece of vacant land: a hundred acres of junk (new-growth trees, rocks, swamp), at the edge of nowhere, previously severed from farm.    Agent explained that HST might be payable, might not.  Hard to tell, because farm, severance, etc...  Friend isn’t a tax expert, agent isn’t a tax expert.  It’ll all get sorted at closing.   Lists for $Y, friend wants minimum $X net.   $Y is much bigger than $X, of course.  Years pass (boonies:  location, location, location). Offer finally comes in.  Agent turns out to be agent for buyer and seller.   Price is strangely $X + agent commission + closing costs, minus a hundred bucks…  smells like agent telegraphed minimum but strange things are known to happen.  Friend lets it pass.    Useful bits of offer say: “if subject to HST, then HST is included in price, if not, vendor will deliver certificate on or before closing.”  Also says property is “vacant land”.  So far, so good.  Mutual understanding of the facts. Check.  Friend reviews offer: Maybe HST, maybe no HST… if no HST, friend will get $X, but if HST is payable, then friend will $X-HST. Nope on that offer.  Offer countered at $X + small negotiating room + legal bill estimate + commission + HST + more negotiating room.   Still way less than Y.   “Final offer” comes back at $Z =  $X + reduced agent commission + reduced legal bill + HST + 0.00 exactly.  Friend grumbles at strange twice in a row, but it’s the only offer in a long time, and it’s (barely) acceptable if HST.   She accepts.   Useful bits are the same, cause it was back and forth RE deal like usual and these clauses weren’t modified. Agreement also included a right of inspection of all terms by lawyers of Buyer, and cancellation by default if not waived by Date, plus return of deposit.   Lawyers for Buyer modify a few details in the title, adjust closing date.  Condition waived.   Closing is nigh: friend and husband meet with lawyers.  And the answer is: property is not subject to HST, so sign this certificate.  Certificate delivered.  Lawyers pore over details.  Two digits plus pennies of land taxes are added to the account.    Friends pocket $Z - commission - legals + two digits:  it’s bigger than $X by five digits. So they are happy.  Until this weekend.  Friend just served them a summons in small claims court, out in some county somewhere nowhere nearby.    It’s legit, so they plan to respond pronto.    Buyer claims after closing, and despite having been given certificate (which he doesn’t mention), “The Plaintiff subsequently applied for an HST rebate based on his belief that he had paid the HST included in the purchase price.”   CRA denied, on the basis that no HST had been paid (no kidding, it wasn’t owed).  Buyer calls CRA &amp; appeals, asks for ruling, finally gets long letter from CRA saying “no!” but taking several pages to do so.  Buyer is now claiming fraudulent misrepresentation: e.g. that friend fraudulently misrepresented to friend’s agent (conveniently not mentioning he is also buyer’s agent) that HST was payable, and Buyer relied on this agent who only tells truth, and Buyer’s whole deal was based on claiming input tax credit on 13% of the purchase price, which depended on Friend paying 13% HST, “included” in the price…  TLDR2:  Buyer who is impervious to information provided in written certificates claiming he relied on friend’s agent, who screwed him, claims friend is liable for the acts of friend’s agent, who was also buyer’s agent.  Any words of wisdom?  Strategy?	No
I have a friend, and due to the fact that she is gay, was kicked out of her home. She right now with family in Virginia, but thinks that she might get kicked out of there too, and might have to live alone in NYC or DC. Her location is in Tinton Falls, NJ, but now I don't know where in Virginia. Is she able to legally get back home? Or press charges on her mother if at all needed? I just want to know what her options are. Thank you	No
So my (18) family rented a house in VA which we recently moved from, now our landlord is trying to come after us for things that aren't even our responsibility. First he claimed we broke the lease w/o a 30 day notice and he was planning on taking us to court due to this, my father emailed him about moving out 4 times over the span of 70days prior to moving out with the exact move out date written within these emails. Now he is claiming that wasn't the case, even with email proof, and is forcing us to pay the last 3 months of rent, along with a broken lease fee, and keeping our security deposit.   We also have had  issues with the house as a result of poor up keeping on the landlords ends. The roof has leaked for the better part of a year and we have sent numerous emails back and forth with pictures attached of water damage (which was also noted by him before moving in as the people who were planning on moving in after us are close friends and he told them the water damage has been there for years) and is now charging us for the water and mold damage in the house due to the leaky roof. He also sent us his bill for landscaping cost which also wasn't a part of our lease.   What can we do about this. Do we get a lawyer? Any advice would be helpful	No
"Short version: My mother is mentally sick (depression) and is being coerced to regularly give someone large sums of money. I don't have enough details to go to the police. I don't think she's capable of caring for herself either. How can I ensure the safety of her self and finances?   Long version: This is long and I don't know where else to turn but the internet. My mother has been ill for a long time with a history of depression and bipolar II. We have a sizable family. A few years ago my father passed away; due to timing in everyone's lives, my brothers and sisters moved out (including me), to school or work or whatever. This lead to textbook empty nest syndrome which she never really recovered.  She eventually moved to NYC into an apartment that cost an obscene amount of money per month. Additionally, she leads a very expensive lifestyle she can't afford to sustain. She apparently has/had a lot of assets but I never did find out specifics of how much or where they came from but I don't care about that. Today I found out she has been giving money to an unknown stranger (she refused to tell me who, or why). I pressed hard but all I managed to get from her was ""he might hurt me"" if she refused. She repeatedly tells me she feels threatened and in danger but will not elaborate.  I am 8 hours away by car, 4 by plane in Bumfuck, Nowhere. I am only just making ends meet. My siblings live closer but only one of them is on speaking terms with her (her illness makes her unpleasant to interact with). Her friends have left her (likely the other way around), so she is alone. She is in a vulnerable position and it seems like no one is willing to help. And I can't help personally because of how far away I am. She's old and vulnerable.  Nearly all of these details are vague and nebulous. She won't tell me anything about where her money came from, or who this mystery person is or why she's giving him money or why she feels unsafe.   * How can I protect my mother when I don't even know what's threatening her? * How can I ensure she gets the medication and prescriptions she needs? * Can I legally force her into someone's care? Are there programs to pay for this? * I've no interest in her finances but how can I protect her assets so she can live comfortably?  * To be honest I'm not even sure I can convince her to budget even if all of the above was taken care of. * I don't think a nursing home is an option. Elderly abuse is a huge problem, and I'm not certain she'd let herself live in a nursing home.  I don't know what to do. Sorry for the brain vomit but all of this came up suddenly. I greatly appreciate any advice of any sort."	No
I was driving home from the gym and there was a car parked in the narrow street right outside the gym. I thought he stopped for the red light but he was parked the entire time. As I was waiting there thinking he would move a car hit me from behind going slowly. I was driving at pathfinder whereas he had something along the lines of an accord ? And his license plate was dent whereas nothing really happened to my car. When i went home however I noticed that my rear bumper had a crack on it not really noticeable. Unfortunately I'm an idiot and didn't bother exchanging information with him. Can I still ask him to fix it ?  	No
Landlord told us that we could get an overnight parking sticker for free from the city, but it turns out overnight parking stickers don't exist. He told us all of his tenants used that lot and had for years so he clearly lied. We have already paid a security deposit but not rent, can we cancel and get our money back?	No
My wife and I rent an apartment with central air.  The unit wasn't working correctly last week and we had to ask the property manager several times to get someone out there to take a look at it.  The technician came out, looked at it, and said that it needed to be replaced.  The property manager brought out a window air conditioner that we can use.  It cools the living room, but the bedrooms are still very hot.   We asked when the air conditioner was going to be replaced.  It's mid-July and we are under a heat advisory.  He told us that he was going to bring us a better window unit this week.  We asked him again when the air was going to get fixed.  He got snapping with us and said it would be fixed eventually.   Is there anything that we can do to get a new air conditioner?  Should we contact the city?     We signed a twelve month lease last year.  That ends next month and then we go month to month.  We are talking about moving out, but we also don't want to deal with that hassle.  We don't want to move our son to a different school.	No
I want to note that the hospital is in VA and we are living in NC.. don't know if that makes a difference.   My father had a procedure to remove kidney due to cancer. When they got in there they found his kidney was stuck to his small intestines, turning a 4-5 hour surgery into an 8-9 hour surgery.    Upon waking up my fathers only complaint was hip pain and he complained through the night. They said it was due to laying on that hip so long, because he's a big guy. Next morning the doctor comes in and he complains to doctor that did testing and found that his muscle in the hip/rear was dead /dying.. similar to a crush injury. From lying on it so long. They rolled him into surgery and removed a large chunk. Later that week they removed more .   This muscle dying released proteins or toxins that damaged his other *only* kidney and he is now on dialysis, and we are hoping for a good recovery   At this time we are not sure of the long term effects on his mobility etc from losing so much muscle in his rear. We also do not know if the kidney damage is permanent.   We feel that the positioning during surgery should have been evaluated when they realized it was going to be a far longer surgery and the inaction of the care providers after he complained about major hip pain should have raised red flags and been attended to sooner thus preventing so much proteins and toxins from damaging his kidney so bad.   Please excuse my lack of medical jargon and let me know if you need any more details to give me an idea if we have something to pursue here .	No
Hello /r/legal advice, I am an emancipated minor in the state of California. I had my hearing in June and the judge granted my petition - I have all of my legal documentation. I also have a passport card I got when I was 14. I'm visiting my godmother in San Diego and I'm thinking of spending a day in Tijuana. Will being 17 but emancipated pose an issue?	No
"Here's the original post:  ""I just found out that my ex never filed the paperwork I gave him IN NOVEMBER because he ""couldn't afford"" the $200 fee. Other than the fact that I'm still legally married to this fucking loser, I can't get financial aid for spring and summer because they want proof of a divorce that never actually happened. I'm fucking irate. This is just a testiment to how immature and selfish he is. I was actually doing him a favor by making him pay the $200 because he originally owed me $450, but I said I'd forget about it if he paid for the divorce. Now, as a student, he expects ME to pay for it, even though he works full-time and is just irresponsible with his money. I hope his girlfriend sees all this and has second thoughts.""   I'm coming up on my deadline and have no idea what to do. I already missed out on an education when I married him and I don't want to have to work low-wage jobs forever just because my ex is a fucking idiot."	No
So I have a very interesting situation. I am transferring colleges and signed a lease for an apartment at a brand new apartment complex with two other roommates. One of these roommates is an employee for the new apartment complex and is offered a 15% discount on the rent of the apartment which is over $2200. While searching for places to live, myself and the other roommate were told we would get to share in the 15% discount equally as a way to attract us to sign the lease. When I went into the office to go over the lease I was reassured by the leasing agent and the leasing manager that I would, as a non-employee roommate of an employee, get the 15% discount as well. The leasing manager even called my employee roommate to confirm that he was going to split the discount evenly between us three (he could have taken the whole discount for himself).   Now, a week before we are allowed to move in I get a voicemail from the leasing manager telling me that I do not get the discount because I am not an employee and have to pay the original rent cost. Upon calling back I spoke to a leasing agent (not the leasing manager) who was still under the impression that we would be getting the discount even though we are not employees. This means multiple employees who are living at this complex were told that their roommates would be getting the discount as well and now myself and my non-employee roommate have received voicemails notifying us that we are not getting the discount.   What can I do about this? There are multiple verbal agreements between myself and other tenants that non-employee roommates would receive the 15% discount but nothing was on paper. Can I fight this or do am I shit out of luck on this one?   Thank you in advance!	No
I'll try to keep this short. My sister's ex-husband (whom she has a child with) is in the middle of a custody battle with his ex- girlfriend over a toddler. He called my sister and asked her to give a statement to his lawyer complimenting his parenting  style over  their own kid. Problem is that they've had some real issues precisely with co-parenting. One summer he came with all clothes that were too small and had to buy him a new wardrobe etc... She's been mulling over this for a while. Wondering about retaliation if she didn't. I think it's a bad idea and she should wash her hands all together of the her ex and his fight with the other woman. Thoughts?	No
My mom has schizophrenia. Her brother is the trustee of a large inheritance given to her by her Dad. This inheritance is her main source of income. He's also the executor of my Dad's estate who just recently passed away.   My uncle wants to sell her house and put her in a assisted living home. She's only 60. She wants to stay in her home, where we she is currently being taken care of by a caregiver.   He's not providing her any sort of autonomy or transparency about the decisions he's making. He also refuses to allow me to have any  knowledge of how much she has and how its being invested. I know she has (800k+).  Right now I'm trying to figure out where her rights start and his end. And also if it would be worth applying for guardianship, I'm only 25 and not exactly that established yet. Would applying for her guardianship allow me to hold him accountable for decisions?  I just hate the idea that he's making these life decisions she doesn't agree with. He's doing this under the guise of it being in her best interest, but if that were the case he would allow her to be apart of that decision and would be sensitive to the fact that her husband just died four months ago. He wants the sell the house she's lived in for over 17 years and put her there within the next few months. From my understanding he wants to do this to lessen his responsibilities of taking care of her.   I'm also concerned about him making decisions about the kind of medical care she receives. She has the mental capacity I believe to make her own medical decisions. With other family members in the past, he has prioritized money over care, and I would hate to see him do the same thing with my Mom.   Does anyone have any idea about how to approach this? I don't where to start or how I go about any of this. Am I asking the right questions?	No
" I'm sorry for any errors, i do not post on reddit very often.  I currently live in an apartment complex in the middle Tennessee area. My central air conditioning unit went out about a month ago. For the first two days it was 90 degrees in my apartment even with the windows open. Eventually the apartment gave us a window unit that it is the spare bedroom of my apartment and that has been the end of the repairs even though during he day it is still 80 degrees in my apartment. I have gone down to the office several times, I've called them, maintenance will come in every now and then maybe once a week to ""fix it"" and then leave and I never hear from them about it for at least another week. They don't really seem to care.  I've talked to other residents and they are having the same problem getting things fixed. A girl even told me that there is mold growing in her apartment because they won't fix her dishwasher properly.  Does anyone know if there is anything I can do to get my a/c fixed? The window unit is very expensive comparatively to central air and I'm pretty tight on expenses.   Any advice would be helpful, I had just renewed my lease before this happened so I am stuck here for at least another 11 months."	No
My sister is pregnant and she wants to get an abortion. In our home state (Texas) after talking to an abortion clinic it seems like they require one parent to be notified and consented. Our parents do not know about the pregnancy and will not consent, not in a million years.  So I guess the question is how much of a legal trouble would we be in if I took her to an abortion clinic in New Mexico? Which doesn't seem to require parental consent or notification. There is one less than two hours away, I can take her and being her back the same day, tell our parents that we were hanging at my place or went to a zoo or something.  Ideally they wouldn't ever know about it but let's assume they figure it out somehow, can I (or her) be in any legal trouble here?	No
"Hi All, We (Family of 4) are currently living in Boston and leasing a property. It is an old brownstone multi-story with different tenants on each floor. We are very clean people who occupy the bottom two floors.  We recently (after 6 months or so) began to notice pest droppings on the floor, it turns out it is from mice. New people moved in upstairs recently and we think the mice probably got into the building during the process. We informed the landlord immediately and sent pictures etc. and he came and set some traps, but suggested there was no point in an exterminator (""they only set traps too""). Every day since we are finding mice droppings in the home. There are gnaw marks on the floorboard by the wall, we noticed lots of holes in the old bricks on the wall, and they are able to travel up through the floorboards from inside the cavity behind the wall downstairs. Generally there are holes in a lot of places, and we have been trying to plug them up with steel wool etc. We have young two kids (1 &amp; 2 y.o.) and are fearful of one of them picking up droppings or a mouse entering their room/crib and biting them or carrying disease. Essentially we want to vacate the property asap, we don't feel safe and are uncomfortable eating or sleeping here. I have already killed one mouse but have also seen more. Our rent is around $3000 a month and we are unsure of whether we can claim back any of the rent we have paid out once we vacate. Our lease is up on 9/1 and has already been paid until then. Do we just walk away, could we claim back some of the 4500 or so we have paid? Any advice would be appreciated."	No

My parents bought their California house in 1981 and their property value never goes up for property tax reasons.  Does anyone know what law caused them to have this benefit?  It's not proposition 13 because their property value doesn't even go up 2% each year.  They are in San Bernardino County in California in case that's relevant.    I believe that people who bought their house at a later year don't get this benefit because their next door neighbor bought about eight years later and has a substantially higher property value for property taxes.

"I'll start with the brief background.  My mom has been an alcoholic for just under a decade, and she dragged my dad into it for a while too. My sisters and I were emotionally abused and berated for the last 5 years or so. I was getting the most of it and would instigate to prevent it from getting to my sisters, but I was at University this last year and it got to them.  Finally, my mom got into rehab. Instead of getting better, she cheated on my dad with an alcoholic 25 years older than her in rehab and abandoned us for him after getting out. She's refusing to help with any bills, even though my dad can't cancel her off the phone plan without paying a $600+ fee. She won't help with any of my sisters' activities costs or my schooling.  I'm 19 now. I built my car up from scratch with my dad, and it was given to me for my birthday at 16. Stayed in parents' names for insurance purposes. I've got a job now and am paying my own things because my dad can't afford it all on his own, but my mom is refusing to sign anything over. She won't sign off on the title of my car to me, or even my sisters car to her. She changed our legal address on our accounts so all of our bills, which she isn't helping with at all, go to wherever she is and we can't access them.   She's literally holding everything in our life ransom because she got sober for a hot minute and ""fell in love"" with this guy and has gone completely loony on us. (Yet she keeps texting us kids how much she loves us.) As a result of this, in addition to paying my own things as I mentioned above, I'm having to send my dad hundreds of my earned money (which I desperately need because Michigan raised public university tuition prices almost 3% again this year) because he can't afford everything on his own.  She apparently wants to do an ""easier"" (I know it's never really easy) divorce that doesn't require court or anything, just filling out the documents and seeing a judge or something, I don't completely understand how it works. My dad is trying to fill out the divorce documents, but it's hard. He's been struggling massively with depression since all of this started happening. (To make it worse, my internship is 10 hours away in Minnesota, so I can't be physically there to help.)  I guess the question/advice I'm seeking, is what are our legal rights against my mom as the remainder of our family (Me, dad, sister 16, sister 14), and what are my legal rights against my mom in terms of my car, when I have my dad's backing? (The plates and everything expire this month and I don't know what to do.)  Title has MI in it, but for clarification, we live in Southwest Michigan. Even though I'm in Minnesota for the whole summer my legal address is still our home there.  Thanks everyone. I'm sorry if this was a bit too long; I'm an avid reader of this subreddit, never thought I would need to use it for something like this, though."	No
"I am the only one of my 4 roommates moving out. I am moving out of my apartment on August 2nd. The next tenant waived the ""clean up"" period to move in as soon as I move out. The apartment complex told me that they don't prorate rent and that I need to pay the full month, but told the other guy that they DO prorate rent and that he would have to pay for the time he lived in the apartment, which is essentially the whole month. So they are basically charging both of us a full month's rent for the same room in the apartment. Is it legal for them to prorate for him but not for me? They are double dipping and it feels illegal, but I'm not a lawyer."	No
"Like the title says, I'm currently staying in a student residence that's not technically affiliated with the college anymore (commonly referred to as ""old rez""), and there's literally a mushroom growing out of an opening in the wall, not to mention mold spots bleeding through the paint near the shower. And for the past 2 years, rent for this place has gone from $450, to $470, to apparently $495 next year. For a tiny bedroom, a tiny kitchen with one fridge, and a tiny living room, in a suite shared by 5 other people with equally tiny bedrooms. And though I've been looking at any other alternative, there are few available that are going to be cheaper than $500 a month, which I can't afford right now. Is there any way to turn this into a beneficial situation for myself? I have a picture of the mushroom that I imagine would be pretty fucking damaging to their reputation."	No
Sorry about formatting, on mobile.   Was running my in unit AC when I noticed that smoke was starting to billow out of it. I touched the sides of the unit and it was scalding hot. When I opened the unit I found Styrofoam pieces inside of the unit taped on by maintenance to jam the large fan. This jamming is what lead to the fire hazard.  Upon unjamming the fan and turning it back on, the unit would shake uncontollably, becoming a further hazard.  I have photos of the inside of the unit and the Styrofoam bits that were placed inside of it.    Do I have any legal grounds here because if I was not in the apartment it surely would have escalated to a fire.  I am located in Centre county Pennsylvania.	No

"Hi all,   So I had a lapse of judgment and got caught up in a craigslist apartment rental scam. I live in NY, and was in NY when I transferred a security deposit plus 6 months rent to a 'landlords' bank account for an apartment I was going to rent in California. It wasn't until the landlord requested a $10K 'immediate refundable credit check' that required me sending him an additional $10K that he would then immediately send back, that I became suspicious. I have never met this landlord, nor seen the apartment, and in retrospect there were a lot of signs that this was a scam that I missed. Since requesting this credit check from, I have taken the following actions:  -I saved and printed out my email conversation, and all text messages, with the individuals I was in contact with.  -I researched who the real owner of the apartment is, and have been trying to get in touch with that individual to confirm he is not renting out his apartment. I want to be 100% sure this is a scam, with proof, which is why I've reached out to him.  -I called a local California police department, and they directed me to go to a NY police department since ""I was in NY at the time I made the funds transfer, therefore I am a victim in NY and should go through a NY police department"".   -I went to a NY precinct with the emails / texts / bogus lease printed out. In order to confirm this was a scam, the NY officer told me to request from the landlord a refund in the form of a bank certified check (that way I don't have to give him my bank account info). If the landlord refused to refund my cash, the police officer said I could return to the station to file a police report. He also said that I should call up the Cali PD again and push to have them work on this, since the apartment is in Cali and since I'm moving there in a week.   -Today, I am going to go to my bank of america branch and talk with someone there about possibly reversing the transfers I sent. I will also call the scammers bank and see if they can freeze his account.  -After the bank, I plan on heading to the FBI offices in NYC with all of the evidence that I have (the texts, emails, lease, bank transfers, name of real owner, the scammers bank info) and hope to convince them to look at the case. I'm going to say that this scammer could be scamming other people as well, and therefore it's worth their time.    Other than that, I'm not sure what routes I can go. Any thoughts are appreciated with regards to the best path moving forward."	No
"Someone I know is pregnant and due in 12 weeks. During her pregnancy, she has casually and infrequently used opiates, bentos, amphetamines as recently as last week. She is not physically addicted to anything and isn't a regular user. She has agreed to stop for the remainder of the pregnancy but I have read newborn meconium tests go back 20 weeks. As far as she knows, she hasn't been drug screened at her checkups, or at least they haven't said anything.    1) When the baby is born, will it be tested?  2) If the results are positive, what will happen?  3) Would it be advisable for her to confess to her doctor now rather than being ""caught""? 4) She also has a toddler. If CPS is involved, will it involve her current child too?   I don't support her actions but unfortunately it's happening.

This is the [relevant part of the lease](http://i.imgur.com/jL2qw3N.png) about move out, which references these [move out cleaning instructions &amp; fees](http://i.imgur.com/9HNGJY4.png) that I received from the front office. The office also mentioned verbally: &gt; You'll probably get charged about $50 for carpet cleaning or you can show a receipt as proof of cleaning from your own cleaners or rugdoctor rental for example).   Being pressed for time I decided to assume the charge, besides, I'm a clean &amp; responsible renter so no worries right? After I got done cleaning I decided to walkthrough &amp; take video of the entire vacant unit... just in case.  Later I'm charged $195 for carpet cleaning. The complex won't budge and could only provide the [invoice from their cleaner](http://i.imgur.com/JVqDdeW.png). The complex says that they usually they take pics but for some reason couldn't find the ones from my unit. The parent company (receivables) also won't budge, even after providing my video and referencing the relevant sections of the lease &amp; cleaning instructions posted above.   Overall I would expect to pay about $65 for our final move out balance: Security deposit - ($50 carpet + a second legit charge).  I refuse however pay the extra $140 on principle. I intend to send a $15 check for everything else, leaving the full carpet $195 outstanding until there is resolve. What are my options here? At a minimum I don't want this to impact my credit.   Additional notes:  * I had a 2bdr unit, the bedrooms were the only carpeted areas * I had a dog, but it was strictly forbidden from entering the bedrooms * I can post screencaps of the final carpet if relevant, but I don't think it is given the above cleaning instructions. FWIW I think it was in good - not great - condition. There was one spot with slight discoloration about 3ft in diameter)	No
"My sister's roommate gave us her old washer and dryer to replace our older washer and dryer. Sunday afternoon, the moving company that the roommate hired brought them to us and installed them both, but it felt like they were rushing things to get out of there. They left and forgot to turn the water back on, which I realized when I tried to give the washer a test run.  Today (Tuesday), I discovered that the floor in the laundry room had water under it. In addition, the wall of my bathroom was wet, and a puddle has formed behind the toilet (laundry room and bathroom are back-to-back). I turn off the washer's water valve and my sister called a plumber for me. He found out that the washer's connection to the house's water valve wasn't tightened and was leaking water when turned on, and he was able to turn it a good 5 or so times to tighten it. My sister also had to call a carpet cleaner company to come dry the affected floors and walls, which they're doing now.  My sister called the movers and told them the situation and asked for reimbursement. They refused, saying that it wasn't their fault since they weren't the ones that turned on the valve. They also said that if they really didn't tighten it, then it would've leaked while they were there (it didn't leak while they were there because they forgot to turn on the water though). My sister decides that she'll have to take them to small claims court.  So I'm not exactly familiar with how these proceedings work, so what exactly should we do here? I feel like we have somewhat of a solid case, but I don't want anything to go wrong. Do they have a case for anything with the point of ""we didn't turn on that valve, we can't be responsible?"" I want to say it sounds stupid, but I could be wrong. Any advice?"	No
"We purchased a new build home under a year ago. We have water damage and mold caused by an AC unit leak. The installer has admitted fault and restoration efforts have begun.

We have lost use of a bedroom, a bathroom, and occasionally lose use of our living room. We are also taking extensive time off for numerous restoration and electrical appointments. Are we able to seek damages for inconvenience/pain/suffering as this is resulting from builder negligence?"	No
"I understand that getting legal advice like this on the internet can be complicated and I'm certainly not looking for definitive answers. I'm also aware how during a divorce there is always hearsay and he-said, she-said or just the old two sides to every story. I would ask though that given this is my life and my family, whom I know intimately and have decades of anecdotal evidence I'm basing this off of. I would ask that within the constraints of this post we just more or less take my statements and fact and then offer your advice accordingly. My intention here is to find a starting point with some good professional advice in what is likely to be a long and complicated road ahead.  My mother married a mentally unstable and physically abusive/alcoholic narcissist. It has taken me many years of living on my own to be able to get my bearings and see him for what he is and although he was certainly not always this way he has started to get worse as it seems he's now working towards an agenda.   I don't see him as this particular mastermind as it is clear he is riddled with mental issues which have gone undiagnosed all his life as he both denies any and all of it and also refuses treatment. However I have recently learned from my mother that a woman, lets call her Becky, with whom my father has had an affair with in the past is back in the picture. Rather she never left the picture, it's just that Becky and my father have gotten sloppy and my mom has noticed. Becky it seems also has a long history, looking back in hindsight, of being EXTREMELY effective at manipulation and extracting money from people. My father is also one of those people (some of you may be able to relate) who puts external social validation WELL above the needs/validation of family....  Becky started out as a family friend about ~15yrs ago. Because my father so vehemently vouched for her it took a long time for her shitty personality traits to shine through on its own and about 9 yrs ago my mother, brother and I all confronted my father and explained to him that she is no good. That we no longer are willing to deal with or finance any of her bullshit. Especially if it means doing so puts our family in financial distress. Then perhaps 5 yrs ago my mother had to overhaul their finances and discovered my dad had several maxed out CC's which he was in the process of having sent to collections. At the time just his off-center personality explained these away and we did not dig into it much more but I've recently found out. That as far back as 3 yrs ago my mother was informed through a trusted friend that Becky and my father were seeing each other a few times a year.... every year... now those CCs make more sense. My father also has not worked a 9-5 in his entire life. He has had some work in the past but has mostly been living off my mother and drinking for the last ~10yrs.  Again, I have to stress that I don't think my father is capable of scheming so much as Becky is capable of putting thoughts and words into his head. It would seem that he is convinced that if my mother were to divorce him, since they live in California, he would get alimony and half of the assets. He and my mother are on the deed to their house however my mother is only one supporting them and paying the mortgage. Given the most recent phone calls I've had with my mother and hearing the distress in her voice with all the mental gymnastics my father knows how to put people through I get the impression he is hoping that a suicide would leave everything to him. Not that he can afford the mortgage, but he could certainly liquidate, downsize and then Becky would be able to live off of that for quite some time. The thing we discovered about Becky, again, hearsay, but people who know her who have reached out to us... this was many years ago. Said she was involved with another man in the exact same way. She leeched off of him and his family for many years and then the wife ""killed herself."" I'm laying this out because this is the kind of sick and twisted people my father is associated with. I wouldn't put anything past him at this point because he does own guns and I'm sure if Becky told him to kill my mom, he would just do it. He has done more irrational things in the past on a whim and I know in a divorce situation emotions run high and these threats can be thrown around without there usually being much validity. It's just that knowing my father I know he is more than capable of it because he's not mentally sound and he's clearly working for the interests of a person who while not crazy is certainly not a good person and like my father I feel I would be making a mistake by believing there is some line of rationality and reason which these people will not cross.  In my mind I want to treat this as a ""Hope for the best, prepare for the worst"" kind of situation.  I hope that was mostly coherent enough, as it is I had to spend 30min on the treadmill to clear my head enough and organize my thoughts.  Any advice is much appreciated."	No

No
Quick summary: a move in special concessions was offered when my roommate and I signed our lease. For a 1x1, the offer was 2 free months of rent. For a 2x2, the offer was $1,000 payable towards rent.  When negotiating, the agent made the mistake of offering us 2 free months amounting to about $3,700. This was later reflected in the lease, which was signed by my roommate, myself, and the leasing agent representing the complex.  We've moved in just a few days ago, and the agent has realized their mistake. They'd like us to come in and sign an addendum changing it to $1,000.  Question: we've got no legal obligation to sign this addendum, yes? It was their mistake. They're just as responsible for reading a document they're drafting and signing as we are. Even if it was a mistake, the lease is now binding.  I'll attach some pictures in the comments including the page of the lease concerning the money as well as their request to sign an addendum.	No
So, I entered a 14 month lease June of last year. This is all in Wisconsin. Around December of 2016, family issues required me to move away, and I talked with my landlord about finding someone to replace me on the lease. He said I would have to pay the lease breaking fee and all rent until the new roommate took over. I asked if I could apply my $500 security deposit toward my $600 lease breaking fee, and landlord declined. So I remotely find a replacement guy around February, and he moves in, no problem. I don't ask him to pay the security deposit, as i hadn't listed it as a requirement in my advertisement. I just figured i could get it back when the lease ended at the end of July. No issues until now. I call to check in with my landlord about getting the security deposit returned to me, and he claims that I am no longer on the lease and therefore my replacement roommate has the right to my share of he security deposit despite him never paying the security deposit. Landlord claims I need replacement roommate's consent to release the security deposit back to me. Now, replacement roommate seems like a nice guy, and I think I can ask him to do the right thing and he will. But did I really lose the right to my security deposit when I canceled my lease?   TL;DR  I had to cancel my lease and landlord still has my security deposit. Landlord says my replacement roommate is entitled to the security deposit and I need his consent to get it back. Is this true? I'm in WI.	No
"I know, I know, but my friend is looking into getting a divorce.  She is a natural-born citizen who lives in Pennsylvania, and he is in the end-stages of getting his citizenship (from the UK) through their marriage.  As far as I know, all assets (house, cars) are in her name and she has been paying the bills.  I helped her with his citizenship paperwork when it was at the point where he was switching from a green card to a citizen.  The fact that he had joint pay-in to their bank accounts was included in the final interview paperwork.  As far as I know at the moment, he is waiting on the final decision.   His original UK passport however has lapsed.   There have been problems cropping up in their marriage.  He is ""threatening"" to go back to the UK.  Regardless of what he ends up deciding, can anyone here recommend what, if any, type of specialized lawyer she might need in case of a divorce?  Any kind of advice would be very appreciated.  Thank you in advance for your time."	No
So I accidentally gave a last month rent check to my landlady so requested it back (I paid 1st &amp; last month at the beginning). She refuses to give back $50 of it for a DirecTV remote control I never used but cannot find (her place is a mess, and honestly I saw it once at the beginning when she offered and I refused, since I didn't even have a TV).  I don't want the headache, so I agreed to cover the cost, so I asked for a copy of the receipt. She said she already bought it and it gets added on her TV bill, ok so I said I can wait for the bill, I just need a copy. She still refuses and now says I'm harassing her (I do admit I called her a bunch of times on Sunday because while I was freaking out, I always saw her with her phone almost 24/7 so I also freaked out about her being not ok), but I sent her mostly texts and a few emails because 1) she didn't answer at all 2) and most importantly, to keep a documented trail of the situation.  Is there any legal way to prevent her from getting her way? Or just let her get her extra $50.	No
Im kind of in a bind and really need help with my forms. I live in Massachusetts but im filing for divorce in Rhode Island. The residency requirements there are that one spouse must have lived in the state for a year prior to filing, which my spouse has. However, the first line of the Complaint asks me to verify that ive lived in the state for that period. Do i leave it blank?   Also, we don't have children so do i need to file the forms regarding children with N/A or not file them at all.   My last question pertains to the financial form. I filled it out to the best of my knowledge but there is a part on the top for total liabilities but seeing as i didn't list any Im not sure whether to write N/A or leave it blank.   Im sorry to put this on you guys but im filing Monday and haven't been able to afford a lawyer so doing it myself has been tough. Any help would be awesome and Id be soo grateful.	No
My friend and I had signed a lease and gave our banking information for an apartment unit on July 27th for one year.  Today I found out that our unit has been double booked and the lease has been signed by other people who had signed to pay a higher rent ($1495, we signed for $1150).   Apparently, the owners said our rental price was too low for the three bedroom unit we are renting..but we had already signed the lease with the property manager or whoever was showing us the property with that price ($1150).   She's calling me back later today, but I just want to know what I need to do or say. We had signed the lease already, can they just drop us like that?  I have an email copy of the lease with the rent stated and date we signed.	No
So... When I was 17 I decided it was a good idea to begin taking out school loans (10,000-12,000 per year for 5 years) to go to a private Christian college. Dumbest decision of my life. This is my ONLY regret in life so far. I can't believe NO ONE told me it WASN'T a good idea to be taking out this much money in loans. I didn't even enjoy my time in college. It was terrible and the school was going through financial difficulties and it impacted the students negatively (so I feel that I didn't even get a quality education). Now it's been 3 years since graduation and I'm still regretting all of this. Almost every day I wish there was a way to retract my debt (even if it means retracting my BA). I'm sure I'm just screwed, but legally is there anything I could do to get out of this debt? Like suing the school or something? I'm sure there's not but it's on my mind pretty much all day everyday so I figured I'd at least ask. Thanks in advance!	No
"I work at a state park in Nebraska. I am currently the only one working in a small store. On my off days someone else works so I have 2 days off. My hours have recently been changed to factor in a half hour lunch, and I am currently at a point where I work exactly 40 hours a week. However, my boss told me that I will have to take a ""working lunch."" That essentially means I remain in the building and continue to work through my lunch, but I am not paid for it. My math shows that I am missing out on 2.5 overtime hours every week.  I am currently a part time employee, so they do not want me working over 40 or else the state gets upset. I told a colleague about my situation and he suggested I keep working until I am done for the season, then pursuit legal action. Tonight at the end of my shift I'm going to collect all past pay stubs and keep them organized.   Am I being wronged here? I just want an outsider opinion on the situation."	No
My friend (not birth mother) asked me today if it is legal to adopt a child by signing the certificate at birth. Her co-worker (birth mother) is pregnant and wanting to put the baby for adoption. My friend and her husband have been thinking about adopting. The co-worker and my friend have the idea that when the baby is born my friend simply signs the certificate at the hospital with her husband and just like that the baby is adopted to them.  She is asking me what I think and I think it sounds illegal but I have no idea. Maybe the community here can give some in sight.   Note: If it is illegal they will NOT do it that way obviously. I suggested they see some one for a consultation to tell them their rights and explain CA's laws. 	No
Basically, it's pretty straightforward. I moved into my current house last january, after starting a new job. I paid my first three months in advance as a sign of good faith, and lived here since. My last position ended in November of 2016, and I didn't have a job until May. Obviously, being unemployed made it hard, even with a roommate and girlfriend, to always make the rent and bills. (my girlfriend had her own place til May, roommate moved out in may.) In March, april, and May, I paid the rent before the fifth of the month; in part because the 1st fell on a weekend. I was a week late in June and July because my new position and bills and my car dying made money extremely tight. I had originally signed a lease from january 2016-january 2017, but because he was busy, we didn't resign the new one until march, so it goes until march 2017. I cant' find a paper copy, but I was under the impression there were no late fees until the fifth. As of July 9th, my landlord basically let his brother be in charge, as he didn't want to do the landlord thing anymore. As of the 12th, out of nowhere, he sent me a letter saying I owe 175 in back rent (late fees) for march to july, or I must vacate the property by the 22nd of July. Basically 10 days to pay late fees I didn't know were an issue, or I'll be homeless. My girlfriend and I both work 35 hours a week at 10 dollars an hour and share a car; but it's impossible to keep up with bills. Is there anything I can do? We live in Indiana. We may be able combined with our paychecks this week to pay the past due, but then we won't have the ability to buy groceries for the week or the gas to get to work.	No
My husband and I are pretty sure we just witnessed a raid in our expensive apartment complex. Due to his job sensitivity, we don't want to live in a place like this any longer. Can we break our lease due to feeling unsafe? Our apartment complex might be filed with rich, drug dealing college kids. (Also, we're pretty sure our mailbox got broken into the first month we moved in.)	No
Hello!  So about a few years ago my parents house in Texas got foreclosed on.   Recently my mom was contacted by someone who had been looking for her for a while. (She had a change of name) They sent her papers and said there was a surplus from the sell of the house.   The papers kind of look legit.   They said there is around $15k that my parents will receive. They just need to file these papers by the end of August.   They sent her: *An additional notice of surplus funds from trustee's sale *Statement of claim to surplus funds *A W9  I was unsure of what to do next.   1.) Is this a real thing and not a scam? 2.) How will this affect them the next time they file for taxes? 3.) Is there anything else I should know/look into?   Thanks so much for your help!! 	No
Gonna keep it short here, my friends came over to my house late at night in his VERY LOUD truck and they parked it in backyard to clean it, I allowed them but the noise was really overwhelming, a few violations were already put on the property because my dad had some work done without a license and a construction crew is coming today to do some more work. I was wondering if the noise could have some drawbacks since we might take the tenants who live on the second floor to court to evict them. I just want to know all the possible scenarios. Sorry for formatting I'm on mobile.	No
So my ceiling fell in on my apartment in one room a couple of days ago due to a leak from the apartment upstairs. There was water damage and mold everywhere. I was contacted by property leasing and was asked if I'd like to move to another unit. Fiancé and I said that was fine if we could get movers to help move our things as the new apartment is upstairs and fiances back isn't the best and it would probably kill us both. Landlord is supplying 2 men to help us move tomorrow. We started thinking about fees to move utilities to our new apartment and contacted the property leasing company asking if we could at least pay half of our rent this month since we have to pay all of these fees and we're not in a financial place to do so. That was a no. So I asked to speak to our landlord directly, and was told that all communication had to go through the property agency. So I firmly asked to reconsider because there's absolutely nothing we could have done to have this happen and how could we be expected to stay in a unit with mold that's actively being renovated on. We were met with the fact that we're lucky they aren't charging us to switch units and that we're also lucky they didn't start renovating before we moved our things. We were also told that a landlord supplying movers was absolutely unheard of. I'm just wondering if there's anything we're able to do legally?	No
My boyfriend's ex is taking him to court for additional child support. Without getting too much into the details, because I don't believe they are relevant...  He has been asked to fill out one of those income/expense worksheets. Obviously he has filled it out with the amount of the bills he pays (his portion of rent, etc) but it also asks for household size. We live together but are not married. Am I correct in assuming that the household size is 1 and not 2?   We live in New York, if it matters.	No
Hi, Forgive me for being an older guy with limited technology experience.  I recently had to move because of certain personal circumstances.  Because of my personal financial situations and some strange incidents, I am living extremely cheaply and I am living with college students.  All of the the roommates use a mobile application called Venmo.  From my own research, it appears that Venmo does create a record of transactions.  The landlord wants all of to use Venmo to pay him.  However, in the future if any legal disputes arise, how would I show records of Venmo in a court?  Is the validity of the records created by Venmo the same as those on a bank statement and other paper documents?	No
"Long story short but I video taped my wife and I having sex and sent it to her via Facebook messengers secret conversation. The video was 15 seconds long and she now claims that she was not a willing participant in the taping. Felony charges have been filled but I haven't actually been charged or arrested yet. I should know more in the next day or so. Needless to say I have an appointment with a divorce attorney first thing tomorrow morning. What are the chances that I will be charged and convicted of this and what does my sentence look like? I have no proof that she was a willing participant and there are plenty of texts saying ""I'm sorry. I thought you knew"" so it looks really bad on me.   I'm sure to be a nervous wreck over the next couple of days. "	No
My uncle is married to a women who has a child. They were married when the child (F/16) was about 8 or 9. Her bio dad is not involved in any way (I am not even sure he has ever interacted with or paid support for her).   There have been a few concerning moments that I have seen in the past. When she was 15 she was dating and 18 year old, and having sex with him, all with her mothers approval. When he broke up with her over text because he was apparently also sleeping with a different 15 year old her mom's response was that it wasn't a big deal, and there was no reason for her to have to talk to the child. I have also seen the mother freak out at her for no apparent reason to the point that my cousin was in tears, and for years they have locked certain rooms in the home (like the master bedroom and some other general living spaces) just because they don't want her to have any access to their space. I know her mother also has another child that lives with bio dad and mom has not seen in 5+ years.   Now the current problem is that they have apparently kicked her out of the house. I have no idea why but knowing all parties involved it was for something ridiculous. My cousin is a great student and, besides the one horrible dating choice, is generally responsible. She isn't doing drugs or anything like that. I only found out about this because she was meant to come to a family event and told me that she couldn't make it as she was currently working two jobs and crashing with friends.   Is the correct person to contact about this CPS? or the RCMP? They live in a very small community in BC, Canada.	No
I have a friend who has been staying at another friends house for nearly two months now. His mother was manipulative and he lived in unsanitary conditions, so he came nearby to live and prepare for college in a more quiet environment where he can be supported. His mother has been upset with him but recently threatened to call the police and call him as a runaway, as he did not leave with full permission. He does not want to return, if he turns 18 and she calls the police, will they do anything?  Or, if he accepts her buying a plane ticket now, but is booked after his birthday, would there still be legal referendums for either my possible runaway friend, or my friend who can be accused of harboring him, if he decides not to go, and she still calls the police on him despite him being over 18 now?	No
I came across the tenants rights of Washington website and discovered my previous apartment complex may have been in violation of some things that we were charged for. However, this all occurred almost 3 years ago...is it too late to do anything about it?	No
Hey Reddit,  I am a Canadian from Ontario who has had their amazon account stolen from them just minutes ago. They managed to also change the email and password before I could react. This individual has made a purchase from my credit card from London UK and I need to resolve this now. The genius who did this changed their shipping address that has a first name attached, their email and the address that their purchase is going to. So I know some decent information about this person (but could all be fake). I already called amazon.ca support and they took down my information about the incident including my name, email, the order code that had been sent to my email and my number.   What else do I need to do?   Thanks in advanced,  ET	No
Moving to a different apartment in the same complex. The lease had the move out date for July 30th but the owner asked us to move out much earlier (I assume to move in another tenant) and only gave us about 5 days notice. He agreed to credit the days we're not staying in the old apartment into the new apartment. We were just rushing to get everything moved on time so we didn't have the time to think about compensation. But now that everything is said and done, are we allowed to ask for compensation? Is it too late?	No
Multiple months ago my fiance and I signed a lease with our landlord to move to a different duplex to live without roommates. Today they called to say the family where we are supposed to move to hasn't moved out. They thought the lease ended in December. They are trying to get us to move to much shitier apartments at a unreasonable rent. They have already leased our current place to others. What do we Do? They are now offering we move to the apartment for a month while they try to evict the people in what was supposed to be our new place. What should we Do?	No
Brought a newly built home in 2014.  Neighbors house was already built.  There were stakes in the ground to depict my property lines which the realtor and builder pointed to several times.  My neighbor got a survey done (as they want to build a fence), according to that (neighbors) survey a little bit of this drive way (bit that curves around his house and where he puts his garbage cans) is actually on my property.  He wants to build a fence which will go over to my property line a little.  When he asked me I didn't think much of it but now thinking back, he's asking essentially asking for free property!    I'm trying to figure out what needs to be done with regards to the driveway (I think a bit of his sprinkler system is on my property too).  The little bit of concrete doesn't really bother me, but I am wondering if there are any liability issues.  I guess I will need to get my own survey done?  Is there any liability on the builder for this? Is it reasonable for them to at least cover the cost of a survey (if I can still get hold of them)?  It never occurred to me at the time of buying the home to get a survey done (I know better now) since the builder pointed out the stakes in the ground.  I've read about adverse possession laws too which I wanted to avoid giving away land.  I don't know exactly how much is in my property, but maybe 1 foot or so, maybe less.  Thanks for any info!	No
We live in Kentucky and my wife got a DUI / OVI in Ohio. We have multiple kids around the toddler age. I have documented proof of infidelity via messages from a former partner of hers. We both have college degrees. Neither of us have criminal records (except for her recent DUI). My wife does have an alcohol issue, but it's never been treated nor documented in any formal way (minus the DUI). I will more than likely file for a divorce. Do I stand a chance of gaining full custody of my kids? What's a best case scenario?	No
Just need clarification on what counts as educational expenses for a child in Missouri. Is it strictly for college/secondary education (Tuition, room and board, books, etc)? I have a child going into elementary school and he is now required to have a laptop. I would like to be able to have this bill shared between myself and the ex.  Need some guidance on what exactly the education expense entails.  Thank you.	No
Every night when they left they would leave my front door **open and unlocked**. Also on more than one occasion, they were spotted by neighbors on areas they were not authorized to access.   I am 100% certain they are to blame for this disappearance. Are there any steps I can take to pursue this?	No
I formed an LLC with a couple of friends last year. My two partners now wish to leave and give me full control over the LLC. What documents do I need to get them to sign to gain full control over the LLC? Thank you!	No
"Last year, myself and hundreds of others put our money down on a product called a ""Marble DCS"". The company is an established company with another successful product. The ""DCS"" was offered in two versions, the DCS-1 and DCS-2.   The promised ship date or the DCS-1 was October 2016. Units were finally being reported as received by backers in May 2017, 9 months after the promised ship date.   But everyone who paid for and backed the DCS-2, has yet to receive anything other than emails describing ""engineering challenges"", and offers to change their order to a DCS-1 instead. The DCS-1 has completely different ports and options.  I've been trading emails with their support asking for an ETA on when the DCS-2 will ship, or asking them to refund the money they've already collected a year ago from backers.   Their only responses are continued emails asking me to change my order to the DCS-1, instead of ""waiting for"" the DCS-2. The DCS-1 will not work for me, nor hundreds of other backers who paid for theirs.   After more stonewalling, I've asked them to pass on the details of their legal department, and haven't heard back in weeks. My bank claims that they cannot return the funds or file a claim because it's more than 75 days past the promised ship date.   What are my options here, or should I just write this off as being a victim of yet another vaporware fraud campaign?"	No
"I apologize if this is in the wrong sub, but I'm having a hard time locating one more appropriate on mobile at work.  A note about the situation: my roommate currently is not on the lease. I am. This is in Nevada. My girlfriend is also not on the lease but lives there with my verbal agreement. My son is visiting from out of town. The roommate in question is an extremely heavy drinker, felon, and has tendencies toward anger and manipulation.  So this has been a long couple of weeks. For the past few months my roommate has been moving from disrespectful to rude to harassing to threatening. My schedule recently shifted from late nights to early mornings and I asked him to respect that. Since then I've averaged about 4-6 hours of sleep per night, damaging my work and personal relationships. He contributes to that in a large way by slamming doors throughout the house, harassing me, making noise in communal areas right next to my room (which I can't close the door to because the air conditioner doesn't blow to my room), and making phone calls on speaker right outside my door.  Essentially I broke recently when he was standing in my doorway calling me names while my son was sleeping on an air mattress at the foot of my bed because we're uncomfortable with him being around my roommate lately.   I asked him to leave the next day via text and he responded with ""I get mail there."" I sent him a text that said ""consider this your 30 days notice."" Then he said he would stay the duration of the lease, dropping it down to September at the absolute earliest. His sudden change of gears had me thinking something was up.  He came home that night and said he never received any notice asking him to leave and he absolutely refuses to leave under any circumstance and he has been researching his legal rights as a tenant. He also said he never harassed me as I had no proof or recorded evidence as it never happened (except non-emergency police confirmed the next day my suspicions that my live-in girlfriend who witnessed this harassment could constitute legal evidence and sign a statement saying otherwise). He said try to make him leave and I was living in a fantasy world where nothing I say is real. I took screen shots of everything he said that night and my polite terms of his exit from the apartment.  Later that night I got a text that said essentially he was sorry for being such a jerk and he appreciates the 30 days and he would be out as soon as he could.  After more research, it looked like my notice wouldn't hold legal weight if I left it at a text message. Everyone I talked to said he probably realized I had no legal leg to stand on and in 30 days when I asked him to leave as per his agreement he could change his mind and I'd be stuck for another 30 days. So I looked up what was required and got essentially a form letter off the internet giving him date of service, date of exit, reason for eviction, and a witness signature. I saw on the website that it wasn't necessary to get it notarized if there was a witness. I had my dad (only person in town who he didn't know personally that I could grab on short notice) serve it to him at work (the only place I could track him down as he spent only late evening hours at home when I had to be asleep for work). I understand this was probably uncomfortable for him but at the same time, I'm at the point where I nearly broke my lease because He's impossible to live with.  Last night his sister (my good friend who introduced us as we both needed a place and it was convenient) called me to inform me that my service was unlawful and he could escalate it if he desired and ""hopefully he won't."" That he had apologized before the moment of service and there was no reason to serve him, let alone a non-notarized notice to evict which he could sue me for fraud by serving that to him. I really want to call her and tell her that was unfair but now I'm not sure what good that would do. I also have about $250-300 worth of stuff at her house that I want to get back if I'm going to not be able to go over there anymore but don't want to worsen the situation.  I feel broken and tired and can't think straight anymore and I'm exhausted physically and mentally. I just need some advice if anyone has any. I know it probably doesn't sound like much of a big deal to everyone else but I've spent the last 6+ months spending 95% of my time in my room avoiding this guy and his rules and yelling and insults and I don't feel safe in the apartment.  Sorry if this is disjointed, I just woke up and started spewing out as much as I could think to put down. I would appreciate any advice on how to proceed.  TL;DR: My roommate refused to leave when I asked, then changed his mind, then I served him with a 30-days notice his sister called and claimed I could be sued for fraud with."	No
I got a phone call an hour ago from my son, who is 26. My son lives in the state of Texas with his mother. His mother and I have been divorced since he was two years old. I have always strived to have a connection with my son; although it has ever been easy (he suffers from Asperger's syndrome, suffers from intense anxiety, has difficulty making friends, his mother loved being passive aggressive and generally make my life a living hell, etc) I have always loved my son and supported him when I could. If the fine folks of /r/legaladvice could advise me on the following dilemma my son has moronically gotten himself into, it would be greatly appreciated.  A few things about my son: he lives with his mother. He makes about $1,400 a month (after taxes). He dropped out of college his freshmen year and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and social phobia shortly afterwards, hence the low paying job and general lack of motivation he suffers from. Because my son can be sometimes be very thick and obstinate, as well as terrified of speaking to people, he neglected to get insurance for his car for a whole month. I know; I chastised him for his gross irresponsibility, but I have long ago accepted that I cannot hold myself responsible for his decisions, however misguided as they can be. I love my son. He told me on the phone that he had been in a car crash a few months ago (on a car he had just bought) without having insurance. He received a ticket for failure to yield (resulting in the accident; according to him, he had just gotten off a 12 hour shift, he hadn't slept well in days due to his anxiety caused insomnia, and he had thought he had the right of way when a car slammed into him. Afraid of the financial difficulties of paying a fine for both things, he consulted his best friend, who happens to be a cop, and his friend advised him to get insurance for the car involved in the accident that same day, so he could present proof of insurance to court in front of the judge and have the fine removed.   It appeared to have worked. He dropped the insurance for the same car after paying his failure to yield fine. However, today (months after the car crash in question) he began to receive phone calls from his car insurance company about a claim placed on behalf of the other party involved. My son's car wasn't covered by his insurance at the time.   How can I best advise my son? Should he confess to the insurance company that he did not have insurance at the time of the crash? Would that make him liable to be sued? What are some repercussions he could face? He pays for his credit card, phone bill, car, rent, and groceries, so despite his gross negligence he tries to be good. He has fucked up enormously, but he is my son.  Please. I am desperate.   -concernedfatherofmoron	No
I have a friend who has been having issues with a roommate and it came to a head last night. She tried to call the cops on them and get them kicked out, which didn't happen because she didn't follow the eviction process whatsoever, and so they have plenty of time to stay there. However, she decided to leave herself, and took the router/modem for the internet when she did. My friend paid half of the internet bill, although she has no real physical proof of that, but does have a verbal agreement for paying half of the utilities, and also her occupation REQUIRES that she has the internet, so she is unable to make money without it. Is this legal, is the roommate who technically has her name on the bill allowed to do this? Can my friend really do anything besides try to sue her? She doesn't really have the money for that kind of thing.	No
So here's my deal: I live in Los Angeles. About last November I was looking for a new place to move into. A friend told me about two friends of hers who were looking for a roommate. Rent's $350/mo. Cool, right? I move in, no lease, mo-mo, no contract, but I pay a $210 deposit. (If I got a receipt at the time it's gone now.) Well this place was alright (except for the cockroach infestation) and these two fellas seemed ok at first.. but they're both actors and one has a hot head because he looks like Thor. If Thor was a total tool. As the weather started to get warmer (I'm talking like low 70s here) I open the windows to let a nice, cool breeze in. Apparently my roommates were allergic to fresh air and wanted the windows to be closed at all times and have the a/c running 24/7. We didn't pay any utilities so they could care less about what it cost to run it. The bathroom smelled like mildew and there was black mold on the windows when I moved in (I took care of that, as well as a large part of the cockroach infestation.(Endorsement: Check out Advion Bait syringes👌)) So I keep the bathroom window open to air it out. By and by these guys kick me out because I won't keep the windows shut (I think I bruised Thor's ego because he's used to getting his way.) Anyway, I'm told I'll get my deposit back when someone else moves in (smells like BS). I say screw it and go on my merry way. A month later (a few days ago now) I text Thor telling him that I need my deposit. He says tough luck, claiming there are damages (a lie. I did nothing but improve that place.) By CA state law, any deductions from the deposit must be taken out within 21 days of a tenant having moved out, and an itemized list of said damages along with the (reasonable) costs. I never heard anything from my old roommate until I texted him and he refused to return my deposit. In that sense, I have the upper hand..however, I have no contract. No receipt of a deposit (only a PayPal transaction for an amount greater than the deposit), no hard evidence except my recent texts and the check images and deductions from my bank account over the course of my having lived at that apartment. So I sent Thor a request for Deposit Return letter and my next step would be to take this to small claims court..but is it worth it? Do I have a leg to stand on or would it be a waste of time and money?  I only have texts and my check images and PayPal statements directed to him. I don't have a written contract or receipt of deposit, etc.  Should I just accept that there are unscrupulous douches out there and I'm a victim of theft, or is there a way I can fight this? Thanks for taking the time to read this, and thanks for any advice!	No
I just moved in with my girlfriend and my name is freshly on the lease. Our AC has been on the fritz the last handful of days, and as we've had a lot of rain and thus temperature and humidity swings, I guessed correctly that the pipes had frozen. When I opened the closet to check I noticed the floor was wet and there was some water dripping from somewhere, and a strong musty, fungal odor. I didn't think anything of it and just tried to thaw the pipes with a hot rag. A few hours later, we both started to feel ill. Weak, fatigued, nauseous, dizzy, with headaches and body aches and a general feeling of disorientation and slowness of mind. We searched for our symptoms and made the connection to the mold and decided we should get out and stay in a hotel room for the night. We've informed our office of this and there response was that they would have maintenance check it out. We're out $200, is there anything we can/should do?  Thanks!	No
Hello /r/Legaladvice,  I guess i'm not sure where to turn here. 3 months ago I completed my graduate degree. Upon doing so the owner of the company I work for told me that everyone was proud of me for doing so, but he felt that the company may not be able to pay me what I am worth, and encourage me to go fourth and find somewhere that would be willing to pay what they felt my degree deserved. I was very appreciative of their honesty, and up until that point loved my job. So i've been job hunting for a few months, found another great opportunity and accepted an offer. I went into my current job and told them immediately because I wanted to give them as much notice as possible, because they've been so great to me. This all happened yesterday. I came in today, and was basically told to pack my shit and that today was my last day. Do I have any recourse here? I would have started the new job next week had I known that giving my notice would just turn around and bite me in the ass? I have nothing in writing as at the time I didnt consider it would be necessary. Now i'm liking going a month without pay (both company pay bi-weekly, and new job is a cycle behind). Am I entitled to any form of payment, as the owner very clearly verbally stated that I would be able to work out a 2 week notice. Does being let go today, negate the chance of receiving unemployment in the mean time? Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Apologies if this is the incorrect subreddit for these types of questions.   Location: Minnesota, US	No
Alright so I've tried googling this but have no guts on my specific situation.  I'm a server and the owner has 3 more restaurants all within a block, so we swap and take things we need from the other 3 if we ever run out of anything. Occasionally we will run out of a certain liquor and they will typically send a server to go grab an unopened bottle and bring it back to the restaurant they work at. Is it legal to walk it if you're under 21 since it is for business and you're on the clock?	No
I recently purchased a property and there is a community driveway for the  houses next to my property and the neighbors told me that my backyard was also once apart another  community driveway for the other three plots. It is no longer a community driveway because the owner next to the entrance of my community driveway blocked access for my next door neighbor and me. Is there any way I can verify that there was a community driveway there before and bring legal action to rebuild the community driveway? Thank you for your time.	No
"Hello,  Let me start by saying, that I know very little about any sort of legal process or have even been in a court before.    I know this is poking my head into issues that don't involve me, but I feel like my mom and my aunt are rather neglectful of my Grandmother, and are about to offload their responsibility onto me.  Late last year, before the winter, she and my aunt moved out to Arizona, and my Grandma bought a trailer in a trailer park for senior citizens 100% on her dime.  My Aunt, who is the medical POA, lives with her.  She has done nothing with such power.  My Sister, who is a CNA at a nursing home, has implored her time and time again to declare her medically incompetent.  However, my aunt shows no interest in doing so, and this is the woman that was originally given this power because 'she'd be the one with the courage to pull the plug'  Now, my Grandma is coming back home to West Virginia, while my aunt gets to stay in her house on my Grandma's dime.  The second home she has done with this, but that's a different story.  Last week, my Mom went out west to bring grandma back, and time and time again complained on Facebook about how difficult it is to take care of Grandma and her dementia.    Before she moved out west, my Grandma said that she would like me to watch over her house while I complete College.  The last of the classes I need can be taken Online, so I gladly took her up on this offer.  However, now that she's coming back, my Mom has explained how I will save her so much money by no longer needing to put her in a home because I am up here for the time being.  I am in no way a medical professional, and honestly have a hard time taking care of myself.  I explained to her that I will have a trip to go on in the second week of August, and someone should watch over her while I am not here.  She simply responded with 'if she falls, she falls"", which is disturbing to me.    The worst thing is that my Grandma told both my aunt, my mom, and me that she's been thinking of giving me the house, since I've always liked it growing up, am currently taking care of it now, and long before my Grandma had moved to Arizona, *and*  the she didn't like the fact that her daughters will be selling it before her body is cold.  My Mom told me before she went out west, that she would do everything in her power as the legal POA to prevent this, as 'this house is my retirement plan, and I'm not going to let you take that away from me.""  If there is nothing that can be done, at the least I will treat my mom the same way she treated her Mom, in the future."	No
...just tell the judge that he is a roommate so it doesn't eliminate your spousal maintenance. Divorce is not yet finalized and obviously this would be a sticking point for the final decree (going in a few days).  What do I need to prove that he is a paramour and not just a roommate? What can I submit in the future to have spousal maintenance reduced/eliminated once this happens, assuming it happens after the final decree is submitted and approved?	No
Not sure how the law works here. Our niece is married to a guy whos 18 and she is extremely in love with. They've been together for four years and married recently.   Her parent's E2 investment visa expired recently, and they will leave to Belarus as soon as it does. Of course, we dont want to hinder her future oppurtinity of American education, and she wants to stay with her husband who is willing to offer a space in his place.  What are her legal obligations here? As her guardians, do her parents have full right to take her? Or is she legally able to make the decision herself based on her marriage?	No
Hello. I live in Vermont and for about two weeks now, our water has been contaminated with diesel fuel. You can smell it on the water. I had consumed it, and had negative health effects for almost an hour (this was me testing confirmation bias ). I've never been given notice by the landlord that the water has been contaminared. I have talked to my neighbors in the same building as me. They have the same problem. I have been told the only way to force legal action is to pay several thousand dollars to test the water, and show the results law enforcement or some other justice agency. Several thousand dollars I do not have.  I was wondering if you had any ideas on how to force the issue legally speaking?	No
So, as the title says, I believe there is black mold in my apartment in the shower. There was a crack above the shower when I moved in, but it is my first time renting and I didn't think anything of it, thinking it was cosmetic and desperately needing a place to live. I noticed that the water from upstairs was leaking through the crack one day. As my lease has progressed the splotches that surround the crack have gotten darker brownish/blackish, as well as the one drop ceiling tile getting more water damaged. I have pictures that show the progress of the shower getting worse. A few months ago my landlord verbally told me that someone would be out to look at it, and it has never happened. What is my best course of action here?	No
"Hi Reddit,   I live in Ontario Canada and am moving into the hosue that my BF and his ex wife own. They cannot sell due to market conditions so he has taken on all expenses.

Is there anything I need to ensure is included? Is there any real purpose for doing this?"	No
Hello,  I (28,m) live with my father in the US (CO)   around February he joined a foreign dating site and quickly became enamored with a woman in Colombia.  He went to visit her (which I was concerned about as well but made it home safe and sound.  Now, about 3 weeks later he has informed me that his latin lover is not only coming to visit, but in fact MOVING IN with us as of next week.  I am very concerned this is a green card  or immigration scam of some sort.  She does not speak English, he does not speak Spanish.  Are there any steps I can take myself / encourage him to take to protect himself financially or protect himself from possible marriage fraud?  Thanks all	No
"Hey guys, I wanted to ask to see if there was anything that can be done about this.   I've been living in the same building for almost a year. At first, it was great, but as March rolled around and brought the rainy part of the year with it, I noticed that water started dripping though a panel in the ceiling of my bedroom. I reported this to the people at the front desk, and they _said_ they would send a guy up to fix it. He never did. This exchange has happened over and over for like two months now, and there's always some excuse for why they can't just either move me to another unit, or fix my damn roof. It's gotten to the point where if it rains in the morning, the liquid pours down onto my bed, and has caused a big pit in the middle of my mattress. It's not too common, but I'd like to know if there is some way to either get out of my contract or something because this place sucks for an ""upscale high-rise""."	No
"I work at a minimum wage service job and put in my two weeks on Monday last week. As the usual two-week courtesy notice would have it, I would typically work until my last usual shift which is this Saturday. However, I told him in writing on my two-week notice that I only want to work til this Thursday (two days from today), which is kinda like a one and a half week notice. To get me to work the last couple shifts, he claimed two things (in person)    1) I need to show up to work because ""I already paid you for those hours, so you need to show up for them"". and    2) ""I need to give you your last paycheck on your last day"" in exchange for my uniform.    ...now for the record I think I know the real reason as to why he's doing this. A number people are leaving for vacation during this time (which is why I couldn't request time off myself in the first place) so he kinda maybe needs me. I also know that I have a direct deposit with the company, so the ""hand me my paycheck thing"" seems pretty bullshit. At the very least, I know he's heavily bending the truth, either too proud to tell ask me straight ""Hey I know you wrote you wanted to give me one and a half weeks, but I really need you this weekend."" or just hoping I'm gullible enough to believe whatever he claims.    Or is he? That's what I want to ask you guys.    Is he legally able to indebt me with ""wage prepayment"" and as a side question, how bullshit is his need to ""hand me my check on the last day""?    Thanks for your time."	No
My friend has rented out his basement apartment to a guy for the last 10 months. Over the winter he got behind on payments (two months behind) but promised to slowly pay it back as he was able to. He is a seasonal worker and so is my friend so he cut him some slack. The issue was he could never quite get ahead each month and now owes $3200. Finally he put his foot down and gave him until the end of July (full month notice). They then agreed that this weekend he would be out. Now the tenant is pushing it further into next week. He claims he will call the police if any of his stuff gets touched. They didn't sign a formal lease. He paid in cash for the other months. My friend has written agreements and documentation of all money owed including bank statements. What can be done here? Is my friend just stuck waiting until it is convenient for this guy to leave? 	No
So my fiance has two kids with his ex he has only gotten to see one of them once and hasn't gotten to see either of them in over a year last year he asked to see them he did ask if he needed to bang on her door to be able to see them ( witch he should have put differently) when he asked that she took him to court stating she was afraid for her life and the judge granted her  with a retraining order now we live in another state but the order is over and he really wants to be apart of their lives what can he do	No
My daughter (age 7) lives in Minnesota with her father. I live in Washington state. We originally lived in Washington together, moved to Minnesota together into his father's house, and then I came home after I had difficulty finding a job, in order to get a job here and save money so we could afford to get our own place in Minnesota because his father did not like having me and all of my other children there (I have 5 other children).   The agreement between my ex and I was that our daughter would stay there with him because his father is ill and he wanted her to have a chance to form a relationship with him. That was 3 years ago. I ended the relationship with him after I came back. We never married and never established a parenting plan or any official custody or anything. He claims I wouldn't win anything in court because he lives on a reservation and tribal court always favors the Native child staying with the Native family.   I say the tribal court doesn't have jurisdiction because he doesn't live on the reservation affiliated with the tribe he's actually registered with and that any custody proceedings would be in standard Minnesota courts. Regardless, I haven't seen my daughter in 3 years and when I schedule time to call and talk to her, he often doesn't answer the phone or isn't home. I haven't spoken to her since January.   I've offered to fly out there to see her but he usually makes some excuse about why it's not a good time. I'm fed up and frustrated and I have no protection because we have nothing established in court about my rights to have access to her. What do I do?	No
Hi!  I have a lease on a townhome but am not currently living there. My lease is up July 31, but the landlord has allowed new tenants to start moving in. Their stuff has been there since at least July 22. Once I found out their stuff was still there I called my landlord demanding a prorated amount of rent to be returned to me, as well as an estimation for utilities. This will total to approximately $500.  The landlord is now threatening to withhold my security deposit, stating that we broke a door (despite giving us the ok at the walk through).  My husband and I have again reiterated that we only want our prorated rent for the time that we know we had left the house and now our landlord is ignoring our calls.  Is it within my legal rights to seize property in the home that I currently still have a lease for? That is the next step we were going to take. Thanks for any advice.	No
"I work as a server at a restaurant in Alabama. I am not sure if there are any special rules that apply to my state, but the general idea that I have come to is that the practice of the employer taking our tips is illegal. However, I am not certain if my specific case qualifies as being illegal.  Originally servers were paid $6.00 an hour in addition to tips(we had a tip share), however this was eventually changed to $7.25 an hour with the tips being collected and ""put back into the restaurant""(whatever that means). However, this is only for the lunch/dinner shift. The original rule($6.00 plus tips) still applies to the breakfast shift.  Is this legal for employers to do? I am given many of my tips in person by the customers I serve who thank me for my excellent service quite frequently, and I feel quite cheated to be forced to put this money that is by all rights *mine* potentially into the owners' hands.  I have thought of saying something about it, but am fearful of losing my job. I have also considered simply keeping my tips, but am afraid of legal trouble that could be taken against me. Any advice/knowledge would be welcome."	No
"I'm an idiot. I've been spending, on average, 3-4 hours a day out of my 7.5 hour work-day (Monday - Friday, 9 - 5) for the past... 2 years on this website, both general surfing and posting (probably 2000 posts? no idea, at least that). I'm the only person in the company who does what I do, I took over for a retiree and there was no manual/documentation of anything, I just trained with her for a month and then learned the rest on my own and I'm integral to the department (primarily finance/secondarily admin role, don't want to get more detailed).    My boss isn't a very good actor and he's been saying/doing a lot of things over the past few weeks that make me think they're trying to get me to tell them everything about how I do my job, before they fire me. I've never had a warning for the amount of internet usage or anything but there's no reason otherwise they'd consider firing me, and like I said, I can read my boss pretty well and he's not a good actor.    If they do tell me that they're firing me and it's due to the high usage, can I say ""No, that wasn't me""? Like, can I demand proof? I'm not part of a union and I'm *pretty sure* they can fire me for any reason, but would making a demand like that do anything? Is there any possibility of legal repercussions if I argue it and make them prove it? The company is undergoing very public downsizing, so if I say I got laid off I can go on unemployment benefits, but if I got fired then I wouldn't be eligible. **Side question** If I file for unemployment, would the company tell the unemployment office that I was fired as opposed to let go? I assume yes, but would like to know. I realize I'm a piece of shit, I'm looking for a new job either way so all of this is just temporary anyways."	No

"Hello all,  I am in a predicament right now regarding my current employer. I recently became a member of the management team at a new local restaurant. My company currently has six restaurants under its belt, and we opened this new restaurant for business last year and I've worked there since. My co-supervisor was recently trained on how to complete payroll before payday rolled around. In passing she candidly said: &gt;I have so much work to do! I have to go through everyone's time punches and edit them to be at least 5 minutes before their shift.  Our company policy essentially states that all employee's punches that are earlier than 5 minutes before a scheduled shift time will be edited to be, at most, 5 minutes before that shift.   That night I talked to one of our company's longer tenured managers and asked him about this practice. He told me that its ""company policy"" and everyone agreed to these policies when they signed their contracts. Many of the managers at other restaurants seem complacent about this practice. I know that you can't just write whatever you want in a contract and call it a day so I was thinking this may be an unenforceable.  I did some light research on the topic on the DOL's website and, from my understanding of the law, the law states that an employer may only edit time punches if an employee incorrectly recorded time (i.e forgetting to clock in or out). But they may not edit time punches in order to reflect something like a ""company policy.""  Now I'm not losing any sleep from my punch being edited from 2:54pm to 2:55pm. I am, however, concerned that my company is simply operating unethically. I want to talk to my HR representative and understand more about where this policy is coming from. But I also feel a little slimy doing payroll and having to edit these punches. Long term I am not interested in going to court about lose wages, etc. I just want my company to operate ethically and fairly.  So, my questions: 1) Is this legal at all? 2) Is this employment contract ""unenforceable"" because of this verbiage? 3) Is there anything a lowly supervisor can do about this company-wide practice?  Thanks in advance"	No
I live in Northern Wisconsin. Our Central Air unit for our house that we are renting broke. I notified the landlord she made the calls to get it fixed. Tech call her back and tells her she needs a whole new central air unit. It is going to cost 3K to fix. She can not afford to fix it until next spring. Which i completely understand. But with that being said I have a 3-4 week old newborn a two year old toddler and my wife who is a stay at home mom with them at this house. So we need to be able to have the house cooled down.  I understand not having 3K laying around to get it fixed. I also understand having to save up for the money to get it done. But with that being said my gas and electric bill through WPS is going to go way up to keep the house cool with window AC units. I currently pay $800 a month plus all the utilities. Is it reasonable to ask her  if she can shave money off the rent payment in order to supplement the differences of the AC units I am going to need to use? Also how would I go about wording this so I do not seem like and a-hole. I like our landlord and i like the house we are renting but I feel like something should be done for the remainder of the summer.  So again....Is it reasonable to ask her if she can shave money off the rent payment in order to supplement the differences of the AC units I am going to need to use? Also how would I go about wording this so I do not seem like and a-hole?	No
"I'm not too keen on paying more than I have to and since paying for part of gas usage was not mentioned in the lease, do I have to pay any part of it?

Specifically it was a vampire novel, the main character and plot were fairly distinctive: I do still possess copies of the original work, and I also have friends who still have copies. Will this protect me in the event of the work being published by the thief? What can I do otherwise to secure authorship of my work, considering that it was never published?	No
So I live in a small college town in rural Mississippi and my roommate and I were supposed to move out of our current apartment and into a new one today, however the landlord says we can't because they have to replace the carpets, fix some holes in the walls, and change the doorknobs. Obviously this has been a huge hassle since we have to be out of our current apartment today. Luckily we know people who have places we can put our stuff/sleep for a few days.  At this point I'm not sure if I want to move into the apartment complex since the landlord has been super hard to get into contact with since the start of this process, so my main question is do we have strong enough ground to stand on to get our full deposit back if we decide not to move in.  We haven't signed a lease yet (I know that was super dumb), but we had a verbal agreement with him that the apartment would be ready by today at the latest, and we have receipts stating that we paid him the deposit/first months rent.

This is a bit of an unusual one. I will try and make it simple points.  There are 3 of us each with our own room. We all signed jointly.  One roommate failed to tell the others that he has stopped receiving income. He kept paying late until the point he couldn't pay anymore and is now waiting on disability money from the government.  The other roommate and I have covered his last 2 months of rent and late fees. He kept saying he will get the money but it doesn't come. We can't afford to keep covering his rent.  He signed an agreement that he will pay us back but I doubt we will get our money.  Even if we win against him in small claims court the money he is getting is disability money and normally we cant collect from that.  I talked to management and they said the only way to get him off the lease is for them to evict us all for non-payment or him to sign himself off the lease.  If he refuses to sign himself off the lease, what are our options?  I was thinking of putting all of his stuff to an offsite storage unit and putting it under his name. Then adding someone else to the lease and renting out his room just so we cant get someone to pay rent.  He basically lives with his partner and uses the space he has with us as storage.   Are there any legal repercussions of moving his stuff into a storage unit in his name?	No
Hello everyone. July of last year my fiance and I moved into this duplex. It's really nice &lt; 3 years old, we're the second tennants. However since we've moved in we've had problem after problem with things breaking, including the A/C. We live in Georgia, so that's a problem. About 3 months ago, I awoke to the smell of smoke, as a firefighter I didn't call 911 and decided to investigate first. Turns out our light fixture above the sink was smoking pretty bad,  I removed the bulb amd it seemed to stop. Maintenance put a new bulb in, and it went out shortly after. We decided to leave it alone. Our A/C went out saturday night. We got by Sunday with the help of a window unit until they fixed it monday. Well about 45 minutes ago, my fiance woke me up screaming that the house was smoking, sure enough the control panel was extremely hot, and putting off a good amount of smoke I removed the panel, shutting it off. I checked the breaker, and it too was hot. Had we not been here I am about 90% certain it would have led to a house fire.   What are my rights as a tenant to terminate the lease if I feel unsafe? Will lawers have to get involved?    Thanks in advance.	No
"Ok, so I live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I recently found out that an ex of mine had called the police on me multiple times during our relationship and after it. He had claimed I was stalking him. I don't know how he convinced the police not to speak to me, or maybe he gave them my incorrect information, who knows.. But I never spoke to an officer. I only found out, well, I found out the first bit one day when I looked at his phone and saw him repeat dialing this number. When I called it, it was a sargents number. I woke him up and confronted him about it. That's when I found out he had called the police on me for accidentally breaking his window. He never set his buzzer up on his apartment, and when I'd come over, since he didn't want me to yell, I'd have to throw something at his window to get his attention to let him know I was there. One time it cracked the very edge of the glass, a tiny hairline fracture. (If I were intentionally breaking his window, I'd probably throw a brick through it, not my set of keys like I always did). Mind you, when he called the police he was texting wiith me saying he wanted to move in with me, etc... And he had called the woman he was cheating on me with.. right before calling the police (lol). Anyway, much later, I come to find out he called and made stalking claims against me when I'd be somehwere he was and I'd almost bust him cheating.. He'd then like.. stop communicating with the police about it, so it would never go anywhere. Anyway, I have printed off the proof that he's full of crap, he told me to do everything he subsquently called the police on me for, and that while telling the police I was ""stalking him and harasassing him"".. he was actually stalking and harassing me because I didn't want to be with him and he wouldn't stop bothering me. I mean, he messaged me on valentines day and I didn't read it for two weeks.. And I find out, recently, in that two weeks in took me to respond he was on here posting about how he ""just wants to be left alone"" and how I ""won't stop stalking him"".. He got meaner and meaner the further time went on and I didn't answer. Crazy ass behavior. Anyway.. is there a law against this? There freaking has to be?"	No
I purchased season tickets for a local team prior to the season. I signed a form that stated that the deposit was non-refundable and that I would make monthly payments towards my season tickets.  Fallen on tough times and can no longer afford. The team is telling me I cannot refund my tickets, but there was no stated policy that included refunds or cancellations. The season doesn't start until October.  I looked online and found that merchants have to give a refund after 30 days with no mentioned policy after a transaction is made...but technically I haven't received the these tickets since the season hasn't started.  I started making payments back in April and they go to September 1. I have paid almost $1000 thus far.   Any other questions welcome.	No
"A few days ago, we noticed that there was water seeping from the floorboards at the front door. We thought it was a burst pipe or something, so we called the landlord. Long story short, the damages are our fault. Water was leaking from our air conditioner in one room, and leaking into the other. Since the damages are directly located at the front door, and no damages seem apparent in the other room, it seemed fine at the time.  However, the landlord wants us to pay for reflooring the whole house. For the record, the front door shares flooring with the living room, kitchen, and hallway (as in, it's all connected). He wants us also to pay for reflooring all the rooms as well, including the ones not affected by the damages. He also insists on picking which service he wants used, and that we can't just replace the section with the damages, because ""we'll never find floorboards that look like that."" I'm not quite sure I buy that; it seems like fairly generic laminate hardwood flooring.   The landlord has been frustrating and condescending as hell, so my SO is content to just find a new place to live and let his landlord keep the security deposit. However, that just feels like a really bad idea to me, which is why I'm looking for outside advice.  My questions are this: 1) Does the Landlord have a right to charge us to refloor the whole house despite the location of the damages? 2) If my SO chooses to leave and let the Landlord keep the security deposit, is there any chance the landlord will come after him seeking more money for damages? 3) My SO claims that he may not've even turned in the rental contract to the landlord. Will that affect things?"	No
"I'm still livid from this and I will be speaking to an attorney this week but I just wanted to get this all down in writing because I still can't believe it actually happened.   So I (single male early 30's) bought a house in a neighborhood outside of a large city in TN. I moved in about 6 months ago. I got a job here and after around 2 years of living in an apartment, I wanted to get a house because my employer made a long term path clear to me. However, I think I may have been too quick to buy. My brother in law is from the area and was helping me find a place and he really convinced me to get this house and I pulled the trigger. This is mostly useless info, but some background might be helpful because -  This home was in a HOA. Honestly, the president of the group met with me when I was talking with the realtor and told me how the dues help to keep the communal small park area clean and they also act as a neutral party for neighbor disputes so I thought it sounded great. The dues were low and the house/neighborhood was great. She sent some paperwork when I bought the house, and I signed.  After this, my job got much more busy and I had to work 60-ish hour weeks. On Saturday's I would invite some work friends over and we would have a BBQ in my yard and watch some shows. This was a dream come true for me. I always wanted to own my own place and just be able to be my own landlord.  A few weeks ago I received a letter from the HOA president I spoke to saying that there were multiple complaints of noise ""after a reasonable hour"" from my home. I honestly thought that was fair so I moved my get-togethers inside and thought it was the end of it.  HOWEVER - yesterday. The HOA president sent me an email saying that my home was ready to be sold. As in she said in the email ""Your home has found a buyer and we look forward to you accepting the offer"". She immediately sent a second email from a realty company with the further info about the offer on my home. I checked that realtors website and there are pictures of my home with all of my things inside of it. Someone had been in my home when I was not here and took pictures. What the absolute shit.  I emailed her back immediately because it was obvious she came into my home, but how? And she said this: ""In the HOA agreement you signed, a concerned neighbor may enter your home if there is a risk of harm, or if it might be in the interest of the neighborhood itself"". I wish I was making this up. She then said ""Because of your repeated noise violations it was in our best interest to facilitate selling your home.""  I don't even know where to begin. Did she do something illegal even if it was in the agreement? I know I should have not signed this and it was stupid. But she was obviously just helping herself inside my home for weeks and I just feel like that cannot be right."	No
"6/12/17 my roommate called maintenance for a dish washing machine that wasn't draining and smelled like something was burning. I have never personally used the dishwasher here but I understand that I'm still somewhat responsible for it.  6/13/17 3rd party repair guy comes in for 25 minutes noting: ""Ran through cycle OK. Lower rack was in backwards preventing top rack from washing due to spray tower miss aligned. Odor from sitting open not used."" $80 was billed to the land lord which they have passed along to us.  7/3/17 Land Lord received the bill from the 3rd party maintenance.  7/21/17 My land lord typed up a bill for $80 saying we have 10 days to pay or submit a written dispute within 10 days time- the resident accepts responsibility for this bill and must pay immediately. After 10 days Land lord will not accept a dispute letter for review. Per Section XX:   &gt;Material Noncompliance by Tenant Which Can Be Remedied by Repairs, Cleaning, or Replacement. If Tenant commits a material noncompliacne that can be remedied by repair, cleaning, or replacement, Landlord may make the repair, cleaning or replacment, and the itemized bill fro same will be submitted to the Tenant as an obligation that will be due and payable as addiitonal Rent within ten (10) days or as provided in the written notice to Tenant such obligation shall be due as additional Rent payable at the next Rent due date.  7/24/17 Letter post marked   7/29/17 Mail checked by tenant (Me)  Firstly Do I need to submit written dispute by 8/3/17 which is 10 days from the post mark. Or 7/31/17 when the letter is dated?   Secondly the roommate who made the work order months ago has since moved out and another tenant has signed the lease in his place. This is where the bigger issue is, two of the roommates currently on the lease are not legally on the lease until 7/31/17. I would have no problem splitting the bill with the roommate who was on the lease and called in the work order. But since he isn't on the lease as of 7/31/17 he doesn't feel responsible.  My other issue is that the dishwasher still doesn't drain, smells like something is burning, and has hardly been used. I wash my dishes by hand. It cleans them better, uses less water and I hardly use any dishes.   So the dishwasher is still in the same state as it was when the work order was called. If I am paying for something it better damn well be fixed not just inspected.  [Here's the Virginia Law on ""Material Noncompliance""](https://vacode.org/2016/55/13.2/5/55-248.31/)   § 55-248.31  &gt; Noncompliance with rental agreement; monetary penalty &gt;  &gt; A. Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or a violation of § 55-248.16 materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in 21 days, and that the rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice.  &gt;  &gt; B. If the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the tenant adequately remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate.  &gt;  &gt; C. If the tenant commits a breach which is not remediable, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this chapter, when a breach of the tenant’s obligations under this chapter or the rental agreement involves or constitutes a criminal or a willful act, which is not remediable and which poses a threat to health or safety, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement immediately and proceed to obtain possession of the premises. For purposes of this subsection, any illegal drug activity involving a controlled substance, as used or defined by the Drug Control Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.), by the tenant, the tenant’s authorized occupants, or the tenant’s guests or invitees, shall constitute an immediate nonremediable violation for which the landlord may proceed to terminate the tenancy without the necessity of waiting for a conviction of any criminal offense that may arise out of the same actions. In order to obtain an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the tenancy for illegal drug activity or for any other action that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act, the landlord shall prove any such violations by a preponderance of the evidence. However, where the illegal drug activity is engaged in by a tenant’s authorized occupants, or guests or invitees, the tenant shall be presumed to have knowledge of such illegal drug activity unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The initial hearing on the landlord’s action for immediate possession of the premises shall be held within 15 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant; however, the court shall order an earlier hearing when emergency conditions are alleged to exist upon the premises which constitute an immediate threat to the health or safety of the other tenants. After the initial hearing, if the matter is scheduled for a subsequent hearing or for a contested trial, the court, to the extent practicable, shall order that the matter be given priority on the court’s docket. Such subsequent hearing or contested trial shall be heard no later than 30 days from the date of service on the tenant. During the interim period between the date of the initial hearing and the date of any subsequent hearing or contested trial, the court may afford any further remedy or relief as is necessary to protect the interests of parties to the proceeding or the interests of any other tenant residing on the premises. Failure by the court to hold either of the hearings within the time limits set out herein shall not be a basis for dismissal of the case.  &gt;  &gt; D. If the tenant is a victim of family abuse as defined in § 16.1-228 that occurred in the dwelling unit or on the premises and the perpetrator is barred from the dwelling unit pursuant to § 55-248.31:01 based upon information provided by the tenant to the landlord, or by a protective order from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-279.1, or subsection B of § 20-103, the lease shall not terminate due solely to an act of family abuse against the tenant. However, these provisions shall not be applicable if (i) the tenant fails to provide written documentation corroborating the tenant’s status as a victim of family abuse and the exclusion from the dwelling unit of the perpetrator no later than 21 days from the alleged offense or (ii) the perpetrator returns to the dwelling unit or the premises, in violation of a bar notice, and the tenant fails promptly to notify the landlord within 24 hours thereafter that the perpetrator has returned to the dwelling unit or the premises, unless the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant had no actual knowledge that the perpetrator violated the bar notice, or it was not possible for the tenant to notify the landlord within 24 hours, in which case the tenant shall promptly notify the landlord, but in no event more than 7 days thereafter. If the provisions of this subsection are not applicable, the tenant shall remain responsible for the acts of the other co-tenants, authorized occupants or guests or invitees pursuant to § 55-248.16, and is subject to termination of the tenancy pursuant to the lease and this chapter.  &gt;  &gt; E. If the tenant has been served with a prior written notice which required the tenant to remedy a breach, and the tenant remedied such breach, where the tenant intentionally commits a subsequent breach of a like nature as the prior breach, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the subsequent breach, make reference to the prior breach of a like nature, and state that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice.  &gt;  &gt; F. If rent is unpaid when due, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment, and of the landlord’s intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55-248.35. If a check for rent is delivered to the landlord drawn on an account with insufficient funds, or if an electronic funds transfer has been rejected because of insufficient funds or a stop-payment order has been placed in bad faith by the authorizing party, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment and of the landlord’s intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid by cash, cashier’s check, certified check, or a completed electronic funds transfer within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55-248.35. Nothing shall be construed to prevent a landlord from seeking an award of costs or attorney fees under § 8.01-27.1 or civil recovery under § 8.01-27.2, as a part of other damages requested on the unlawful detainer filed pursuant to § 8.01-126, provided the landlord has given notice in accordance with § 55-248.6, which notice may be included in the five-day termination notice provided in accordance with this section.  &gt;  &gt; G. Except as provided in this chapter, the landlord may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or § 55-248.16. In the event of a breach of the rental agreement or noncompliance by the tenant, the landlord shall be entitled to recover from the tenant the following, regardless of whether or not a lawsuit is filed or an order obtained from a court: (i) rent due and owing as contracted for in the rental agreement, (ii) other charges and fees as contracted for in the rental agreement, (iii) late charges contracted for in the rental agreement, (iv) reasonable attorney fees as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law, (v) costs of the proceeding as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law only if court action has been filed, and (vi) damages to the dwelling unit or premises as contracted for in the rental agreement.  &gt;  &gt; H. In a case where a lawsuit is pending before the court upon a breach of the rental agreement or noncompliance by the tenant and the landlord prevails, the court shall award a money judgment to the landlord and against the tenant for the relief requested, which may include the following: (i) rent due and owing as of the court date as contracted for in the rental agreement, (ii) other charges and fees as contracted for in the rental agreement, (iii) late charges contracted for in the rental agreement, (iv) reasonable attorney fees as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law, unless in any such action the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant’s failure to pay rent or vacate was reasonable, (v) costs of the proceeding as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law, and (vi) damages to the dwelling unit or premises.  &gt;"	No
I'm asking this question for my boyfriend. Several years ago through a one night stand my boyfriend got a girl pregnant. About two years ago he found out it was his and has been paying child support since, but has not had or wanted any interaction or custody. The mother was fine with this arrangement and would still be. However, it turns out she has a pretty serious drug problem. The child has been taken from her and dcyf is demanding that my boyfriend take custody. He does not have the means or the ability or the inclination to care for this child. If it were up to him he would give the child up for adoption. He works full time and is about to start going back to school. But they say he has to or neglect charges will follow. I'm hoping somebody here can tell me what his options might be from this point and what possible consequences could come from those actions. Should he bother with a lawyer (We don't really have the money, but could probably fit it on a credit card)? The mother is being given a year to get right before having her rights terminated. The child is currently in foster care	No
My grandfather died several months ago and his trust leaves everything to my mom. She understands his wishes after death was to sell the property to my brother and split the proceeds equally amongst the siblings. After pressure from her siblings she agreed to sign an agreement stating that the property would be sold, maybe to my brother, and the proceeds distributed equally. When she got the agreement today a portion states that they will amend the trust to include all of the siblings and a clause that the trust must be sold within 90 days.  From my understanding once someone dies the trust can't be amended at all, is this correct?	No
"Hi /r/legaladvice,  I'll try to keep this as brief as I can, but I'm sorry, I know it will be long. I live with my boyfriend in the top floor of an eight-unit rent-stabilized apartment building in Brooklyn. Since we moved in, we've been having issues with our downstairs neighbors. The weekend after we moved in, one of them knocked on our door and asked if we were doing construction because he heard banging coming from our unit. We told him no and left on a cordial, if weird, note. He approached us a few times over the following month or so about the ""banging,"" and we told him we'd buy additional carpeting (since we didn't move in with much, and there is an 80% carpeting clause in our lease), but he seemed very frustrated when we explained that we weren't doing anything other than walking around the apartment and making your garden variety apartment living noise. He hasn't approached us since and graduated soon after the last time we spoke to banging on the ceiling with a broomstick whenever he deemed us too loud, which started at about once a week and has since gone down to once a month at the absolute maximum, always at seemingly random times.  Management's involvement started with a phone call sometime in October asking us to buy additional carpeting, which we did. Ceiling banging continued, and in January our neighbors called 311 about the noise and the police came to our apartment. I was folding my laundry in silence at the time, it was 12PM, and my boyfriend was on his phone on the couch... no banging, no music playing, no nothing. We don't own a stereo or even a TV. The cops told me the downstairs neighbors are ""very dramatic"" and that they've been to the building before for similar complaints, and that I shouldn't worry about it.  My boyfriend called management immediately after and asked them to address the issue, and their response was to come and inspect our rugs, which they did in mid-February. In March we received a letter from them stating that they could hear someone walking around ""heavily"" in our apartment from downstairs and that we needed to purchase additional carpeting and padding, which we did. (The vast majority of the hardwood floor, aside from what's covered by furniture, is now carpeted, by the way—I'm confident it is at least 80%.) I spoke briefly with the building manager to confirm that we'd purchased the rugs they'd requested and to address the most recent complaint alleging loud banging, which had occurred earlier that day. I told her the truth—that I'd spent the morning on the phone on my couch talking with a potential employer and, after that, that I'd watched Youtube videos on our bed while my boyfriend took a shower... nothing louder than that—and that we'd heard what sounded like hammering coming from the downstairs apartment.  We heard virtually nothing from either the neighbors or management and assumed the issue was resolved until mid-June, when we received a letter from our landlord's attorney stating that ""it is believed [the noise emanating from your apartment] rises to the level of nuisance, potentially justifying the termination of your tenancy,"" and:  ""You must ensure that you maintain a reasonable level of sound coming from your apartment. This must include a deliberate effort on your part to prevent excessive noise from your apartment, and the installation of soundproof padding under any and all rugs throughout the apartment. Should management receive any other complaints in regard to you and your invitees, we have been directed to seek the termination of your tenancy.""  We were understandably kind of flabbergasted by this, considering the only noise we make is really normal stuff—walking, opening and closing cabinets, cooking, showering, washing dishes—and, as I said, we have no stereo or TV (or pets, or kids) and have already purchased adequate carpeting. My boyfriend's parents spoke with a lawyer they know who advised that we should purchase soundproof rug pads and let the landlord know for now. We purchased pads (arriving tomorrow) and will confirm with management once we receive them, but I am really nervous about what the future holds considering what has happened thus far.  It's worth noting that there are no formal quiet hours in our lease—only the 80% carpeting clause, which we've complied with, and a vague statement that no tenant should disrupt the quiet enjoyment of another... nothing more official than that. It's also probably worth noting that there is renovation going on in both adjoining buildings and in another building two doors down, the noise from which we can hear (if only faintly) in our own unit. Like I said, our building is rent-stabilized, and we've never actually received a formal written complaint... we've only been notified that complaints have been received by management. I don't really know what the neighbors have been saying, other than that there is ""banging"" coming from our unit. Here are my questions:  * Do we have a legal right to know what these complaints actually say? * Given what's written above, is an eviction proceeding even a realistic possibility? What sort of proof would the landlord need in order to bring us to court? * Aside from buying the rug pads and informing our landlord that we've put them down, what can we do to advocate for ourselves? Is it worth seeing a lawyer and sending them a formal letter documenting that we've made reasonable accommodations and suggesting that perhaps the building—not us—is the problem... maybe asking them to test how noise travels or something? Our policy thus far has been to stay quiet and comply with requests, but it hasn't really seemed to, you know, work. * If the landlord DOES try to evict us, what should we do?  We have the opportunity to renew our lease and would really prefer to stay for a variety of reasons, but I don't want to get myself into a legal pickle if I can avoid it (and only have until August 29th to decide). I appreciate any advice anyone can provide!"	No
I am an international student currently enrolled in a University in CA. I had signed up for a 1 year lease for accommodation for my stay here. No actual pictures / sq-footage was provided upon request before I signed the lease but the place had great reviews on yelp/g-maps so we decided to go ahead given that there was a shortage of accomodations. Unfortunately upon arrival the place was too small for all of us, and we asked a few students if we can bail on the lease against the security deposit, to which we were informed that it does happen at times and shouldnt be a problem (I should have taken legal advice here itself).  Based on this info we decided to take a new place and signed up another lease for a year, and then decided to break the older place's lease (I wanted to break the lease before signing a new one but there is a shortage of accomodation so we decided to take this step first) - but the landlord has threatened to sue me if I do that. I am looking for alternative roommates to take my spot and settle this peacefully if I can. We cannot afford 2 places and are already burneded with student loans. Upon discussing this with a few friends, I have been suggested to default on the lease and handover possession of the apartment but I don't want to be sued for a lot more money than the actual rent.  Regarding defaults, the lease basically states that : 1. Failure of me paying rent / agreeing to this contract classifies as a default. 2. 3 days after owner gives a written notice (demanding that I pay rent or quit or cure default or quit pursuant to CCP Sec 1161 and 1162), this lease can be terminated at owners option, provided I fail to comply with owners demand. 3. After termination, owner shall have resident expressly grants to owner (what does this even mean?), the right to enter and take possession of the premises, exclude resident there from and store for 30 days, then sell the resident's surrendered personal property located therein.  Please advice, does it make sense to surrender ownership? Will I face legal trouble? Do I have any other options? I come from a poorer country and paying rent for 2 places is not going to be easy :(	No
"Sorry in advance for the long post, and formatting/spelling issues as I'm on mobile.  If you take the time to read it all, I'd really appreciate any help you can offer.  Hey Reddit, I don't have the resources to pay for an attorney's advice, and could really use some help. If you have any advice or have been in our situation, please share your knowledge.  It is helpful to not that my wife has various, diagnosed mental illness problems (generalized anxiety, PTSD, depression, borderline personality disorder.) And she takes prescribed meds to help treat these problems. This is known to my landlord and the upstairs couple and is the reason she has a service dog here.  Back story: My wife and I rent a (kind of) basement apartment in Colorado. We have 2 rooms, living room/dining area, bathroom and kitchenette(fridge, a little counter space with 2 cupboards and 2 drawers). The upstairs couple has to come downstairs to use the washer and dryer, and we have to go upstairs for the kitchen to cook and wash dishes, etc.   My landlord is the Aunt of the woman upstairs, and the mother of the woman upstairs is the owner of the house.   I was originally told that my landlord was the owner of the house, and that the couple upstairs rented from her. A couple months into my lease, my landlord told me that the mother of the woman upstairs is the owner and that she bought the house for the couple upstairs because they have bad credit. So they claim it is their house but is actually in her mother's name. Hopefully that makes sense, it turned out to be a complicated situation.  Regardless of who owns the place, the Aunt is still my landlord(she is the landlord on the lease I signed, and I deal with her directly for any problems with my apartment or people upstairs, and also pay all my bills to her. So the upstairs couple is not involved(with me) at all when it comes to my living space downstairs or the house in general, unless she is harassing and causing problems.   I have told the couple upstairs multiple times to leave my family alone, and to talk to my landlord about any issues they may have.   We have lived here since the beginning of March, and signed a 6 month lease.  The problem: The woman upstairs harasses my wife and I. It has happened about 4 time's since we have lived here. She has gotten in my face yelling, cursing and name calling once.  This happened because I talked to my landlord about asking them to stop throwing their cigarette butts on the ground, as my 1 year old daughter was picking them up and putting them in her mouth. Woman upstairs got mad because I wasn't ""adult enough"" to talk to them and had to bring her aunt into it. She also made it clear that we all need to talk to each other and get along because we live together. I told her that we don't live together, my family rent's the basement, and that we are not here to make friends, but to live a peaceful life and raise our 2 kids. This is when she began yelling at both of us and calling us names(with our kids present). My wife went inside while I finished my cigarette in the driveway. As I returned to the door to come inside, she began yelling again and cursing and name calling. I walked away and went inside to my basement. That is the only time she has started problems with me. The other times have been harassing my wife.  The second time she got in my wife's face yelling, cursing and name calling.   This started because we originally had an agreement to trade off every other weekend with them cleaning dog poop(we have a service dog for my wife, they have 2 dogs). They weren't holding up their end of the deal, so I told my landlord that I'd rather not trade off weeks, and simply clean up directly after my wife's dog poops. After my landlord talked to the woman about it, she became irate, came outside and got in my wife's face name calling and yelling at her(again with my kids present.) I was at work when this happened.  The landlord preferred that we continue trading weeks and I told her we'd try it again and that if there were problems again, we'd be only cleaning after my wife's dog.   Today while I was at work, she began harassing my wife again, about how she needed to clean up the dog poop, walking around the yard pointing out dog piles. My wife cleaned it all up 2 days ago. She yelled and cursed, name calling again with my kids there. So my wife told her that we'd no longer be cleaning after their animals and would only be cleaning up directly behind my wife's dog when he goes. She wasn't happy, yelled about my wife being a bitch and some other names.   My wife told her that she was sick of being harassed, and that this is the last time she'd warn her before she calls the police and reports her.   I have spoken with my landlord each time this has happened, and my landlord has also told me that we're not the first tenants the woman has caused problems with. Landlord has apologized for her niece's behavior, admits that it is unacceptable, and told me that she knows how hard her niece is to live around. Landlord has spoken with the couple upstairs, but nothing changes.  My lease is up at the end of August, so it's not too far away. But, this woman upstairs treating my wife and our family as she has has been detrimental to my wife's mental health. Her mental health has increasingly gotten worse because of this woman's harassment and problems. Another 6 weeks is a very long time for my wife to keep experiencing this treatment, and I'm afraid it's only going to cause her more issues.   Do I have any options to get out of my lease early and unpenalized? Or are we just trapped and stuck dealing with this crazy lady until the lease is up?  I'd sincerely appreciate and advice or words of wisdom about this as I'm completely lost and have no idea what to do stop it.   Thanks Reddit.  Tl;Dr: Wife has mental illness, woman upstairs in a shared living arrangement continues to cause problems and harass my wife and I. Her mental health is worse and we're still stuck in a lease for 6 more weeks."	No
I haven't actually called him out on it as of yet. If he does not agree with my discrepancy is there any legal action I could take? Seems like a classic bait and switch to me.   Craiglist ad is directly linked to his work email. I took screen shots. 	No
Hi I have some confusion regarding a leasing situation. Ill start with some background info before getting into the details. I signed a 1 year lease with an LLC, in 2015 from august 1st to July 31st. I renewed the lease last year for another year ending July 31st 2017. I sent an email with my notice to terminate the lease on May  2017. Now this is were the issue comes in to play. Last night my roommate sent an email to the landlord with a few general questions about deposit and other moving out related things. She replied that she had no idea that we were moving out and has started with demands that we need to pay rent for august and September.  Now some details from this point on I will refer to the landlord as B and my roommate as J. In 2016 B emailed us a lease renewal document on the June 1st, it had 2 options a check box to renew the lease or a box to terminate lease and vacate at end of the contract. It had a due date of June 5th. Because of this i thought that we needed to provide 60 days notice of intent to terminate the lease. Fast forward to May. After discusions with my gf and J I decided that i would not be renewing the lease. To give B plenty of notice, I sent the email stating my intent to terminate the lease on May 10th, 2017. The email was written as follows:  subject re Tractor   Hi B, I was wondering if you had an update on the mower? I would also like to inform you that I will not be renewing the lease. I met a wonderful women and I will be moving in with her. Last I checked J did not have plans to renew please double check with him.   Regards,  Now I know the email was received and opened on the same day because B replied with an update on the mower. So i assumed she read the whole email since it was 4 sentences. I forwarded that email to B showing her that i did provided notice. upon receiving that email B changed her demands from Aug and Sept rent to that the lease states the tenant must provide 90 days notice and that the lease automatically renewed.  this is what the lease states about renewal: 22. LEASE RENEWAL: A. At the end of this Lease Agreement, Tenant shall have the option to renew the Lease for an additional term that is equal to the initial term of this lease (Term of Lease Agreement) pursuant to the terms and conditions contained herein.  B. If Tenant or Landlord does not wish to renew the Lease, written notice must be given to the other party at least 90 days before the end of the term (Term of Lease Agreement) to terminate the Lease (including any exercised renewal or extension thereof).  I understand that I only provided 82 days of notice.  Finally to my questions. Does the section of the lease above actually automatically renew? i understand that it gives me the option to renew and states how to go about terminating the lease but never mentions auto renewal. Since she only required 60 days last year and never sent a renewal email this year do I have some kind of case based on confusion and lack of notification from the Landlord? What should i do and expect from here?  Thanks for your time and advise	No
Tl;dr: booked hotel, they upped reservation price after the fact. called bank to reject the charge and now hotel is threatening legal action and am just wondering if they have the right to do that.  I was looking for a place to stay for a few days in NYC and had stumbled on this hotel. Thinking it was okay for the price I had booked a reservation to stay only to find out the price that I had booked it for was later raised and I was charged for it. When i called to try to cancel the reservation they had said there would be a cancellation fee equal to the booking cost, which had already been charged to my card months in advance of the reservation date. I called my bank claiming fraud, that was charged wrongly and today i receive a call from the hotel threatening me with legal action asking for triple damage charges. I don't know what to do and feel entirely wronged. I do see that I had told the bank fraud, where in fact that mag not be the correct way but I was so frustrated and flustered that I didn't know what to do. I really need help on this and need to know what to do to just get this out of my hair.	No
"I'm not at a risk of getting fired - but have been considering changing jobs if i find a better paying position.      My contract comes with a non compere clause for 12 months and NDA for 24 months limited geographically to my current country.  BUT it also comes with a line that, when translated, says:   ""The amount of monthly compensation is agreed upon at the end of the contract."".   Since sum is not specified, what stops me from asking a compensation equal to my full salary for the duration and refuse small and tiny compensations they might offer?"	No
I work for a Fortune 500 company in California.  I accepted an offer in the fall of 2016.  The offer did not explicitly list my PTO days, but it had a link to the current benefits site.  The current benefits site detailed that PTO days for employees in my range would be X, and a footnote that said the schedule would change on 1 Jan 2017.  My hiring was delayed by the company until 2017, and now I make X-16 hours of PTO, according to the new schedule.    I believe this has happened to numerous other employees as well, since my hiring class was around 100, and all had offers accepted in 2016.  Do I have any recourse for the company changing the terms of employment?	No
Roommate gave key to boyfriend w/o discussing it with me. I came home one day after being away and heard someone enter the apartment. Expecting it to be my roommate, it was her boyfriend and she was nowhere to be found. She refuses to return the key and I'm forced to live with the couple until I can find a replacement. He spends every night here. What are my options, please?   Lease has no duplicate key clause.   Thank you.	No
Is there an online form I can use to file a judgement against him?  Or a way to garnish wages?	No
"I'm currently moving to a new place somewhere else in Minnesota.  Yet, my roommate is demanding I remove my stuff from the living room because ""it looks like junk"".   I'm currently packing stuff up for my new place, yet he's strongly demanding that I get my stuff out of the living room.      I told him repeatedly not to touch my belongings.  I even told him that I called the police and informed him that he's trying to throw out my belongings.  What should be my next step if I find that my belongings are gone?      Do I have any recourse to call the police and show them the text messages?  Is that enough proof to charge him with theft?"	No
Backstory: I'm transferring from my local community college to go to Cal in the Bay Area. Housing was ridiculously hard to find, so I'm living in a small house split into two apartment units with people I've never met. There is 4 rooms being rented out in the unit I'll be living in, and I was the 2nd person to sign a lease for one of the rooms. All 4 rooms were leased out as single rooms to 4 different people. Turns out there is no wall separating two of the rooms. They emailed me saying I can either rent out a room in the other unit that is more expensive because of it being secluded (which I can't afford), or share the room until a wall is built (they still need to get permits from the city) in a couple months. They claimed that the other 2 people that signed up for singles have already moved in. I emailed them back saying I was not pleased about it, but I'll share the room until they get a wall up. This all occurred about a week and a half ago.  Fast forward to yesterday and one of the roommates that supposedly already moved into his single emailed me asking if I could set up the internet because he will not be moving in until the 11th. I signed up for a room, and also will be moving in before him (on the 2nd). Another email came in and made it seem like the other guy with a single room also hasn't moved in.  So my question is, what would happen if I move in and take one of the empty single rooms? The lease I signed states that I'll be getting a single room to myself and the other room is even 50 sq feet smaller than the one I'd be getting after the wall is built. The rent is only a $50/month difference, but I'd be willing to bite the bullet on that if I had to just to guarantee that I'll have privacy. I don't get why the landlord (which is a corporation) is singling me out for sharing a room in the first place since I was the 2nd person to sign up for a room and will be moving in and paying rent for a longer period than the other roommates.  Could they do anything about me taking the other room since they are already breaching the contract we signed by not actually having a room for just me to rent?	No
"Hello, everyone.  I submitted 60-day notice to break my lease with my current apartment complex because of noise complaints against a tenant. In addition, there are renovations being completed that have been handled poorly so I wanted to get an idea of what steps I should do next or what I could expect.  1) **Noise:** According to my lease, a tenant must:   ""Respect the privacy of your neighbors with regard to televisions, radios, and stereos.  Gatherings must not become loud, boisterous, rude or generally disturbing to other residents.  Residents playing loud music in their units, the common area or cars will be in violation of their lease and may be issued a citation for disturbing the peace.""  The city noise ordinance says:   ""As to multifamily structures including apartments, condominiums, or other residential arrangements where boundary lines cannot readily be determined, operate or allow the operation of any sound amplification equipment so as to create sounds registering 55 db(A) between 8:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. Sunday through Thursday or between 8:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Friday or Saturday or 50 db(A) at any other time, as measured from any point within the interior of another residential unit in the same complex or within the boundary line of the nearest residentially occupied property.""  I have spoken to him in person, called the office over 10 times, emailed the office, called the courtesy officer twice, and called 911 once. Despite these notices, he continues to play music through a subwoofer on his television after 11 pm, often throughout an entire night.   Since talking/calling/emailing/911 did not stop the music issue, I decided to submit my notice because the behavior continued. I have lived here 4.5 years and this has been a constant the entire time. The apartment has changed management twice so I'm afraid they will ignore everything.   2) **Construction:** My biggest concern is the safety of the walkway and the lights. On July 6, the walkway looked like this:  http://imgur.com/71Jq3ZF  My boyfriend had to crawl over the boards to get to school that morning.  I feel like a small amount of debris is absolutely understandable, but this is not easy to walk over and it has nails sticking out.  The exterior lights have been out since July 5, and the manager's email says construction replaced the lights when they have not as of last night. The below image is the view from the sidewalk and the place where the light should be installed.  http://imgur.com/QpTPDTS  http://imgur.com/dziOj0P   **Reply:**  When I emailed corporate (after emailing and speaking to someone in the office) to bring the noise complaints and the walkway/lights to their attention, I got an email saying they would not release me from my lease.   ""I understand you have had some issues with noise from your neighbors that our on site staff has addressed with your neighbors.  We have also shared with you that we have a courtesy officer that could assist in these matters after business hours.  While I cannot address issues that occurred prior to the management change to [company name], you mentioned that you have emails that you could provide regarding your complaints to the office.  I would be happy to review them for you.    As for the construction, we have sent out numerous notices to the residents informing them of the days their buildings would be under renovation.  Understand that in the middle of this renovation some debris will fall but is being picked up on a daily basis.  We were unaware of the lights in your building but once we were made aware of this, we had construction put them back immediately.    Without further documentation that our on site staff with [company name] has not followed policies and procedures, I cannot agree to release you from your lease at this time.  If you would like to provide the documentation you alluded to in your email, again I would be happy to review them on your behalf.""    I'm not worried about this part, but if you read his reply regarding the fact they provided notice about the construction, the notices that were sent out regarding the dates the construction crew needed access to my apartment were incorrect.  The first notice stated the construction crew would need access to my specific building's apartments on June 29. The construction did not actually start until July 5.  The second email stated construction would replace windows for my specific building on July 18. The access to the apartment was not made until July 24.    I have not emailed him back yet, but I have compiled a list of my previous emails and dates I called the office, called police records to confirm I called 911, taken pictures at night of the unlit building and took pictures of the uninstalled lights.  I can pay a buyout fee of $1416, but I would like to avoid this because I feel like I shouldn't be penalized for all the times I've contacted management and nothing is being done regarding the noise complaints. I'm also uneasy because he was willing to say the lights were put back by construction when they were not.  At this point, I would pay the buyout fee just to leave here and avoid the hassle, but is there anything I can do to get them to let me break the lease? Any tips on what I should email back? I have a draft prepared with the pictures and previous emails."	No
I am renting the basement of my two-flat to an elderly woman. She is frail and often needs help from her long time friend(1st floor tenant) to care for her. Recently, I've been starting to smell urine more often. What kind of recourse do I have in this matter? What would be the most gentle way of address this issue? Thanks in advance.	No
I filed this patent with her in September of 2015. I have tried everything I can to reach her. As of recently I received a mass email from her law firm stating that they have new contact information. Something seems off and feels like they are covering something especially due to the way the email was written and phrased. I just want my patents out of this hole.	No
"Long story short: Wife works as an RN in California. She hasn't been getting union dues deducted from her paychecks for quite some time (something I've been on her about checking in with, but I guess she/we are just too busy to rectify the problem.. we do acknowledge that unions are important and thought she just wasn't signed on with hers, not that she wasn't paying the dues).   Nowhere on her paychecks since roughly 2014 has there been a union dues deduction. Recently, she has received a letter from her union stating that they have experienced ""phenomenal growth"" in recent years and that some employees have fallen through the cracks of their antiquated system, thus deductions had stopped for some employees.   With their updated database they've discovered that some people owe money, and we're being told that she now owes more than a thousand dollars in back payments just because this union decided to upgrade a system and discovered they fucked up and weren't deducting people properly.   The document is basically admitting fault here. I called the union myself and discovered that it's basically a mandatory repayment (of course they are going to say that), but that there's ""no due date""... they just want to set up a payment plan.  The rep did say, however, that collections could be involved at a later time if no payments are arranged.   What are my options?  It just seems like an odd move for a union to go about correcting their huge mistake like this.. my wife wants to just blindly pay the amount, but I am extremely hesitant.   Any advice is greatly appreciated."	No
Under our side of our duplex there's a little door that leads to the piping, heaters/boilers, machinery of both units. Under our unit, while inspecting it with the maintinence guy, my boyfriend found a large amount of black mold.  &amp;nbsp;  For one, we've already spoken to our landlord about our AC not working properly, and we're in Georgia in the summer, so this is about as pleasant as you'd expect. They sent someone out and supposedly fixed it. They did not. They then (also on the first visit)  pointed out that there's a leak in our washing machine, to which the second maintinence guy said is probably what caused the mold.  &amp;nbsp;  We took a few pictures of the mold, and I plan on sending our leasing company an email outlining these issues, as well as the fact that we've been running our AC under their assurance that it is working and it wasn't, running up our electricity bill. I will be asking them to re-reimburse us as well as either fixing this mold issue within 24 hours or that they need to house us at another property, or something to that effect, as we just got a two-month-old puppy a day before finding this out, and black mold (which is right under our bedroom) is particularly dangerous to infants. **I've even read somewhere that this may be valid grounds to break our lease without damaging our credit and even get some sort of 500-dollar civil fee from our landlord?** I don't care about the fee so much as leaving this place, because I honestly don't feel like they're going to fix this in a timely manner, and my boyfriend and I are beginning to feel signs of the mold's effects... we have no clue how long it's even been down there, but the side effects have been felt for a month or two now (chronic fatigue, chest compression/finding it hard to breathe, etc.) and my boyfriend and I are fit, and healthy, well under weights considered to be obese.  &amp;nbsp;  What can/should we do here?	No
"So about half a year ago I noticed a $200 ish charge on my credit card that I had not made. Looked up the company in question and found many complaints about continued charges after cancelling the service this company provides (online dating). I then called my bank and got them to mark the charge as fraud and they sent me a new card. Yesterday I received a letter from a credit services company. The letter begins by saying this is a 72 hour demand. It goes on tell me it has been sent in accordance with provincial legislation and that the credit service has attempted to find a solution with me, though this is the first time I have heard anything from this company since a had to get a new credit card. Then it says the debt is past due and IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION may be the only way to resolve the matter. It tells me after obtaining a provincial court order they may garnish my wages, attach real estate or property I own, seize money in my accounts, seize and sell assets and have my finances examined in court. ""There is still time to deal with the matter"" it goes on to say but if no reply is received in 72 hours they will make a referral back to the client for IMMEDIATE LEGAL ACTION with no further notice to me. What should I do?"	No
