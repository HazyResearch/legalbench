0	About two years ago when I was a freshman in college I got in some legal trouble. Basically ended up in the hospital super drunk, freaked out, accidentally injured a nurse while they were trying to restrain me. I woke up still intoxicated with a police officer instructing me to sign a piece of paper. I did that then I passed back out. When I next woke up there was a doctor there who told me what had happened and that the nurse I accidentally hurt didn't want to press charges.  I hired an attorney and found out (I believe my attorney told me) that the police officer was also trying to charge me with assault and battery. A few days later I showed up at the local court house with my attorney. He spoke to the judge who decided to get rid of the misdemeanor Minor in Consumption and battery charge and instead give me one charge of Disturbing the Peace. I informally plead guilty by telling my attorney to take the deal. I then paid a fine, and that was that. My attorney also mentioned that, because my battery charge hadn't been formally written up and filed yet, it wouldn't show up on my criminal record. Does that sound accurate and plausible?  Now, back to my main question: how can this all be on my file if I never remember having my fingerprints or a mugshot taken? They wouldn't have done that in the hospital, right? I would have had to have been booked into jail?  I'm also an Elementary Education major and I've taken two fingerprint checks, neither of which have come up with anything that the Board of Education found bad enough to bar me from teaching. Does that mean they didn't find anything, or that they don't care about my record?	Yes
1	I got back after a long day and the first thing I wanted to do was take my bra off.   I was already in the middle of changing out of my work clothes by the time I realized my roommate left the shades open. I immediately went over and closed them.   Two days later a friend of mine contacted me to say a friend of his sent him and a few others pictures of me undressed that looked like they'd been taken from outside my apartment.   I did some checking around and learned this creep lives in the building next door to me, and considering the pictures, likely has a view directly into my place.   Now the photo has been passed around a considerable amount, two other people have contacted me to warn me it was sent to them and check if I knew the photos had been taken.  I'm mortified and feel violated. I haven't confronted the guy who took the original pictures. I asked the people who knew him (none of my friends knew him that well) and they all said he's a douche bag, a bit of a misogynist, but they'd never known him to be dangerous or anything like that.   I'm not sure what to do but I'd like to be able to do something. Taking the pictures of me without my knowledge is bad enough, but sending them around(?!) that must cross some legal line, right?	Yes
2	So I was driving home from my weekly UA and classes as required after last DUI (wouldnt have even been in that town if not for these obligations). Sober all day, and days prior to that.  For some reason I seizured, passed out, etc behind the wheel not 10 minutes after meeting my PO.  Single vehicle accident, hit a curb.  Eneded up goin to the hospital to get checked since I was frightened I may have had a seizure or something Consented that I'd do the state test via blood and UE.  Nothing to hide.  All came back clean for everything.  I wasnt worried, just thought I'd get driving under suspension...Well this cop finds an empty package of Kratom which was not consumed anytime prior to the accident. He writes me a DUi (which I've had a few guilties of but learned my leason)...With this additional charge I could face substantial jail time even though I was not in anyway intoxicated.  I was never given sobriety tests, read rights etc.  This cop may have just ruined my life right as was rebuilding it, so pissed!  Any advice?	Yes
3	"I have a fairly high end computer (custom built) that was a few years old.   Recently I started having lots of issues with it and upon further troubleshooting/inspection noticed some of the modular connections on my power supply were melted.  Oddly enough the machine continued to limp along until I made this discovery.  The power supply is a ""high end"" 1000W and had a 5 year warranty so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. Was a fairly painless transaction.  My issues persisted even with the new power supply (instability, etc)   I tried my ram sticks one at a time and the issue continued with all four and so I figured my motherboard had been damaged (in hindsight i should have bought all new ram at the same time)  Being a high end X99 platform it made sense to just replace the motherboard as any kind of an upgrade would be very expensive and not much gain to me as I just use it for office/IT tech work and gaming.  The replacement motherboard did not fix the issue so I started to suspect my ram/processor.  I am awaiting a replacement processor from Intel and new ram from amazon.  I have been in contact with a seemingly helpful/friendly person from the PSU company and had originally shipped them my motherboard for further inspection. I have not yet heard back their diagnosis on the motherboard but regardless I will not be using it again.  I emailed them today and explained everything ive done and money it has cost me and i've asked what they can do for me.   If they don't offer a reasonable settlement to this matter is it a good idea to sue them in small claims court? I have spent many hours troubleshooting and dealing with this system including loss of productivity at work from having to use my laptop which is not ideal for IT work.   In hind sight I should have just bought all new components right away after the PSU failure and then tried to work out compensation with them but I opted to try to fix it one part at a time."	No
4	"A couple months ago, as title says, I was offered a job through a contracting agency, which I accepted and relocated for (only a few hundred miles, but still a trek when relocating all your belongings).  The day before I was supposed to start, I hadn't received any onboarding documents from them so I started to get a little worried and tried to make contact. They ignored me all day until that night when they told me that there had been ""some mistake"" and I no longer had a job.  I was able to maintain some sort of contact with them for about  a week after, in which I was told they could give me some compensation for things like **relocation, security deposit, one month rent**. However after this they simply stopped responding and I never got my compensation.  I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to move forward with getting said compensation from them."	No
5	I'm in a dispute with my former landlord. Long story short, my lawyer send him a letter that he never addressed.  I prodded him about it and he just now asked that I have it forwarded on to his lawyer. The letter gives him 7 days to act, so there is a little time sensitivity to it.  My question is, is it my responsibility to have the letter forwarded on to his lawyer after he received it? Or should I tell him it's not my job to do that?	No
