"I want to make this short so people will read this and give me advice, cause I've never been in this much trouble before.  I'm a 19 y/o male college student, and I was arrested a week ago while sitting in my car in a neighborhood near my house (I was alone). Cops searched my car and found my mason jar, which contained:  - ~14 grams of marijuana (in two different bags)  - A pea-sized amount of wax (hashish), with a paperclip  - A grinder  - 3 packs of rolling papers  - A small bag of tobacco  - A paintbrush that smelled of marijuana (I used it to clean my grinder)  I stupidly lied to my arresting officer when he initially asked if I had drugs in the car, they searched my car with probable cause, and after that I was cooperative. The cop asked ""why did you lie to me?"" then said ""Nevermind you don't have to answer that"" so I never admitted to having knowledge of the marijuana (not that it matters.. I was my car).  Also, I had not been smoking that day, and the officers knew that (they let me drive my car home after they booked me), so DUI isn't an issue.  I was charged with a misdemeanor. I have already hired a lawyer, and he contacted my arresting officer, and the officer agreed to bring it down to a disorderly conduct. But, my lawyer said I was going to have trouble getting the District Attorney to agree to that due to the amount and the wax/rolling papers.  Any advice or sympathy would be much appreciated, this is my first brush with the law and it's really scary. Thank you in advance!!"	Yes
Hi, I'm new to legal advice and being in trouble in general, so please let me know if I'm missing anything.  First things first, I'm going to turn myself in obviously, I'm going to have my lawyer set up a time to do that.  About 5 years ago, my drug addict father showed up at my mom's house, after I hadn't seen him for over a year. In my opinion, he was messed up on prescription painkillers when he arrived. He was parked in the driveway, I yelled at him to leave, we yelled at each other. He tried to open the car door and I closed it back on him. I ran inside, called my mom, and he backed out of the driveway, called the cops and said I was threatening him. We were the only two people present. Honesty, I have no idea what I said to him. I was 20 at the time, and pretty upset that my abusive father showed up at my house without warning. The police arrived, assessed the situation, and told me something about how in domestic cases they usually arrest someone no matter what, but that my father wasn't going to sign a complaint and they told him to not come back to the property. The next day, apparently he called the police to sign a complaint. A warrant was issued for my arrest at the time, for misdemeanor domestic abuse  Here's where it gets fucked. I was never notified I had a warrant. Nobody ever showed up at my house. I never got a letter in the mail. I've had my ID ran by multiple police departments, including the one wanting to arrest me now (never in trouble or any other charges ever, just verbal warnings), applied for jobs, school, new passport, left the country and went through customs, etc ect. Nothing ever came up, so I had no idea.  About a year after that, my father passed away because his liver failed, due to the ridiculous amount of prescription pills and alcohol he was consuming.  Cut to just now. The police called me, saying they were going through old warrants and needed me to turn myself in. They explained that they tried to have the state's attorney quash the warrant, but the attorney refused. I'm not walking into the police station without a lawyer obviously.   What the hell happens next? The cops are saying that they'll transport me to court, I get booked, and then the bond court will PROBABLY throw it out. I don't believe them at all. I have bail/bond money, but I'm just afraid as fuck of jail.	Yes
What's the best way to fight the ticket?	Yes
My gf works in hospitality, she closed out her drawer and made her drop into the safe at work which then got stuck and did not make it into the safe. After she had left her coworker came and stole the envelope out of the safe. They have cameras and caught him on camera doing this. He is denying it and will be taking a lie detector test. The owner of the business told her that if he doesn't fess up she will be responsible for paying him back. Im trying to figure out what we need to do. Apparently this is a problem with the safe and she has always made sure to check to make sure her drops made it into the safe, apparently this time is got stuck on the side and she did not notice it when checking and thought it made into the safe. I'm just worried that if he does not fess up etc that they will try to hold her paycheck, it was around one thousand dollars stolen and she does not have the money to pay them back.	Yes
Can someone help me find a warrant? I have called the jails. The only thing I have is the Warrant or Case Number. 	Yes
"I have a friend who works at a crappy retail store (think glorified goodwill) and during break her coworker followed her to the break room and said something along the lines of ""let's just bang it out right here in the break room"" she laughed it off and started to walk away, then he grabbed her and pinned her against the wall and tried to kiss her, she basically fought it off and said ""wtf get off me"" and walked away. As she was walking away he grabbed her arm and pulled her skirt up, she fought him away and just left work to go home.    She messaged the manager and told him what went down and he basically got both of them in the same room and gave HER the choice on if she wanted to fire him. The manager guilted her by saying things like;   1) he has 3 children to take care of 2) he has been to jail in the past so it's hard for him to find a job   I personally think the manager just does not want to lose another worker because this place is literally always hiring and is always understaffed. He said that he just won't schedule them the same days  Help?"	Yes
I'm 15 and got caught stealing at Walmart I know I'm really dumb so don't bother commenting saying I'm dumb i know I am for this but in all honesty I need to know What my options are here . I stole under $30 worth of merchandise (2 iPhone chargers) and they caught me and took me to a room and officers came and wrote me a ticket or whatever . I gave them my first and last name as well as the first initial to my middle name but keep in mind this happened in Texas and I live in Florida. I gave the officers my old house address which is a rental house and they said I have until august 7th to go to court and pay a fine or they will put out a warrant for my arrest. So the question is should I tell my parents or just leave it alone and don't worry about them trying to find me back in Florida ? since they don't have my real address. Will they be able to put a warrant for my arrest in Only Texas since this all happened in Texas or Florida too ? or would they still be able to find me? can I pay this over the phone without showing up to court since I leave Texas tomorrow ?  	Yes
A friend of mine is facing a serious felony assault charge, his lawyer told him he may be able to plead down to a lesser assault but it could go to jury where he is risking 2-8 year prison term. He asked the lawyer about if a person leaves the state for the coast since he hasn't been served a warrant. The lawyer said if he did he would never be extradited but would spend 30 days in jail and released basically any time he got a ticket. He also said that once this happens a clock starts and that after seven years there would be a statute of limitations. This doesn't sound correct to me, but if that's true it honestly seems better than risking his life being ruined. Any legal experts here that can verify this? Thanks. He is from Ohio.	Yes
