Hello, Im in Ontario, Canada.  I have an idea for a business (a solution to the adblock problem).  I am not in a position to make my own company or pay for a prototype to be built.  I was considering using the idea as leverage (lets assume the idea is good) to get a job with an advertising agency that could actually utilize it.  My issue is if I reveal my idea and the company just runs with it without me, would I have any legal recourse? (I am assuming not)  And if not, how could I approach this in a way to cover myself? Would provisional patent be relevant?  The idea in question is pretty basic (in fact I am shocked that no one is doing it) so it would be very easy to steal.  Any advice?	Yes
I formed an LLC with a couple of friends last year. My two partners now wish to leave and give me full control over the LLC. What documents do I need to get them to sign to gain full control over the LLC? Thank you!	Yes
"Just like it says in the title our web designer has chosen to not only restrict our access from the site but has now completely taken it down. I get a ""forbidden"" error when trying to visit the site. When I do a domain search it's his name that comes up as the owner and administrator. However the domain name is clearly our band name.        This was kind of a ""friends deal"" and to my knowledge no contracts were written or signed. Is there any legal action we can take to regain ownership or are we screwed?"	Yes
After 5 long months (3 of which I was backpacking), I finally got my logo finalized with said company.  When I asked them to send me the logo, they said I legally can't use the logo because it has not been copyrighted and technically they own the logo however I paid for the design.  Now they want me to pay $250 dollars for the copyright.   My question is, if they send me the finalized logo (which some reviews say they wont unless you pay for the copyright), can I use it as a image for my company.  I will be selling to some online retailer platforms and want to make sure they do not sue me in the future.  The company itself has been reviewed as a scam but they seem legitimate.  However, when you actually deal with them, all the things they say they would do in the package you bought, they will either sluggishly do it or not do it at all. Definitely the most frustrating experience I have ever had. Total lack of commitment and so much dishonesty with this company.  All I want is the logo so I can move on with my life and not do anything to have them bother me in the future	Yes
I'll try to keep this short and keep as little reference to names or job titles as possible. Basically, about 6 years ago I met a girl who had semi-famous parents and I ended up marrying. During the course of our relationship, I suggested starting a YouTube channel and various social media with her father who was a professional athlete. My intent was to build a brand around it under the idea that eventually my wife and I would take over once they retire and that we could live off of the fame and publicity (my wife also became a pro athlete after I convinced her to let her father mentor her). Everything was fine, until she decided it would be a good idea to cheat on me and move to a completely different state with the dude randomly. I waited and tried to reconcile with her for over a year with no luck and it tore me up extremely badly. She also ran off with the majority of our assets and money and left me with very little. So not only did my wife disappear over night but also my career. She and her family also refused to give me my filming equipment back until just recently we had it court ordered back to me next month. Over the period with the drama between my wife and I, my in-laws approached me about buying me out in both person and through text. I informed them that I still wanted to wait and see if my wife returned before I made any big decisions, and I was also concerned about whether she would try and claim it as community property or not and if I would get in trouble for selling before we reached a settlement. Everything was created before we were married, so that's not the problem. The problem is that eventually they texted me wanting to buy me out still and after consulting with my family lawyer they thought that if I could get an offer that we could draft up a contract that would legally absolve any possible right my wife had to the stake in IP and social media. I asked them to give me an offer and they did not. After a couple of weeks I was then informed that they were suing me and placing a restraining order against me (even thought I had not voluntarily contacted them in over a year). Since we were family, we had no formal contract- But the agreement always was that I kept the revenue from the channel in exchange for building her dads fame and increasing his value  (which it did EXPONENTIALLY). The YouTube account and all contracts associated are all under my name. The Logo was also created by me and I have all original photoshop, sony vegas, and over 7 TB of footage and pictures to show my ownership- But hiring an IP lawyer is going to cost me a minimum of a $20,000 retaining fee. And I have very little money thanks to my wife taking everything with her and my inability to get my equipment back to be gainfully employed normally. I feel like they are trying to back me into a corner so that I settle for much less than it's worth or just give it up. But this is the last 6 years of my life work and I would prefer if I could at least get some startup money for a future venture of my own so that I can start new. What should be my next step? We're talking potentially millions of dollars worth of value in assets and I know that he is feeling the hurt and pressure from his sponsors otherwise he wouldn't be trying to get it so badly. Especially given the fact that he always belittled my work and acted as if it had no actual value to him (even though he always wanted to continue doing it).   Hopefully this is easy to understand. This is a throwaway account just for the record because I'm not sure if names getting out would hurt me or just them.	Yes
I've been writing some episodes of an animated series I plan to post on YouTube in the future, after my animation skills improve. A few of the episodes, however, have scenes that take place in an amusement park. My animations are hand-drawn (I never could figure out computer animation, and I think traditional/2D looks better anyway).  To hopefully avoid the tremendous work that would be animating these rides from scratch, I briefly considered building a replica of the amusement park in Roller Coaster Tycoon 3, taking some videos, and tracing the images to use in my animated series. But before I decide to do this, would it get me in any legal trouble?  A few notes:  1. Credit would be given to the makers of RCT3.  2. I would only be tracing the rides themselves (and possibly some scenery)  3. I don't plan on making money off of this series	Yes
Hi /r/legaladvice!   I have a question for you guys: I plan to journal/blog and would discuss medical issues, but should state that my thoughts are not medical advice and that they do not reflect my training institution. What would I need to take in mind if I wanted to use a disclaimer posted in a similar medical education website that also waives its status as medical advice/representation of any training institution?	Yes
"Hey friends, would love the community's thoughts on my situation.   I own and operate an ecommerce store. We're currently talking to a well-known artist about licensing his work to use on our merchandise.   The artist's licensing people have asked for a proposed royalty, advance, and guarantee. I'm trying to calculate these figures in a way that makes sense. In the last 30 days, our top 400 products generated a total of $1900 in sales per product (over $20k annualized). We plan on licensing over 500 designs from the artist. What sort of calculation needs to happen here?   My understanding is that a royalty of about 15% is appropriate give the fame of the artist and the fact that I operate a sort of ""specialty shop."" I've heard a $25k advance for an artist's catalog makes sense. But what about the guarantee?   We only have an online presence (only retail, no wholesale).   Does anyone have any experience in this area? Many thanks in advance."	Yes
"Hi,  I'm from this page https://www.facebook.com/SaisTuQuee  We post videos with permission from the owners  Recently a video got reported from a company ""TheSoul Publishing"" which the video copyright is not belong to them.  and i have the permission from the owner : http://i.imgur.com/CSyUiqG.png  Facebook deleted the video from our page  http://i.imgur.com/ArqB0A6.png  is there any solution to fix this ?

Have a small service business (similar to plumbing, electrical) and am starting it with another person that has decades of experience forming and running companies (i have none).    We are equal partners at this time.    He told me he was going to have his lawyer draw up the paperwork, and that he would be listed as President, and I would be Secretary.  Is it unusual to list the second person as Secretary?  I told him i thought it would be more appropriate for me to be listed as Vice President, and he said okay... but when i received a draft of the paperwork, i was still listed as Secretary in it.  So should i be concerned about this, or are the titles more or less arbitrary?  I assume that two people cant be President, so I am fine conceding that to him due to his experience, but should i insist on having the title of Vice President for legal reasons?  As a side note, i dont believe anything malicious was intended by not changing it in the paperwork, it's more likely that he just forgot to do it.  He had a multi-million dollar company with nearly 100 employees in the past, and is extremely knowledgeable about tax codes and legal partnerships, and such, so i pretty much trust his judgement... but i am still curious.	Yes
This past week we have noticed people selling one of our t-shirt designs through some online print on demand platforms. These companies are the sort where anyone can submit artwork and get it printed. I believe these companies are in the US. One company we contacted and they have removed the listing, and the other we are contacting right now. Between both listings, these people have earned a few thousand dollars from my design. Since it's relatively a low amount I understand that it might not be worth dragging lawyers into the situation...but it annoys me that there are US companies that are aiding these a$$holes and profiting from stealing my design.   I can post more specific information if it would be helpful.	Yes
What are the steps to go through for putting ownership in writing per say with a logo that we designed for our business? I don't know if this is the type of legaladvice /r/legaladvice is for but, I figured I'd give it a shot.  Esp	Yes
I'm trying to put out a piece of hardware that would be used by laboratories, so I guess it falls under the umbrella of lab equipment. Obviously, I would like to comply with all regulations, but was wondering what relevant organizations/documents I should take a look at. I was thinking along the lines of FDA/FCC maybe? Any help would be appreciated!	Yes
So I thought up an idea and I would like to build it and sell it to people on craigslist or online or even to companies that will have me. Others thought of [this](https://patents.google.com/patent/US20040189246A1/en?q=mouse&amp;q=charging&amp;q=wireless#legalEvents) as well in 2002. Will I get sued if I follow through?	Yes
I recently signed a contract with Jukin Media granting them the rights to license my video to other media outlets. I was offered $200 up front for signing and 70% of all revenue made from the video.      I didn't research the company as much as I should, and now I'm wanting out. I have not filled out any personal info that would allow them to pay me, so as far as the contract states, they can't use the video. The contract said this about terminations:      &gt;T4. Termination. Licensor may seek to terminate this Agreement at any time; however, this Agreement shall only be terminable upon the mutual agreement of the parties, the consent of which may be granted or denied in Jukin’s sole discretion. No termination shall impact any prior license of the Images by Jukin prior to termination, which shall continue in full effect under the terms of this Agreement.      Since I cannot be paid and they cannot use the video because of that, I don't see why they would want to deny the termination request, since the video would seemingly be in limbo.      But I was wanting to ask about the wording of that excerpt. Does it imply that if the contract is terminated, they will still retain rights to use the video, despite the fact that the contract associated with it was cancelled?	Yes
I want to get a business license for a home based business I want to start. The application for a license asks for my home address. Would there be any ramifications if I use a mailbox that has a street address (from a local store not a PO box) instead?	Yes
Quick run-down:   - My hand-made accessory is listed on ebay and etsy in Sep 2015 and I sold 20 units to a local store around that time period.   - Company files patent on my accessory in Nov 2015  - Company gets patent published in May 2017  What do I do now reddit? Do I have any good plays? I found a public forum entry from 2009 that details how to go about making the accessory, will this count as prior art to invalidate their patent? Can my ebay listing count as prior art?   Really appreciate any feedback!	Yes
Hello I previously worked at a organization that had an IMax theater where we showed Star Wars Episode 7. One day after work I went to throw something in the dumpster and found the entire movie in 70mm film. I quickly loaded about 500 feet of film into my car, took it home, cleaned it, and boxed it away. I no longer work at this organization.  My question is if there are any legal issues that could arise from me selling individual frames of the 70mm film online.	Yes
"I run a small social network that lets users register usernames as their handle. A company which I'll call ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" (not its real name but similar) sent me an email accusing one of my users of committing a trademark violation because she registered the name ""illusionalsunrise"" on my site. But when I search for ""illusionalsunrise"" (again, not the real name) on http://tmsearch.uspto.gov, I see that the word mark is for ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" and not ""Illusionalsunrise"" by itself.  The email sent to me also contains this paragraph:  ""From the information that we have received regarding your use, our use of this Trademark has priority over yours based upon earlier and continuous use, as well as the above federal registration. Therefore, your use is a violation of our company’s rights.  We are requesting that you remove the use of our trademark described in the provided link or any other name or mark confusingly similar.""  Their actual trademark filing states: FIRST USE: 20160401. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 20160401 with a filing date of July 21, 2016 whereas my user registered her account on Oct 14, 2011. My user also doesn't sell anything and is not a business entity so they shouldn't even be in the same industry (it's just a username).  Lastly, that specific user does not reside in the United States (the social network itself is a registered company in the United States).  I don't think this company has any ground to stand on. It would be easier for me to just change that user's name but they are currently active and I don't think it's right to do so especially when I think this company is overreaching. I'm going to bring this up to a lawyer regardless but I just want to get /r/legaladvice's opinion so I can have a general idea on where I stand."	Yes
My friends and I love watching movies and making fun of them. It was suggested that we make a YouTube series of us doing this, and so I did some reasearch at this seems like it could be a fun hobby. I was going to have us sitting around with mics, and then show the movie as we are watching it at the bottom of the screen. It occurs to me though that the movie is under copyright, but I don't know exactly what that protects.  So what does the copyright prevent me from doing. Can I show the movie? If not, is there another way to do it that will make it legal?  Thank you in advance.	Yes
I'm currently drafting a non-fiction book about economics and the software development industry.  I want to compare charging an unreasonable amount or demanding excessive payment to the fictional character Rumpelstiltskin from the titular fairy tale.   As far as I'm aware, no one owns fairy tales and I'm allowed to do this - am I right?	Yes
Hi r/legaladvice,   I'm considering forming a travel management company in New York State, helping individuals and possibly small businesses research, plan, and book travel arrangements (air, hotel, ground transport, activities, etc).  Instead of being viewed as a full blown travel agency, I prefer to position myself as a consultant/assistant and would essentially be booking these arrangements direct with the suppliers (airlines, hotels, etc) on behalf of the client.   I plan on getting errors &amp; omissions insurance, as well as forming an LLC to protect my personal assets, and also have the clients sign a credit card authorization form or something of the like when I go to book for them. My question is, do I need some sort of legal terms and conditions that my clients have to agree to before making arrangements for them?  Any advice or info is appreciated, and let me know if more info is needed.   Thanks so much!	Yes
I purchased a website about 6 months ago, however the website was not as described, and does not have the capabilities that were promised (such as a fully functional shopping cart with integrated payment processing). I've tried to work with the original owner to get these items done, but she is very slow to respond and always has excuses about her health, her child's health, and how she is traveling.   I'm in Northern California. The woman that I bought the website from lives in San Diego, but the LLC that she does business through is in Pennsylvania.  Can I file small claims court in my local court, or would I have to go all the way to San Diego or Pennsylvania?  Thanks for your help.	Yes
"So the shop will have a name other than my own legal name, though my own legal name is attached to the shop as the ""Shop Owner.""  Do I still need to file a DBA?  In which state?  In which state do I need to file any/everything else?"	Yes
I had my Amazon Kindle publishing account terminated because they think my account was related to a 'previously terminated account'. I've tried proving that I never had a second account, but it's hard to reach anyone at Amazon without being redirected to Malaysia / Costa  Rica to a tech support who has no power...  I've talked to other Kindle e-book publishers and one of them had a similar situation. He said that he filed a demand for arbitration for lost royalties since the date of termination, and sent it to Amazon's legal department. He was offered a settlement or to have his account reinstated one last time as a last chance, but decided to take the settlement offered by Amazon instead.  How much would it cost to find a lawyer to do something similar for me? I'm at my wit's end trying to get my account back, and this seems like the best option so far...	Yes
"I'm not sure if this question is acceptable in this subreddit. So I will ask my question, and if people suggest hiring a lawyer, then I request advice on how to find the right type of lawyer for my situation.   After graduating from college, I spent six months working on a startup which was unsuccessful. Then I began searching for a job, and I put my accomplishments during my startup on my resume. After six months of job searching, I received my first job offer with a company in the same field as my startup, but it's a 3-month consulting agreement. The CTO of the company said if it's a good fit I will be offered a full-time position afterward. I read the consulting agreement and analyzed it with a plagiarism checker. I discovered over 90% of the contract came from two online contracts, and one major difference I found was the removal of a phrase in a statement. To summarize the statement, the online contract says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc, that I develop while performing my services under this agreement"". The contract I received does not have the last phrase so the statement says: ""the company has rights to all my ideas, designs, etc."".  I spoke with the CTO about this, and he said I could make changes to the contract, and they would consider it. At the moment, I had doubt in negotiating and told him I sought a permanent position. So I declined the offer. A week later I regretted not negotiating and asked for another opportunity. He said they might give me another opportunity, but they will be unable to change the wording of the contract. If I sign the contract, is it possible that I will give them rights to all my accomplishments I achieved during my startup?  Let me know if you need additional information. I am on the fence about hiring an attorney/lawyer to help me with my situation, but I would like to get advice from this subreddit first. Thanks."	Yes
I am in the process of a legal name change, although it can take anywhere between 60-90 days.  At the same time I am also trying to start a business. I don't know if I should just sit tight and wait for the name change to happen, or if this wouldn't matter anyway because I need to get things to match with past IRS tax returns, etc. I also don't like sitting still if I don't need to, since this is time I could be using for my business.  So I'm not really sure what I should be doing. Wait for the name change and then file the paperwork, or use my current legal name to get the ball rolling and then try to register my name change with the proper places later?	Yes
I just noticed that another website probably copied one of my site's more popular posts (responsible for about 20% of my traffic). Right now, my post is n1 for a certain search term on google (at least when I search) and theirs is n5. Now, I can't be sure or proof they copied me, because it's something anyone could come up with after a bit of research, but I believe so because:  - The content and structure is very similar, they just consolidated some points and point to their service at the end.  - It's dated a few months after I posted mine and there was no similar content before. There are some other posts on the same subject dated after mine, but at least they don't look so similar / brought in another perspective  - This particular post/guide is relatively out-of-niche for them, while my site centers around that topic. They just bent and twisted it to make it relevant to their service.  - I link to their service in some of my site because I find it very useful. This leads me to suspect they found my site as a source of steady referral traffic (after I wrote them an email asking if it was okay to link to them and they agreed), found the post in question and noticed they could copy it and use it for their own gains. This kinda adds insult to injury.  Now since I can't proof anything I don't want to throw around accusations, but it all seems pretty clear to me. I'm placed higher on google, so I doubt I'm losing too much traffic to them because of this, though it may be some, but it's more about the principle. I link to their site because I like their service and recommend it to my readers, and they steal my content and a chunk of traffic.  So, what do you think I can/should do about this?  My first instinct was to write them an email, politely requesting they link to my site since its contents my interest their readers of that particular article, but maybe you have a better idea?  Thanks in advance for your input :-)	Yes
I know this isn't as important as some other matters on here, but I haven't found a solid answer on it.   I work as a news reporter at a regional newspaper in Minnesota. Our local radio station has been reading my stories, with exact quotes, on air without giving any credit.   The radio station has a news reporter, but she doesn't show up at most events, or cover any of these stories. I hear shortened versions of my stories being read pretty much every day and it's mildly infuriating.   I've asked them to stop, or give credit, but get no response. My company doesn't do anything about it.  I'm having trouble understanding the grey areas of fair use law. Basically, is there anything I can do about this?	Yes
Hey guys. I'm currently cofounding an app startup which revolves around the on demand gig-economy.(App in the same market as TaskRabbit,Uber, etc.) We're currently at a crossroads of what type of insurance coverage best fits our business model. There would be a wide array of services offered on the app including at home services (workers will be entering homes), deliveries (transportation involved,) miscellaneous personal requests (beauty care, massage therapy, etc.) It seems as if we would be needing a different type of commercial insurance than the average company. So if anyone on here has any insight with insurance law, your advice would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!	Yes
"Most of the ""fair use"" discussions that I've seen on here focused on either musical parodies or graphic IP's but I'd like to see if ""fair use"" extends to things like a plot structure. Here's some context:  Right now, I'm hoping to make a comedic puppet series that bases it's plot on Agatha Christie's ""And Then There Were None."" In doing so, I will certainly rename the characters/locations but will most likely use the archetypes (doctor, judge, church lady, etc.) and the general plot structure (10 people go to an island where one is killed off each day). It would be a comedic riff on the book and not much outside of it thus disqualifying for satire (as I understand it) and I can't imagine it would have any positive or negative affect on the original copyrighted material. So is there any sort of legal precedent any of you know might know of that addresses comedic literature-to-film adaptations?   For what it's worth, the book was published in 1939, Agatha Christie is no more, and I'd say most people are familiar with it. I doubt that makes a difference but I thought it might.  Oh, and I live in the United States and may post it on YouTube which I understand has its own set of rules n such.  TL;DR version: Is a re-named comedic adaptation of an old, well-known IP a bad idea or not? Thanks, friends-in-law!"	Yes
A book cozie is two slips of fabric over some foam, it's a folder for a book and etys has tons of sellers. it's not an original design and anyone with a sewing machine can make these easily. I don't understand why they attacked my small shop over the ones I make when literally there are tons available on Etsy from multiple sellers.   Etsy encourages me to contact them regarding the issue. I'm in America, they are in the United Kingdom, how can this be trademarked with so many sellers and what do I say to them upon email?	Yes
"I own an SEO company and we do legit work.  We have been in this space since 2007 and have had 0 complaints and no chargebacks.  A while ago we were hired by a company that we were unsure if we wanted to work with for $1,500 per month (the guy had a bad attitude and was very rude).  We explained that results may take between 4 to 6 months and sometimes longer and he agreed.  He also signed our contract that has the terms of work and no refunds or guarantees of page 1 results.   2 weeks into the project he begins asking about results and we tell him it takes 4 to 6 months..  He agrees and is happy and content.  4 weeks in he again asks about results and again we tell him 4 to 6 months..  He pays a second month and tells us we are doing a great job.    After 3 months and $4,500 with the client calls us up and says no is angry with our work and wants to cancel his service.  We told him we have a 30 day policy but not a problem he is free to leave with out any additional money owed to us.  Then he initiated chargebacks with his credit card company for the payments he made to us.  We have never had to deal with this issue before so we contacted the processor and we filed our disputer paper work and we won due to proof of work done and the contract he signed.  He is now threatening to report us to ic3.gov , leave bad reviews, and file criminal charges against us for ""fraud"" if we do not return all his money..    My lawyer is out of town and unavailable until next Friday due to being on vacation so I am waiting on his reply to me but this guy wants an answer NOW or else he said he is moving forward with his complaints.    We have never had any complaints, issues and we did nothing wrong..  His main complaint is we outsourced work (we did not) and we did not provide results to his website.  We are based in the USA if that matters for the advice.  Thanks for your time in reading, i hope you can help.   TL;DR client hired us and did a chargeback which we won, now is threatening legal action in the form of criminal complaints if we do not refund him."	Yes
My start-up has been talking with company 1 about partnering up for the past couple of weeks.  Meanwhile company 2 approached us for the soon the same thing.  They are talking about some kind of agreement that halts negotiations with company 1 if they want to continue.  What is the legal name for this type of agreement?  Does it exist as something normal?

Like everybody and their brother in this town, I too, am an aspiring screenwriter on the side.  I am about to start a tech job at one of the major studios, and in my offer letter it has the boilerplate stating that as of the day of my employment I assign any and all IP to them.  I don't really have any choice about signing this if I want to work there.  This job is not creative, but I could be exposed to creative projects at various stages of development.  I have developed to a reasonable degree one TV project (pilot written, season 1 outlined) and on film script (fully outlined with 20 pages of dialogue).  I've never really done much with either project other than have my friends read them.  I have no representation, nor am I a member of any trade union.  Obviously I'd love to have the film studio pick up either of these projects, but I don't want to have gifted these work (nor anything else that I create) to the film studio just because they've hired me as a code monkey.  What are my rights here?    I know in CA that as far as tech is concerned as long as you don't develop the IP with the company's time or resources and it is not substantially related to their business you can own it.  Does the same thing apply to creative works?  Can I continue to create works on the side?  Obviously, I can't steal ideas from anything I get exposed to at the studio.  What precautions should I take to avoid any appearance that I've done so?  You can find a lot on Google advising independent creatives about sharing stuff with studios, but I don't see anything pertaining to individuals with an employment contract.  Thanks for reading.	Yes
"Ok so i own a hair extension company and I hired a photographer to take some photos for the front page of my site. I picked 2/3 models that we used and I had an agreement with them that in exchange for their time modeling they would be compensated with being able to keep the hair I put in their hair (around $500 worth) and being given an affiliate code where they can earn commissions. They would also be able to use the photos for their portfolio.    Exactly 2 weeks before the shoot the photographer lets me know he found the perfect girl and asked me what I thought of her and i approved and he said he would ask her if she wanted to do it as well as discussing how we were doing anything. 1 week before the shoot she says she wants a contract (she contacts the photographer) and I asked the photographer, ""a contract for what?"" and he seemed confused about what she wants and she wouldn't let him give me her contact info so I could discuss it with her and she didn't want to give her address so I could mail a copy of the contract I drafted so she can have it ready and signed by the day of the shoot. So I said fine as long as she understands what she is getting out of the shoot.   So the day of the shoot rolls around and I finally meet and speak to the model for the first time. Everything is fine, all 3 models shoot and everyone seems to be happy. At the end of the shoot the model asks me about the contract and I told her I am still confused about what she wants out of this ""contract"" and she talks in circles and I get the impression that she just wants a contract to have one and doesn't necessarily need one. She told me she would have her  mom-ager look it over and send me any issues with it. I told her if she needed time for her mom to look it over I would send her the contract over email and once we reached an agreement I would send her a DocuSign. So I sent her the contract and I got a response 4 days later with some demands: 1) she wants shared rights to the photos 2) she wants to be able to approve of all photos before i use/post them 3) she wants a personal hair stylist to make wigs for her at my expense on a regular basis 4) a 6 month term for the contract.   WTF. 1) I don't have a problem with sharing rights but I don't have the rights to give her since the photographer owns the photos. 2) I cannot give her the right or power to control the photos I use from a  photoshoot that I paid for. Basically signing my rights away. 3) The girl is bald and basically wants me to give her new wigs to wear all the time in different colors. 4) 6 months for what? There is no ongoing relationship implied besides the affiliate codes with is optional for the model and is just an opportunity for her to make money off of the promo of the hair.  So upon reading this I was taken back and trying to decide if I was just going to say NO or if I was going to negotiate further. I am very busy in general and sleep about 4 hours a day so i only have time to deal with this on the weekends. so a few days pass by and I let her know she will get a response by the weekend and she says okay. so she calls me first thing saturday morning and i was sleeping so she sent me a long message about how she isn't going to chase me down and I need to remove her photos and I can't use them now. This is all because I didn't answer the phone because i was sleep. As soon as I woke up I returned her call and she says I have been dodging her calls (she NEVER called me outside of this one day and I spoke to her mom TWICE so I am confused about what she is talking about). She says I have had months and months to respond to her. she is delusional because me and the photographer didn't even know she existed until June 15 so it hasn't even been ONE month yet. And I didnt have her contact info until the day of the shoot (July 2). So I am not sure what months and months she is talking about. She has called everyone and basically cursed everyone out saying everyone is lying to her and we are all confused. so i have a couple of questions:  1)since she never signed the contract or a model release, can she say that me and the photographer can't use her photos even though it is what we initially agreed on? 2) Who owns the photos : me, the photographer or the model? 3) does she have any recourse for me posting her photos on social media after she posted them first?  I am just over this chick and I am completely ready to sever the relationship but I do not want to do so if it means I have to pay the photographer to remove her out of all the photos but I am strongly considering it. She hasn't had a problem until literally today (July 15)"	Yes
I filed this patent with her in September of 2015. I have tried everything I can to reach her. As of recently I received a mass email from her law firm stating that they have new contact information. Something seems off and feels like they are covering something especially due to the way the email was written and phrased. I just want my patents out of this hole.	Yes
I live in California, client is in Europe. We only had email agreements to do a 3k video project. The resulting video was not professional quality. It was so low quality it started going viral a bit since filmmakers were enthusiastically denouncing every aspect of it.  I gave the client a full refund, but now I have this video which to me is a silly (and expensive) reminder of a project gone terribly wrong. Can I make it public on YouTube? I removed all reference to the company in the Title/Description, and note that the client is not affiliated with it and was given a full refund. But the video itself still contains their name/brand.  Is this fine to publish, or can I be sued for liable, brand infringement, or some other offense I'm unaware of. At this point I feel like it's mine, I paid for it, and should be able to publish it. I even refunded the fee for the script, which their whole team had signed off on and already paid for. I had hoped to retain them so was being nice there, and then they bailed.	Yes
So this guy has owned a trailer based business washing windows for awhile, every now and then on big jobs he has had college aged kids come help him complete those jobs. He files as an sole proprietor and pays the kids in cash. He is leaving for a couple years, and bought another trailer. While he is gone he wants me and another guy to run the trailers. He calls us independent contractors and asks for a 30/70 split of profits. We use his client base, and primarily he does scheduling. His name remains on the trailers, and we do not own the equipment but to dodge legalities I would be leasing the trailer from him.  He had no idea what a 1099 is, and has claimed all wages he paid to people that helped him as business expenses. What problems exist here? I can provide more non-identifying information if that helps. He also has called me a foreman in a video he put in social media.  The reason I ask this is that I believe this is an employee/employer relationship and could get troublesome fast, but there are some gray areas that could prove it possible to make work.   I'm not really interested, but he's also a friend and I want him to know why I'm turning it down and that he needs to fix some things. I'd also like to understand the situation better, and I don't think he even knows there's problems. Thanks!	Yes
Basically an obese customer was denied service since we didn't have the proper equipment to handle someone of her size. (weight limit on machine is stated as 250lbs)  She writes a bad review claiming that we really denied her because she was black since she saw another large white woman in the store (but she fails to mention the other woman was half her size)   Since her review was framed in such a way to make this seem like a case of discrimination based on race, her fb post has been shared by a few thousands and as a result we've taken a hard hit on our online reviews/scores, harassing phone calls and what not.   I feel like we could have a libel case on our hands, but I'm not sure. How do these cases usually go? I ask if it's worth it since I also don't know the process of investigation for them, and I don't necessarily know if inciting this case somewhat more publicly like that would also be good...	Yes
12/01/2017: Applied for LLC with name &lt;X&gt; with the Arizona Commerce Commision  12/27/2017: LLC was approved as &lt;X&gt;  01/08/2018: Signed first contract work as &lt;My Own Name&gt;  01/16/2018: Received letter that LLC was approved  When I signed the contract I was not aware the LLC was approvied. Did I at that time do business as a Sole Proprietorship or as the LLC even though I did not specify?  I talked to my City and they said I should only apply for a LLC with the city not for a Sole Proprietorship because of the contract.  I'm trying to figure out if I should have the contract corrected to include the LLC or if I can just let everything go as is. Am I going to run into any complications come tax time? Opinions?	Yes
My sister runs a semi popular African American natural hair blog and instagram. She interviewed with a hair company in order to join their sponsorship program, which would require her to post images of her using their products on her instagram in exchange for monthly free products. After going through the interview process she was informed several weeks later that she had not gotten into the program. Flash forward to today, I am scrolling through my Facebook page and see that this company has posted one of her pictures taken from her instagram without permission. Are companies allowed to Take images from instagram without giving any sort of compensation or obtaining permission from the owner?	Yes
Hey all! I've recently started an NBA blog. I'm currently writing posts to fill up the site before I begin to promote it a little bit, and, I use images (which don't belong to me) in posts. My parents have mentioned that this might get me into some legal trouble, but I wouldn't think so as I don't profit off the blog.  A lot of NBA YouTubers use images such as the ones I use on my website. As well, many use real footage of the NBA. These are monetized videos with hundreds of thousands of views. If they never get into trouble for using the material, is there any reason I would?  I'm planning on getting this site to be fairly big (I have the ability to promote the site pretty well, so there's a decent chance it can get pretty popular -- that sounds kinda braggy, I don't mean it in that way though haha). I figured I should mention that because I'm guessing it's a bigger issue legality wise if the website is popular.  Thanks so much for any help! Feel free to ask any questions in case I left anything important out.	Yes
"Hi guys, this is my first time on Reddit but I figure if there's one place that I can get some answers without hiring a lawyer, it'd be here. So to start out I am a small time YouTuber looking to use viral videos in my channel in the context of ""Videos of the Week"". I contacted the publisher of this video 'Jukin Media' in hopes in receiving permission to use a specific viral video. However they told me it would be $1000 just to be able to publish in my video. So the most logical thing is I obviously cannot use it unless I am willing to pay them. However, I have seen this video all over the place, and I know for a fact that these channels did not get permission from Jukin. Also, YouTube has contentid which puts your video through a system that allows publishers to put claims on your work for using certain works in your videos. It also does not allow you to monetize. I would be fine with not being able to monetize and all of that, I just want to use the video. However I do not want to get a copyright strike when I post it or in the future. Am I legally allowed to post this video and just let the ContentId catch it, which would allow Jukin to monetize on my behalf, or am I violating copyright rules? Thank you"	Yes
Is it legal to post videos which are sent around on what's app groups on a personal website or a personal you tube account  (which runs ads) without permission from the creator? (Many times the creator is unknown as the videos are forwarded many times over.)  Thanks in advance. 	Yes
Would it be illegal to start a service that allows people to rent a boyfriend/girlfriend as long as the app and website have a liability waiver and the service does not use employees but independent contractors who set their own terms and thus the website is not a direct service provider but rather a sharing economy marketplace where providers and users can find each other for a nominal revenue share?	Yes
"I recently received a strike on my Soundcloud for posting a remix/cover to ""Drake - Do Not Disturb"" I didn't however have the mechanical license for the song. If I buy the license and obtain it, will I be able to fight the strike and remove it? Location: Florida"	Yes
"I am currently in FL, but the corp exists in AL.  tl;dr- In the late 90s, my dad created a ""Domestic Corporation"" (has the .inc at the end) when I was a minor, used it to do some masonry work, and then passed away in the early 2000s. Thanks to Google, I just found out that I'm named as an officer (incorporator) and it still exists.  --------------------------------  Setting: small semi-rural town in Alabama.   So, back in the late 90s my father had an opportunity to take the masonry he worked as a 9-5 job and use it to form his own company and take on some really big projects. I was in 8th grade at the time. He created the corp with the help of a lawyer friend, rented a little shed somewhere for cheap and got to work with my grandfather on the first project. It didn't make massive money, but it made enough for him to quit his day job and keep the lights on, and that's all that mattered.  For the most part, I never got involved except for helping him work out at his shop after school some days, and sometimes during summers in high school. He had a lot to do, it was hard work to do alone and he had no help (never hired anyone; it was always just him), so I was happy to lend a hand.   That said, I was never officially paid in any capacity. This was just the ""family business"" and I was doing my duty as his kid to help keep the lights on. I didn't mind.  By college, in the early 2000s, I pretty much went on about my own life, and the help I could offer decreased pretty greatly because of my own responsibilities.  Around that time, he was diagnosed with terminal cancer and stopped working. He kept his warehouse, just paying rent to keep it around (I guess to keep the hope alive that he would be able to do it again one day), but in 2008 he passed away. After his passing, his widow (my stepmother) mentioned that the shop was still around and she was going to have to pay rent on it if it wasn't cleaned out, so I took some friends down and sweeped/washed it out, threw out the old tables, and brought whatever was left over back to her (the vast majority of the equipment he used was rented, so all that was left over were some old pallets, old wooden tables he cobbled together to do work on, and mechanic hoist that I took back to her).   That was the last I ever thought of his corp.  Well, last night I was just sitting there being somewhat sentimental and thought to myself ""I wonder if anyone talks about the work he did anymore..."" and Googled his corp name. While looking, I ran across a Google business listing and clicked it. According to the site- the corp is still listed as ""Exists"" and it has 2 officers... my father and ME (both listed as ""incorporator).  After some panicking, I went to the AL corp lookup and looked the company up via ID there, and sure enough the information was legit. It is listed as a ""Domestic Corporation"" and has a "".inc"" at the end of the name.   I had always assumed that it was his company alone, and that when he passed the corp would be shut down. And yet there it is. From what I can tell, Alabama will never administratively shut down a corporation on its own.  After looking, I realized that Alabama requires a minimum $100 annual filing fee each year (subject to fines each month you don't deal with it). Obviously no one has dealt with this since at LEAST 2008, and that's assuming he kept it up as he should have up until 2007. The registered agent is still listed as him, and pointed to his shop. The mailing address is some PO Box I don't even recognize (I guess he got his work mail there).   Now, before anyone jumps to the obvious conclusion of ""This could have been nefarious"" - that wasn't something my father would do in ill will. The man would have taken a bullet for me, and DID sacrifice a lot of his own personal life and happiness to care for me. Also, I am intimately familiar with my credit, and nothing has ever shown up out of the ordinary on it. When he did this, I'm sure he did it for no other reason than he thought it would be ""cool"" for his son to be a part business owner at such a young age. And, unfortunately, I can't remember that conversation at all (it's been some 20 years...), so 8th grade me probably thought it was really cool, too.  In short- kinda freaking out. There is this corporation out there, somewhere, that I am an officer in which has been sitting derelict since at least 2008 amounting what I can only assume is a lot of debt. I have none of the paperwork (that I am aware of), and know little more than the name of the company and that it's my responsibility now.  I'm pretty sure this is lawyer territory, but it's Sunday afternoon and my stomach is doing cartwheels, so I wanted to ask what you all thought since I have literally nothing else I can do right now about the situation.  Thanks!"	Yes
Let's say a person has a leaked song of an artist and decides to leak it and monetize it. Is this punishable under copyright laws or ok since the person is the first one to post it?	Yes
I'm currently finishing up a part time position and a large bank/financial institution and I was thinking of doing as I described in the title. However, I know that the finance and investment advice field can be heavy in regulatory and legal burdens.   One of the main focuses at my part time job was researching and presenting on cryptocurrencies (i.e. Ethereum and Bitcoin) and blockchain/distributed ledger technology. I have participated in briefings for high up executives, including presidents. In my spare time, I have given advice/feedback on the cryptocurrency investment sphere for friends of friends (making sure to state that I don't know for sure the price will rise, they are taking their own risk, yada yada...) so I have a few references, as well as a letter of recommendation from a high level executive at my bank/institution.   My plan was to use these references and experiences to start a small consulting company to help advise people on investments in cryptocurrency, best practices for keeping your currency safe, provide weekly newsletter/debriefings on the markets, etc. Any idea of how I need to go about making sure I'm following regulations?	Yes
when I create a video series which I sell on my website for profit, is it legal for me to show close-ups of certain book pages from books I have purchased? I am referencing several pages in order to illustrate a point or further support what I am saying in my videos. I would naturally give the book title and author in my videos but are there any legalities involved?	Yes
So I'm making a short documentary, and I was wandering how to make the music.	Yes
"**USA/Louisiana**  I really don't know anything about LLC/trademark/copyright. In all likelihood, the app won't take off. But let's just assume it does. What should I do legally for protection against whatever it is that could happen? I've read some answers around the web about how I should create a second Google account to release on (if Google had a problem with my app they could disable the account it was uploaded with, and that could be my personal account). So I know to do that. But what else should I be doing? I want to be making revenue from the app via ads + in app purchases, but I have no idea how that works legally.   **Do I need to be a ""company"" (LLC?) and not an individual to receive the money?**   **Would it be BEST if I released the app as company and not an individual?**   **What do I need to do to prevent someone from taking my unique app/brand name? (trademark/copyright?)**  **Is there anything else I should be thinking about doing to best protect my creation?**  Hopefully these questions aren't too basic for this sub. Thanks for your time"	Yes
"Hi r/legaladvice,   This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.

What are the rules regarding quoting/summarizing news articles from other websites for your own website? I assumed if you quote only 1-3 sentences, credit the source and link to the original article that you are in the clear.   However I read on the New York Times website the following:   &gt; 3. May I use portions of New York Times articles, such as quotes or excerpts? May I edit or adapt New York Times articles? Back to top Under certain circumstances, it is permissible to make direct quotes from New York Times articles. The context, number and length of the quotes will determine whether permission is required. It is never acceptable to selectively quote from articles in a manner that changes their meaning, to take quotes out of context or to combine quotes to create a sentence. It may also be considered infringement if a large percentage of the publication consists of quotes from New York Times articles. It is always best to submit a request for clearance.

My brother and I recently created a card game (it's awesome). We were wondering the best way of going about protecting the game itself as well as the images and logos used in the game. We have also used stylized drawings of world leaders (not referring to specific images) which our research shows is fine but please let us know if you know otherwise. We have had the prototype printed which I believe gives us immediate copyright. Please let us know what is the best way to go about this. Thank you.	Yes
I have had an eCommerce business for about a 1.5 years and never filed for the LLC, but I have the branding, domain name, etc.  I just went to check the Secretary of State's site to lookup my name, and I found that just this May a corporation from Las Vegas, named **United States Corporation Agents, Inc.** filed for my exact name.  I know for a fact that no one would have picked the name of my eCommerce store randomly in my state, so I'm guessing they are doing this to try and make money off me.  Just look at how many other LLCs they've filed randomly: https://www.sosnc.gov/search/regagent/6542001  What can I do? Can I still get my name if I've had the domain name and branding for over a year?	Yes
Let's say I write a book about a now pretty unknown legend. The word has had various different meanings over the years. And if I ever make a movie I don't want the studio to be a dick. And take down other works people might make. What's the best way to make sure I can legally do that, before any studio  gets their hands on the script?	Yes
Asking for clarification as a buddy and I were debating this after watching a show about it.  When people (everyone) downloads videos or music that's encoded would the copyright owner go after the person who initially downloaded and shared the files? The website that hosts the files or every single person who subsequently downloaded it as it's available online?  As an example if an episode of Seinfeld was downloaded via megaupload. Would copyright owners go after the person who initially shared it, the host site megaupload, or the subsequent tens of thousands of people who downloaded from site after being posted?	Yes
Hey guys, I'm a musician that knows only the side of law that covers things like copyright and trademark and sampling (audio).   I'm trying to make the release of my next couple of singles as professional as possible, with all bases covered on grounds of copyright and terms of ownership. I've got a song finished and I drafted up artwork for the song using a picture of a friend of mine.  I'd like to write up a Work For Hire contract concerning the picture I'm using and the model in the picture. I basically just want the contract to cover ownership of the song, the model's permission to use her likeness with the song and promotional material of the song, as well as being distributed online with her picture attached to the song.    I don't want the contract to include any sort of royalties to the model as 1. We aren't trying to pull in large sums of revenue from this release and 2. She did not have any creative involvement with the creation of the song.  Do you guys have any pointers and/or clauses that I should include in the contract? Or any advice as to the best possible way to go about writing the contract for the model?  Thank you in advance	Yes

I'm working with a company on an eCommerce site as general help (customer service, manufacturer communication, photos, etc.).   It's a small business, and I'm helping out now with intent to hold equity in the future. The ownership arrangement is still pending (hasn't finished the ownership transfer/purchase document). Currently I'm taking a small monthly pay until equity is sorted out.   Recently, the company owner is intending to file a lawsuit against a competitor.   The owner suggested that I become an independent contractor formally (sent me a contract to sign) for the reason of legal protection. The reasoning for the formality is: as an independent contractor, any counter suits against the company after the litigation will not reach me as easily.   I trust the company, but in research I've done online, I've become worried this might not provide me the best protection in counter suits.  Any resources or thoughts are greatly helpful!   States involved include CO and DC.	Yes
Hello r/legaladvice,   I am from NY. I established an S corp with my business partner. I am a minority share holder in the corporation, and my partner is the majority. He just recently got divorced(?) even though a lot of what he is saying is not matching up. I have an EIN number if that matters for anything. I am looking to get out of this partnership. I still have the contract which states everything that I said above. I placed about ~$7500 into the business. I currently reside in a different county than he does, so I am thinking about taking him to court, because he won't buy me out of the partnership. Should I take this man to court, because supposedly he is getting divorce.   Personally, I fell out with this man and I am not sure if he is even telling me the truth.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks!	Yes
I am a social media employee for a venue in northern California. Normally, we have cheap local bands come in and perform. All our concerts are free, used to gather the community together. Recently we had a singer who is actually signed to a label come and perform. Nothing big, but I want to use his performance in an ad. He performed both his own songs and more popular songs. Legally speaking, what music copyrights might I be breaking?	Yes
Hey Legal Advice, I'm working on putting together a crafts business.  I know I need to register for a business license/tax ID from the state, but it's not clear to me if I also need to trademark my business name federally.  It's an extra fee I'd sort of prefer not to incur, and I am not making unique enough things to worry about copycats.  If I were to start selling unique patterns or instructions, I would definitely trademark. Mostly, I'm looking forward to a tax-ID that allows me to pay wholesale/tax free for supplies.   I have verified that my company name is not taken (in VA or on the federal database), so that is not the issue.  If anyone can provide clarification, I would appreciate it.	Yes
Like the title states a friend and I have come up with a fun little idea and we want to build it and try market it. It would be named after a video-game character.  Any advice on whether or not this would be legal? Or any good resources on where to see if the name is still trademarked?  Thank you in advance!	Yes
I am aware of an organization that has filed Articles of Incorporation declaring 501(c)(3) status.  However, there is no record with the IRS or their state of incorporation that suggests that they operate as a 501(c)(3).  I am a member of the governing body of this organization, but am not an officer.  I would like to see that the organization is closed, but the rest of the governing body is a large group, and it would be difficult to get the vote needed.  Do I have any recourse considering how they have incorporated?	Yes

Specifically it was a vampire novel, the main character and plot were fairly distinctive: I do still possess copies of the original work, and I also have friends who still have copies.

"A month ago we began working with a guy who had an idea that we liked a lot. He's young, fresh out of a 1-year entrepreneurship program that he did right after college. He's charismatic, and at first we liked him.   I say ""we,"" it's myself and my friend who are both (skilled) programmers.   The idea is not unique: other people are working on it, there are a couple companies starting to do it exactly in the space we've been trying to enter. However, it's a very new area so it's exciting and fun to work on.   Over the last few weeks, we've been developing a lot of code and we incorporated the company quickly because our co-founder needs a visa soon.   A couple days ago we decided we can't work with him anymore: he is too immature and wants to be the one on top, the one with the most shares and the CEO title. He obviously feels like it's more HIS projects that ours. He doesn't compromise well, we've had arguments and it seems every time we end up saying ""alright, we'll do it your way which is not *completely* unreasonable, we want to keep the peace and make things work."" Anyway, it's making it hard to work with him. I don't trust him. And also, I don't respect him because of the aforementioned qualities coupled with the fact that he actually doesn't really contribute anything to the business. He's not particularly skilled at talking to people or writing or having good ideas or design.   Anyway, we don't want to work with him anymore. We still like the idea and are excited about the work we've done on it so far, and have a key connection that he doesn't have that will help us a lot towards success.   We're thinking of just taking the code we wrote and nothing else except the basic idea (which, as I said, is not particularly novel) and doing our own business.   We're also considering potentially going to work for the primary competitor who are looking for a CTO and seem very qualified on the business and marketing side (but we're not at all sure about this option either).   Would love some advice! Thank you in advance."	Yes
This is the picture - https://craniophiles.files.wordpress.com/2012/05/skull2.jpg  I am wondering if I am allowed to use this image as an album cover? It would only be distributed digitally &amp; not printed on an actual physical copy. It would be edited to include the band name and logo.  I have Googled it and a site said all his works are copyright free but also listed some exceptions that have been raised so I am not sure where to draw the line.  Thanks.	Yes
Small-time punk rock band based in Monmouth NJ here.  So long story short, my band recorded an album a couple months ago with a drummer we'd been running for the past year. 9 out of the 11 songs on the album (yet to be released) were already written before we added him to the lineup, so he would technically have writing credits on those 2 remaining songs.    The issue is that due to a myriad of reasons, we kicked him out a few weeks after recording. It was not very amicable, but he said at the end of the day it was okay to use his studio recordings on the album as long as he got proper credit. But now, on the precipice of this release, he wants his fair claim on the copyright to the album.    Two of the members of our band, which includes me, feel it is not worth the hassle to fight for full ownership of the songs against him. The other two members want to keep him out of the copyright at all costs, but still credit him textually.    I have no legal background and probably phrased some things incorrectly regarding copyrights, but my question is what are the ousted drummer's options for fighting us, and what are our options defending against his claim, if that's what we have to do? Thanks in advance.	Yes
"Can anyone help me out? What legal action should I take?  I co-founded a business in 2013 in freshman year of college with a friend of mine where girls step on insects. We usually sold our stuff using xxxfetish-media, which is a good place to sell bug crush and femdom content. I used their official OCMB forums to help figure out what people liked best when I started out. Early that year I saw a legit filesharing website (we'll call it fetishare) where people made accounts to trade videos and got points for it, so I figured that it'd be a good way to spread my store's name around. Well soon after that I found out from the admin on the OCMB forums that they were spying on customers, farming IPs from 'known pirate websites, and in some cases placing malware to track people. I figured I'd stop using the fetishare site and just sell normally.   Well last year in June when I was waiting for a payout from them, I didn't get it and started wondering why it didn't hit my bank account. I contacted them but the customer service wasn't good at fixing it. I eventually got a response saying: 'Your account has been suspended for copyright violations'. So basically I got locked out of my store for something that happened three years ago. Notice I said 'locked out' and not 'closed down'. My store is still up. People can still buy from it and they can make money from it while giving none to me. They don't respond to any of my emails either, except for one when I ask for how I can restore access to my store they said: ""We will for forgive this if you sign a statement saying you will never again share videos.'   I made about $41k/yr from that store. In hiatus/hibernation mode with no updates it at least made $10k from last year to now. I'm owed money, and this isn't right. They're not only hurting me, but other producers by banning customers left and right from being able to buy and lowering profits.  Since then I started my own e-commerce store and hosted on Clips4Sale and Kinkbomb instead. However I would still like to know what to do about this.  I live in Alabama.  Any thoughts? Should I take legal action?  - tl;dr: Possible embezzlement with my store on a fetish hub. What do?"	Yes
Say I created a transcription service, where people payed me to transcribe their audio. Instead of hire people to do it 'myself', i just passed the audio files on to other companies who costed less, and took the price difference.  This *seems* like it should be wrong, but also seems like it'd be awkward to make laws for (outsourcing to 3rd party companies might be part of the process, like how sliced bread manufacturers don't grow their own wheat).  What would be the 'official verdict' behind this, or is it more of a grey area?  Thanks!	Yes
We are in Pennsylvania.   We are starting up an e-commerce store that will also sell on Amazon. We are committed to this long term but need to limit costs up front.   I have an accounting background so am somewhat familiar with incorporating, sales tax, IRS requirements etc., and possibility to incorporate in other states that are not our home state.   What we're stuck on is wondering whether we actually should incorporate or just file for a fictitious name in PA. Filing for a fictitious name in PA requires posting a legal notice of such, which alone is a $90 cost in our county. As such I'm thinking that money would be better spent towards incorporation fees and that way we also get legal protection from personal assets in case someone misuses a product we will sell.   Our question is which state would be best to incorporate in and should we incorporate as an LLC or regular corp or what. We're highly focused on minimizing costs up front and the ease of required filings etc. Any advice is greatly appreciated.	Yes
I'm a US citizen (land living in the US) and also a partner of a company based in Australia.   What is the best way to handle distributions in my case -- would it make the most sense to create a subsidiary in the USA for tax purposes, or is there a better option?   While we have a few customers in the USA, we don't plan to pursue the market here and will not open any offices in the US. We'd like to remain focused on the Australian market. If we did open a subsidiary company in the US in order to pay distributions, would that open us up to US law and liabilities? We'd prefer to remain under Australian law since most of our customers are there.  I plan to speak to a lawyer about this, but thought it would be nice to get a few different opinions to prepare in case anyone else has dealt with a similar situation. Thanks in advance for your help!	Yes
"Hi folks,  I was excited to see that Ryuichi Sakamoto is having a short film contest where you make a short film that utilizes songs from his new album, and three winners get money, compositions to use in future films, filmmaking advisor services, a spot on the blu-ray version of the album, among other things.  But in the submission guidelines, there is this bullet point:  &gt;Upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the submitted work in any media form for any purpose. **Our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, adapt, transmit, demonstrate, create derivative work, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion.** Furthermore, upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company and any affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the name(s), nick name(s), and biography of the filmmaker in any media form for any purpose.

The filmmaker must represent and warrant the lack of a third party contract which may interfere with the licensed rights above.  Is this (especially what I bolded) as sinister as it sounds? A mere submission means that a third party can create derivative work based on submitted work? ""Sorry, you lost, so we don't have to pay you, but we can spin your idea into a feature film or music video of our own production at any time.""  Am I misreading this and it's actually standard? Or it's standard anyway? Or it's an overzealous lawyer just covering themselves in case someone wins and then sees a better offer elsewhere? Er, covering themselves in case they happen to make something similar to a generic submission in the future so no one can try to pull a Creed situation?   Thanks"	Yes
I want to make a brand of cat plush toys and coloring books. I was planning on naming it Mushu, but the dragon from the Mulan movie has that name. I searched the trademark website and it said the trademark for that is 'dead.' So would it be okay to use that name for the company and the products?	Yes
So, this is about my grandfather in New Jersey. about two years ago, we were browsing on amazon when we found something strange. A book my grandfather had published... kind of. You see, he was going to run a business a few years ago republishing old books, however the initial cost proved to high so the idea was shelved. that said, before he stopped, he sent one of those books to the PoD service lightningsource to do a small run of a few test copies (iirc, the count numbered less than 10). so, imagine our supprise to find this: https://www.amazon.com/New-Yorks-Awful-Steamboat-Horror/dp/097150590X on amazon one day.  Out of curiosity, I ordered it, and the book that arrived was a perfect match to the test-print he had. somehow, it had gotten printed and sold without his knowledge. Its been two years since then (and who knows when they started and stopped printing the thing), yet even now copies are floating around. Amazon was very unhelpful as we couldn't find a good way to contact somebody outside the customer service department, and obviously Lightningsource never replied to our questions. Was there anything we could have done? his name is even on the book as the editor, as is his company name. it has all the edits he made too.	Yes
I'm designing a product which moves a bed out of the way to enhance a small room space.   It uses motors and a controller. Unless the CRAZY happens 4(1500lb) cables breaking it will be safe.   It will not allow anyone to be on the bed when moving and will move slowly as not to injure. It will also stop the motor if there is an obstruction.  I'm unfamiliar with liability law/insurance so I'm wondering how to go about getting this started.   I understand developing an LLC to separate the company liabilty from my personal assets but I don't understand how much coverage I should get when taking costs into account.   Thanks R	Yes
    As a naive recent college graduate, I came upon an opportunity to work on a side project for a small business owner. We agreed that it would be a side project and I had to get permission from my full-time boss before I could take the project on (proactively avoid any conflict of interests situation).          My boss said he thought it wasn't the best idea because he didn't want my focus being pulled away from any client I would be working for at my full time job, but ultimately was okay with me doing the side project (with the caveat of no phone calls for side project while at a client site, and my full time job always comes first). I communicated this situation to the small business owner and he was okay with the situation.         Long story short, I completely underestimated the project (right out of college, estimation abilities weren't based on reality) and had to enlist the help of 3 other acquaintances to help. We all were working on the project on and off for over a year and there was still some minor development work to be completed plus user testing/bug fixes at the time of him deciding to call off the project.         Over the course of the year he paid me two payments of equal amount and he paid me as a 1099 employee (the second payment only for the sake of being able to include it in his 2016 taxes). From the first payment I used almost all of it to pay 3 work friends for their help. Almost half of the second payment ended up going towards paying my own taxes from the 1099 income.         At the end of 2016/beginning of  2017 his business took a huge hit after losing a major client, and he had to downsize to the point where he might be quitting altogether/finding some other opportunity. In the stress of his business falling apart all of the sudden, he burned a lot of bridges and took a lot of his stresses out on others. During this time he told me that we were going to have to scrap the project because he no longer really had a use for it.         Now, about a month later, he calls me and basically says that he doesn't have a finished product to show for his money and he wants it all back, even if we have to come up with a monthly payment plan. I brought up my time and energy spent on the project and he basically told me that my time doesn't matter, I was supposed to give him this product and I didn't so I owe him everything back. I even told him how half what he paid me had gone to outside help for his project, a large portion to taxes, and I only had a small portion left to show for my own efforts and time; to which he basically replied that that was on me and that my time and efforts are worthless and that if I didn't pay him back he would have no choice but to get his lawyer(s) involved.   So, r/legaladvice, am I pretty much screwed in this situation, or would I even stand any kind of chance in court? He decided to give up on the project and he paid me as a 1099 employee, does that matter in this kind of scenario? I know he is trying to recoup from losses in his business, but just because my efforts are less tangible in his mind (lines of code), it shouldn't discredit my hundreds of hours of effort.  Any help or advice would be appreciated!	Yes
Hi all, I live in Pasadena, CA. I'm starting a new business and need to register a trademark. I've researched the online options like LegalZoom, and I've researched how to do it myself.

"Greetings from Pennsylvania!  I would like to make a series of media channels under the umbrella title ""Highly Questionable.""

"Hello all,  We are a new clothing company based out of Phoenix AZ. We are in a very early stages of creating this business so I wanted to cover everything to make sure what I am printing is legal.

I wanted to see if I can legally print and sell shirts with this type of wording on them. ""Kill"" Murder"" and other violent terms.

"My SO (we are in the UK) crochets amigurumi plushies, and sells them on etsy, as a side hobby (by no means does she really EARN from it per se).  One of her listings on etsy is a pattern for an animal amigurumi, which she posted in the last month. Today she received an email from another etsy seller (from Canada) telling her to take it down as she is infringing on her copyright, as she also has a pattern for the same animal on etsy, and has done since 2016.  the seller notes that she can tell the patterns are not identical, as the stitches are clearly different (at least from a crocheters perspective), but cites that the finished amigurumi is still very similar in appearance, and thus this is where her copyright has been infringed.  is this a thing?  this woman literally says ""Copyright laws protect the appearance of an amigurumi design, even if the actual pattern isn't identical"".  i know my SO didn't copy her pattern, or even use images of her amigurumi for the inspiration. it is purely coincidental. this isn't the first pattern she's made by herself."

So we have this concept for an android app that we think is amazing. The game will use 5-7 second clips of copyrighted media. These are in webm form (no sound). All the clips were taken from Youtube (posted by their respective studios) and from original DVDs we bought. The question is will this pass for fair use or will we get sued? I'm not from the US so I don't fully understand the fair use policy. Thanks if somebody can answer.	Yes

Hello, curious about IP in the US and have a few questions. Whenever you visit a convention (Comiccon etc) there are always a ton of artists selling fan-art.   What's the legality behind that? Is it just a matter of companies not going after small time artists and hoping they don't notice you? Is there a difference between selling a drawing of a companies character in their original costume vs designing a costume with that character in it? Does it matter?  What about accepting commissions to draw a companies IP?  With those out of the way - I plan on selling original artwork of my own design at conventions starting next year. What can I do to protect myself? How would you go about income tax (Specifically MO/KS tax laws regarding artwork sold)or licensing original content? If someone stole artwork from me what would be my best course of action?  Thanks for your help!	Yes
I've been working on a game and I have it pretty fleshed out. But I'm worried about moving forward without having some protection of it. How do I make steps to publish this to the public?

I'm looking to start a online head shop (bongs, glass pipes, etc) based in Canada, shipping all of North America. Now from what I have read it is better for me to start a Canadian Corp instead of an American LLC, because I would be double taxed, is that Correct? If it is, besides filing for to start a corporation online, what would I be looking for locally to go in and be able to talk to about the legalities about selling such items online? Would an accountant or lawyer be better, because I seem to find different answers for that online.  Basically, who do I find locally to start a corporation, and be able to answer questions about the type of business I am looking to start. Thanks in advance for any help.	Yes
https://www.instagram.com/p/BWm01LQAMQP/?hl=en  They never once contacted me or asked me about using my work to promote themselves.   Can I just send them a invoice as if this was a for hire project?  Should I just contact them and say these actions are not cool? I haven't done so yet.  I'm a professional animation/vfx artist. This is what I do for a living. Nearly 1000 hours went into making the full animation, I feel I'm owed something for my time.   I know its probably not worth perusing legal action, as nothing will likely come of it, but I have not been in a situation like this before, and would like some input on how to proceed. Thanks!	Yes
I am asking about nonprofit organizations that arent registered in the state of WA, I giggled the name of their org and found nothing. I know someone who just started a Facebook page claiming to be a non profit organization and is accepting donations, the donations are toys and kids clothing and items for children, I do not think any money is involved but am not sure. They claim none of the things they get are new, but the basically take donations and give them out to people, but for free and some pictures look like new in box toys. My question is they aren't registered, is this legal? Are they supposed to keep books of the items they receive for tax purposes and such? I don't understand and want to know if anyone can help me understand and answer my questions and if they are violating any codes or laws. Thank you for your time and if you need any more information please ask!	Yes
Hi,  I currently run a technology tutoring service for the elderly. I meet one-on-one with them in their homes and am paid hourly.

So I know there are tons of gaming news websites out there and all of them use screenshots, but I'm a newbie when it comes to the legal aspect.  Am I required to ask the game developer/publisher for permission? Do I have to reference the source?

"Every day at 4:00pm my college campus posts available on-campus housing contracts for sale at an online webpage. There is a huge shortage of contracts for students (and nearby off-campus housing is expensive) so the demand is huge and getting one of these contracts is like winning the lottery. I attend a private university.  I wrote a internet bot that refreshes the housing page 30+ times per second and reserves a contract the instant it appears. I successfully used it on myself to get a housing contract. I feel like if I released my bot as a service there would be a big demand for it. Something like ""Pay $50 to guarantee a contract"".  What things should I consider from a legal perspective before launching this type of service? I would need to collect their login information, log in on behalf of the student, and use my bot to put the contract on hold. I wouldn't need to actually pay for or sign any sort of lease agreement for the student. They would finalize the contract after later logging into their account.  In other words, could this be illegal? How should I know if this could get me in trouble with my college? Is it a bad idea to talk to the college directly? Are there other business models that could minimize my risk to legal repercussions?"	Yes
"So after pretty much no word from former landlord, he sends us an itemized list within hours of his 60 day duration being up saying we owe him more money. FYI the numbers given aren't the exact quote more just a ballpark figure of what it is.  The first item that took our security deposit is that he expects us to pay for plumbing repair and replacing the plumbing system. In March our basement plumbing system started leaking water. We notified him immediately of the problem. However, he did not actually send a person to look at it until late May. (We have multiple texts from when we first reported the problem and trying to get him to send someone out) When a person did finally come to look at it, the only resolution we got from him was to put down towels around it. He did not actually get it properly looked at until a few days ago. Invoice for replacement is dated 8/01. According to him, the problem was cause by a rag getting stuck in the plumbing system. None of my roommates seem to ever recall flushing a rag down the toilet and I do believe them. Our apartment was one of three in a single building and not sure if the plumbing system in our basement was for multiple units or just ours. Either way, the long period of the plumbing system leaking caused baseboard damage which leads to the next item.   He is quoting us $2,500 dollars for re-painting the entire house. Besides the pictures of the damaged baseboards in the basement there are only a few pictures of minor scuffs on the wall which should be ruled as normal wear and tear. Also, we were told before moving out that he planned to re-paint the entire house anyway. We have texts with the landlord for when he was telling us that a painter would be coming to start the process while we were still living there. The ""painting company"" he hired seemed to be a friend of his and worked for about half a day while we were still living there. However, the invoice for painting in May 17 he sent us was for 61 hours of work.   He is also charging us $500 for Landscape repair. Our roommate did have a dog with dug up the yard a decent bit but the ""backyard"" is only about the size of a suburban and half of it is concrete/gravel so not sure if this is a reasonable quote?  Finally, many of the pictures he is using for ""damages"" are from when we still actually lived there. Earlier in the year he did a surprise visit with his dad so we did not have time to clean the place before his arrival. He is using these to claim we did not do any cleaning before leaving and saying we left the place in poor condition. In some cases, it is obvious as parts of our furniture and possessions are in the corners of the pictures. In other cases, there are pictures of corners/window sills we know we cleaned thoroughly but could not think of another time he would of gotten a picture when they were dirty. Unfortunately, we did not take pictures when we moved out. Besides his slowness to deal with the plumbing issue he had seemed like an honest person and we we're not expecting anything like this. In hindsight, obviously I will be sure to document pictures myself.  There are some other charges such as cleaning fees, carpet repair (damage from dog) and routine landscape maintenance which does seem to be in the lease but confusingly worded. These aren't such a big deal. It is mainly the plumbing and painting that are the issue.   Any advice would be appreciated! Especially concerning how much to reveal on things I can disprove when I initially dispute the bill before going to court.  Thanks!"	No
"Here's the original post:  ""I just found out that my ex never filed the paperwork I gave him IN NOVEMBER because he ""couldn't afford"" the $200 fee. Other than the fact that I'm still legally married to this fucking loser, I can't get financial aid for spring and summer because they want proof of a divorce that never actually happened. I'm fucking irate. This is just a testiment to how immature and selfish he is.

"I've been trying to find what the law is on this. I saw something written about obtaining a permit for yellow strobe lights (red and blue are reserved for official emergency vehicles) but I haven't been able to find anything about whether they're allowed to exceed the speed limits...   Story:  Today I was stopped at a red light, a white van pulled up behind me. I noticed that it had yellow strobe lights built into its side mirrors which it didn't have on when it pulled up behind me but at some point it turned on. The light turned green, I guess I was 2 seconds slow to notice because the van behind me honked at me (the car in front of my had just started to move as the horn sounded).  So I proceeded to drive in this two lane road, there were cars next to me.  I noticed that the white van was following me very very closely. I increased speed a little (5 above the limit) but I was able to maintain a safe distance with the car in front of me.  After some point, there was a break and the white van moved to pass me on the left. He exceeded the speed limit by at least 10mph to do so and then quickly merged right in front of me without using his turn signal.  It was at this point that I noticed a sticker on the back of his (very dirty) van that said ""Emergency Roadside Assistance, 24 hours"".  Shortly after this, the speed limit dropped by 10mph as we were passing a fire station with somewhat poor visibility and this van was now driving 20mph above the limit as he tore away from me.   I didn't have the presence of mind to try to memorize his license plate but I didn't see any kind of other identification number I could use to report him.  My questions: In my state, what exactly is the legality of yellow strobe lights? Do they require a permit? Are there specific circumstances when they can be used? Do they allow a vehicle to exceed the speed limit or drive in any other dangerous/aggressive ways? If so, under what circumstances?  I will add, that in the bright daylight when this happened, his yellow lights were not very noticeable. If I hadn't thought to check my rear view at the stoplight, I don't think I would have noticed them at all. Additionally he did not keep the lights on the entire time he was driving. He turned them off at some point while following me, then turned them back on when he passed me, then back off when he was in front of me and going 20mph above the limit.  This is a little different from the types of questions I usually see here... I'm not looking to take any kind of legal action or anything I just want to know, did I screw up? Was I obstructing a legal emergency vehicle in some way? He only used his horn once at the stoplight, never to indicate that I should move over for him or something like that..."	No
I just purchased a home in Wisconsin and closed on May 11th. last week we had 3 days of heavy rains and unfortunately it ended up coming out of the living room and dining room wall through a dormer roof that was not properly sealed. My insurance adjuster came to take pics and informed me that the old owners filed a claim in Oct 2016 for a roof leak that caused ceiling damage. However no repairs were done to the ceiling save for repainting. What, if any legal recourse do I have?  Sellers never disclosed roof issues or water damage to the house.	No
Hello everyone,  I am a real estate agent. When I first began my career, I was quite naive and I signed a non-compete agreement because the firm claimed they had a number of trade secrets, incredible training, etc.   After receiving my first paychecks, I was quite disappointed, and I left for a different brokerage. My old firm's lawyer has now sent me a letter saying that I must stop or they will pursue legal action against me.   The non compete says that I cannot work for or operate within 25 miles of any of their offices. They have 4 office across the Detroit Metro region. The term is 2 years.  I know I knew what I was signing, but I had no idea it could hinder my career in this manner. A real estate agent's career depends on their sphere of influence and all of my SOi live around me. A 25 mile non compete puts me out of business for 2 years. I have to drive at least an hour and half to get to a firm outside this region. Furthermore, after interviewing with a number of firms, I have found that there really aren't any trade secrets in Real Estate. And many other firms have more robust training regimes with better splits, and every single one of them did not require a such a noncompete to be signed.   I called my state real estate legal hotline and the lawyer had no idea what to do because he had never hear of non compete agreements in our industry. Ditto with the executive officer of my board. They had never heard of such a thing in my field.   I am not sure what to do.   I can send a copy of that agreement and the letter they send me on request.	No
So I've learned that somewhat recently there have been cases in which plaintiffs have won cases against companies which have websites which are not ADA complaint (sites which are usable by the blind/deaf).  My understanding throughout my career (which was probably false) was that only US Government agencies were required to comply with these rules.  I have heard of many cases in which lawyers have sued small businesses over failing to have wheelchair ramps, elevators, etc. in the past but only recently that website operators and mobile app owners are being sued. I am quite concerned that there could be a liability by simply having a website. What's worse is that it seems the DOJ has not even finalized any regulations on the subject.  How can plaintiffs justify damages by not being able to access free websites? I've never understood how a disabled individual could justify damages for being unable to access a restaurant or other business.	No
"My boyfriend and I met at work, and both had their health insurance. I quit after getting a different job, but I don't have health insurance. ""I'll just add you to mine"" he says, because we knew that company doesn't require marriage. Neither of us are interested in getting officially married, and if we were, it wouldn't be right this second.   Well, after looking into adding me to his insurance, it does say it requires a domestic partnership affidavit.  As far as I can tell, you can get one of those in a bunch of counties in NY (not my county) but most have residency requirements. The exceptions are the cities of Albany, Ithaca, and Rochester. Albany is 1.5 hours away, Ithaca 3.5 hours, and Rochester 4 hours. I was not opposed to driving down to Albany, but then I saw the rules. (see links below)  We have lived together over 6 months, but his driver's license address is his mom's because he cosigned her mortgage for her, and there was a whole thing about residency. That house is right up the road from us. I own my house and the utilities are all in my name, and he doesn't have a lease with me. He's just here. We do have a joint bank account so I can provide a document for that. His car insurance and pay stubs list our address. He got the motorcycle license endorsement in May, so his driver's license issue date is not over 6 months ago, which Albany seems to require, right?  Ithaca doesn't seem to have all these rules. It looks like you just show up, sign the paper, and you're domestic partners. However, they are only open on week days and the 3.5 hour drive each way would result in an entire day spent. I'm fine with doing that, I just want to be sure it's really necessary instead of going to Albany.   I can't seem to find any google or reddit examples of domestic partnerships in NY state...everything that comes up is for NYC, or for state employees, or counties we don't live in.   Does anyone know anything about domestic partnership in New York state? Is Ithaca really the place we'll need to go?

Hello legaladvice! This is my first post here so bare with me.  In April me and 4 friends signed an apartment lease for September. Last week we got emails saying that another property management group had taken over our building.   That was fine but the problem arose today when we got an email saying that our unit was actually double booked and the people living there have renewed their lease. They failed to mention this to us when we signed the lease.   Our issue is that the they want to move us into another unit in the same building while paying the same rent but our room sizes are significantly smaller. Can we do anything about this?  All help is appreciated. Thanks.	No
Posted in r/personalfinance originally   Not sure if best place to post, but have found help on this sub-Reddit before   My grandfather passed away this weekend and I have been off work since. My partner went to work on Monday but came home early and has since taken Tuesday and Wednesday off as well. Partially as she is upset and partially to support me.  Now, the thing is she has been temping at a company the past few weeks (in the uk) and she has been called this morning to be told she is no longer wanted as she is 'unreliable'   To me this seems wholly unfair, as she is taking compassionate leave, and if she had been asked to go in, she would have.  My question is, is this right? Is there anything that can be done here?	No
"Okay, so my mom passed away in the state of Texas back in 2009. One year before the, she and her husband at the time took out a home equity line of credit. He co-signed. Then she died. There was no probated will upon her death. As I understood it, the house and property goes to her husband at the time of death. I was in the military and have NEVER had any financial or legal ties or obligation to the house. Anyway, he stopped paying on the loan last year. Back in December, the attorney representing the bank calls me and asks if I have talked to my former step-father (who co-signed on the loan). I explained that he and I haven't been on speaking terms since my mom's death due to personal reasons. Then about two weeks ago, I get written notice in the mail that they are trying to  pursue judgment against my deceased mother, her husband, and ""any heirs..."". I immediately called the attorney representing the bank (plaintiff) and left a vocie mail explaining that I have never have any financial or legal ties to that property and that I have not been able to reach my former step-father. Today, I get written notice that now I personally and being sued for the property....  Mind you, I haven't lived in the state of Texas in 14 years. I have NEVER had any ties to my mom's house. But now they are suing ME for it?!?   I'm a full time college student here in California. I have ZERO means to defend myself financially. I can't afford to hire a defense attorney. I called and left another voicemail for the prosecuting attorney explaining yet again that I have no ties to the property. I requested that they call me back ASAP to straighten this out.  I don't get why I am being sued for 35k for a property that is never and was never my responsibility."	No

My husband and I have been separated for over a year and living in different states. All finances are separate and neither relies on the other for any assistance. We have not even been in contact for over 6 months. I recently became pregnant from my boyfriend. I know my husband is the assumed father and I should put him on the birth certificate.   I have tried several times to get in contact with the husband to try and proceed with a divorce but he hasn't returned any texts or phone calls. I also know that he has moved at some point and I don't know his address or if he still works at the same job.   Could I just say that I am separated on any paper work and list my boyfriend as the father? I just want to do this with the smallest amount of stress and financial burden on myself and worried about legal fees adding up with having to try and track the husband down and having to do paternity tests. 	No
I just signed a lease that I was very hesitant to sign, even after speaking to the property manager.  This complex, in San Antonio, tx, is going to charge me $41/ month for cable.  I have to sign the addendum in order to move in.  I spoke to her (prop. Manager) about how I don't want cable and don't own a tv and she said since they do bulk cable deals with the local provider, every apartment in the complex got discountes cable even if we didn't want it. As much as I want to ask is this legal, or how do I work around this, I'd prefer some links so I can research on my own. Thank you.	No
My father has been involved in a biking accident a few months back. Luckily, he didn't sustain serious injuries, and only had (substantial) damage to his (racing) bike. The other person involved in the crash was a woman who sustained heavy injuries (fractured skull, and cannot recall the accident) and spent 2 days in the hospital. She is now holding my father accountable for the accident, and we are wondering how to respond, as we firmly believe he was not the one at fault.   He (and his friend) describe the situation as follows:  The two of them were heading home after a long tour on their racing bike, and cycling up a hill in the town center. My father is on the left, nearer to the middle of the road, and they approach the cross road where the accident happens. At the side of the road, the view is blocked by a large white van, as there are parking spaces right up to the cross road. BEFORE they reach the cross road, and can see past the van, a woman aproaches from the right, first hits my father's friend (lightly, causing him to fall) and then has a full on collission with my father, causing my father to fly headfirst over his bike, while she falls backwards. My father was protected by his helmet, which has broken in multiple places, she, sadly, has no such protection. Both of them are lying on the ground next to the van, a good distance before the cross roads, on their side of the road. The woman claims that as she was approaching from the right side of the cross roads (Dutch traffic law) she had right of way, and my father is liable. My father says they were not at the crossing yet, hadn't been able to see her because of the van and she 'cut corners', and so she is in fact at fault. Police arrived only after they had already left for the hospital, took their statements, and decided the aftermath was left for the insurance companies to decide. So there is no proper   Today, he received a formal letter, to inform him she will hold him accountable and informed her insurance of this. Now, as we are insured this doesn't really matter, not even affecting his deductible (?word?), but he does resent being blamed for something he feels he is not responsible for. Or at least, not solely, as his friend was also part of the incident. Aside from that, he also has significant damage to his biking equipment (upward of 200 euros) and though nothing compared to her ordeal, it's no small ammount.  He is planning to put this all into a proper letter in reply, and has had contact with his own insurance about what is going on, but I am wondering if you people have any advice how to proceed?  Thanks in advance!	No
So it all started one sunday morning when me and my family decided to fly to california. My mom is a relatively frugal woman so she tried to get the cheapest tickets for an airline due to us having 6 members including her in the family. So we go to the airport get passed security and find ourselves boarding the plane she boards first due to her having multiple sclerosis. Then the rest of us board. We get a little confused because we got business seating. Theres first class, business then the regular coach. But there we are literally in the back of the plane with no way to push our seats back. And other people start boarding so were literally stuck there for the ride. After that terrible flight were onto another flight to get to cali. My moms bladder is insanely good thank god. Her having no movement of her legs, it gets quite hard as you can imagine. But on this flight she finds herself needing to use the bathroom and what do you know the bathroom isn't handicap accessible they had to hold up a curtain on both sides of the plane so no one could see her and my dad as she used a basic right. I would curse every sentence but im sure thats probably not allowed. So my mom was utterly humiliated and she wants to sue the airline. My question to you lovely people is should she sue? And would it have to be a class action suite of some kind?	No
Long story but this is the short version. My miniture dachshund bit a neighbour. At first they gave us a 14 day eviction. I protested that 14 days was not enough time so they extended it to a month. Now my property manager is saying that we can stay until the end of our lease (which ends November 31). This is now not an eviction but a request. I have never been late with my rent. What would happen if I just keep on paying my rent and dont move?  Eapecially if my dog hasn't bitten anyone during the next 4 months. Would they have grounds to evict still? I live in Alberta Canada.	No
My new husband and his ex-wife have joint legal custody of their two children, 10 and 11. He is the parent with primary physical custody, however, and they reside with us the majority of the time, with her receiving standard 1st, 3rd, 5th weekend visitation, as well as other holidays, etc., as noted in their agreement.   She is, however, a very high-conflict individual. My husband receives many texts blowups, sometimes almost daily, which usually escalate to her calling him over and over, or emailing him long diatribes if both of those avenues fail. Sometimes this will slow for about a week until the inevitable flair blindsides us again.   These communications can range from demands for him to provide her my social security information to run a background check on me since I reside with her children, to detailed questions about things in our home; do we have parental locks on all electronic devices? Do we have a gun safe? What is the “safety plan” for her children now that my son (13) also resides in the home? We need to provide her with the children’s cell carrier and plan information so she can monitor those accounts (in our name, which we pay for). Where are their shot records, right now? Why aren’t we making sure those phones aren’t on every minute, every day, as they should be reachable to her at any time?   These are just some of many examples of demands, all given in command form, “You need to do this, RIGHT NOW.” They’re interwoven with name calling, verbal attacks, bullying, and total emotional meltdowns in which she has once even insinuated she will take her life, tell her children she loves them!, or a time when she had the children and refused to commit to returning them at the end of visitation, saying she’d be in another state, or maybe another city (although she DID return them, after we both were insane with worry and stress). The emotional breakdowns when calls aren’t answered or texts aren’t replied to, or information she wants isn’t given, can also come with threats to show up on our door at 3am to take the kids because we are unfit, to call the police, or just standard legal threats of all of these refusals to her demands or communications being “documented” for her records.   Emotionally demanded or not, she has the rights she has as ordered by the state to her kids and information about them. Having joint custody means, (I believe?) she is supposed to have a say in their day-to-day life, but I’m not sure what our responsibility is on that front, or what the actual actions are to carry out abidance to that looks like. We do know WE have the right to have a life that isn’t plagued with these demands and emotional attacks under the guise of it being about the sake and safety of the children. We are planning on communicating our intent our ground rules and guidelines about communications with her, including we will not communicate on anything but things which are about the kids, and further than that, that we will only communicate with her about things about the kids which we are LEGALLY bound to do.   With all of this said, even generally, what are we legally bound to do? I know most of this rests in what’s in the custody agreement, but it’s pretty standard for the terms listed, no special previsions or demands made and signed to. Is there a place to start before we make is serious by heading to the lawyer for legal counsel? We’re willing to do so eventually, but dang… we just want to know if we’re overreacting when we should have been saying, “LOL yeah right!” from the get go before we get official.   Thank you in advance if anyone out there is with me this long. I appreciate any pointers or guidance on this issue for my family.	No
Hello,  My wife and I are looking to buy a house to use as a short term rental property in Rochester MN. Is anyone familiar with Minnesota laws as far as injury due to accidents of a guest? From what I understand this doesn't fall under homeowners insurance.  We would be advertising locally, on Airbnb, VRBO, and Homeaway. Does it make sense to start an LLC or does this change the tax status of the property? Sorry if none of this is very focused, I am trying to find a good resource to learn how to do this. If anyone on here happens to know a real estate attorney in Rochester they would recommend, we would appreciate it!   All the best	No
"Hi,  I recently moved in with 2 other people into a 3 bedroom town home in Virginia. The 3 of us signed the lease paying $516 a month each. They agreed I could have the master bedroom so I would sign on with them since I was more interested in living on my own which they said they were fine with.   Fast forward about 2 months later, a week before move in they bring up that they think whoever has the master room should pay more. This is annoying because we had never talked about it before but I was somewhat amenable because the room was better. I offered to pay $560 a month which I thought was fair but no one answered the group message.   3 days before move in one of them messages me saying they were willing to pay $600 for the master room and if I wasn't willing to pay that price they would take it. This is infuriating but I say we should just move in and discuss it later because I was worried one of them would move into the room before I could get there.  Now a few weeks have passed and it's time to pay rent. They message me to ""confirm that [I] am good with paying $600... or discussing a room swap"". I never agreed to paying this much and I certainly don't want to swap rooms. The only reason they were able to convince me to live with them was because they agreed I could have this room without ever suggesting I would have to pay more than the amount we all signed on for until mere days before move-in.  I have a ton of student loans to pay back and really don't want to be paying almost $100 more than I signed on for. I think it's incredibly rude and unacceptable for them to promise me the room and then essentially auction it off among us because suddenly they think the room is worth more and arbitrarily chose a new number for me to pay. My worry is that I don't really have much leverage or a way to stop them from moving all my stuff into another room while I'm at work if I don't agree to pay the price they decided. These are people who have been my friends for about a year, but have know each other longer and I feel like they are ganging up on me. I don't know what to do and I'm hoping you guys can help.  Thanks!"	No
I started working for the company over 4 months ago and I have only taken one day off (for my grandmas funeral). My mom thinks I have a staph infection but I want to go to the doctor to make sure that I am ok ( I have been feeling nauseous for the last few days and I have this sore on my foot that itches). The company has about 12 employees including me. My real question really is if there is anything in Texas law about paid time off, vacation days, and sick days, for a small company. I also was wondering about not receiving check stubs when I am being paid. He takes taxes, SS, and health insurance out of my check and that is shown at the bottom of the actual check but I feel like check stubs should be in place. Any thoughts and advice??	No

Rather than the traditional route of donating through a company (which after some research I decided was not for me) I found a site that does it in a similar fashion to a dating site, which seems much less carefully tracked. Is it possible I could be sued for child support or other risk factors for this? Should or could I draft up some kind of legal waver and how would I go about doing so if I did? For further information the site I use is www.coparents.com	No
Maine, USA  My exhusband and I purchased a house while married, however when we got divorced he agreed to continue making payments on the property and that if in a year he was unable to refinance the house would be put on the market and sold. This was in November of 2016.  However, I recently discovered that he has not made a single payment on the property since we split up in June 2016. The reason I wasn't notified earlier was because he changed the address they were sending past due statements to without my knowledge.   I received a forwarded letter to my current address from the bank that our mortgage is through with an intent to foreclose slated to be done on August 4th if the current 13 missed payments, interest and escrow is not paid by that date. Recently I have come into money that would allow me to pay this debt off and continue making current payments on the house to keep it out of risk of foreclosure again in the future.  To my knowledge my ex spouse no longer lives there at the property but has tenants. What he is doing with the tenants check every month I couldn't tell you.   My question is that even though in our divorce agreement he was going to take ownership of the house, is it possible to go back to court and use this information to take back the property and evict the current tenants? And would the court be willing to have an expedited court date to speed up this process? The loan is still in both of our names.	No
I recently rented a house in Maryland (Prince Georges County) for a month while waiting for my next lease to start. It has been a week since I moved in and I found myself covered in bug bites. To my surprise I find that the carpeting and box spring that were left in the room are infested with bed bugs (I clearly didn't do a thorough inspection before renting). I notified my landlord about 3 days ago with picture proof that I wasn't the one who brought the bugs in with me. Unfortunately he hasn't given me a straight answer on what he's going to do about it. My question is: Is there anything I can do to either expedite the process or break my lease? 	No

Hi, thanks for taking the time to open this up.  We're looking to rent in London and had an offer accepted for a house, the agent then asked us to transfer the holding deposit via email. We transferred £700 now the agent says the landlord is considering other offers. Do we have any legal recourse? Are holding deposits binding for both parties?  Thanks again.	No

"tldr; my girlfriend received a lease violation and potentially one more based on complaints that are not true  Approximately one month ago my girlfriend received a lease violation regarding a noise complaint.  We called the apartment manager, and he said it appeared to be noise from sexual activity.  So we toned it down dramatically and moved all activity to a different room that doesn't share a wall with any neighbors.    Three weeks ago, a note was slipped under my girlfriend's door from one of her neighbors claiming there was still a ton of ""banging"" noises against the shared wall.  My girlfriend and I were appalled.  All she has for a bed is just a mattress on the floor, and we had not been having sex in the room at all.  I decided it would be best if we write an extremely polite and pleasant note back to the neighbor explaining that we will be extremely conscious of any noise.  So we did.  Yesterday, my girlfriend received a voicemail from her apartment manager stating he had received another noise complaint about similar noises.  However, he said he would hold off on sending a lease violation again in hopes we could rectify the situation over the weekend.  My girlfriend is going to talk to the apartment manager in person on Monday to try and explain our side of the story.  Has anyone else dealt with false complaints in an apartment before?  I'd greatly appreciate any advice."	No
Just received a letter from my old college landlord asking for $1k on top of my $300 security deposit for damages at my last apartment.  I only stayed there for the fall semester and subleased the spring semester out.  These damages are ridiculously overprice.  $180/person for carpet cleaning (there was 4 of us), $200/person for general house cleaning.  We did do some damage but this is insane.. I didnt take any photos when we moved in but a lot of these damages were there before.  I need to get out of paying the majority of this.  I was thinking asking for proof of all damages and receipts of all cleanings/repairs, and then threatening a lawyer if I was forced to pay for pre-existing damages.  What should I do? This is a sleezebag college landlord that is very sketchy.  The letter I received threatens the bill will be sent to collections if payment is not received in 10 days but I'm not sure he'd even do that.	No
"This is my first time having to deal with renting, but my roommates have rented several times before. We are all going to grad school (my first year, their last year). We have assistantships that give us a paycheck each month. There is a mobile home park across the street from school, and they have great sized homes for what we need - three bedrooms, two full baths, a washer/dryer, dishwasher, central air, etc. It's a pretty great deal.  When we were originally looking, the price range (depending on size and age of the unit) was $879-$929. We put in an application and got accepted, and **at that point paid the $200 deposit**. We called to inquire about a moving date, got told mid-July or end of for moving in, and was alerted that the prices were being raised by corporate and it was now $959-$979. They told us the unit we have was $979 a month...but it wasn't a new unit.  Okay, kind of crappy, but we all estimated highly for rent just to be on the safe side. My other roommates have been heading talking to them, I was just ""added in"" to the contract. According to my roommates, they have been rude. After inquiring about why we are getting a higher price, they were snippy and explained it was corporate and not them.  Fast forward to yesterday, they told us rent is possibly being raised to $999 a month, which is completely absurd. The manager told us she would ""go to bat"" for us to keep the $979 rate after my roommates absolutely blew up her phone and e-mail. She then complained to my roommates that it was only $6 extra per person so she doesn't understand why it was such a big deal. We are paid pennies in grad school, we can't afford a lot in rent especially since we have to pay other utilities here as well as fees and that's not including food and gas. She then proceeded to say that we should be grateful we are getting a spot with such a good deal and so close to the school with so many utilities covered (we have to pay electricity, gas, and internet.) That's a lie, a few other places cover almost all utilities but they have no availability and if we bring it up they'll just drop the contract and tell us to go there instead.  Something about this seems very wrong, it doesn't sit right. I understand that corporate could be raising prices, but isn't it a thing that the price is locked in after paying the deposit? We are paying the rest right before we move in, **as well as signing the contract (we have not done that yet.)** We also have to determine a moving date, we don't know when that is either. We know complexes and parks near schools extort students, especially right across the street from the school, and that is a reason why the price is so high. But it's too late to find something else, I am also scared that if we keep fighting they will take away our contract and we will be homeless.  Since we have not signed the contract, is there anything we can do? I have this impending feeling they will raise the price and continue doing so until I literally will not have any extra money."	No
Hello everyone. July of last year my fiance and I moved into this duplex. It's really nice &lt; 3 years old, we're the second tennants. However since we've moved in we've had problem after problem with things breaking, including the A/C. We live in Georgia, so that's a problem. About 3 months ago, I awoke to the smell of smoke, as a firefighter I didn't call 911 and decided to investigate first. Turns out our light fixture above the sink was smoking pretty bad,  I removed the bulb amd it seemed to stop. Maintenance put a new bulb in, and it went out shortly after. We decided to leave it alone. Our A/C went out saturday night. We got by Sunday with the help of a window unit until they fixed it monday. Well about 45 minutes ago, my fiance woke me up screaming that the house was smoking, sure enough the control panel was extremely hot, and putting off a good amount of smoke I removed the panel, shutting it off. I checked the breaker, and it too was hot. Had we not been here I am about 90% certain it would have led to a house fire.   What are my rights as a tenant to terminate the lease if I feel unsafe? Will lawers have to get involved?    Thanks in advance.	No
My roommate took a trip to California last month, leaving his cats and all his things for me to take care of. We didn't sign a lease, I just moved him in. He hasn't paid for this month or next.

"Hello,    We just received a certified letter from our rental company stating that our payment was ""dishonored by [my] financial institution."" They are now demanding an additional ~$150 in fees. When we called the number on the letter, we were prompted to leave a voicemail. I left my details along with the confirmation number we had received with the payment confirmation email. We then contacted the customer service for the rental company and the rep stated that it had been denied for ""insufficient funds"" while the website states it was denied for ""closed account.""     1) I have $800 in privilege pay, so if I hadn't had the funds (I did), my checking account would have gone negative to pay the rent.    2) The website deleted our saved account information so I cannot even verify the account number I used to make the transaction. All I have is the last 4 of my account number per the confirmation email, which I verified is correct.    3) The letter demands these fees be paid within 12 days or we will be taken to court. While we can pay these fees, this is not our error as we had the confirmation email stating the payment was made.     4) My checking account does NOT reflect that any attempt to retrieve the funds was made, however. I called to confirm this and the rental company didn't pull out any money. The funds are still sitting there.      5) No one called us to state there was an issue with the payment. We assumed all was well as we had the confirmation email and figured it would take the typical 3-4 business days. I reasoned that with the holiday last week, things would be delayed a bit.    6) We used my checking account for the first time instead of my fiancé's (his has never had any issue before). This is the only difference, but it still made us input the account number twice and routing number once when we entered the information initially.       Questions I have: Are we responsible for these fees? Does it seems suspicious to anyone else that both of our saved bank accounts were deleted from the system so we cannot even confirm the account number from which funds were supposed to be drawn out from? We have not been able to get in contact with the woman who issued the letter (from the collections department), and the customer service line was of no help."	No
Hi all!  I moved into this apartment at the start of the summer after dorms closed at my college nearby. I answered an ad on a Facebook housing group for our college posted by a girl I knew, Vanessa. She was looking for a roommate so we both moved in together. Vanessa left after about three weeks for her graduate program, so I've been here alone. This is fine since it's a one bedroom and Vanessa was sleeping on the couch until it was time for her to leave. I knew that Vanessa was going to leave and that I would be here alone, which is why I agreed to have a roommate in a one bedroom.  I was just told by the person who is on the lease, Julie, that she is having someone move in to the apartment I am subletting. I pay rent to someone else, so I guess Julie sublet to Lacy who sublet to Vanessa and me.  Julie might be having this random person move in I guess a week? I told her that I was under the impression I was living here alone for the summer.  I do not feel comfortable with living with a stranger. There was no formal agreement which is why I feel like she could just have this person move on in. What are my rights and what do I do?  Thanks!	No

If a couple is married, can one person file bankruptcy on their own? I'm married but have past premarital debt. My spouse doesn't have debt or bad credit. Would it be possible for me to file bankruptcy on my debt that occurred before our marriage without him having to file with me or be effected in any way? He has a security clearance to think of and his job depends on having good credit to keep his clearance. I need to protect my husband from my debt. I have a disabled child whom l stay home and care for, so me working to pay off the massive amount of medical bills and hospital stays my childs disability racked up with me being a single mom before I got remarried and got health insurance is impossible. My credit is shot. I'd really like to start new if could. My ex-husband doesnt contribute a dime for our son and never has. I've had hell trying to get the court to enforce support beyond the order, so all the bills are on me and hurt my credit. I can't afford to take the ex back to court again, not that he'd get a job and contribute anyway. What can I do?	No
"I am posting for a friend who does not use reddit- she has no idea where to go for advice for this situation and I feel as though she is getting poor advice, so here we go.  Location: Bloomington, Minnesota  My friend bought a condo a couple months ago. When she bought it the floors were all hard laminate, which was preferable but they were badly warped. She wanted to tear the floors out and put in new floors, and as such contacted the HOA for her building. In the last couple of months she's been getting little to no response from them, and had literally just today gotten her ""welcome packet"" with the HOA rules and such. It was so bad she had no way to pay the HOA fees and had to convince them to waive the late fees because she had no way of knowing how to pay the fee before today.  About a month ago, after getting no response after many attempts of contact, she had the floors torn out, because they were garbage no matter what. She found that the subflooring was also in horrible condition and was the wrong sort for laminate and has scheduled to have the concrete redone for laminate flooring. That appointment is tomorrow  Here's the dilemma: when giving her the welcome packet and such, she finally got to talk about the renovations with the HOA. They told her they aren't allowing any hard flooring outside the kitchen and bathroom due to nose concerns. She has already bought all of the flooring for the condo, which is high-grade noise cancelling. She has been waiting to do this for months and this will set her back by another couple months and a good chunk of change. She also doesn't feel that this concern is very valid, as there are no previous complaints on the unit, even though the previous laminate was much worse and the concrete was the incorrect type for the floor. Additionally, the rule book for the HOA says nothing about the type of flooring allowed.   What options does she have? Can they even enforce that rule if it isn't in their bylaws? Can she appeal that rule with other options? What redirections might she face if she just goes forward with the laminate flooring?  A huge reason she bought the condo was for the hardwood floors- she can't deal with carpet because her cat has digestive issues and ruins carpets pretty immediately. She would not ever get carpet, so she would be open to almost any other option.   TL;DR friend bought condo with trashed hardwood floors. Tries to talk to condo about new floors, gets ignored for months, finally replies and shuts her down on the wood floors and insists on carpet."	No
In the fall of 2015 I found myself in a situation where I needed to get a new car. The car that I had been driving needed so much work done to it, that for me it wasn’t worth fixing. At the time I was also taking care of medical bills that had piled up while I was out of work the previous year, and my credit wasn’t in the place it is now, so I couldn’t get approved for a loan myself. My girlfriend at the time offered to take a car loan out in her name that I would make the payments on. At the time there was no signed agreement between her and I made regarding me making the payments, and my name wasn’t on the car loan whatsoever. I was only an insured driver on her policy, something she did to make her own insurance less expensive, while also making it easier on me. I drove the car and made the payments on time every month for a year, until September of 2016.   Long story short, she was unhappy in the relationship and suggested I move out, which lead to us ultimately breaking up very shortly after I moved out. Of course, this resulted in me returning the car to her. She decided to sell the car at a loss very quickly so she didn’t have to deal with it, while making me feel as though I had to reimburse her for the money she lost on the sale. She drafted up an agreement at the time, saying the amount that I owed her, with a payment plan. Having been completely blindsided by her request to me move out, I wasn’t in a clear headspace and very depressed. I was out of the apartment that I had lived in for two years, she kept both of our cats that we had (one of which was MY LIFE), and I had no car.   For reasons I can’t explain now, I felt obligated to agree to and sign her agreement. I have begrudgingly sent her a check for $200 every month for the past 14 months, all the while thinking the agreement that we have is unfair. I’ve done some research on signed agreements, and feel as though hers has holes in it, but am not sure. The agreement doesn’t detail what the money is for. The agreement provides an address that I am to send the payment to, but that has changed since the agreement began. (One of the bullet points on the agreement state “Any modifications to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties.”) I don’t feel like I’m legally obligated to pay her back for a car she sold that didn’t have my name anywhere on it, especially since there was no signed agreement in the beginning, when I originally got the car.    I have a copy of the agreement, and can retype (changing names) and send as a PM.	No
"As the title says, my roommates and I are being sued by a former landlord to the tune of roughly $7500 after a tenancy that stretched from 2014 until April of 2017. The bulk of the charges come from painting ($3000) and carpeting ($3200). In addition to these charges there are $600 in damages that they are attempting to charge us for that appear on the initial commencement checklist as being previously damaged, signed in 2014 at the outset of the lease. They are also suing us for their attorney's fees; one of my biggest questions regarding the issue is if they are allowed to do this and if so is there a limit to the amount we can be held liable for?  There are some damages we do not contest, such as wall dings, scratches, and a broken kitchen drawer, however, we assert that the ""damage"" to the paint and carpet was normal wear and tear over the course of a 3 year lease. Some of the paint in the home at lease origination was noted as ""freshly painted"", while other rooms were not. The carpets were dirty at the time of lease inception and one of the tenant's parents rented a carpet cleaner and cleaned them before they moved in, it is our belief that the carpets in the home may be original to the home (built 1997), but we do not know for sure.  After we moved out of the home the landlords fully re-painted and re-carpeted the entire house and have since sold it. It is our belief that they are attempting to leverage our security deposit and other alleged damages to offset the costs of their renovation of the property.   Ultimately, the main questions I have regarding our case are whether or not the life expectancy of the paint and carpeting was exceeded by the term of the lease and whether or not we are liable for their attorney fees should we choose to go to court. Any help or suggestion would be greatly appreciated!"	No
"As title says, I have lived in my house for just under a year. I began noticing an area in the back corner of my backyard was slowly eroding away every time it rained (I am in the state of Louisiana, so lots of rain), and more recently the hole has grown to a very large size. In my closing documentation, it states that proper drainage was installed ""per Home Owner Warranty Act"" however clearly this is not the case, as every time it rains the water is slowly taking the earth away with it.  I have reached out to the builder with basically no luck, and all they have offered to do is fill the hole in with dirt for a ""cheaper"" price than what the going rate would be for a local contractor, but mentioned nothing about fixing the root cause, which is improper drainage. I brought out another independent contractor to evaluate the situation, and he pretty much told me the situation was pretty bad and gave me a quote for several thousand dollars to fix.  Do I have legal grounds to bring a lawsuit upon the builder? It has been under a year and this problem was brought on strictly due to there not being proper drainage in my lawn. Additionally, as the ground has eroded away, large chunks of concrete have been revealed, alluding to the builder just throwing all sorts of rubbish into the ground in order to build up the level of the yard during construction phase.  Any help will be appreciated."	No
My aunt has sole custody of the kids, the court allows my uncle to speak to the kids when he wants to and vice versa. However he never calls the kids and instead harasses my aunt who put a restraining order against home because he's crazy and abusive.   My uncle is extremely authoritarian and tries to restrict everything he can, currently in divorce with my aunt; he does not allow the kids to speak to my aunt when it's his days or weekends.  He disables their internet on their iPads and blocks all her calls/texts so she never has an idea whether or not the kids are safe. She fears one day the kids may get kidnapped from him and she won't be able to get a hold of them...  I'm concerned for their safety to and am curious, if I buy my cousin a phone and pay for his services per month to be able to keep in touch when needed; is my uncle allowed to confiscate it or place restrictions?   Any help is truly appreciated, thank you!	No
Hi guys, so here is the scenario. I took my car to get a free code scan to an autoshop (Goodyear). They gave a sheet with the codes and gave me the car keys back. When I went to my car, I found the car smashed in. I went inside and asked them what happened. The manager and the employee who drove my car denied the car crash. They said they didn't do anything and it was there already. I called the cops and then the manager made a claim through their company corporate. The manager told me that the company doesn't have its own insurance but it has a third party insurance. The manager told me that the car will be inspected and an estimate of the damage will be calculated. Afterwards the company will either have a body shop fix it or pay the amount for the damage depending who is seen to be at fault. He said that their insurance will be contacting my car insurance. He only said that my car's front bumper is damaged, when in fact i disagreed. The car's bumper is dented in; the grill came off; a part of the undercarriage frame is bent; car takes longer to crank up now. UPDATE: Goodyear's insurance denied the car crash and they denied the claim that was requested by the manager. The Goodyear insurance person said that the damage was not caused by the employees but it might have been one of their customers since they claim to have a footage from a nearby store. Here are the problems that I have with this: 1. This cannot go through my insurance, there are way too many claims (all no fault) on there already. I won't be able to afford a further increase for the car insurance. What can I do if they refuse to reimburse me from their insurance company? Would the next step be to go to small claims court?  2. If I take it to small claims court, how does the process work? and how would i get the amount for the damage the manager said there is and also the damage he said there is not?   3. Should I use these estimates as proof to claim there is more damage than the company agree to?   4. This is what i prefer: I want the company to pay for the damage and I want to fix it myself. Is this possible? What do I do to get them to pay me instead of fixing it through their body shop?  5. What should i do if they claim it through my insurance company? I don't want this  I know this is a long post, I am frustrated and confused. I don't know where to start, please give any information you think is helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read my whole post.	No
"I live in Texas first of all. My 5 year-old son just told me that he ""snuggles"" and sometimes co-sleeps (my language, not his) with his stepfather. He also told me this happens nearly every morning after his mom goes to work and that his stepfather is only wearing underwear while they're under the covers. Apparently, they also watch videos or play games on his phone in this state.  He continued to say that he sleeps between them some nights and his mom is ""totally naked"". I'm more than a little disturbed by all of this. He sleeps in his own bed 100% of the time when he's with me, which is 50/50 on a week on week off basis. Clearly he doesn't ""need"" this.   Where does the law/judges/cps stand on this behavior? It seems like alienation at the very least to me."	No
"State: CA / City: Los Angeles   Hi, I am a tenant of this apartment in LA area which was recently purchased by a new owner/management. For the past 7 years living in this apartment, I've had some great experience with the management and never had any issues with them. But this time, I am frustrated with this new apartment manager who is not willing to give us what we've initially deserved when we first moved into this apartment.   For the past few months, I've asked the manager on duty to provide us an additional parking space to park our newly purchased car. But, before I go ahead and proceed with anything, here is a little bit of a background story. As a tenant who lives in a 2 bed/bathroom unit, we were initially given 2 parking spaces when we first moved into this apartment. However, since we only had one car, the apartment manager, at the time, has asked us if they can spare one of our parking spaces to our neighbors who were in need of an additional space which we gladly let them use it without any compensation. (My parents and the manager, at the time, got along pretty well.) The manager has promised us (verbally) that we would get the space back whenever we would purchase an additional car and now with this new owner/management, they are not willing to give us another space which was something that we've originally had been granted.   I've spoken with the current apartment manager numerous times in regards to this matter and all I get from her is ""That was something that you have dealt with the previous management. There are no more spaces available and I can't give you additional parking lot for whatever reason."" I have friends and neighbors who live in a unit with 2 bed/bathrooms with 2 parking spaces (same apartment) and when I inquired about them having 2 spaces, the current manager said ""It all depends on how many cars you have."" The manager did not even care to say they would try or would get us a space when something becomes available and our family is very frustrated with this parking situation now. My little brother has been finding parking spaces on the street late at night after his work, walking great deal of a distance, after finding a space blocks away.   From the contract of ours with the apartment, the only section that mentions parking states: ***""Subject to the provisions of this Lease, the Tenant is entitled to the use of parking (the 'Parking') on or about the Premises. Only properly insured motor vehicles may be parked in the Tenant's space.""*** (As it doesn't specify how many parking spaces can be used, I don't know if I can use this statement to back up our request.)   I am about to write a formal request letter to the HQ of the management and try to explain the frustration of the current situation.   Are there anything that I can do to get our initially given space back?   Add: The previous manager who we dealt with has fled back to his country and is no longer available."	No
"I've recently made an offer on a home.  In the listing for this home, there was no mention of a solar panel system installed and I didn't even realize it had solar until the following morning when I was looking at the photos of the house.  I made an offer that stated the panels were to stay with the home.  I received a counter offer stating the solar panels would not be included in the sale of the home.  Since I didn't even know it had solar, and I loved the house, I accepted this contingent on the panels being professional removed and the roof repaired as needed.  Today my realtor, at my request, contacted the seller's realtor to ask about a timeline for this, as I'm going to have to get a 2nd follow up inspection to make sure the work was done correctly.  My concern is that we are only 4-6 weeks from closing and being in the construction business...I know how busy everyone in town is.  I don't see how he's going to get the work done in time.  Their reply was asking if I, the buyer, might be interesting in taking over the payments for the solar system at $70 a month.  That is all the information they provided.  I've requested more information as far as what the amount owed is, how much the savings is per month on the utility bill, what is the APR, warranty, etc.  So, I have some questions assuming I said no.  Does he have an avenue to back out of the offer or is he committed to either removing the panels or leaving them and eating the cost.  I'm also assuming he received a tax credit for the installation, which makes me wonder if he's even allowed to move the panels to his new home (I assume that was his plan).  My biggest question is regarding the wording of the counter offer.  They specifically stated       5. Per section 2.5.1: Solar Panels WILL NOT be included in the sale of this property. The wording states solar panels and nothing about the electrical system that goes with the panels.  Am I splitting hairs or do I legally have a right to any electrical, inverters, batteries, etc or would that logically be part of ""solar panels"".  I love the house and don't want to do anything that would prevent us from getting it.  I'm just wondering about my options as this is a situation I am not familiar with.  Thanks r/legadvice!"	No
Hello, Sorry if this is in the wrong location and hopefully its not too long winded.  I recently purchased a condo in Mid June in St. Louis County Missouri.  I was aware from the previous owner that our decks were being replaced by the Condo Association sometime this summer.  I received A letter approximately 2 weeks ago which states the following:  &gt;Dear Homeowners, &gt;The Board of Directors would like to notify everyone in Buildings *** and *** that the deck replacement will begin Monday, August 7, 2017, weather permitting.  We ask that everything be removed and stored inside your unit during this time.  Thank you in advance for your patience as we complete this building improvement.  If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact our office.  My deck was taken off on the 7th (though is not yet complete).  When I was speaking with my neighbor they informed me that the last time the decks were replaced they were required to pay for the top boards and the price would be ~300 - $500.  Should this be true, I never received any information on any replacement cost either from the previous owner (whom I have spoken with and they were unaware of the cost) nor in written / verbal form in the information that I was provided from the condo association when I moved in.    My question is, do I have to pay for this?  What course of action do I have for this as its an unexpected cost that I could pay for but I'd rather not if I don't have to.    Thanks for reading!	No
My plan is getting cut off in a few weeks. I have ordered a brace that is covered by my insurance due to an injury, however it might take around a month to arrive. In order for it to be covered, the pickup date must be before the date my policy ends. The admin person at the medical office told me that if necessary, she can change the pickup date on the receipt to ensure that I can successfully file it to be claimed if my brace arrives at the office past the policy end date.   I asked him if it was OK , he said no problem. I don't want to commit fraud. Is this considered fraud and how likely would it be that I get caught?	No

"CA/Alameda county/Bay Area So long story short, I am posting for my brother. He is getting a divorce and she won't leave until he signs a paper saying he kicked her out with is untrue. A little backstory: they got together when she was in high school and then had a baby so never finished high school until some time later. fast forwarding, they got married and had kid number 2. They have been living together for quite some time but obviously unhappy. I mean I'm not rude or anything but she's a 2 and he's like a 7 at least right so how they got together is still a big question.....anyways the point is she's stuck in her high school mentality or something, never grew up. When they got together she became a ""housewife"" because she has no job and doesn't do anything with her life. She sits at her house watching netflix all day/facebooking all day. Her kids are usually dirty, her house is always a mess. Literally her dishes would be piled in her sink and she would leave them there for weeks! The house would smell like sewer because if the rotten food on the stove! Half of her food in the fridge was always decomposing!The kids clothes are small and not to mention the kids clothes smell rotten because she washes them and then dries them days later. Im pretty sure they shower every other week too! Now my brother works graveyard shifts all the time. He comes home and wants a hot meal and a clean home and clean kids! but no. So of course he would be unhappy! mind you she can go to the store anytime she wants she has a joint debit card with him. Theres so much to this story but i guess thats the basics. Now. I wanna know what can he do incase she tries him in court. I mean he brings in all the money, he provides for them and she's a stay at home mom. never had a job before and doesn't even clean or do anything at home. She wants to get full custody of the children. She wants him to sign a paper saying my brother kicked her out so she can pull it up in court. He told her if she wants to leave the door is open, but he will not continue to pay her phone, bills, buy her stuff , etc. I think she's crazy and honestly i don't know how they have lasted years of marriage, its been around 10 years. OH! and they have a new house together and of course the house is not paid off yet so its legally not theirs yet but i also am curious about the home. Someone please tell me what could happen and whats the best way to go and etc. Thanks!!"	No

"Hello /r/legaladvice   This may be a bit long, but this is very important to me and I can't really afford an attorney and time is of the essence.   When I was 18 I was sentenced to a 5 year term of probation, with 4 years DOC on an SIS back in 2007 for Felony Theft (Class C) and Attempting to Steal by Deceit (Class D), I was ordered to pay restitution and court costs in both cases totaling almost $5k.   Fast forward to 2011 and I had moved from Missouri to Wyoming as I had been struggling to find any work at all in Missouri, I had hoped it would get better right? 2 Felonies and a shitty economy made things rough, Anyhow, I managed to find temp work, nothing steady and come June 2011 a Probation Violation was filed and a warrant issued out of Missouri for Failure to Pay restitution and court costs, I was arrested and spent 30 days in county jail in Wyoming before being extradited (Another $600 in costs added to total) back to Missouri for a hearing.   The court revoked my SIS, Sentenced me to an additional 5 years probation on a SES and told me I could NOT go back to Wyoming, So I had essentially been uprooted, lost all of my belongings and was homeless from the start of my new probation term.  -----  Still unable to find jobs, I decided to try my hand at getting my CDL and truck driving, well the trucking industry turns out is not very felony friendly either!  I managed to lock down a shitty job making just above minimum wage and struggled to pay my bills let alone any court costs, I managed to pay about $500 total over 2 years.  2014 Rolls around and I guess I had been earning a ""Earned Compliance Credit"" for being good with 0 violations of my probation and my Probation was set to end early due to that, And here came another Probation Violation, For failure to pay Restitution and Fines, Court revoked my ECC and ordered me to an additional year of probation making it end on July 11th, 2017.  Fast forward a few years, I finally landed a decent job last year, Finally was able to save up some money, paid over half of my Restitution and Court costs, Now I have a probation violation AGAIN for Failure to pay, and they have issued a Warrant for my Arrest, This has all happened in the last 8 days, My Probation was set to expire 7/11/2017 (TODAY) but I have A warrant and a Violation filed against me so that won't happen.  -----  So here I sit, zero legal knowledge, and using google,  I managed to find multiple cases in Missouri from the Supreme court which are quite similar to mine, Defendants Probations revoked due to being indigent, and then over ruled by the supreme court as it violated the 14th Amendment to Equal Protection.  One part of particular interest to me is in one of the cases, The Missouri Supreme Court ruled that Earned Compliance Credits could not be suspended or revoked merely because a person was indigent and unable to pay, while those who were affulent would still be able to earn them because they don't face the same hardships. [Found on Page 15](https://www.courts.mo.gov/file.jsp?id=99059)  But yet during a period of numerous hardships, The judge revoked my ECC and ordered me additional terms of probation?  [Also to the fact, Missouri's very own statute on Probation terms says that Felony probation can not exceed a TOTAL of 6 years including a 1 year extension](http://revisor.mo.gov/main/OneSection.aspx?section=559.016&amp;bid=29097&amp;hl=) But yet I have been on probation for 10 years now?  [Missouri is trying to amend its Earned Compliance Credits to include a new area saying that Probationers can not be released if they still owe restitution](http://house.mo.gov/billtracking/bills171/hlrbillspdf/1343H.01I.pdf)  [However that has not been passed, and is not in effect yet](https://legiscan.com/MO/bill/HB595/2017).  What are my Options right now? Have I been seriously screwed over by the judicial system by them not only extending my probation an additional 5 years on top of the first 5, but by the Judge suspending my ECC under false grounds? If my ECC would not have been suspended I would have been released from probation in 2014... Making my current situation irrelevant.  I honestly feel cheated by the system for being indigent most of my life, and I really need some guidance!  Thanks a ton, itzathrowaway"	No

It seems that adult life has been set up in a way that makes things kind of complicated if you're trying to make financial decisions with someone who you are not married with. Some of the benefits of marriage include:  - Your spouse can make your medical decisions hassle free - If you're married your spouse can get health insurance through your job and you get the family rate if it's offered - Family leave is an option when you're married - Making big purchases is simpler  There seems to be so many benefits but I have no interest in getting married. Are there legal ways to get some of these benefits without getting married?   Location: Fl, US  Thanks reddit.	No
I'm moving to Atlanta, GA with my wife. We used an apartment locator service where they look for apartments within your budget and with your preferred specifics (floors, size, location, etc.)  I was given a quote for an apartment for $1150 per month. I applied, was charged the $300 application fee, and now the apartment is saying the apartment is actually $1250 per month instead.  I have saved documentation from the apartment locator service, my application states the correct apartment and price, and I had phone conversation with the lady at the front desk about the apartment and the correct price.  Essentially, if I stay, I have to get a different apartment that doesn't fit our needs, I have to pay an extra $100 per month for the one I actually want, or I'll end up forfeiting the application fee for nothing.  I've been in touch with the apartment staff. They won't budge.  Any advice?	No
Hello LA, My girlfriend has been really upset by this recent turn of events. Her sister has a criminal background and has been in prison before. Likely, to avoid showing up again for warrants, she used her sisters name (my GF) to avoid a Jay Walking Ticket. Afterwards, she has been placed back in prison for a burglery charge and is currently serving time.  The issue is my GF received the $551 ticket from the tax recovery service because penalties have been acruing since my GF hasn't been served notice of the ticket because the wrong address was used when the Jay Walking citation was issued. How can one get the charges and penalties be taken out of my GF's name and her credit ratings restored? Thank you for any help.	No
"This is quite a long one.  Please excuse poor grammar. So 5 years ago I started custody on my son.  At the time he was 8.  While this started his mother refused to go to any court dates till she was handed with a contempt of court months later.  So during the next 2 years there were over 100 days of missed parenting time.  Our judge had enough of us constantly being in front of him.  None of this was due to me.  I had always done everything that was asked of me.  During this time his mother was charged with 7 drug felonies. She was allowed to use a 7411. Which means if she successfully completed her terms. That she would be charged with possession of non-narcotic.  During this time she had moved 90 miles away. And we had to meet half way which she despised doing.  Ok so now this is where the story picks up.  So on a Tuesday before my weekend I get a call from CPS.  I tell them that I will inform my lawyer and we will meet.  I work nights so mother goes to pick my son up.  The next day I ask my son what CPS was in regards to. And he says ""none of your business"".  Me and my son were really close prior to me starting custody.   We spent time together when she wanted a babysitter.  So we go to my parents house.  I tell him that he can go sot at his desk. For being disrespectful to his grandmother the weekend prior and me just then.  He wanted to get up so I tell him that he could write a report that his school was offering for extra credit.  He chose not to so I told him to continue to sit.  He was allowed to get up but I told him no TV.  He ends up watching TV with my father.  I tell him to sit back down he says no and what are you going to do about it.  I get up and I pit my hand on his ear and he walks in front of me and sits down.  Say an hour passes and I tell him he is done being punished.  We watch some soccer and go about our day.  Next day we all go to see Ghostbusters.  He has a younger brother and my ex's son who I raised since he was 1.  After we go to my house and they all play and go to the park.  We drop him off later that day.  So on the following Thursday I get a call from a detective and am told I am being accused of breaking my sons arm.  So when he was age 6 &amp; 7.  He had broke his arm in the same spot.  Now that January he had broke it for 3rd time throwing a dodgeball at school.  I call my lawyer.  And he says normally I would say not to talk to them but in your case we should.  We go and meet with him and tells me the allegations. The story was that  got mad at him and dragged him from one room to the other and threw him into the wall rebreaking his arm.  There are no accessible walls in the room.  Running a pornographic household.   For having a sex talk with a 13 &amp;12 year old.  Showing a Playboy and having a serious talk with them.  Both mother's had agreed and known about prior to use sitting down.  And then of course my wet preserved specimens were brought up.  Oh and I did this when CPS already had a investigation from her call the week prior. So during all this my children have been interviewed multiple time prior.  I have never hit my children.  I dont even yell at them.  So I go to court and I end up losing custody of my son.  If more back story is need on why I will provide.  But basically my court appointed lawyer set it for a bench trial.  And I was deemed unfit.  I did switch to my regular lawyer but the deck was already stacked. So during this time about 3 months later.  I find out I am being criminally prosecuted.   I get depressed about everything and stop going to work and make some overall bad choices.  One was having sex and getting a woman pregnant.   My youngest son was 9 and I had no plans on having any other children.   Well this woman is an addict.  While pregnant she was taking pills.  She goes to jail and then rehab then to methadone clinic then back to jail. All in her 1st 6 months.  So the baby is born. He maconian comes back positive for opiates.  CPS is involved. They find no reason to continue since she had a prescription for her last pregnancy.   Which was like 5 years prior.  Oh yea she signed rights away to her first son to her mother.  And gave her 2nd son up for adoption.  So CPS tells her that if she lives with me that they will be involved and want them out of my home.  So I still see my daughter when the mother would come over.  Till I ask for some things she took from the home.  I had bought everything for our daughter but was for the home.  The mother was essentially couch bouncing with our daughter. We stop having physical contact after this fight as she wasnt welcome in my home.  Over the course of her firat 16 months CPS had been involved 4 times.  One alleged incident involved her boyfriend shaking the baby.  These were always dismissed regardless of my concerns.   When we go for custody.   She received sole legal custody and I was denied parenting time.  I was also denied parenting time for my son. The reason was alleged abuse.  Even though the criminal charges were dismissed against me.  So last week CPS gets ahold of me and tells me the new case.  That the house she lives at is selling drugs.  Unknown number of people living there.  She smoked weed at 630 and at 1030 was in a single car rollover. 300ft of skid mark.  She was taken to jail for dui, driving suspended and child endangerment.  So today when I called they told me that our daughter was placed with her mother.  They are petitioning to remove custody from her and place her with the grandmother.  I have fought for my children endlessly. And continue to be disregarded.  Do I have any options?"	No
So I got a DUI in Louisiana. They issued me a temp license. I have not had my first court date, so I'm not actually convicted (I'm assuming). I have since moved to Arkansas. Can I get a driver's license here before my court date?	No
My neighbor is looking to build a fence between our properties.  I'll preface this by saying we don't know exactly where the property line is located.  I discovered though speaking with the fencing contractor (when they were doing an initial site visit) that my neighbors had lied about me giving them consent to build the fence directly on our property line.  I made it clear to the fencing contractor that I had not given consent to do so and that I wanted my neighbor to have the property surveyed so that the fence would be built entirely on their property.  I am weary (since my neighbor already lied once) that they may tell the fencing contractor that I have given consent for the fence to be built on our property line and go ahead with it when I'm not home.  If the fence is built without the property being surveyed is the onus on me to prove where the property line is located so that I can take appropriate legal action with the municipality?  Are there any other precautions I should take to ensure I am protected legally? 	No
I was contacted today by xcel energy to pay an over due bill of $166 but I moved in with my girlfriend on June 1st and the account is under her name. I talked to a representative and he said it was for an address that I lived in over two years ago and that it's been coming out from my account. He's sending me a print out showing I've been paying for both. Upon moving into each of my apartments (all in Wisconsin) I've filled out a transfer of service form as part of the lease signing. Am I completely screwed out of this money or is there hope I could get reimbursed from one of the landlord companies or xcel themselves? Thanks For any an all advice on where to go from here!  	No

"Currently renting at an apartment community in GA. I've been here for a couple years and every year they send out a renewal offer each year. Well, i've been trying to get them to send the lease over so I can lock in my renewal rate for another year (we lucked out and pay MUCH less than any of our neighbors). The staff in the office has changed a lot over the years and I'm worried someone new will come in and really jack up our rent. We received a written renewal offer on the company letterhead stating our renewal rate for 2017-2018 with absolutely no expiration date or stipulations (i.e. offer is void if presented with future offers). Would they have to honor this since it's in writing? We've been calling and going into the office in person and keep getting the old ""we'll get to it"". Starting to get very nervous. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!!!!"	No
**TL;DR:** Should I go to court over a 1110(a) violation based on the defense that I am an out of town and not regular NYC driver and the sign was not visible to me? Or take the 2 points and pay the fine?  **My problem:**  I received a traffic ticket for violation of 1110(a) (2 points) in November 2015 in Brooklyn. All I can read on the ticket is: Disobeyed...traffic...device. I had an initial court date of September 2017. I was unable to attend, and it was rescheduled to 5/2017. Then, I got a letter in the mail that it was now 8/2017.   I wanted to know my best approach. I am not sure what details matter so I included as many as I could remember.  **Background:**  I turned right after another car on a busy intersection at a green after sitting and waiting for pedestrians to clear. After I completed the turn, I was pulled over (the other car wasn't).  It was a no right turn intersection. I am not a regular city driver. And I had never seen this sign. It was new to me. I am trying to find out the date of install. At the time, it was blocked by a truck, and I was behind a big truck. I followed another car and turned right. The cop was aggressive with me and implied he could do more than ticket me which I felt to be arrest, and I did not challenge him beyond an inquiry.   At the time, I was back and forth in NY and did not drive in state, and I had an out of state license. Now I live in NY, and I have not got a NY license yet because I don't drive and didn't have a SS card and enough ID points (I do have a NYC ID card). Now I have both, and I am not sure if I should retain my out of state license for point reasons or get a NY license this week. This is my first ticket on this license (had a license at 16, let it lapse when I stopped driving, retook the driver's test in my 20s).  **Questions:**  1. Is it worth fighting this ticket on this basis? Or should I just pay the fine?  2. Do I need an attorney?  3. If not, how will this hearing go? What should I be prepared for? This is all new to me.  4. Should I get a NY license (and won't be driving) or will the outcome affect my new license? Or keep the out of state until the court date?  **Secondary questions:**  1. I can find a database about parking signs but not traffic signs. Any idea I can find when a traffic regulation began at a particular intersection?  2. My new hearing time is at 4:30 in the afternoon. Is this typical? The TVB closes at 4:00. I have an evening class, and I wondered how long I could expect to be there.  3. If I go to DMV and request a new date, are they likely to give me one with school conflict?  4. Why would the DMV change the hearing date on their end?  Thank you for any and all help. I appreciate any insight. I have no idea what to do or expect. Have a great week.	No
"I'm trying to find a job so I can afford to leave an unhealthy marriage. My immature husband cannot handle this like an adult and is now telling me that if I'm not gone (from our apartment) in a week, he's going to call lawyers and the authorities. Because he makes 90% of our household income and pays rent etc. he feels he has the legal hand and that he can kick me out because I'm a ""squatter"" who is ""taking advantage of him"". Both our names are on the lease. I give him money monthly (we have separate bank accounts) to contribute to expenses but it isn't much. Is there any legal authority he can take with regards to living space?"	No
She told us 'we'll prorate the cost to replace the carpet in your old place'   I've spent plenty of time here in legaladvice, so I'm pretty sure they can't make us pay to replace it after such a short period of time. It's not in bad condition, it just needs a good professional cleaning. We're transferring units inside the complex in the next couple weeks and I think it's pretty shitty and wasteful of them to make us pay for perfectly good carpet.	No
"The flooring in my apartment is laminate/wood and there is an area that has either a stain or been stripped such that I cannot get it clean. My landlord wants to replace the panels and charge me $600-800. I would like to do the work myself and pay for materials only, but she said she is not comfortable with that and requires a professional. My main question is, does she have that right, or do I have the right to fix it myself?  Possibly relevant: I honestly have no idea what this stain is from. It looks like something spilled and then dribbled towards the middle of the room, but I am certain I didn't spill anything there and the ""dribbled"" part grew over several months (no I didn't tell my landlord when I first saw it, yes, I know I should have). My fiancé (also lives in this apartment) thinks maybe there is damage from underneath, but not sure how we would prove that and if it would still be our fault anyway.  Thanks in advance for your advice."	No
I got a speeding ticket about a week ago in Florida. Not my county but next over. Its only $131 and I just want to pay it and get it done with. I called and the lady said give it a few days and told me to check again and I did and its still not there. They use a 3rd party ncourts for payments. They have no record nor the county clerks office! Don't they have to make it available for me to pay? What are my options here? Should I challenge it? I dont mind paying I just need it taken care off to not worry. What should I do, and the officer also did not mention anything about points on my licence, is was doing 79 in a 70. He followed me for 25 min through another county until I entered his just to nail me.	No
Is there any ways I can fight this in court? They didnt find any actual pot but the pipe itself was dirty. Does that actually count as possession of marijuana in virginia? And if I Wasnt distributing the bowl to anyone and only had it for personal use, what would the correct charge and penalty be? Having trouble finding this information online.  I was given Asap and a 500$ fine but if theres any way I can get this reverted to a different charge and a lesser fine that would be really helpful.	No
Well, it's been a busy day and it's barely 8:30. Christ.  Yesterday afternoon, after I made my post (which admittedly helped calm my rage just posting it), I called her gynecologist. (I have uterine issues so I got her a gyno to get checked for them once she started her period.)   She was very understanding, and offered to stay late if I wanted to bring my daughter in that evening. So, I called the police, let them know I was taking her to an appointment at her gyno that evening as well, so we could coordinate.  My daughter was a bit hesitant to go see the doctor, but understood when I explained that we needed to make sure she wasn't pregnant and didn't have any damage that went uncared for because her father refused to get her medical attention.   The doctor said she's physically fine, pending the results of the STI tests, and she asked to be put on birth control for peace of mind. Though I know this is traumatic for her, and her father's family is a bunch of goddamn nutjobs, I'm glad they didn't get into her head enough that she'd be afraid to ask for that kind of protection.  After the doctor's appointment, we went home and ordered pizza, and a detective arrived around 8pm. He sat down with my daughter in our living room, while I hung out in my office, after making sure she was okay being alone with him. (didn't want her to not tell him something for fear I'd hear it.)  The detective told me before he left that this is a serious matter, and he'd be contacting me with information about anyone in Maine I needed to speak to. I made a few copies of the letter, and scanned it in, then gave him the original and emailed him a digital copy. He left a big folder with a bunch of victim advocacy groups' information in it. He also told me to get a restraining order for her against her father's family.   After he left, we sat down and set up her new cell phone, and she went on Facebook and blocked her father's family, as they had started posting victim-blamey bullshit to her wall. Within an hour my phone was ringing, with my ex demanding that I make our daughter unblock him since apparently he's decided he has a right to be on her facebook. I told him to only contact me through my attorney, and hung up.   This morning, I got a call back from my attorney, even though he's on vacation. His assistant heard my message and contacted him about it, since it seemed more pressing than most other matters, and he called me to reassure me that he will handle it, and since we divorced in CA, the custody arrangement is in CA, and it will be amended in CA (since CA is her state of residency), and in CA they take a real dim view of this kind of shit. He also told me at 14 no judge he knows of would tell her she HAD to go visit her father, much less in this situation.   I have an appointment for her with a trauma counselor the detective recommended this afternoon, and took the day off work so that I could help her as needed. Right now she's mostly been playing World of Warcraft and eating junk food, but I feel like at least right now I'm not going to tell her when she needs to go to bed or police her health choices.  I want to thank you all for your excellent advice and support. I will do my best to keep you updated as the situation unfolds, but my conversation with the detective and my attorney leads me to believe that while the custody amendment will not take too long, the criminal proceedings may take longer, as they are complicated by the fact the victim lives in one state and the crime occurred in a different state.	No
I was wondering if I gave up parental rights if I still had to pay child support in Arkansas? 	No
"First time asking for legal advice, so forgive me if this is maybe the wrong place?  Firstly im 24, living in Michigan. I was adopted privately when I was 2, after being removed from my birth mother's home for child endangerment.   Now, my adopted parents and I are estranged. My birth mom is actually deceased, she died in 06' and I have no idea who my birth father is as my parents have denied me access to my adoption file. My birth father also walked away when my birth mom got pregnant.   I'm wondering if its possible to legally unadopt myself? I identity with my birth name, my birth family  (who I found and am in contact with). I'm currently married so this wouldn't even effect my current last name, only what my legal ""maiden"" name is. Personally I want to be as completely removed from my adopted ""family"" as you can be. My adopted brother basically gives no fucks about his parents and I know for a fact I will be saddled with any sort of care for them, funeral costs etc if something happens. They are not my parents and I want to be untangled with them.  Is there any way to do this?"	No
Hi, Here's a quick timeline of what went down: June: House is listed for sale- we make a cash offer within 3 days. The seller accepts our offer. We go through with various inspections to get through all the contingencies set forth in our contract.   After a few weeks we find out that there's an issue with the title- the seller's husband had died a year ago and they were both still on the title. Apparently they never got his assets taken care of/divided? They go to probate court in CT, and it's listed in the court's case-lookup as about 3 weeks after the initial listing and about 2 weeks after the accepted offer.   According to the seller's attorney, they expected the probate court process to take 4-6 weeks. I don't believe it because I haven't seen a single instance of anyone's probate court matter being that expedited. Moreover, since the probate court has the case listed at the end of June, and it's already almost mid-August, that timeframe isn't correct.  Our contract has it outlined that if by November they don't have the matter resolved, we can walk away from the purchase.   My question is whether or not there's anything legally wrong with what either the seller, or the seller's listing agent did in this matter. It seems a little strange to me that a listing agent would accept selling a house without proper proof of ownership. I understand that sellers can being a sale during probate, but have found nothing regarding what happens if they put it up for sale before going to probate. It seems excessively misleading to do this- as we expected to have a standard closing timeframe, well within weeks and not within 12 to 18 months.  At this point, we'd be lucky to have the probate court ready by next July.  Any ideas/input? Thanks	No
Moved out of room at the end of June after a 3 month sublease from the Master Tenant of this house.  Him and GF were having some problems and I wanted no part of it.  I tell them I will be leaving at the end of the lease after month 1, month 2 - the GF moves out.  A month later as I'm packing up the last of my stuff, he says he doesn't have the money to pay me my deposit, yet this guy was receiving a steady stream of packages in the mail everyday since the GF moved out.  He gives me a letter stating that I am owed the full amount of my $500 deposit and will work to get it to me in the CA regulated amount of time - 21 days.  Those days go by, no answer, sent him demand letter, no reply.  So how do I go about actually filing small claims court?  Should I get a lawyer as it stated in my generic demand letter I got off the internet?  This was in San Jose if that helps.	No
"Thanks in advance for any help.   My lease ended on May 25th and my landlord has yet to contact us about our security deposit. I'm listed as the agent on the lease and emailed her the day we moved out with my mailing address and a reminder that I was the tenant that would be receiving the deposit.  I read the Maryland statute that says the following ""If the landlord, without a reasonable basis, fails to return any part of the security deposit, plus accrued interest, within 45 days after the termination of the tenancy, the tenant has an action of up to threefold of the withheld amount, plus reasonable attorney’s fees.""  Today is the 45th day and I still have not heard from my landlord. How exactly should I proceed? The security deposit was a little under $10,000 and suing her for $30,000 seems somewhat unreasonable but is that what we're entitled to under the statute? At what point should I contact an attorney? Should I reach out to her directly again?"	No
Someone filmed me having sex through my window. My university conducted interviews to get more information, and I have the transcripts from those interviews which pretty clearly point to who was responsible for taking the video. Is there any action I can take against that person? Can I take action against the people who viewed the video and didn't report it? Should I take it to the police? Does it matter that I don't have access to the video?	No
I live in a [Mitchell-Lama](http://www1.nyc.gov/site/hpd/renters/mitchell-lama-rentals.page) co-op.  I moved from a 2 bedroom to a 3 bedroom in 2011.  They never transferred billing of my garage fee to my new apt.  I wrote the management company &amp; CC'ed the President of the Board telling them to do so.  They didn't.  I figured screw them, I did my duty, I informed them, they ignored me.  I wash my hands of the situation.    Now 6 years later they're sending me a bill for six years of monthly fees.  My question is...do I have to pay?  Is there any kind of statute of limitations?  It is after all their job to bill me.  Their screw up, not mine.       PS:  Just so nobody thinks I'm that bad a guy...  After all, why shouldn't I pay for my garage space...  This was an incompetent, possibly corrupt Board with an utterly incompetent &amp; almost certainly corrupt management company.  They were already fighting with me on other issues.  So I felt justified not paying, if they're too incompetent to bill me, even after I brought the situation to their attention.	No
Long story but here is the short version.  17 year old boy has been paying most of his families bills.   Mom suffers from such bad anxiety, depression, and on and off prescription abuse.  She makes him leave school/work because she wants him to take care of her.    He has younger siblings and step father but mom tells him and treats him as if he is the only one who can provide and care for her.    He made a 35 on his sat the first time he took it, top student in his class and is being recruited by Yale.   Since he will graduate at 17 mom is making it very difficult for him to attend college.  She wants him to stay with her and drive to a school close.   He got sick of everything and asked us to take him to a lawyer to get emancipated.   Lawyer said it would take too long and to seek guardianship.  We've known him since he was in kindergarten, he is friends with our daughter and was best friends with our son until our son passed away.  Anyway child welfare was called and refused to intervene because basic needs were being met. What are the odds we can get guardianship of him?	No
Hello. My father passed away a couple of months ago. He didn't leave much in the way of assets, but he did have a 401k with a little over $52k in it.   My siblings and I weren't close with him, he wasn't a nice guy. My mother wants no part of anything to do with him.  So, I met with a local estate lawyer who was willing to handle everything, but he wanted a $3000 payment up front that would cover all costs associated. He said that if we were to put it on a credit card, we could get money out of the estate that he would be opening in order to pay it off before the next payment is due. My siblings and I, being young, don't have access to that amount of capital up front, and with my mother not wanting to get involved, I don't know what to do.   So here are my questions: 1. Does this seem to be a fair rate for setting up an estate and handling all of the probate stuff 2. Are there any services that you're aware of that could pay the money up front for a fee, that we could pay back quickly from the estate 3. Is this something I could handle myself 4. Am I running out of time to do this  One of my siblings and I are adults, just young and in school. We don't want to miss out on this money, the only good thing our dad has ever really done for us as far as we are concerned. He listed no beneficiaries on his 401k and had no will. This is taking place in Michigan, and the lawyer came highly recommended by my mentor in the local chamber of commerce.  Thank you so much for your time.	No
I'm subletting in NYC. The original lease has the following conditions for landlord entry for inspection for showings to future tenants:  Any time between 9am and 8pm, 7 days of the week.  However, [this website](http://streeteasy.com/guides/renters-guide/can-your-landlord-enter-your-apartment-at-any-time/) claims this is in contradiction with NYC tenant/landlord regulations (I haven't verified by searching legal text): **9am to 5pm only, and Monday to Friday only, except holidays.**  1. Where / how can I verify the regulations?  2. Which trumps which?  3. What should I do?	No
I own a VW that is part of the whole Dieselgate scandal. I have not yet received any compensation from the lawsuit.  I was hit by someone running a red light. Although I live in a 'no-fault' state, he was ticketed for running the red light as there were three witnesses to the accident. Insurance is saying that their preliminary evaluation is a total loss on my vehicle.  My question is what to do to fight for proper valuation of my car. Dieselgate caused the value to drop- am I going to get screwed by the reckless behavior of VW execs? I owe more than KBB is saying it is worth.  I'm also told that I don't have rental coverage through my policy (made sense at the time due to access to another vehicle), but the officer told me I can get it through his policy? Is this true?  Getting a full medical work up now. Have had a lingering headache and low back pain.  Thanks in advance for your time and advice- I've never been in an accident before, so this is all new to me!	No
"Hi r/legaladvice  I have a 1 year lease from August 27, 2016 to August 31, 2017. I can't find a single mention in the lease about procedures for terminating the lease at the end of the initial term. There is a section about ending the lease in a holdover, periodic tenancy period, such as month to month, which states that written notice of intention to vacate must be given and the lease will then be over at the end of the second complete month after notice.   I emailed my building manager and the company leasing person on June 21 stating my intention to vacate at the end of the lease, August 31. They acknowledge my message and sent me a company specific ""notice of intention to vacate"" form to complete and return. I returned the form on July 7 (no excuses, I forgot for a while), and the leasing agent now says I am responsible for an additional months rent in September because I gave late notice within 60 days of my desired move-out. However, this was not a periodic tenancy that this rule might apply to, I did give written notice prior to 60 days anyway in the form of my email, and the lease made no mention of it needing to be given via their own specific form.  In short, I believe they are now making up rules or trying to stretch and apply ones that shouldn't be relevant to get an extra months rent out of me when they have no legal or reasonable grounds for doing so. Any thoughts on how best to proceed in a way they'll take seriously and back off of these demands?  Thanks!"	No
"Hello all. So I signed a lease to a place in June. This is the first apartment I've lived in on my own, which is something I've saved up for for years. About a week later, the broker calls to tell me the owner wants to sell. After two months of having strangers walking through my home, it gets sold.  During the inspection, one of the buyers asked if I would be willing to take on a roommate and allow them to do interior renovations if they reduced my rent. I politely refused, as I've lived with roommates my entire adult life, and frankly the apartment is affordable for me as it is. After this inspection/proposal, I overhear them talking outside my window talking about getting permits. Keep in mind, I had no idea any of this was going to happen when I signed the lease in late May. To say I feel taken advantage of is an understatement.  So anyway, what are my rights in this situation? I know tenants have a right to ""quiet enjoyment"" of a property. These wouldn't be repairs, but rather it sounds like they'd be building walls and overhauling the bathroom and kitchen to up the value of the house. As far as I'm concerned, everything is fine the way it is. I can only assume my lease won't be renewed in May 2018, but I'm worried if they'd be legally allowed to do all of these interior renovations against my will.  I'm pretty upset about this whole ordeal. I've been dreaming of my own place for so long and it's turned into a nightmare. I was just hoping for some good news.  Thanks so much in advance."	No
My rent is $1200 a month. I recently requested the apartment install a washer and dryer in my unit, which according to them, is $40 a month added to rent. It took them a month to get the washer and dryer installed, and I ever signed a new lease or any paperwork indicating that I agree to pay for the washer and dryer. The last rent bill included the cost for the washer and dryer. Can they arbitrarily increase the billable amount of my rent without me ever signing anything agreeing to pay for it? I get that I requested the washer and dryer, but they forgot to send me a new lease to sign (their mistake, not mine).	No
"I am a resident of Massachusetts. I am going on a vacation to Utah. I am planning to rent a vehicle in Utah for personal use for the duration of my holiday. My insurance company is Arbella and I have comprehensive coverage from them on my car. I called and explained to them about my plan. I asked them that if I rent a car and decline all insurance coverages offered by the rental company, would Arbella cover all the damages as listed in my policy document in case I do happen to get into an accident while operating the rental vehicle. They ""said"" that the insurance will cover the liability and the rental vehicle but did not send me a written confirmation. I am wondering if it is necessary to get this in writing from them that they are going to cover the damages in case of an accident. Is this a standard thing nationwide to use personal-car insurance on the retal vehicle? Is verbal confirmation from Arbella enough regarding this matter? Can you please guide me how to proceed in this regard?  Thanks in advance"	No
Parents of biological child mentioned were not  married, but the father abused his biological child's 10yo autistic half sibling (but not the neurotypical  biological child, toddler) and there is proof (yelling in face, cursing, pushing in video, sounds of hitting heard in another room but not seen on video, child heard/seen screaming, beung pushed around while naked because of bm accident, obviously traumatized in video) but no charges filed at the time of incident. Mom reported 1.5 years later when finally got courage to leave relationship (d.v.p.o).  Because of the evidence of abuse to the biologocal child's half-sibling, what are the chances of termination of father's rights to the biological child?	No
My landlord, Ben Leeds, refused my August rent check on the first because of a 'violation'. They are now demanding the check be made out as a certified check (CC or Money Order), and it must now include a $75 late fee. My first thought is 'is this legal?'  Here's the context: I have been living in an apartment complex since 9/14. Ben Leeds took ownership of the building in the spring of 2017 (March or April) and had us sign a new lease. We have documents stating that they will send us a copy. We have not yet received a copy at this time.   On 7/25 we received a notice that a vehicle parked in our space is in violation of their policy (the car was a gift to us from a friend, but we had not yet gotten the title transferred. It had been in the space since prior to Leeds taking the property). The notice stated we had 3 days to become compliant before Leeds would take action.  That evening I sent an email to our manager asking for an extension on the deadline, as I thought it would take longer than 3 days to become compliant.   5 days later, on 8/1, I received an email back saying this request was denied. They would be inspecting on 8/7 and would take necessary action if found not in compliance.   Later that same day, I saw they had returned the rent check. When asked, the manager said she was instructed not to take it. When asked why, she indicated it had something to do with the violation, and that they would be demanding the late fee once the check finally could be submitted.   The car was subsequently towed and no longer occupies the space.   I waited until today (8/8) before reaching out to the manager. I did not get word on the verdict of the inspection. She responded that she saw the car was removed and asked when I'd be submitting the rent check, to include the $75. I informed her it would have to wait until I returned from work tomorrow.   So first, can a landlord even do this? Refuse a rent check then demand a late fee? Second, if so, does the manager (or 'upper management' who apparently responsible in denying the request for an extension) have a duty to communicate their decision in a timely manner?  Third, does the fact that they have not sent us a copy of our lease make any difference here? Ultimately, do I have any recourse?	No
Long story short.. divorced 2 yrs. minor child lives with me alone. No contact from ex in over 2 yrs. he has recently started emailing me asking for pictures of child. My Atty advised I should send. He has increased requests to every month and now every week for the past three. Each email he is trying to get me to converse with him, &amp; makes references to our past relationship. I only respond with pictures, no conversation. I had pfa against him which expired and was not able to be renewed because he moved out of state. My question is what is reasonable for asking for pictures? I mean come on, appearance isn't going to change month to month and I feel that he is just using as an excuse to try and get me to talk to him. I feel like it's just more emotional abuse and harassment.	No
So I got a mechanic's lien from a company that didn't do work on my property...but is owned by the same guy whose company DID do work on my property. We are in a dispute over the technicalities of the work...and an inspection done by 2 third parties may have elucidated he committed fraud which is why I'm hesitant to pay at this moment (coupled with the fact that he billed stuff my insurance denied and I cannot afford at the moment), but that's besides the point. The point is, we signed a contract that said he couldn't put a lien on my property prior to the work being done. Now he's filing the lien on behalf of this second company. Can he do this? Also, one thing that I thought about, can he say that he transferred the debt from company A to company B? In court, are there ethical considerations that could defend me considering it's the same dude that owns both of these companies?   &amp;nbsp;  I'm gonna lawyer up soon but I literally cannot sleep over the fact that I may lose my home...and it's making me sick to my stomach.	No
"A couple months ago, as title says, I was offered a job through a contracting agency, which I accepted and relocated for (only a few hundred miles, but still a trek when relocating all your belongings).  The day before I was supposed to start, I hadn't received any onboarding documents from them so I started to get a little worried and tried to make contact. They ignored me all day until that night when they told me that there had been ""some mistake"" and I no longer had a job.  I was able to maintain some sort of contact with them for about  a week after, in which I was told they could give me some compensation for things like **relocation, security deposit, one month rent**. However after this they simply stopped responding and I never got my compensation.  I would greatly appreciate some advice on how to move forward with getting said compensation from them."	No
Here is my question. If I were to commit suicide without a will wrote up for my kids, will they be left with my debt and taxes? Would it be better to not have them in a will, put each child's possessions in separate storages, and my cars into their names?	No
Hey r/legaladvice. I am looking into taking a ticket to court. I have 2 speeding tickets on my record. 1 a couple years back and 1 in april.   Today I got pulled over for running a stop sign based on what the officer saw. I drive a very small car and actually stopped but I believe the officer did not see this as there is a picket fence on the same corner that he was coming from. I usually stop a good distance back because there is a railroad track on the other side that cars fly over.   My issue comes down to the attitude that these small town police have. He set my court date as next Thursday even after I told him that wouldn't be possible and requested that he at least give me a week to request vacation. I have also heard horror stories of people paying court fees for bogus tickets and these police getting their way anyway. I feel like the only way to get out of this ticket is by having the officer not show up but I can't make it on the date he set.  If I call the courthouse and reschedule, won't that put a target on my back for this officer and he will make sure to be there in an even more pissed off state? Should I just make sure I'm there on the third? I wouldn't fight the ticket if I didn't feel I did anything wrong. My previous tickets were paid as soon as I could make the payment. But I don't want to waste my time and money if I'm just going to get screwed either way.	No
We are in Ontario Canada and have been looking at places in Toronto, Ontario and Windsor, Ontario.  We signed one buyers representation agreement with an agent in the Toronto area when we were looking to lease a place in Toronto. We just moved to Toronto on July 1st and ended up finding a place without the agent.  The agent marked on file that he is helping us out for the Toronto central, east and west area. He says he only works in the Toronto area and Windsor is about 4 to 5 hours drive away.  In Windsor we are signing with another agent and purchased offer was accepted yesterday evening.  Today we are planning to send acknowledgment forms, sign buyer representation with the Windsor agent and so on.  I am wondering if there will be any problem with the previous agent trying to take the new ones commission or anything.  Any info helps!   ** TL;DR: Signing buyers representation with two different agents in two two different cities about 4 to 5 hours away from each other.  Neither of them work in the others duristiction but are in the same province. Any problems here?  **	No
"7 of my friends went camping on a Monday night, I had work unfortunately. They were camping at a site where camping isn't allowed but many people camp there anyways. After being there for a few hours, a man and woman came to the camp site and held a gun(later revealed to probably be a pellet gun) to the back of my friends head. He started saying things like, ""Are you prepared to die?"" And remained there pointing the gun from person to person for about 10 minutes. From this I have found out his name and I am wondering what sort of action, preferably legal, we should take against him. Is there anything we can do considering they were camping illegally?"	No
"Quick question and I'll delete once answered.  I'm renting a town home from a husband and wife who own a few properties around my town. The lease is the shortest I've ever signed, probably because they're not a huge complex or company. The lease is pretty standard and we've had no issues with anything since moving in. When my fiancé went to drop the rent off, he had left a lease for us to take home and sign. It's the same lease we signed when we moved in, with only the dates changed.   One of the clauses (if that's the right word, but basically description)  in the lease is ""deposit:"" then something along the lines of a $650 non-refundable deposit due at the start of the lease. We paid this at move in. I emailed him for clarification and I'm sure he will say we don't have to but here is my question to you:   Is the email sufficient enough as an agreement in the event he tries to charge us and takes us to court as proof we don't need to pay it? (Although i doubt this will happen, I've read horror stories on here so now I'm second guessing everything) or should we go in together, sign it with him, and have him edit that part with initials?   Thanks!   TL;DR - lease renewal mentions paying a deposit already paid. Is an email agreement that we don't need to pay it enough in the event they later say we owe it or should we have them edit the lease?"	No
This is complicated.  We are trying to buy a house on an Indian reservation.  I am Native, he isn't.  The tribe and BIA won't put him on the land lease.  (white guy) I will not be on the mortgage. My income debt ratio is not viable as I am not working right now- I am a student.  How does community property speak to one spouse being on the land lease and the other being on the mortgage?	No
I am a legal permanent resident(via employment) and in April, it will be 5 years so I can apply for naturalization this month. I think Naturalization is a straight forward process that I can do myself without an attorney.   I got married last year and my spouse has overstayed her tourist visa by a number of years and is out of status. I know I can apply for her green card once I am naturalized. I want to know when I should start the process for her: 1. When I file my N-400 2. Or during the oath taking ceremony 3. Or after I get citizenship  Also, what should I put in as the status of my spouse while filling up N-400?   As mentioned earlier, I was thinking of filling up the N-400 myself and only use the services of an attorney while filing my spouse's paper. Does that sound good or is it safer to use an attorney for the naturalization process as well?  Thanks :)	No
My friends soon to be ex husband moved from their home in Florida to Iowa. He some how made himself an account manager on her Verizon account. Then he went and charged a $1000 iPhone to her account and split the line. When she tried telling Verizon it was fraudulent they basically told her she was up the creek. Can there be legal action taken here ? 	No
I am having a hell of a time trying to find out if this is legal or not.   Does anyone know if a doctors lawyer/legal advisor is allowed to be present in the exam room with the patient, while the doctor and patient discuss the patients medical information/diagnosis, without the patient being aware of or introduced to the lawyer? In California.  In what situation would a doctor do this?   To me it screams guilt/liability but this isn't exactly something that happens frequently so I am unsure. Especially when the patient is unaware of any serious medical issue that the doctor might be liable for.	No
Hello everyone I am 28 years old and when I was 17/18 I had a troubled youth and was arrested on 4 different occasions resulting in 7 charges.  All convictions were for 5 misdemeanors and 2 violations.       For the violations and 3 of the misdemeanors I was given youthful offender I believe.  For the other misdemeanors I believe my record has been sealed / expunged.       I got my life straightened out and I went back to school eventually and just received my masters degree.  I have been offered a position which will require a background check.  On the application it asks if I have ever been convicted of an offense that HASN'T been expunged/sealed or given youthful offender status.  I answered NO here as I believe my records are sealed and given youthful offender.      Honestly i'm not sure what the background check will show up.  These charges happened so long ago and I believe the records have been sealed as part of my plea agreements, but I cant be certain. I submitted a free background check on myself however I may not receive the results in time.       My question is what should I do in this situation?  Tell the employer about my past criminal history before I accept the official offer?  Or should I just not admit to it and hope my records have been sealed?	No
N.CA   So I was involved in a collision like two weeks ago and my dumbass admitted fault because it was my first accident.  Talked to my adjuster (I have full coverage) and I told her how it happened and she told me that it was not completely my fault. My insurance already gave me a check for the damage of my car &amp; everything. Yesterday the other driver called me twice but I didn't answer because I was working, and today his insurance called wanting to talk about it and I told them they can talk to my adjuster if they have any questions. I'm freaking of maybe being sued, like the other guy was an Uber so he can claim lost wages, and everything I google leads me to law websites so I'm stressing.	No
"Hi there, my friend recently purchased ""African Black Soap"" from Shea Butter. She followed the directions for using the soap and it caused her to have chemical burns. She has been treated by a doctor who indeed said they are chemical burns. The ingredients seem to be a lie as well. Is there a lawsuit here? If so what is it?"	No
Until recently I worked for a large bank and knew before leaving that I had used up more holidays than I was entitled for the amount of the year so far. I was told it would be deducted from my wages but it wasn't. They've now written to me asking me to repay the £400 I owe. Am I legally obliged to repay it?	No
