0	Asking for clarification as a buddy and I were debating this after watching a show about it.  When people (everyone) downloads videos or music that's encoded would the copyright owner go after the person who initially downloaded and shared the files? The website that hosts the files or every single person who subsequently downloaded it as it's available online?  As an example if an episode of Seinfeld was downloaded via megaupload. Would copyright owners go after the person who initially shared it, the host site megaupload, or the subsequent tens of thousands of people who downloaded from site after being posted?	Yes
1	So we have this concept for an android app that we think is amazing. The game will use 5-7 second clips of copyrighted media. These are in webm form (no sound). All the clips were taken from Youtube (posted by their respective studios) and from original DVDs we bought. The question is will this pass for fair use or will we get sued? I'm not from the US so I don't fully understand the fair use policy. Thanks if somebody can answer.	Yes
2	"Hi folks,  I was excited to see that Ryuichi Sakamoto is having a short film contest where you make a short film that utilizes songs from his new album, and three winners get money, compositions to use in future films, filmmaking advisor services, a spot on the blu-ray version of the album, among other things.  But in the submission guidelines, there is this bullet point:  &gt;Upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the submitted work in any media form for any purpose. **Our Company, any affiliates, subsidiaries, and any third party affiliates designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, adapt, transmit, demonstrate, create derivative work, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion.** Furthermore, upon sending an email submission as noted above in step 3 of &lt;How to Submit&gt;, the applicant agrees to grant our Company and any affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors a full, global, nonexclusive, irrevocable, sub-licensable, and free license to use the name(s), nick name(s), and biography of the filmmaker in any media form for any purpose. Our Company, affiliates, subsidiaries, any other third party designated by our Company and their successors may copy, distribute, display, publish, transmit, and use the submitted work in anyway at their sole discretion. The intended use includes but is not limited to the uploading to various websites and social media channels including Ryuichi Sakamoto’s official website, his social media channels, the official website and YouTube/Vimeo channels of the Japanese label commmons and the official website and YouTube/Vimeo channels of the international label Milan Records, in addition to the promotional use of the short film for async and as a preview for the documentary film, “Ryuichi Sakamoto Documentary Project” (tentative title).  The filmmaker must represent and warrant the lack of a third party contract which may interfere with the licensed rights above.  Is this (especially what I bolded) as sinister as it sounds? A mere submission means that a third party can create derivative work based on submitted work? ""Sorry, you lost, so we don't have to pay you, but we can spin your idea into a feature film or music video of our own production at any time.""  Am I misreading this and it's actually standard? Or it's standard anyway? Or it's an overzealous lawyer just covering themselves in case someone wins and then sees a better offer elsewhere? Er, covering themselves in case they happen to make something similar to a generic submission in the future so no one can try to pull a Creed situation?   Thanks"	Yes
3	"I'm specifically talking about a filter (K9 Web Protection) blocking furaffinity for ""Alternative Sexuality/Lifestyles."" Should I do something about this, or not? Sorry if this sounds dumb, but I just have no idea.  Further information: I am a minor, and this filter was installed on my computer by my parents. Please do not use this information for other purposes."	No
4	Hello all!  My boyfriend and I have been struggling with frustration for a while. A few months back, our next door neighboor hired a man to build a fence dividing our backyards. Our front yards, as seen [here](http://imgur.com/a/DKREo), have a joint driveway (with a discoloration between the two sides so you can kind of see where the division is). As he was almost finished building,  my boyfriend pulled out our surveyors certificate of our land lot and we were able to determine that they were building the fence **three feet** in on our property and so we asked them to move it. They complied, and the man rebuilt the fence - only to still have built it about a **foot** in on our property. The fence has been up for about a month now. We've been struggling with how to bring this up (again) and were curious what options we had if, once we do confront him, he says no. We don't exactly get along with our neighbor and he does not seem to be the accommodating (or nice, friendly, happy) type.	No
5	"Today I was pulled over.  When the vehicle came to a stop I cracked the window to about 1/2in, enough to hear the officer's commands and hand over my identification.  The officer approached my driver's window and stood there.  Said nothing, then opened my driver's door.  I was flabbergasted, I asked him what right he had to open my door.  He replied, ""You didn't put the window down.""   As I see it, if I had something illegal in the door of my car, he would not have known about it until he opened the door.  Which seems to me like an illegal search.  Could someone weigh in on this?"	No
