I know this isn't as important as some other matters on here, but I haven't found a solid answer on it.   I work as a news reporter at a regional newspaper in Minnesota. Our local radio station has been reading my stories, with exact quotes, on air without giving any credit.   The radio station has a news reporter, but she doesn't show up at most events, or cover any of these stories. I hear shortened versions of my stories being read pretty much every day and it's mildly infuriating.   I've asked them to stop, or give credit, but get no response. My company doesn't do anything about it.  I'm having trouble understanding the grey areas of fair use law. Basically, is there anything I can do about this?	Yes
I want to make a brand of cat plush toys and coloring books. I was planning on naming it Mushu, but the dragon from the Mulan movie has that name. I searched the trademark website and it said the trademark for that is 'dead.' So would it be okay to use that name for the company and the products?	Yes
A book cozie is two slips of fabric over some foam, it's a folder for a book and etys has tons of sellers. it's not an original design and anyone with a sewing machine can make these easily. I don't understand why they attacked my small shop over the ones I make when literally there are tons available on Etsy from multiple sellers.   Etsy encourages me to contact them regarding the issue. I'm in America, they are in the United Kingdom, how can this be trademarked with so many sellers and what do I say to them upon email?	Yes
I'm a US citizen (land living in the US) and also a partner of a company based in Australia.   What is the best way to handle distributions in my case -- would it make the most sense to create a subsidiary in the USA for tax purposes, or is there a better option?   While we have a few customers in the USA, we don't plan to pursue the market here and will not open any offices in the US. We'd like to remain focused on the Australian market. If we did open a subsidiary company in the US in order to pay distributions, would that open us up to US law and liabilities? We'd prefer to remain under Australian law since most of our customers are there.  I plan to speak to a lawyer about this, but thought it would be nice to get a few different opinions to prepare in case anyone else has dealt with a similar situation. Thanks in advance for your help!	Yes
Hello r/legaladvice,   I am from NY. I established an S corp with my business partner. I am a minority share holder in the corporation, and my partner is the majority. He just recently got divorced(?) even though a lot of what he is saying is not matching up. I have an EIN number if that matters for anything. I am looking to get out of this partnership. I still have the contract which states everything that I said above. I placed about ~$7500 into the business. I currently reside in a different county than he does, so I am thinking about taking him to court, because he won't buy me out of the partnership. Should I take this man to court, because supposedly he is getting divorce.   Personally, I fell out with this man and I am not sure if he is even telling me the truth.  Any advice is appreciated, thanks!	Yes
"My SO (we are in the UK) crochets amigurumi plushies, and sells them on etsy, as a side hobby (by no means does she really EARN from it per se).  One of her listings on etsy is a pattern for an animal amigurumi, which she posted in the last month. Today she received an email from another etsy seller (from Canada) telling her to take it down as she is infringing on her copyright, as she also has a pattern for the same animal on etsy, and has done since 2016.  the seller notes that she can tell the patterns are not identical, as the stitches are clearly different (at least from a crocheters perspective), but cites that the finished amigurumi is still very similar in appearance, and thus this is where her copyright has been infringed.  is this a thing?  this woman literally says ""Copyright laws protect the appearance of an amigurumi design, even if the actual pattern isn't identical"".  i know my SO didn't copy her pattern, or even use images of her amigurumi for the inspiration. it is purely coincidental. this isn't the first pattern she's made by herself."	Yes
"Hi r/legaladvice,   This is my first post in your sub, but I've done my homework by searching the sub and reading the various wikis. I still have some questions for you folks.   I'm gathering preliminary sources and images for a book idea that I have. This book would consist mainly of images, illustrations, and hand-drawings that _mostly_ come by way of the Library of Congress or government agencies. The Library of Congress states that the government works hosted on their site *""are also available for worldwide use and reuse under CC0 1.0 Universal.""* However, they also state *""you should determine for yourself whether or not an item is protected by copyright or in the public domain, and then satisfy any copyright or use restrictions when publishing or distributing materials from our collections.""*   My concern is that second snippet.   - How can I verify that a work is truly in the public domain (or equivalent license)?    - If I do publish an image that I find out is not in the public domain after publication, what options do I (and the copyright holder) have?    - What sites or services can you recommend that will ensure I only use works that are in the public domain?   Thanks for any and all information.  PS: I'm in the USA."	Yes
"I run a small social network that lets users register usernames as their handle. A company which I'll call ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" (not its real name but similar) sent me an email accusing one of my users of committing a trademark violation because she registered the name ""illusionalsunrise"" on my site. But when I search for ""illusionalsunrise"" (again, not the real name) on http://tmsearch.uspto.gov, I see that the word mark is for ""Illusionalsunrise Media"" and not ""Illusionalsunrise"" by itself.  The email sent to me also contains this paragraph:  ""From the information that we have received regarding your use, our use of this Trademark has priority over yours based upon earlier and continuous use, as well as the above federal registration. Therefore, your use is a violation of our companyâ€™s rights.  We are requesting that you remove the use of our trademark described in the provided link or any other name or mark confusingly similar.""  Their actual trademark filing states: FIRST USE: 20160401. FIRST USE IN COMMERCE: 20160401 with a filing date of July 21, 2016 whereas my user registered her account on Oct 14, 2011. My user also doesn't sell anything and is not a business entity so they shouldn't even be in the same industry (it's just a username).  Lastly, that specific user does not reside in the United States (the social network itself is a registered company in the United States).  I don't think this company has any ground to stand on. It would be easier for me to just change that user's name but they are currently active and I don't think it's right to do so especially when I think this company is overreaching. I'm going to bring this up to a lawyer regardless but I just want to get /r/legaladvice's opinion so I can have a general idea on where I stand."	Yes
