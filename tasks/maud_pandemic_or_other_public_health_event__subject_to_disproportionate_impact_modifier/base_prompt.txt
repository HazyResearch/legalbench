For the avoidance of doubt, any changes in any program administered by or related to the SBA under which First Choice participates, including, without limitation, any changes in any Laws   96   applicable or relating thereto (or any interpretations of any such Laws), that would (A) eliminate or materially limit or impair the ability of First Choice or any First Choice Subsidiary to originate or service Loans under any such program, or (B) eliminate or materially limit or impair Loan guarantees under such program, whether on a prospective or retroactive basis, in each case shall be deemed a “Material Adverse Effect” with respect to First Choice and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.
