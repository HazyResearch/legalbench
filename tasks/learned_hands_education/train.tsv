0	Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	Yes
1	I recently moved to a new state and decided I wanted to go back to college. I decided I would play around with the idea and I applied to a local state college since the application was free. They deemed me a resident (much to my surprise), so I decided I would go. Had I not gotten resident tuition, I would not have gone. I put my student loan things through and registered for Summer and Fall classes. Both my online application and written confirmation confirm that I was given in-state status.  Well, Summer classes roll around and my bill is for $4000 instead of $2000. I figured it was some early billing for Fall or something (they don't have an easy way to see an itemized bill) but I called to confirm after a couple weeks. Turns out someone made a mistake and I was actually considered out of state. They in no way contacted me to confirm this before I was given my bill. At this point, Summer classes have started. Eventually, I am told that they are working a way out for me to still get in-state tuition. I ask when I can see those changes reflected in my bill, and I get no response. It's been about a month and I haven't heard anything back from them despite my multiple attempts at contact. Now we have long passed the point where I can even get a partial refund and my bill still hasn't changed. I would have withdrawn immediately had I not been told repeatedly that everything would be okay. I have everything in writing and I'm wondering what all I can do. I've already taken out student loans for the year and I don't want to both change all my plans for the next year *and* go through the process of returning loans.	Yes
2	I thought i'd come get a more informed opinion before I go forward with this.    I'm a student at a public university in the NC state system. Our recreation center provides a specific kind of barbell in the weight room for student usage, it is a 20kg weightlifting bar meant for males.    This type of barbell is also made for women with different specifications; shorter length and thinner diameter, as these characteristics are better suited for female athletes/exercisers. Our recreation center does not provide an equal amount, or even one, women's weightlifting bar. We have plenty of female students that would benefit from having them.    Based on a cursory overlook of the Title IX provisions am I on solid ground bringing this to the attention of the recreation center management? I feel as though they'd be forced to act on it immediately to provide more equipment and thus equal access/opportunity for both sexes.    Any input or corrections would be appreciated.	Yes
3	Hello, On July 7th I had my grandson over for a week. My property had a large population of feral cats who were extremely aggressive. I killed or trapped at least 5, and the rest eventually stopped coming around my area. I still received visits from the neighbors cat who lived several acres away) who wears a green collar. As well as an occasional feral cat.   On July 7th I was watching a western movie when my wife yelled at me to come help her through the screen door. I rushed on to my deck to see what was going on. My wife was bleeding from the hand, and the neighbors cat was hissing at her. The hairs on the its back were standing up, and it looked pissed. The cat stood blocking me and my wife from my grandson The cat swiped in our direction then slowly walked in the direction that my grandson was in as he cried. I drew my .45 (note I had it in a concealed holster, which I have a license for) and fired 3 shots into the cat, who died.   I then obviously called my wife and ambulance. She had to get several stitches, it was a whole mess. The police filed a report notified the neighbor, and now the neighbor is threatening to sue me. Claiming that her cat was docile and was not violent.   What are my options? Am I at fault here?	No
4	Hello, I have a rental agreement (non-business) until August 31st 2017. I gave 3 months notice to vacate the premises end of May, and all seemed fine. I moved to my new apartment on July 1st, and emptied the old one. I was planning on keeping it to help my sister store some furniture during her move end of August, and I paid for the month of July already. However, when I went to check on the apartment on Saturday and pick up my mail, I noticed that there are new tenants already living there despite the apartment still being mine. The new guys are super nice and showed me their rental agreement, which looks like a normal one. What am I supposed to do? Am I allowed to get my 1/2 month rent from the landlord back? Am I still on the hook for the August month? I'm kinda freaked out. I tried speaking to the regie des logements who told me that the landlord could easily say they had a verbal understanding with me so there's not much I can do. No such verbal understanding was made. Any advice?	No
5	Kind of strange situation. Girl friend and I lived in a small 1br apt. 555/month, cheap for the area for 3 years. Literally our last month the owner sold and changed management companies, giving our deposit to this new person who we would have otherwise no contact with.   Checked out with new manager 5/30 returned keys. Apt was very clean aside from the oven had some burnt stuff inside which was documented.   We've contacted new manager twice regarding our deposit and gotten no where so I looked up the owner using public records and mailed him [this letter via certified mail] (http://i.imgur.com/LgT1Mz7.png) basically asking for 1000 dollars citing **MN statute 504B.178.** It's been over twice the 21 days MN allows, I want to make sure my demands are reasonable.  What are next steps assuming he doesn't respond?	No
