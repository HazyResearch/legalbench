"I'll try to be as brief as possible.  It's my senior year. My school is trying to make me get on a mandatory meal plan. They changed to a new provider with a new requirement that all students purchase it (it makes the school money). I already lived off campus so I could cook my food and because of my mental health am not always able to go to a huge dining hall with hundreds of other people every single time I want to eat. I would just eat at home but I can't both pay for the plan and buy food.   I have anxiety and depression as diagnosed by a medical professional. The school knows this and has known it for three years because they give me accommodations.  When I spoke with a woman in the accessibility office (who has not answered any of my questions in a timely or complete manner), she told me there is no longer a medical meal plan option and that students who used to have one would have to work with the dining company in the first week of school to work out a good solution. I know for a fact that since my refusal is rooted in a health issue this could be breaking HIPAA among other things (please let me know). It smells really illegal and discriminatory.   Does the Americans with disabilities act make it illegal to force me to go to the dining hall? Title 9? What legal language should I use? Interested in any and all suggestions.  One girl said the school wouldn't help her until she used the words ""eating disorder"" so I'm thinking about trying that. But I still have a diagnosed mental illness and can get a medical professional to request accommodations accordingly, so it still feels like they should not be able to sweep me under the rug legally even though my illness' connection to food might fall in a grey area according to some people.   Please help me fight my school that only cares about my money and not my health. I'm mad."	Yes
TLDR is, degree, terrible job, want to change my life in any way I can. It's incredibly depressing, and I want to know what are my options. I heard conflicting things:  * it's easy/hard to get tuition paid on unemployment  * you have to be a minority they recognize  * you actually have to be on unemployment for &gt;24wks before they even consider helping you, which seems incredibly counter-productive  * even if you get it, you're not getting essentials covered by UI, just tuition  Help me /r/legaladvice you're my only hope. As I'm too broke to do much else. Thanks for reading	Yes
"Hey everyone!  I'm a Canadian, wanting to attend a professional degree program in the US. I have some questions about US Education Law and would like to find a lawyer, but I'm currently in Canada where I'm assuming most Education Lawyers will be experts in law that is specific to Canada. Is it possible to ""meet"" with a lawyer remotely and where would be a good starting place to find such a lawyer?  Thank you."	Yes
"[Original Thread Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/6l543s/im_being_accused_of_academic_dishonesty_violation/).   In two weeks I'll have a hearing scheduled to determine whether I cheated on 2 final exams. These are being held as 2 separate cases, so if I am found guilty of both, the university has the right to expel me. I studied for these exams without the aid of others.  **Relevant details:**  * On first final exam: I got 11/80 questions wrong. Three other people had the same 11/80 wrong and put the same thing for their wrong answers. I'm wondering if they sat behind me and were able to see my answers? Apparently another, who took the exam early, had similar answers but not exact. There is no allegations of a ""leaked"" answer key, only a similar pattern of answers between students. Still, the accusers assume that the exam was leaked during this final as well, due to the similarity of answers between students and the student(s) who took the exam early.  * On second final exam: 5 of my answers were wrong and match up with an alleged ""leaked"" answer key. These are the only 5 questions I got wrong on the whole exam, and I put what I thought was the best answer at the time. The department has a copy of my final exam, which clearly shows my work on most questions, and my reasoning (process of elimination, marking off certain answers in order to narrow down choices to the correct answer). I also did 8-10% better on the final exam than the others being accused of cheating.  The accusers thinks that in both cases, answers to the exams were leaked by student(s) who took the exam early because a number of students had similar answer patterns on both finals. The board has narrowed it down to students they think committed cheating on both exams, by looking at patterns of answers on both exams, and I was grouped in with the alleged cheaters.   The first thing I did was email my lab professor, who I had for both of these classes in which I was accused. She works DIRECTLY with the people accusing me, and is a full-time Ph.D instructor of both of the classes. So she seemed like the best person I could go to. I asked her to write me an email vouching for my integrity as a student, and this is what she said:  &gt; What is baffling is why this issue is being brought out now long after your semester is over.  &gt; I think that my comments about your integrity would be of more help if it is written to the board/committee instead of directly to you. Wouldn't this make more sense? I think that would surely help your case. I can definitely do this part because when it is called for because I have known you for two semesters ([Class 1] and [Class 2]) and you were indeed one of the best students of the class. I am confident about your integrity. I am surprised a sincere student as you has to face this unfortunate situation. Could it be that this has occurred due to some miscommunication or rather due to some strange coincidence?  &gt; Either way, I am sure you would be able to convincingly explain to the committee to absolve yourself. I can do my part at that stage if it is required. So, keep me updated of the developments if my support/help is needed.  &gt; I am positive that you would get over this issue unscathed.  I immediately printed this email out and gave it to the person advising my case. She looked impressed that I was able to get a letter from someone who instructed me in both of the classes in which I was accused of cheating, so I hope that's a good sign.  Looking through the documents, it appears that the professor, after discovering potential cheating, originally considered voiding the final and basing the students grades on lab performance. Ultimately this was not done. But If that were the case, I would have received very good grades, as my lab grades were excellent. Should I bring this up to the board?  Also, I looked at the stats for the 5 questions I got wrong that matched the alleged ""leaked"" answer key and at least 45 other students had the same wrong answer as I did. Another thing that baffles me is that if student(s) did take the exam early, surely they were being supervised?  I have 200 credits and am on the cusp of 2 degrees, and have attended this university for 6 years. Now this situation happens to me, a month before I graduate. I cannot afford to re-take classes, and I certainly cannot afford to pay back my loans if I am falsely accused of cheating.  The frustrating part is that final decisions are made by a board of students. This seems unfair, as students probably tend to side with professors (the accusers), not the students (accused).  I cannot sleep at night thinking about this. I don't even know how to write an opening or closing statement. Any advice on what I can do to resolve this situation would make a world of difference.  Thank you for reading."	Yes
This happened several years ago, when I was about 13 years old.   I verbally threatened to kill a classmate. I was just a dumb 13 year old, and no reasonable person should have taken me seriously.  My school principal told me that I would get an 80 day suspension, but yet she never contacted my parents. And I never told my parents because I didnt want them to know.  Then, for the next 2 weeks, monday to Friday I was instructed to sit in an uncomfortable wooden chair and do nothing at all for the whole day every day. This is 9 am to 3 pm, sitting in a chair doing nothing but staring at a wall for 10 days. (2 weeks). Nobody to talk to and nothing to do but look at the wall.  This is 60 hours of isolation. I felt like a prisoner in those isolation things.   Then abruptly, she told me that my punishment is done. I never received any paperwork or documentation of anything at all. I found her reaction incredibly harsh.  Was I morally abused?  Is there any legal action that should have been taken at the time? Is there any legal action that can be taken now, year later?	Yes
I was set to graduate from college within the prescribed 4 years. The final classes I needed to graduate were not offered at my university (small liberal arts college). I missed out on registering for the classes at another school so my time in school was to be extended by a semester. The financial aid office and business offices at my school are terrible. They took forever to get back to me and since I was over 21 they requested dependent verification paperwork. This all took place halfway through the final semester. I had filled out all requirements on my part to receive my financial aid. The only thing I needed to submit was my mother’s tax return forms. Well since I had not graduated on time my mother was upset and kicked me out of her house. So there I was in school, homeless and broke so I stopped attending classes.   Now I am 10,000 in debt outside of student loans with the school. My concern is how is this possible if I never approved my financial aid (loans). The fault lies in the bad timing on the school’s part. It takes them far too long to communicate with students. Is there anything I can do? I am in too much debit to ignore this and not get a degree. Especially considering the quality of education at the school is a joke and everybody cheats.   I don’t want to come off as vindictive but my attempts at speaking to the administration have not yielded any results. What can I do to make them listen? Will contacting the accreditation bureau help? I want to include legal action but so far that is a hollow threat with the condition of my finances. Should I get legal representation or find another way to handle this?	Yes
So I received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/spDd1) in the mail today along with a settlement check in the mail today.  This is the very first I've heard of a law suit against DeVry for fraudulent advertising.  I attended DeVry from 2010-12 and incurred significant student loans but never graduated.  The loan in question is actually in default and it would be absolutely amazing for my life if I could get out of paying it back.  That probably makes me sound like a horrible human being but I'll live with it if I can get out from underneath that mountain of debt.  I went to [the mentioned website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) but I really don't understand if I qualify or not.  If anyone could advise I'd greatly appreciate it.	Yes
I took out a student loan in 2013 to attend trade school with a company called TFG and we paid those off in full. Now - 4 years later - NELNET is calling me saying that I have a student loan that is delinquent and will need to pay or it will start affecting my credit.   I know for a fact that we never took out federal student loans. What do I do?	Yes
