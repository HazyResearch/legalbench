The situation is my sister was enrolled in a dual enrollment high school program at a local university where she went and lived on campus to take classes. My parents were not involved in any of the application or enrollment process and neither saw nor signed any paperwork. For context, She is not on good terms with my parents and has a long history of behavioral issues. They weren't really told anything about this program.  My sister told my parents when asked about how she would pay that she had money saved from working at Starbucks and had taken a student loan.  My parents later found out that there was in fact no loan or money and that the huge tuition bill was due. My sister is 17 (18 in two months) and is still technically a minor.  The university is making lots of threats to my parents if they don't pay. However, they never knew about any of this or signed any paperwork to make them liable for a $10,000+ bill.   Legally, can the school come after my parents for this?	Yes
For the 2016-2017 school year I was a freshman at a top university in New York. Second semester I withdrew because I realized I could no longer afford it, and moved back home to California. Because I withdrew in time, they refunded me half of my tuition for the semester, which was about $12-$13k. Almost as soon as I got the money, I sent it to my loan company as a payment (this was in March).  A few days ago I received a letter in the mail stating that I owe the school $31,000 (~$30,000 for tuition and ~$950 in interest) for the semester. I brushed it off for a few days until today, thinking that it was just a bill for next semester that was accidentally sent to me. So I called and the lady speaking to me told me that the bill was actually for the past semester, and that they had canceled the loan they had received from the government (I was never informed of this). She tells me I owe the $30,000, plus it accrues a 1% interest rate monthly, which is why I also owe around $950.  I can't afford $31,000 out of nowhere, hence why I even took the loans out in the first place.  My question is, was it even legal that they didn't disclose that they declined the loan money? Where do I go from here?	Yes
I know this is going to sound petty and make me look like an entitled petty teenager but given that all adults in my life seem to be ignoring me, the internet could probably give me better advice.  I took my Exams back in November and my results were as expected all A* with one surprising exception, my English literature grade was a c. My parents were of-course slightly disappointed but in light of my success in the rest of the course, they weren't too bothered. I investigated and asked class-mates about their grade and the results consistently showed that on average everyone scored two points below their expectations  It seemed like my teacher had devoted far too much time to advancing a fringe interpretation of the text based on modern philosophy that wouldn't apply to texts such as those we studied which was responsible for our low-grade.  I'm wondering if my English class could collectively sue the teacher for failing to teach appropriately?	Yes
I began my mPharm course in 2015. This was the university's first year with pharmacy students. The regulations to pass, were extremely strict, and because i failed 1 low weighted assignment in the each of the 2 seperate modules, the year after I had to retake one of these modules, costing me £9000 in tuition and a frther £5k debt in student loans. As students we werent informed of these strict rules before or during the first year of the course. This year the school of pharmacy completely changed the pass regulations, it is now much more reasonable and easy to pass. Under these regulations my grades would have easily have been good enough.  to clarify my marks for both modules were &gt;60%. However the original rules dictated I could not get less than 40% in anything, without resit oppurtunity. As a result I had to resit the module next year at a cost of £9k. The rules were changed a year later, to allow my original pass, and also with the oppurtunity to resit the components, without being capped.   Is there any potential for me to be reimbursed for this tuition fee, due to this sudden rule change, being implied.	Yes
I took out a student loan in 2013 to attend trade school with a company called TFG and we paid those off in full. Now - 4 years later - NELNET is calling me saying that I have a student loan that is delinquent and will need to pay or it will start affecting my credit.   I know for a fact that we never took out federal student loans. What do I do?	Yes
Hello!  I finished a degree program in Liberal Arts from a large college in Missouri back in 2012.  This was a *huge* accomplishment because back in 2009, my dad cut off my support. I dropped out of school and started working waiting tables, took night classes, finished an Associates at the local community college, and re-enrolled at the large university in 2010. I worked nights and went to school during the day to finish.  When I walked across that stage, I had done it all on my own. Great feeling, right?  Well, in my last semester, I was almost kicked out for non-payment. A financial aid officer had Mercy on my soul, and removed the hold on my account so I could graduate. I completed all my coursework, but my degree was never actually awarded. This is important for the actual question, which I'm getting to I swear y'all.  Anyway, I did a year of AmeriCorps service, and came away with a Segal Award for $5730. The balance I owe my university was originally $7500, but due to finance charges is $11k. However, they're willing to accept $9k and release my degree.  I was accepted into a Master's program to continue my work in Youth Education, but they wouldn't let me begin without my official transcript. People in my community fundraised for me, and I was able to get the remaining amount. Then the university refused to accept my AmeriCorps award, stating that it can not be used on a previous balance.  I have contacted the National Service hotline twice, and both times supervisors have stated that since my degree was never actually awarded, and the university would require me to re-enroll before awarding my degree, the balance would count as current. Additionally, the balance stays current as it accrues the finance charge every month.  At this point, I know I need to retain an attorney and just have them reach an agreement this way. I'm planning to seek out low cost legal services here in the Greater Boston area, hopefully via Harvard Law when their clinics start back up.  I'm curious what sort of letter needs to be drafted. What's reasonable to ask them to do? I want them to accept the award, and allow me to go on a payment plan for the remainder, and *hopefully* reduce the finance charges a little closer to the original balance. (I spent the gifted money on living expenses; I have a new baby and didn't have much of a choice since I couldn't begin my Master's program and use loan money from that for living expenses. Not ideal, I know, but I'm desperate.)  It should be noted that, in a last ditch effort, I sent the Provost a letter about 3 months ago, but never got a response back. The Provost makes like $375k a year, I doubt she could even begin to understand what I'm dealing with or cared at all.  **tl:dr University won't accept payment via an AmeriCorps award, won't release transcript, how do I negotiate with them?**	Yes
"Clarksville TN, CHS.  I sold and printed about a hundred shirts with the message ""Sex Is Okay"" and a illustration of a bee. They are innocent in appearance, as was my intention.  The reason I did this was to promote a more open culture in regard to sexuality among people of my generation. I live in the southern US where sex negativity is at the root of massive STD rates, teen pregnancies, and foolish legal jurisdictions. I knew the school wouldn't be HAPPY about this, but since I saw them as being a part of the problem, I figured that was unavoidable.  What I did not expect was for the school to bar me and my fellow supporters from wearing the shirts all together.  I understand that the school DOES have the right to bar freedom of speech if it is ""vulgar"" as defined by the Bethel VS. Fraser case, and if it poses a ""material and substantial disruption"" as defined by the Des Moines VS Tinker supreme court trial, but I can see no argument by which the word ""sex"" is vulgar, as there is no more politically correct replacement. Besides, the word is included in non-literary educational material.  Am I missing something important here? Is the school perfectly within their right?  ------------------------------------ TLDR: Printed and sold shirts reading ""Sex Is Okay' for a movement I've been working on. High School banned them. Is my freedom of expression being trodden upon?"	Yes
I was set to graduate from college within the prescribed 4 years. The final classes I needed to graduate were not offered at my university (small liberal arts college). I missed out on registering for the classes at another school so my time in school was to be extended by a semester. The financial aid office and business offices at my school are terrible. They took forever to get back to me and since I was over 21 they requested dependent verification paperwork. This all took place halfway through the final semester. I had filled out all requirements on my part to receive my financial aid. The only thing I needed to submit was my mother’s tax return forms. Well since I had not graduated on time my mother was upset and kicked me out of her house. So there I was in school, homeless and broke so I stopped attending classes.   Now I am 10,000 in debt outside of student loans with the school. My concern is how is this possible if I never approved my financial aid (loans). The fault lies in the bad timing on the school’s part. It takes them far too long to communicate with students. Is there anything I can do? I am in too much debit to ignore this and not get a degree. Especially considering the quality of education at the school is a joke and everybody cheats.   I don’t want to come off as vindictive but my attempts at speaking to the administration have not yielded any results. What can I do to make them listen? Will contacting the accreditation bureau help? I want to include legal action but so far that is a hollow threat with the condition of my finances. Should I get legal representation or find another way to handle this?	Yes
TLDR is, degree, terrible job, want to change my life in any way I can. It's incredibly depressing, and I want to know what are my options. I heard conflicting things:  * it's easy/hard to get tuition paid on unemployment  * you have to be a minority they recognize  * you actually have to be on unemployment for &gt;24wks before they even consider helping you, which seems incredibly counter-productive  * even if you get it, you're not getting essentials covered by UI, just tuition  Help me /r/legaladvice you're my only hope. As I'm too broke to do much else. Thanks for reading	Yes
"I live in Arizona, but the university is in Virginia.  I was guided here from r/personalfinance   I graduated in 2015 from this university and now attend dental school in a completely different state. I was randomly checking my university email which I never do and I saw that apparently ""I"" had registered for two in-person classes for the summer and now have about $2700 to owe. These classes are still in session and I also have emails from the professors that I am failing these classes, etc. I am not sure where the mix up is but how can I prove that I never registered for these classes and that I have no motive to take these classes. I am not sure if someone logged into my account and registered for them or if there was some IT error. This is really worrisome as I definitely don't have the money to pay for it nor in my mind should I. Any help would be greatly appreciated."	Yes
So... When I was 17 I decided it was a good idea to begin taking out school loans (10,000-12,000 per year for 5 years) to go to a private Christian college. Dumbest decision of my life. This is my ONLY regret in life so far. I can't believe NO ONE told me it WASN'T a good idea to be taking out this much money in loans. I didn't even enjoy my time in college. It was terrible and the school was going through financial difficulties and it impacted the students negatively (so I feel that I didn't even get a quality education). Now it's been 3 years since graduation and I'm still regretting all of this. Almost every day I wish there was a way to retract my debt (even if it means retracting my BA). I'm sure I'm just screwed, but legally is there anything I could do to get out of this debt? Like suing the school or something? I'm sure there's not but it's on my mind pretty much all day everyday so I figured I'd at least ask. Thanks in advance!	Yes
I'm an international student at a Dutch university. In the academic year 2016-2017 I was unable to obtain 30ECs and hence my Residence permit will most likley be revoked. However if I transfer to a different university in the Netherlands to start a new course from Sept 2017 will I be able to stay in the Netherlands? I couldn't contact IND so I'm asking here. I hope someone here knows about this. And the MoMi states that you have to gain 30ECs ie half of the Total 1st year credit points at the University where you're enrolled to continue your studies and stay in the Netherlands.	Yes
My local high school is out of control and I am OUT an additional $1000 because of their arbitrary decisions.    I got two kids in high school, sophomore and junior. It seems like I can expect to pay $400-900 per year per student and swallowed an additional sunk cost of $1000 of two iPads I purchased that they do not allow to bring anymore, forcing you to rent.   Is there a public government department to file complaints to avoid litigation?  The fees are  Registration - $160 Technology - $185 Advanced Placement - $92 per class Drivers ed - $300 Sports/Parking additional Students have to purchase ALL books each year, not school supplied.   I do not make much money,  but too much for assistance (50k). I was also unemployed for half a year last year because of the shakey economy.   This is getting out of control. I have to stress and dip into college savings to pay for high school. Personal safety net was depleted a while ago.   While I can agree with most the fees, the only thing that angers me is that they told me I could buy my own iPad, and now after a year thy discontinue it and tell me to rent there's.   --  Here was my reasoning. By bringing your own they knocked $100 off the technology fee per year.  The schools iPads are 4 years old and  in poor condition.   With the savings of $400 over the high school period I bought an iPad Pro for slightly more. Not only do I get to keep it after four years instead of returning it, it was more up to date and supports a stylus.   Now they pulled support. So in addition to my $2000 yearly expenditure, I lost a $1000 more due to policy.   Is there a public avenue for filing complaints. This is out of control.	Yes
I recently moved to a new state and decided I wanted to go back to college. I decided I would play around with the idea and I applied to a local state college since the application was free. They deemed me a resident (much to my surprise), so I decided I would go. Had I not gotten resident tuition, I would not have gone. I put my student loan things through and registered for Summer and Fall classes. Both my online application and written confirmation confirm that I was given in-state status.  Well, Summer classes roll around and my bill is for $4000 instead of $2000. I figured it was some early billing for Fall or something (they don't have an easy way to see an itemized bill) but I called to confirm after a couple weeks. Turns out someone made a mistake and I was actually considered out of state. They in no way contacted me to confirm this before I was given my bill. At this point, Summer classes have started. Eventually, I am told that they are working a way out for me to still get in-state tuition. I ask when I can see those changes reflected in my bill, and I get no response. It's been about a month and I haven't heard anything back from them despite my multiple attempts at contact. Now we have long passed the point where I can even get a partial refund and my bill still hasn't changed. I would have withdrawn immediately had I not been told repeatedly that everything would be okay. I have everything in writing and I'm wondering what all I can do. I've already taken out student loans for the year and I don't want to both change all my plans for the next year *and* go through the process of returning loans.	Yes
"I'll try to be as brief as possible.  It's my senior year. My school is trying to make me get on a mandatory meal plan. They changed to a new provider with a new requirement that all students purchase it (it makes the school money). I already lived off campus so I could cook my food and because of my mental health am not always able to go to a huge dining hall with hundreds of other people every single time I want to eat. I would just eat at home but I can't both pay for the plan and buy food.   I have anxiety and depression as diagnosed by a medical professional. The school knows this and has known it for three years because they give me accommodations.  When I spoke with a woman in the accessibility office (who has not answered any of my questions in a timely or complete manner), she told me there is no longer a medical meal plan option and that students who used to have one would have to work with the dining company in the first week of school to work out a good solution. I know for a fact that since my refusal is rooted in a health issue this could be breaking HIPAA among other things (please let me know). It smells really illegal and discriminatory.   Does the Americans with disabilities act make it illegal to force me to go to the dining hall? Title 9? What legal language should I use? Interested in any and all suggestions.  One girl said the school wouldn't help her until she used the words ""eating disorder"" so I'm thinking about trying that. But I still have a diagnosed mental illness and can get a medical professional to request accommodations accordingly, so it still feels like they should not be able to sweep me under the rug legally even though my illness' connection to food might fall in a grey area according to some people.   Please help me fight my school that only cares about my money and not my health. I'm mad."	Yes
I received and email from my schools financial aid office notifying me that my low GPA from last semester could possibly put my financial aid in jeopardy. This email was sent with a open mailing list of every other student who received poor enough grades to have their financial aid threatened. From my understanding my grades are supposed to be private from other students and this may be a violation of something called FERPA. Should I or can I pursue legal action?	Yes
"[Original Thread Here](https://np.reddit.com/r/needadvice/comments/6l543s/im_being_accused_of_academic_dishonesty_violation/).   In two weeks I'll have a hearing scheduled to determine whether I cheated on 2 final exams. These are being held as 2 separate cases, so if I am found guilty of both, the university has the right to expel me. I studied for these exams without the aid of others.  **Relevant details:**  * On first final exam: I got 11/80 questions wrong. Three other people had the same 11/80 wrong and put the same thing for their wrong answers. I'm wondering if they sat behind me and were able to see my answers? Apparently another, who took the exam early, had similar answers but not exact. There is no allegations of a ""leaked"" answer key, only a similar pattern of answers between students. Still, the accusers assume that the exam was leaked during this final as well, due to the similarity of answers between students and the student(s) who took the exam early.  * On second final exam: 5 of my answers were wrong and match up with an alleged ""leaked"" answer key. These are the only 5 questions I got wrong on the whole exam, and I put what I thought was the best answer at the time. The department has a copy of my final exam, which clearly shows my work on most questions, and my reasoning (process of elimination, marking off certain answers in order to narrow down choices to the correct answer). I also did 8-10% better on the final exam than the others being accused of cheating.  The accusers thinks that in both cases, answers to the exams were leaked by student(s) who took the exam early because a number of students had similar answer patterns on both finals. The board has narrowed it down to students they think committed cheating on both exams, by looking at patterns of answers on both exams, and I was grouped in with the alleged cheaters.   The first thing I did was email my lab professor, who I had for both of these classes in which I was accused. She works DIRECTLY with the people accusing me, and is a full-time Ph.D instructor of both of the classes. So she seemed like the best person I could go to. I asked her to write me an email vouching for my integrity as a student, and this is what she said:  &gt; What is baffling is why this issue is being brought out now long after your semester is over.  &gt; I think that my comments about your integrity would be of more help if it is written to the board/committee instead of directly to you. Wouldn't this make more sense? I think that would surely help your case. I can definitely do this part because when it is called for because I have known you for two semesters ([Class 1] and [Class 2]) and you were indeed one of the best students of the class. I am confident about your integrity. I am surprised a sincere student as you has to face this unfortunate situation. Could it be that this has occurred due to some miscommunication or rather due to some strange coincidence?  &gt; Either way, I am sure you would be able to convincingly explain to the committee to absolve yourself. I can do my part at that stage if it is required. So, keep me updated of the developments if my support/help is needed.  &gt; I am positive that you would get over this issue unscathed.  I immediately printed this email out and gave it to the person advising my case. She looked impressed that I was able to get a letter from someone who instructed me in both of the classes in which I was accused of cheating, so I hope that's a good sign.  Looking through the documents, it appears that the professor, after discovering potential cheating, originally considered voiding the final and basing the students grades on lab performance. Ultimately this was not done. But If that were the case, I would have received very good grades, as my lab grades were excellent. Should I bring this up to the board?  Also, I looked at the stats for the 5 questions I got wrong that matched the alleged ""leaked"" answer key and at least 45 other students had the same wrong answer as I did. Another thing that baffles me is that if student(s) did take the exam early, surely they were being supervised?  I have 200 credits and am on the cusp of 2 degrees, and have attended this university for 6 years. Now this situation happens to me, a month before I graduate. I cannot afford to re-take classes, and I certainly cannot afford to pay back my loans if I am falsely accused of cheating.  The frustrating part is that final decisions are made by a board of students. This seems unfair, as students probably tend to side with professors (the accusers), not the students (accused).  I cannot sleep at night thinking about this. I don't even know how to write an opening or closing statement. Any advice on what I can do to resolve this situation would make a world of difference.  Thank you for reading."	Yes
I thought i'd come get a more informed opinion before I go forward with this.    I'm a student at a public university in the NC state system. Our recreation center provides a specific kind of barbell in the weight room for student usage, it is a 20kg weightlifting bar meant for males.    This type of barbell is also made for women with different specifications; shorter length and thinner diameter, as these characteristics are better suited for female athletes/exercisers. Our recreation center does not provide an equal amount, or even one, women's weightlifting bar. We have plenty of female students that would benefit from having them.    Based on a cursory overlook of the Title IX provisions am I on solid ground bringing this to the attention of the recreation center management? I feel as though they'd be forced to act on it immediately to provide more equipment and thus equal access/opportunity for both sexes.    Any input or corrections would be appreciated.	Yes
My phone was ringing in class and my instructor took it away and refused to return it until September. Do I have legal rights to retrieve my phone since it's my property?  (BC, Canada)	Yes
This happened several years ago, when I was about 13 years old.   I verbally threatened to kill a classmate. I was just a dumb 13 year old, and no reasonable person should have taken me seriously.  My school principal told me that I would get an 80 day suspension, but yet she never contacted my parents. And I never told my parents because I didnt want them to know.  Then, for the next 2 weeks, monday to Friday I was instructed to sit in an uncomfortable wooden chair and do nothing at all for the whole day every day. This is 9 am to 3 pm, sitting in a chair doing nothing but staring at a wall for 10 days. (2 weeks). Nobody to talk to and nothing to do but look at the wall.  This is 60 hours of isolation. I felt like a prisoner in those isolation things.   Then abruptly, she told me that my punishment is done. I never received any paperwork or documentation of anything at all. I found her reaction incredibly harsh.  Was I morally abused?  Is there any legal action that should have been taken at the time? Is there any legal action that can be taken now, year later?	Yes
"I am writing this post on behalf of a friend who I know very well and has found himself in a frustrating predicament and is in need of some advice. Background Story: My friend obtained a grant to carry out and complete a Master's dissertation in Chemistry which he has to finish by September or else risk having to pay the grant himself, which he cannot afford.  What Happened: My friend was assigned to a completely new tutor/supervisor, lets call her Dr. Smith for simplicity's sake. This is Dr. Smith's first year working at University and is thus supervising her first two students who she is being abusive against. The problem first started when my friend cordially disagreed with Dr. Smith on how a particular calculation should be worked out - a classical example of a student not agreeing with his teacher and the teacher taking it completely the wrong way (the displacement defense mechanism).  The latter is just the tip of the iceberg, on several occasions she has called my friend 'stupid' to his face (and even his colleague) in an aggressive tone. Her personality is what I would describe as toxic and straight out abusive. It got to a point where my friend had to be careful of everything that he does, says or asks because of a possible tantrum by Dr. Smith. This took a toll on my friend so he approached Dr. Smith and told her that she was being too aggressive and was intimidating him. Once again Dr. Smith took it completely wrong, not only was she completely oblivious to how abusive she has been but she accused my friend of being aggressive, not working hard enough and at times, intimidating her. Now I know my friend really well and if I had to describe him I would say that he's extremely passive, smart and hardworking so her accusations genuinely dumbfounded me. My friend realized that his chat clearly got him nowhere and made things a lot worse. Knowing that he needs Dr. Smith to complete his Master's degree, my friend decided to take the higher road and ""suck up"" to his supervisor so he sent her an apology email, hoping that if he would be the first to reach out and make a compromise to settle their differences Dr. Smith would TRY to do the same. WRONG, she did not even read his email and they got to a point where Dr. Smith kicked him out of the lab and told him that she is not going to work with him anymore. At this point, my friend is not completely screwed as she won't let him complete his dissertation so he setup a meeting with the faculty Dean to explain things to him which was unfruitful as she ended up 'hijacking' his meeting and turn it into a scolding session against him.  With no options left he decided to setup a meeting with the disciplinary board and he explained his case quite well in privacy this time and was quite convincing. Dr. Smith also had a meeting with the board and used my friend's apology email as leverage to falsely prove her point. It seems like the disciplinary board is more inclined to believe Dr. Smith because the apology email demonstrated my friend’s guilt (from their point of view) rather than the fact that he was willing to take the higher road as he is in need off of his tutor (however crazy she is).  My question now is, if the disciplinary board decided to side with Dr. Smith, what else can my friend do or who else should he turn to? The situation that he's in is not only unjust because he's going to be robbed of a Master's degree which he's so close to finishing but also because he will have to pay for the grant that he worked so hard to obtain, all because of a person who has personality issues and is good at hiding it/lie about it during disciplinary meetings. Should he find a legal advisor or attorney considering that he’s broke? Does he stand a chance in tribunal or court? Is taking legal action even worth it?  I apologize for posting such a long post, I did not realize that it was going to be this long and I am sincerely very grateful for any advice whatsoever as none of his friends seem to be able to think of a way to help him, hence why I am here."	Yes
"Hey everyone!  I'm a Canadian, wanting to attend a professional degree program in the US. I have some questions about US Education Law and would like to find a lawyer, but I'm currently in Canada where I'm assuming most Education Lawyers will be experts in law that is specific to Canada. Is it possible to ""meet"" with a lawyer remotely and where would be a good starting place to find such a lawyer?  Thank you."	Yes
This happened before states began to outlaw student teacher relationships even if the student was over the age of consent.  Essentially, when I was going through a rough time emotionally, I began receiving a lot of extra attention from a teacher. It started innocently and then progressed to emails, followed my phone calls, then texts, then flirting, some sexting and sending him pictures of me in skimpy negligees. When I graduated high school (he was still my teacher for a summer session) we began to go out on dates. He then came to my college to take control of the department I was majoring in and remained my teacher throughout college (we maintained a relationship during this time).   Now with all of the new legislation and scandals being unearthed (like the choate one) I'm wondering if I have an obligation to report this to someone (the school, his current employer which still has him around students all the time etc). I don't want to get him in trouble because I do still care about him and as far as I'm aware he didn't break any laws (except possession of child porn when I sent the negligee pics (if they count) but they are long gone from all of my electronic devices (this was before the cloud etc).   See the thing is, I don't know if what he did was wrong/ illegal. My therapist (when I was 17 and involved with him) told me to cut ties but never reported him. My guidance counselor at school knew because the man in question didn't have a drivers license so I drove him one on one to the practice he had at another school after ours was over and I once told my guidance counselor I may be late because of driving him and she said it was inappropriate but never followed up. I don't like thinking I was groomed or a victim (though he was emotionally abusive once he had me in the relationship).   I also have proof/know he did this with at least four other students.  So, if it happens in the future and I don't report it am I liable for what happens to any further students he becomes involved with?   Do I have a legal obligation to report it to the schools he works for?  I need to know if there's anything I need (or should) do from a legal standpoint.   I don't want to press charges (I can't he did nothing illegal with me) and I don't want to get him in trouble but I also don't want any other students to go through what I did and I what I know others did because of his narcissism (he's diagnosed) and emotional abuse.  Yes, I am in therapy for this and working through it and I know it's messed up that I care for him but I do. I just need to know what my legal obligations are.	Yes
I am 17. I live in California. I often wear a large butt plug to school because it feels good. A teacher found out I do this, gave me detention, and threatened to call my parents. I did nothing wrong. What do I do?	Yes
Ok this story that starts around a few months ago, My family was lower middle class but I was going to good school that I had only gotten into because of Dumb luck during my PSLE exam. I wasn't able to cope and my grades began to slip first in english but then in math and eventually science. When My parents became aware of my slipping grades they pressured me to improve it by all meen nesscary.  They stopped letting me leave the house and spread lies about me to my friends to drive the away to allow me to concentrate on my studies. I was already using coffe to stay up in order study enough but it just wasn't enough, soon I resoreted to Adderal in an attempt to keep up. It was a godsend that allowed me to keep up with my peers and stop the pressure with my parents, my parents were aware of my usage but thye laid down some ground rules.  I would only be allowed to use the drug as long as my grade were either Distinctions or Merits in all my subjects. They also said that I had to provide half the money for the drug habit and that they wouldn't pay for a laywer if I was caught.  I'v been caught by my school administration after some asshole took a picture of it and posted it on instagram. What should I do ?	Yes
So I received [this letter](http://imgur.com/a/spDd1) in the mail today along with a settlement check in the mail today.  This is the very first I've heard of a law suit against DeVry for fraudulent advertising.  I attended DeVry from 2010-12 and incurred significant student loans but never graduated.  The loan in question is actually in default and it would be absolutely amazing for my life if I could get out of paying it back.  That probably makes me sound like a horrible human being but I'll live with it if I can get out from underneath that mountain of debt.  I went to [the mentioned website](https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense) but I really don't understand if I qualify or not.  If anyone could advise I'd greatly appreciate it.	Yes
Due to an unexpected medical expense I have missed 2 payments on a student loan. This loan is in my name only and does not have a cosigner. I have a cosigner for another loan that is almost paid off and has never missed a payment. These are both private loans and are both serviced by Navient. My cosigner for the loan that has no missed payments called me yesterday to tell me that Navient has contacted him and told him that my loan has missed payments and is demanding that he make the payments that were missed. They made it seem like the loan he co-signed on is the one that is behind. This is not the case at all and i double checked to confirm. Are they allowed to do this? He is not listed on loan number 1 and has nothing to do with it. Is navient allowed to contact cosigners about loans they have not co-signed?	Yes
"I (EU citizen) moved to another EU country a while back and been learning their language for some years now. I changed the language school recently (end 2016) to be closer to my home and they informed me I can get B2 diplom before summer holiday which is great for me because I wanted to go to univercity here.  However due to (what I believe is their) mistake I am not able to do the exams in time and now I got to wait a whole year before I can apply for univercity.   Where did the mistake come from? Well when I switched to this new school I'll addmit my speaking was not the greatest however I had gotten a paper from the other school that I can be in a class where people learn to become B2 level, but they simply made me take their school test and marked me as level A2. For 2 months I was in a group where I felt I was not growing at all. I had 2 other classmates that were aiming to have B2 level and were about same level as me. Rest were complete beginners.  Here comes my biggest problem. Basically the teacher felt I was ready for the B2 books but the 2 other students were almost done with their B1 books so I needed to wait for them.   Second problem was that I was promised classic lessons (teacher teaches everyone) but instead we were divided into THREE groups and teacher jumped between all of them. To us tho, the least. Because to become B2 you need to work a lot on your own aperently. But what am I paying for? To speak with people that are just as bad in the language as me and there is no one to correct us? I can also work alone at home and not come to school at all.   It took 2 months to sort this situation to better but not ideal. I got a different teacher but the group situation remaind. Now instead of having 3 different groups we have 2. There is a lot more classical lessons but I still feel the tempo for us who wants to become B2 is slowed down due to the people who are aimimg to become B1.  After not bein fully satisfied I wrote a complaint e-mail to them and got no answer for a month and I sent a reminder but still got no answer for over half a year.   The reason I sent a second reminder is because I realised I needed to extend my contract for 2 extra month to be ready for exams... 2 months that I lost in the beginning.  They responded with that they do not understand what I am complaining about because they sorted the problem (havin 2 different language level groups in one group instead of 3) and therefor do not undernstand what I want.  After mentioning the money wasted for the 2 months they now want to schedule a meeting with the teacher I had for 2 months. Yes i gave the times I'm available but I feel like they are completely dodging the fault they made not the teacher. Yes it was wrong of my teacher to say I need to work on my own for most of the time. BUT it is NOT the teachers fault of having so many students of so many different language levels.  I am afraid of getting an ""enemy"" that is not suppose to be my enemy. The teacher made mistakes but the biggest problems came from the school itself and every email I've gotten from them is so passive and not acknowledging anything and just blaming it on someone else.  What should I do in the meeting? What should I be prepared for? I will definetly make preperations of all problems I have with them (this isn't the only one) but my biggest fear is that I can not stand my ground because I have to do it in THEIR language. I was wondering of asking to record the conversation but I can understand if the teacher that is dragged into this doesn't want to be recorded. What should I do then?  My apologies if this isn't the correct subreddit. Just point me to the right direction and I'll post it there instead.  Tl;dr: language school made me waste 2 months. Missed applying to univercity because I couldn't do language exams on time due to wrong class placement. School makes me have meeting with them and the teacher. Teacher very little at fault. What should I do during the meeting?"	Yes
I'm trying to enroll my child in kindergarten. I attended pre-reg in April and provided my lease and copy of utilities. All utilities are in my name. On lease my name is listed under occupants, but my step mother is the primary lease holder. (She signed for me 2 years ago when I first got back to the US because of the employment gap.)    Received letter stating that I am required to appear with the primary lease holder in person on a specific date/hours next week for her to sign an affidavit saying I live there. Apparently this is a new county wide requirement put in place specifically to [irrelevant opinion.] She cannot be here for it. She can't leave work and she lives out of state. They said she can't have it signed and notarized not in person. (She has never lived in the apartment and signed online. Basically my guarantor or whatever.)  I called the school board and they said a wordier version of too bad and that she has to come. Another woman in the kindy office said to show up alone and plead my case, but she has no authority and could tell I was frustrated. I'm assuming I have to miss work and show up alone, but do I have any leg to stand on to get her enrolled?  Don't they have to enroll even homeless kids?	Yes
When i started, and was attending university, my father never let me see any of the paper work, i was there on grants, which covered my tuition (and according to my father, my housing as well) i was never given any information regarding my finances regarding my time there, all of it was sent to his email, this went on for four years, i asked pretty regularly to see the paper work (student emails saying forms were due when i asked generally FAFSA and what have you) during my last semester i received an email saying i needed to take an online loan repayment course (this came from the school to my student email) so i went to the studentloan.gov site only to find i had an account byt could not sign in, upon further investigation i found my father had made the account and the emails from the sites routed to his email. I asked him about this many times and he delflected the question and blame. Later that year my older sister who had graduated was informed she had students loans taken out during her time (mind younshe was on the same set of grants as i) so i decided to dig around in my student information from my school, low and behold over 35k in student loans i never knew about. Or signed for.    Is there legal action i can take to help this at all? I the only reason i went to college to begin with was because I was told my grants/scholarship paid for everything.  Important note, my father has also commited various amounts of identity theft on myself, my mother and my sisters. Going so far as to take all the equity out of the house i grew up in and lose the house.  Tldr version: My father signed papers with my name agreeing to accept government loans to pay for housing in college and kept me in the dark about it.  Please help, im not a savant on this kind of thing and need advice.	Yes
I was falsely moved to special ed in third grade. My disabilities do not affect my intelligence (dyslexia, dysgraphia and ADHD) I know people you have the the same / similar at my school and are not in Special Ed. And I would like to know if I could pursue legal action.	Yes
During one of my semesters at college I had to have nerve surgery on my arm and was not given accommodations despite bringing evidence to the accommodation office of having surgery. Upon my return with my arm in my sling I still was given no option to reschedule a test. I told my teacher that I had doctors orders to stay in bed and he outright refused to accomadate me. Do I have a claim? 	Yes
I currently work at an RV park up here in Alaska. We offer long term, monthly stays for people wanting to stay for months or years on end. It's kind of a common thing up here for RVers to do, as it's cheaper than paying rent at most apartment complexes and alot of times, when people move up here, they'll stay in an RV until they can find a home to buy. We've run into a hang up though we haven't had to deal with in the time we've owned the Park (2 generations).    We have someone who owes a TON of back rent for there lot (2 months worth). We've attempted to get ahold of them, and we let them know we'd be moving there RV into our storage if they didn't pay something, or at least talked to us to arrange something. But we haven't heard anything from them in over a month now, and we haven't seen anyone go to the RV. Heck they had a freezer full of frozen, rotten, halibut.    We eventually just went ahead and moved all of there property into our storage area. Including a panel van, deep freezer, trailer and a large 5th wheel with all of it's possessions inside. Well me and the boss have been talking the last week or so on what we're going to do, and how we're going to be able to get the money they owe us, when they're not even bothering to contact us.    So the advice we're looking for, is whether or not we can Seize property for unpaid lot rent. Or if there was a law that allowed us to file for possession of abandoned property, in the state of Alaska.	No
Lease expired June 30th. In Florida landlords have 15 days to return the deposit if there are no claims and 30 days to send an itemized list of claims if there are any.  On July 10th I sent LL a text with my new address which was acknowledged by him. By this time I had also set up mail forwarding with the post office from the address of the old house.  On July 31st (31 days after the lease ended) I sent him a text asking him if the deposit was in the mail and headed to the new address. He replied thanks for the reminder, he'll send it tomorrow.  Today, he texted me that cleaning cost $350 for the whole house, and that was some minor wear and tear but that he wouldn't charge me for it, and that he'd put a check in the mail today for $1800. The problem with this math is that the security deposit was $2250, not $2150. He is likely confused because that was the security deposit and rent from the year previous.  My thoughts on the cleaning itself: he was having the house cleaned ON the 30th. We handed over the keys on the 29th. He was also talking about getting cleaning people to the house weeks before the end of the lease. He was asking us to leave us the keys early if possible to facilitate him having them there before the lease ended. I believe that the house was not dirty beyond the level of 'normal wear and tear.' It needed routine dusting and mopping, but nothing beyond that. However, I made the mistake of not taking pictures on my way out, so I'm not sure if I have a leg to stand on there. I did take pictures when we moved in, and there was trash in the backyard and drywall dust and paint inside. $350 is also a lot to clean an 1800 sqft house.  Another thing he did that I'm not sure is relevant or not: he failed to give me a receipt for the security deposit per the FL statute, which should have disclaimed the bank it was being held at and whether it was accruing interest or not.   My plan is this:  1) Stop texting him. Start communicating via certified mail (which is actually also how he was supposed to notify me of claims in the first place according to the statute)  2) After I get the check, DONT cash it, and send a certified letter with the following information (summarized):  * Say that I was your tenant at address X until June 30th, and paid my rent regularly. I cooperated with handing the keys over a few days early to accomodate your request, stated over a week in advance, for cleaning.  * State the timeline of the texts that went back and forth, and that I have received his check (I actually haven't yet, but I want to prepare the letter so I can send it out on the same day I get the check)  * State that the refund is not accepted, and while I do object to the claim itself, more importantly, he's forfeited his right to claim the security deposit per florida statute  83.49(3). Statute attached.  * Even if the claim were legitimate, the $1800 is not correct because the total deposit was $2250.   * For the reasons above, I request that you mail the full security deposit in the amount of $2250 to my address below. A failure on your part to do so within 15 days will result in court action on my part. Please note that the prevailing party in court actions of this nature are also entitled to their court costs and attorney fees.  **My questions are the following:**  **Is there anything wrong with the content of  my letter or my plan? I thought it would be best to not go into the detail of the cleaning objection and stick to the deadline thing.**  **Am I leaving myself open to him simply returning the deposit and then him suing me for the cleaning? The statute says he may file an action for damages after return of the deposit. That would suck because if my case for that is bad I'd be out HIS attorney fees and court costs in that separate action.**   Statute: http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0000-0099/0083/Sections/0083.49.html  &gt;(3) The landlord or the landlord’s agent may disburse advance rents from the deposit account to the landlord’s benefit when the advance rental period commences and without notice to the tenant. For all other deposits:  &gt;(a) Upon the vacating of the premises for termination of the lease, if the landlord does not intend to impose a claim on the security deposit, the landlord shall have 15 days to return the security deposit together with interest if otherwise required, or the landlord shall have 30 days to give the tenant written notice by certified mail to the tenant’s last known mailing address of his or her intention to impose a claim on the deposit and the reason for imposing the claim. The notice shall contain a statement in substantially the following form:  &gt;This is a notice of my intention to impose a claim for damages in the amount of __________ upon your security deposit, due to _________ . It is sent to you as required by s. 83.49(3), Florida Statutes. You are hereby notified that you must object in writing to this deduction from your security deposit within 15 days from the time you receive this notice or I will be authorized to deduct my claim from your security deposit. Your objection must be sent to (landlord’s address) .  &gt;If the landlord fails to give the required notice within the 30-day period, he or she forfeits the right to impose a claim upon the security deposit and may not seek a setoff against the deposit but may file an action for damages after return of the deposit.  &gt;(b) Unless the tenant objects to the imposition of the landlord’s claim or the amount thereof within 15 days after receipt of the landlord’s notice of intention to impose a claim, the landlord may then deduct the amount of his or her claim and shall remit the balance of the deposit to the tenant within 30 days after the date of the notice of intention to impose a claim for damages. The failure of the tenant to make a timely objection does not waive any rights of the tenant to seek damages in a separate action.  &gt;(c) If either party institutes an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to adjudicate the party’s right to the security deposit, the prevailing party is entitled to receive his or her court costs plus a reasonable fee for his or her attorney. The court shall advance the cause on the calendar.	No
My 50's mother in currently in a temp (6 month full-time I think) position and a permanent position opened in the vacancy of her coworker, same job just permanent.  She was told not to apply because it would interfere with her position possibly going permanent. Within a week of that, the application on the other position closed and she was also told her job was not being changed to permanent. They were going to close her temp and open an identical perm job in her slot that doesn't have a new application period but is pulling from the list of candidates from the job she was told not to apply for. She was told afterward that they were specifically looking for someone 'energetic and outgoing' in both positions. Given the fact that she was told she might be changed over, and was told she wasn't right after application closed, it is really fishy. Is this a defendable age discrimination case?	No
"Throwaway, because this is just gross and I'm embarrassed.   Monday afternoon, my toilet stopped working. It will fill and then drain over the course of an hour, but doesn't actually flush. I did my due diligence, plunged it for an hour, tried the baking soda/vinegar thing, etc. No dice.   I called my landlord's agent (The place is owned by a man and his son. The daughter, his agent, picks up the rent, fixes issues, etc.) regarding another issue and told her I was heading to the store to get a drain snake because the toilet wasn't working.   She said ""Oh, no. You too?""  Turns out apartments 1-4 don't have functioning toilets. I asked how long it would be before they're fixed, she said she didn't know and that she would need to talk to her father and brother.   It's Saturday now and we still don't have functioning toilets. Since Monday I've been having to pee in the bathtub and drive to a nearby store if I need to poop.   Well, the store is closed today and I was forced to put a plastic bag in an old water pitcher to take a poop and I am beyond fed up. I feel humiliated. I can't have company in my home because the toilet doesn't work and there's old poop in it that can't be flushed and combined with the heat we're having it smells god awful.  I called and called and all I've been told is that they don't know when the toilets will be fixed because ""it's going to be really expensive"" and they apparently don't have the money.   What do I do? This is ridiculous. I know by law we must have functioning toilets, but who can I report this to in order to get something done?   If nothing can be done, can I just move out? I'm on a month-to-month lease, which I know normally requires a (30 day?) notice, but I can't be here 30 days without a toilet."	No
So I know there are tons of gaming news websites out there and all of them use screenshots, but I'm a newbie when it comes to the legal aspect.  Am I required to ask the game developer/publisher for permission? Do I have to reference the source?   Or can I just freely publish any screenshots I took myself of the game in the context of news or updates to the game.  Any help would be appreciated.	No
"My children were removed from my home last August after my husband made a false report that got me arrested and released with no charges. The DHS complaint and arrest was for my husband alleging that I held him and the children hostage at gun point. However, my husband admitted to the DA, DHS, and PD that he lied about the incident. My husband was never arrested or investigated for filing a false report.   My husband (who I now have a restraining order against and am in the process of divorcing) failed his court ordered psych eval, and I passed my court ordered psych eval. In court two weeks ago, I was ruled the only viable parent by DHS.   DHS is refusing to give my children back unless I admit to criminal activity per the caseworker verbally telling me that repeatedly.   The children have been with my family since last August. My family doesn't support me (except for my father) due to the caseworker telling them that DHS knows for a fact that I committed a gun crime.   I have no mental health diagnoses (a psychologist certified it), I have no substance abuse issues (random UA and medical records proved it), I have a clean background (I have never been charged with a crime, and I have never been arrested before my husband made his allegations), I have a clean, safe, and stable home (DHS and service providers have been there to prove it), I have a job (I am capable of providing for my children), I have been engaged in every service recommended by DHS without hesitation, and I have completed the Action Plan created by DHS (except for the 32 week domestic violence course which I have 22 weeks left).  My court appointed attorney will not defend me or advocate for me due to his stated reason of not wanting to make the caseworker get mad and quit her job (he blames me for making the last caseworker quit his job due to being scared of my husband). He has stated to a service provider, my father, and myself that I made the last caseworker quit his job. My lawyer calls me needy, says that it's my fault that my husband stalked/beat me, and he has repeatedly stated, ""It's not my job to explain the state's case against you. I don't know the case, it's complicated."" He has been my lawyer for almost a year.   A few days ago, the caseworker told my lawyer that I sent my parents hostile e-mails after court which proved that I was an unsafe and unstable parent. I never sent them e-mails, and I gave the caseworker and my lawyer a statement provided by my father denying the caseworkers allegations. After I provided my father's statement, the caseworker has refused to communicate with me. My lawyer, a former prosecutor, is trying to get me to admit to sending the e-mails and has not commented on my father's statement denying the allegations. My lawyer will only say that he is waiting to get a copy of the e-mails (that don't exist) before he will comment about them.   The caseworker told my mother, brother, and sister in-law that it is their legal duty to report to her every time they learn that my father speaks to my lawyer. The caseworker also told my mother, brother, and sister in-law that my father has to legally give her the contents of private and privileged communication between my father, my lawyer, and myself. My family (my brother and sister in-law are the foster family and my mother lives with them to care for the children) has been pressuring my father to give them the communication between my father, my lawyer, and myself so that they can give it to the caseworker. My refusal and my father's refusal to give the caseworker private and privileged communication is being seen by DHS and my family as me being an unsafe and unstable parent. My lawyer refuses to comment or intervene on my behalf regarding this matter (he also refuses to comment or intervene on most things).  DHS is threatening to adopt out my children per my lawyer and my family.   TLDR; My lawyer won't put me in front of a judge so that I can fire him. I'm drowning due to not having competent representation."	No
My daughter turns 18 in 5 months and has one year of high school left. She is severely mentally ill after being sexually abused by her bio dad for six years, and she has lived with me since January of 2016. Her bio dad is in jail awaiting sentencing.   She threw a coffee mug at me tonight as hard as she could because I asked her to pick up her belongings in the living room, she went to bed without doing it, and I immediately asked her to please get up and do it. When she did she was yelling at me the whole time, throwing things, etc. Long story short, we were arguing and she threw the mug at me. I covered my face, and it hit me in the ribs. She picked it up to throw it at me again, and I held her wrist and asked her to please put it down. She dug her nails into my arm before slamming it onto the table. She also broke a knitting needle in half and threatened to stab me in the neck with it.   After she went to her room I had my husband change the wifi password, and told her we would talk about it tomorrow. She decided to try to punish us by playing music really loudly, and when we told her we weren't going to let her use the wifi regardless she left. It was around 11:30pm at this time.   This is not the first time she has gotten violent with me. She also rescinded her consent to allow her therapist and doctors to speak with me, and she has not been to see her therapist in over a month. She won't allow me to have access to her meds, nor will she tell me what she is taking. She has broken our property, punched holes in the walls, broken the bathroom sink. I have had her hospitalized before. I should have called again tonight, but I'm just so exhausted with her. And I'm legit scared of her.   I suspect she went to her boyfriend's house. I was unable to call his father because she had her boyfriend block my phone number on his dad's phone. I was able to send him an email through the form on his business website just to give him a heads up.   I don't want her coming home without being able to communicate with her doctors and therapist at the bare mininum. Really at this point I would rather she not return home at all because she is completely uninterested in cooperating with me of following the house rules to even the barest degree. What are my options? I would like to still keep her safe as much as I can, but I don't feel safe with her living here anymore.	No
The card was expired so the transaction didn't go through. The address the person used is very close to where I live. I would like to report this, but I'm not sure where to start. Is this a lost cause?	No
"I have lived in the same apartment for 1.5 years and my renewed lease began July 1 (1 year lease). Coincidentally, I have been having bug issues since the beginning of July. I think it begins in early June when I heard an animal crawling in my wall. I made a service request to get it removed and the response was along the lines of, ""yes we have received multiple calls on multiple buildings with animals but there's nothing we can do this evening."" I think it died in my wall. Fast forward to early July, I begin to see big flies in my apartment, 1-3 at a time, as days past upwards of 5 flies. I keep killing them and think maybe it's the Texas heat bringing flies inside. I go buy fly strips, request a pest spray in my apartment and hope for the best. The repeat flies go on for a week or so and I continually look for cracks, open windows - nothing. My girlfriend starts to complain about a musky smell, I may be used to it at this point. Then one night I come home late and there are over 30 flies in my apartment! I couldn't believe it. I pack a bag and go to my friends house.  The next day I make an online service request and go to the office face-to-face. I bring up the fact that I made an animal request because I heard one in the walls a month ago and maybe it died. She said they could be it, they spent over $15k to patch holes in roofs and set traps (I want to call her fib because I don't believe they did) and the best they say they can do is go in my apartment and cut holes in the walls and maybe find something. They do and ""don't find anything"". The flies are swarming toward the window, and before anyone asks yes I am fairly clean as I don't leave food out, clean my dishes and occasionally leave a dish to be cleaned later in my sink. This is 30 flies. I have to stay at a friends for the next few days, and tomorrow (Monday) they are going to fog and clean my apartment, I have stayed one night because the flies are now gone I find that strange and now I'm worried they've laid eggs everywhere.   Now I'm dealing with carpet beetles. Small bugs keep poking up from the carpet and I keep vacuuming them up. I've had enough of this, I truly want to leave this apartment. Either a new complex or new apartment. What are my rights in this situation? Or, if I can't move, how do I make certain these issues are resolved?   I apologize for any odd formatting as I typed this on my phone. If any more description needs to be added about this situation please ask."	No
Title explains it pretty well. I just got sucker punched by my alcoholic scum fuck of a brother for the last time, and my mother told me to 'get a grip'. My name is on the lease, so my main worry right now is getting a legal document with airtight wording to get him out. He has drank, smoked, and snorted himself into psychosis, and as a result, isn't of sound mind, hence the sucker punching his younger brother, paranoia, et cetera. He is violent, unruly, and poses a threat to my well being and quality of life, as well as my mother's. Can you guys help me word the document? I live in Nova Scotia, Canada, for reference.	No
I am in Ohio, my mother lives in FL, owns a home there and an undeveloped piece of land in PA. My brother, only sibling, lives in TX and will be the executor of the estate. I will want to disclaim any interest in the PA and FL properties (although not the contents of the FL house). Questions: 1) Is an estate lawyer the right type of legal expertise I need? 2) Does anyone have any specific recommendations of an estate lawyer here in Columbus, OH that could help me with this? Or do I need to find someone in PA and FL? If so, any specific recommendations for Treasure Lake, PA and Punta Gorda FL would be greatly appreciated. 3) Is this kind of assistance usually flat fee or hourly? Thank you in advance.	No
Hello, I was wondering if someone on here could help point me in the right direction.    Back in March 2017 my 18 year old daughter contacted me and asked me to come pick her up and asked if she could live with us.  She had been out on her own since Jan 2016 when her and her mom got into a fight and her mom kicked her out.    I jumped on a plane immediately and flew to NC to pick her up.  After getting her settled in and enrolled and transfered in to the local High School I decided to contact the OAG to file a change of status and termination of CS.   The OAG mailed me the required forms and gave me instructions on how to prove her residency. Which I sumbitted per their request.    Now child support was due to terminate in June 2017 so there was merely 3 months of payments left from a 17 year history of the order. I did not want my ex to have anything she did not deserve especially once I learned my daughter had essentially been homeless since Jan 2016.   The AOG placed the moneys on hold while they verified the change.  Months went by.  Finally received a status update from the AOG on June 20th 2017.  However it was not was I was hoping for.  They informed me that with out the other parents signature stating she is giving me credit for those three months the AOG states they can not return the money to me.    The OAG claims it is their policy but refused to give me documentation stating the legal procedure claiming it is not public record.    It has been one month since they mailed my ex wife the documentation and she never responded.  I called the AOG and asked them what the next step was and they told me they do not have an answer for me.  I asked to speak to a Supervisor who ended up just contacting someone else who is going to send another letter to my ex wife inwhich will go straight to the trash.    So my question is what policy is the OAG following that stipulates they must have a response from the other party to determine status change?  They claimed it is not public record when I asked about such policy.  Also if I were to file a suit in court on what grounds would I file since the court order has already expired since my daughter is 18 and has now graduated?    A lawyer would cost too much in comparison to what the AOG is holding.   Any advice would be appreciative.	No
"6/12/17 my roommate called maintenance for a dish washing machine that wasn't draining and smelled like something was burning. I have never personally used the dishwasher here but I understand that I'm still somewhat responsible for it.  6/13/17 3rd party repair guy comes in for 25 minutes noting: ""Ran through cycle OK. Lower rack was in backwards preventing top rack from washing due to spray tower miss aligned. Odor from sitting open not used."" $80 was billed to the land lord which they have passed along to us.  7/3/17 Land Lord received the bill from the 3rd party maintenance.  7/21/17 My land lord typed up a bill for $80 saying we have 10 days to pay or submit a written dispute within 10 days time- the resident accepts responsibility for this bill and must pay immediately. After 10 days Land lord will not accept a dispute letter for review. Per Section XX:   &gt;Material Noncompliance by Tenant Which Can Be Remedied by Repairs, Cleaning, or Replacement. If Tenant commits a material noncompliacne that can be remedied by repair, cleaning, or replacement, Landlord may make the repair, cleaning or replacment, and the itemized bill fro same will be submitted to the Tenant as an obligation that will be due and payable as addiitonal Rent within ten (10) days or as provided in the written notice to Tenant such obligation shall be due as additional Rent payable at the next Rent due date.  7/24/17 Letter post marked   7/29/17 Mail checked by tenant (Me)  Firstly Do I need to submit written dispute by 8/3/17 which is 10 days from the post mark. Or 7/31/17 when the letter is dated?   Secondly the roommate who made the work order months ago has since moved out and another tenant has signed the lease in his place. This is where the bigger issue is, two of the roommates currently on the lease are not legally on the lease until 7/31/17. I would have no problem splitting the bill with the roommate who was on the lease and called in the work order. But since he isn't on the lease as of 7/31/17 he doesn't feel responsible.  My other issue is that the dishwasher still doesn't drain, smells like something is burning, and has hardly been used. I wash my dishes by hand. It cleans them better, uses less water and I hardly use any dishes.   So the dishwasher is still in the same state as it was when the work order was called. If I am paying for something it better damn well be fixed not just inspected.  [Here's the Virginia Law on ""Material Noncompliance""](https://vacode.org/2016/55/13.2/5/55-248.31/)   § 55-248.31  &gt; Noncompliance with rental agreement; monetary penalty &gt;  &gt; A. Except as provided in this chapter, if there is a material noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or a violation of § 55-248.16 materially affecting health and safety, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice if the breach is not remedied in 21 days, and that the rental agreement shall terminate as provided in the notice.  &gt;  &gt; B. If the breach is remediable by repairs or the payment of damages or otherwise and the tenant adequately remedies the breach prior to the date specified in the notice, the rental agreement shall not terminate.  &gt;  &gt; C. If the tenant commits a breach which is not remediable, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the breach and stating that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained elsewhere in this chapter, when a breach of the tenant’s obligations under this chapter or the rental agreement involves or constitutes a criminal or a willful act, which is not remediable and which poses a threat to health or safety, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement immediately and proceed to obtain possession of the premises. For purposes of this subsection, any illegal drug activity involving a controlled substance, as used or defined by the Drug Control Act (§ 54.1-3400 et seq.), by the tenant, the tenant’s authorized occupants, or the tenant’s guests or invitees, shall constitute an immediate nonremediable violation for which the landlord may proceed to terminate the tenancy without the necessity of waiting for a conviction of any criminal offense that may arise out of the same actions. In order to obtain an order of possession from a court of competent jurisdiction terminating the tenancy for illegal drug activity or for any other action that involves or constitutes a criminal or willful act, the landlord shall prove any such violations by a preponderance of the evidence. However, where the illegal drug activity is engaged in by a tenant’s authorized occupants, or guests or invitees, the tenant shall be presumed to have knowledge of such illegal drug activity unless the presumption is rebutted by a preponderance of the evidence. The initial hearing on the landlord’s action for immediate possession of the premises shall be held within 15 calendar days from the date of service on the tenant; however, the court shall order an earlier hearing when emergency conditions are alleged to exist upon the premises which constitute an immediate threat to the health or safety of the other tenants. After the initial hearing, if the matter is scheduled for a subsequent hearing or for a contested trial, the court, to the extent practicable, shall order that the matter be given priority on the court’s docket. Such subsequent hearing or contested trial shall be heard no later than 30 days from the date of service on the tenant. During the interim period between the date of the initial hearing and the date of any subsequent hearing or contested trial, the court may afford any further remedy or relief as is necessary to protect the interests of parties to the proceeding or the interests of any other tenant residing on the premises. Failure by the court to hold either of the hearings within the time limits set out herein shall not be a basis for dismissal of the case.  &gt;  &gt; D. If the tenant is a victim of family abuse as defined in § 16.1-228 that occurred in the dwelling unit or on the premises and the perpetrator is barred from the dwelling unit pursuant to § 55-248.31:01 based upon information provided by the tenant to the landlord, or by a protective order from a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant to § 16.1-253.1, 16.1-279.1, or subsection B of § 20-103, the lease shall not terminate due solely to an act of family abuse against the tenant. However, these provisions shall not be applicable if (i) the tenant fails to provide written documentation corroborating the tenant’s status as a victim of family abuse and the exclusion from the dwelling unit of the perpetrator no later than 21 days from the alleged offense or (ii) the perpetrator returns to the dwelling unit or the premises, in violation of a bar notice, and the tenant fails promptly to notify the landlord within 24 hours thereafter that the perpetrator has returned to the dwelling unit or the premises, unless the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant had no actual knowledge that the perpetrator violated the bar notice, or it was not possible for the tenant to notify the landlord within 24 hours, in which case the tenant shall promptly notify the landlord, but in no event more than 7 days thereafter. If the provisions of this subsection are not applicable, the tenant shall remain responsible for the acts of the other co-tenants, authorized occupants or guests or invitees pursuant to § 55-248.16, and is subject to termination of the tenancy pursuant to the lease and this chapter.  &gt;  &gt; E. If the tenant has been served with a prior written notice which required the tenant to remedy a breach, and the tenant remedied such breach, where the tenant intentionally commits a subsequent breach of a like nature as the prior breach, the landlord may serve a written notice on the tenant specifying the acts and omissions constituting the subsequent breach, make reference to the prior breach of a like nature, and state that the rental agreement will terminate upon a date not less than 30 days after receipt of the notice.  &gt;  &gt; F. If rent is unpaid when due, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment, and of the landlord’s intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55-248.35. If a check for rent is delivered to the landlord drawn on an account with insufficient funds, or if an electronic funds transfer has been rejected because of insufficient funds or a stop-payment order has been placed in bad faith by the authorizing party, and the tenant fails to pay rent within five days after written notice is served on him notifying the tenant of his nonpayment and of the landlord’s intention to terminate the rental agreement if the rent is not paid by cash, cashier’s check, certified check, or a completed electronic funds transfer within the five-day period, the landlord may terminate the rental agreement and proceed to obtain possession of the premises as provided in § 55-248.35. Nothing shall be construed to prevent a landlord from seeking an award of costs or attorney fees under § 8.01-27.1 or civil recovery under § 8.01-27.2, as a part of other damages requested on the unlawful detainer filed pursuant to § 8.01-126, provided the landlord has given notice in accordance with § 55-248.6, which notice may be included in the five-day termination notice provided in accordance with this section.  &gt;  &gt; G. Except as provided in this chapter, the landlord may recover damages and obtain injunctive relief for any noncompliance by the tenant with the rental agreement or § 55-248.16. In the event of a breach of the rental agreement or noncompliance by the tenant, the landlord shall be entitled to recover from the tenant the following, regardless of whether or not a lawsuit is filed or an order obtained from a court: (i) rent due and owing as contracted for in the rental agreement, (ii) other charges and fees as contracted for in the rental agreement, (iii) late charges contracted for in the rental agreement, (iv) reasonable attorney fees as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law, (v) costs of the proceeding as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law only if court action has been filed, and (vi) damages to the dwelling unit or premises as contracted for in the rental agreement.  &gt;  &gt; H. In a case where a lawsuit is pending before the court upon a breach of the rental agreement or noncompliance by the tenant and the landlord prevails, the court shall award a money judgment to the landlord and against the tenant for the relief requested, which may include the following: (i) rent due and owing as of the court date as contracted for in the rental agreement, (ii) other charges and fees as contracted for in the rental agreement, (iii) late charges contracted for in the rental agreement, (iv) reasonable attorney fees as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law, unless in any such action the tenant proves by a preponderance of the evidence that the tenant’s failure to pay rent or vacate was reasonable, (v) costs of the proceeding as contracted for in the rental agreement or as provided by law, and (vi) damages to the dwelling unit or premises.  &gt;"	No
Hi legaladvice, I recently just managed to break a lease with a terrible property management company. They did many unethical things, such as going into my unit without my permission, trying to not send back the security deposit, outrageous deductions with no proof of receipt, intentionally ignoring calls and emails, etc. The company is extremely unethical, I'm not sure how they are even still around.   They did things such as: 1) Trying to charge me for wear and tear. 2) Purposefully saying that my emails didn't go through when I had proof that they did, and charging me for 'late' fees 3) Entering my unit to do the move out check without me, claiming that I contacted them and told them they could (?) 4) Refusal to send my security deposit until I told them it was past the 21 days, and when I finally reached them and threatened to sue, they sent a letter that was dated of the day that I emailed them, but lied to me and said they sent it out earlier 5) They deducted me over $1000 of my security deposit for 'trash left at unit' and 'wall damage' 6) When I told them that they were responsible for wear and tear and that $1000 is outrageous for trash, they refused to give me receipt or list of charges, and started to email me 7) When I threatened to sue again, they tried to bribe me, by saying they would return 1/3 of the deposit.   I contacted my neighbors and made a post on yelp, and I found that MANY people were in my similar situation. Many people contacted me saying they were in a similar situation and that they were opening a small claims court case. At this time, 6 people contacted me saying that they were in a legal case with the housing corporation and that the exact same things happened to them.  I know I'm definitely going to try to take legal action if I can, but I was wondering if there's anything else I can do, given that there's so many people with the same complaints as me. Is it possible to say, form a class action suit? I have suspicions (but no proof) of this company doing other terrible things (such as starting a cancer fundraiser and pocketing the money) and I would hate for the worst thing to happen to them is just that they have to return the money that they rightfully owe.  Thanks!  Edit: California, Los Angeles!	No
(Throwaway for obvious reasons) I wor for a small business outside of Philly in PA, USA. My boss has an unsecured computer that both employees and customers are left alone with on a regular basis. He has never given us any instruction on what we can and cannot access on said computer. I was dicking around and I found that they keep massive caches of customer and employee information on the computer, with no password protection or anything. I found email lists with names and emails of all the customers; vet records for the dogs (it's a doggy daycare); email and phone number lists for all current and former employees, and a copy of each current employee's w-2, which list our social security numbers.   Can I pursue legal actions? And if so, what will probably happen?  They also have old texts and Facebook posts from employees screenshotted on the computer, but that seems like less of a legal issue and more of an ethical one.	No
"So this is going to be a long story, but I’ll make sure to add a TL;DR. I’m going to start in the beginning.  My parents bought a foreclosed house in what-I-though was a very nice, quaint, small Indiana town (however in the past 6 months, my perspective of the town has completely changed). It was a fixer-upper and once it was nice and livable they stayed there for a year, then decided to move back to their primary home and rent out the newly renovated home. First few tenets were all right, paid rent on time and kept a good line of communication with my parents-at least my dad who was the man in charge of getting the rent and writing out receipts. When our old tenets left because the couple were having marital issues, they broke the contract and gave us the keys to the house. No biggie (at this time, my dad did not do a formal lease including a leasing contract-my parents are traditional salt-of-the-earth immigrants from Mexico that attained citizenship in the 90s).  However, after my dad inspected the home after the couple left, he noticed they left in a bad shape. The neighbor-next-door love my dad and the elderly neighbor told my dad that her son is looking for a place and thought it would be nice to have him next door to her. My dad thought it would be a nice idea and knew the son to be a handy-man (later I would know for this to be complete BS) and trusted the son to fix up any repairs from the last tenet and my dad would lower the rent about 50 dollars. Deal was made, and the son moved in and got started on repairs around the house, such as holes in walls, holes in doors, broken window screen-minimal stuff.  The first month, we did not pay and took out what he spent on materials and didn’t pay rent. The wife was working at factory in-town and the man was stay-at-home working on things. Months passed and we didn’t get rent, as the wife was fired for starting a fight at work and couldn’t get ends met. We were lenient and told them to pay us as soon as they could. The tenet wanted then a formal lease contract so he could get a lawyer that was in charge of a trust fund to pay the rent due. The trust fund lawyer never got a hold of us, and the following month the tenet was arrested for paraphernalia of crystal meth. The following month, the wife of the tenet was also arrested for the same charges and by the start of this year-my parents were stuck with an abandoned property and rent due. Months past and no communication between the arrested tenets, while I reached out to tenets’ family members to get a response from them as to what to do with their personal belongings. No one was available or disposed to help the tenets. My dad decided to go to court and legally evict them and have a judge figure out what to do with their personal belongings. The initial court hearing ruled that the wife-who was out of jail sooner than the other tenet- were to go to the property and put things into a storage unit, so the house could be cleared out.   	Also, to give a glimpse of the amount of crap they had I’ll give you a mental image of a Goodwill store vomiting into a second-story home. Nascar posters and a large waterbed decorated the house-things were trash. Nothing of value was found at the house.  	The wife came and took things to the storage and my dad with his helpers made trips to her storage and fill it up with remaining things they had at the house. Once the storage was full, my dad moved things to a tool shed we have behind the house, but larger things such as furniture was left on the front porch-which we later got cited by the city. Everything was tossed and my dad had a city garbage truck takes loads of things away.  	A second court hearing was held earlier today, so my dad could get something figured out with the rent that was past due. They came into a payment agreement, however at the hearing the former tenet had a list of two pages of things that were missing and wants to claim property damage.   My questions are for my dad, do the tenets have a viable case against my dad for a property damage claim? If the property was abandoned and no communication was made with the landlord to remove the items and the storage was full, could the landlord be held responsible with the property hold it as private property?   The current situation of the rental property stands as everything is cleared out, my dad is working on repairs and hoping to continue to rent the house out or is thinking about having a property management take care of the house.   **TL;DR** Dad owns a rental property in small-town, USA. Dad leases it to dead-beat son of our next-door-neighbor. Fail to make rent. Tenets get arrested, leave rental property and their personal property abandoned.  Court decides to have them move things to storage unit, things get thrown out because unit gets too full. Now tenet wants to throw a claim for property damages."	No
"TLDR; Can I recover a portion of my ""lease termination fee"" (equivalent to 2 months rent) through small claims court, if my landlord fills my apartment within those two months?   Background: My wife and I purchased a new home with 4 months remaining on our apartment lease. We asked for leniency, offered a fair deal (full month of rent + security deposit), etc. but were ultimately shot down by our apartment manager.  The two options presented were:  1) Pay a two month lease termination fee.  2) Prepay the remaining lease (4 months), then be reimbursed any amount once a new tenant was found.   We put in a 30 day notice in mid June and received our monthly rent bill for July 1 through our move out date. Moved out of the apartment in mid July without issue. Today received a final bill, which included regular cleaning fees and the lease termination fee. We weren't ever given the chance to select option 1 or 2, I think he just went with the cheapest out of pocket route. I'm wondering if we should just tell them to bill us for the 4 months instead of the two month ""fee""? It's more out of pocket, but we would be reimbursed later.   The apartment is in a very desirable location (&lt;1 mile from the beach) and is a relatively good deal in terms of other options in the area. Our now vacant apartment is the only one available in the 70 unit complex. I don't think there will be issues renting the place and the manager is telling people it'd be available as soon as 7/24 (seems like he's trying to get someone in ASAP).   I know in California that the lessor can't collect double rent. I'm worried that since it is stated as ""Termination Fee"" that we wouldn't be able to collect anything in small claims court if they were to have someone move in on say Aug 1.  Any help is greatly appreciated."	No
My sister, Anne, (30s) is mentally ill. I am not sure of her exact diagnosis, but she has been on and off medication and in and out of therapy since we were teens.   She has a 3 year old with her ex, John, who lives 1 hour away; John is employed, responsible, and a good dad. My sister moved back in with my parents when they broke up shortly after my nephew was born.   Anne has custody during the week and one weekend a month. John gets Nephew three weekends a month. My other sister and I live out of state and don't engage with Anne or the situation much.   Anne and our parents have a volatile relationship. Anne doesn't work, does not parent, and loses her shit if my parents try to set boundaries or engage with my nephew when my sister doesn't want them to.   Without getting into details, there's all kinds of damaging shit happening to my nephew - including some concerns that triggered a visit from CPS.   Suffice it to say my sister is an unfit mother, and my parents have been in what has felt, to them, like an impossible situation. They've been terrified for my nephew's well-being and have been hesitant to lay down the law with my sister because she's so volatile. They've thought it was better to put up with the insanity as long as Nephew lived where they could keep an eye on him.  But things have apparently come to a head. My sister left my parents' house several weeks ago, taking Nephew with her. They're apparently staying at a friend's house. Again, my sister doesn't work.   The last time John and Anne met to do the handoff for John's weekend, Anne refused to turn over Nephew and John called the police. So there are files with police and CPS related to this situation.  John has told my parents he is pursuing sole custody, and my parents are supportive of this. They have spoken with John's attorney and will be fully cooperative. John's attorney sent a certified letter to my sister at my parents' house, but she hasn't lived there for a few weeks and has not come to pick it up.   As of now, Anne does not know this custody suit is happening, and I am concerned Nephew will be in physical danger once she finds out. She is obsessed with someone taking away her son and will absolutely lose her mind. She has had violent episodes with family in the past.  My questions: 1. Do my parents need an attorney? Not necessarily to pursue their own rights, but just to guide them through this to ensure the safety of Nephew.  2. I'm concerned my nephew might be in danger once Anne finds out about the custody suit. How should that whole thing be handled?   I'm actually terrified that she'll find out while she has my nephew and may hurt or kidnap him, when really the best scenario is that she finds out while Nephew is with John.   Is there anything that can be done to remove him from her care for his own safety while the custody suit is ongoing?  3. Is there anything I can do? I feel so helpless.  4. What are we (myself, my parents, my sister) not thinking of that we should be doing?  Our biggest goal right now is just to make sure that Nephew is physically safe, now and when Anne eventually finds out about the suit.	No
I (23) moved into a 4 bedroom unit here in Qld, Australia at the start of the year with a friend Caden (19), and I also invited two others from housemate websites. Jordan (23) and Luke (22) moved in and everything seemed fine, there was just the typical differences you would get between housemates.   At around the same time, 3 months in, Caden and Luke both got into relationships. This is completely fine, as Caden at most has his girlfriend over a couple times a week and he also goes to her house. But Luke on the other hand has his girlfriend over on average 5 nights a weeks, and mostly all through those days. She hasn’t ever had a conversation with us, and it’s very awkward when they come into the house and walk straight past us without any acknowledgement. I do go out of my way to say “hello, how are you?” as they pass and sometimes she replies, sometimes not.   They mostly hide out in his room the majority of the time, and occasionally use the kitchen. She showers here of course, and just today, Jordan spotted that she had moved her toothbrush/shampoo/conditioner and god knows what else into the guys shared bathroom.  Their sex is loud, excessive and the entire house can hear when they are doing it, even when we turn on the tv loud or play music. It wakes us up sometimes, and can be upto 4 times in one day.   Jordan, Caden and I all feel as if she is over way too much, and it’s like living with a 5th housemate, which we’ve all agreed we do not want. I would feel more at ease if we actually got to know her, which I’ve expressed to Luke but he doesn’t help us go through with this. I do like Luke as a person and I don’t want to cause any trouble, but moving her stuff into the guys bathroom indicates something needs to be done.  My parents, myself and Caden are on the lease, with plans to take off my parents and add Luke and Jordan on it at the end of the year. We can only have 4 people living here, so I’m unsure of how to navigate this. I don’t want her to move in, nobody does so I will not ask her for rent money. She does use utilities such as showering and whatnot, but considering they hang out in their bedroom most of the time. It’s a small house, probably only made for 3 people to live comfortably.   How do I talk to Luke about his girlfriend? I’ve left this go on too long and now they seem very comfortable just moving her stuff in. What have others done in this situation? Any advice is appreciated.	No
TL;DR My SO sometimes only gets 3 to 4 hours of sleep in between shifts. Is there any requirement for adequate time between shifts?    My girlfriend normally works a shift from 7am to 3pm. However they sometimes are needed to work mandatory overtime from 7pm to anywhere as late as 2 to 3am. Considering a modest commute of 20 minutes and night / morning routine, she ends up only getting maybe 3 hours of sleep some nights. It's also worrying because she has to drive a vehicle for work and might be too groggy to be on the road.     Are there any rules for giving time in between shifts? I researched briefly and only read something about 24 hour maximum working. She works for the county government so I assume they aren't doing any shady business but thought I should ask anyways.	No
"[Throwaway for legal reasons]  Hello everyone,  As the title says. I'm looking to divorce my wife. I've been out of the military since June 2016 and am now on Inactive Ready Reserves. We got married in October 2014. In April of 2015, she gave me 6000 dollars to put down on my vehicle. While in the military and once I got out I have been financially supporting her while she attended college full time. I am working full time and going to school full time. In March of 2016 we co-signed a vehicle which I am the primary holder. We have two dogs. I have been paying all the bills  Move Forward to now. I have moved out of the house. The house is her aunt's. I met a woman who I kissed(which will be talked later). That's it. Now she found out, and is threatening to take me to court if I don't pay her back the 6000 dollars and pay for the damages the dogs did to the house. She is also threatening to call my commander and tell them I committed ""adultery"". I am receiving VA benefits, and a disability check which she wants to take away. She wants me to pay for her bills until they add up to the 6000 dollars plus the damages. I am just looking for the best way to handle this because I'm honestly unsure of what to do.

Our landlord has charged us a $100 fee for denying access to our apartment for contractors to do repairs. They claim the contractirs sent them a bill because we denied access, and they passed the bill for rescheduling on to us.   We did not deny them access, we were not home at the time, and our superintendent has a key to out apartment, so they could have let them in if needed. The day before we had called our superintendent IF it was possible to reschedule to another day, but she said she wasn't sure and would look into it. After returning home to find no work had been done, we assumed all was well and the work would be rescheduled.  Our superintendent agrees with us that we only made a request, and did not deny access, however the property manager has ignored our argument and attempted to take the fee out of our deposit and last months rent interest. We have had no luck speaking with anybody who can resolve this issues, we just get passed from secretary to answering machine.  We have contacted legal aid and out universities legal department, but don't meet the criteria for them to help us, and we can't afford to spend hundreds of dollars to resolve a $100 issue. Any suggestions on where to go from here for advice would be great, we are in Ontario Canada if that helps. Thanks	No
I signed a lease contract that ended middle of July. The contract was signed months ago and specifically states the exact date that the lease would end on July 14th of 2017. I paid him a prorated amount that covered half of July, but he wants the full amount for the month. He says he will take me to small claims court if I don't pay him the full amount. Thank you for your help!  Some other details: -My original residence is in County A (to which I will return to when my lease ends) but rental location that I leased from him is hundreds of miles away in County B (to which he will return to after lease ends). If he does end up suing me in small claims court, will he sue me in County A or County B?	No

"We live in NC and currently the temperature is mid to upper 90's every day. Yesterday, I smelled a burning in our house, like a plastic burning, but could not find any source. It happened once or twice over the next hour or two then stopped. I thought it was weird, but didn't fret too much. The wiring in this house is very ""eccentric"" and I wrote it off.  That happened around 10 am. Around 1 pm I looked at the thermostat. It was ~84 F in the house when the temperature was set to 74 F. This had happened before so I wasn't super concerned. Last time it was because I had left the blinds on our large glass sliding doors up and they let a LOT of sun in. I shut the blinds.  The temperature didn't go down. At the behest of my fiance (I wanted to see if it cooled down over night) I called the land lord and told him that we needed an AC repair. This was thursday night.  Friday morning, the house had stayed the same temperature overnight. My fiance left to take an exam and I stayed in the house. By 9 am it was 90 F in the house. By noon it was 94. Through this I kept texting the landlord saying that this was an emergency and that we needed the fix asap. He stated that he had called the company his home warranty group contracts with and they were just waiting for the service number to come in.   (An aside: we rented this house specifically for this warranty. It was a selling point. ""You call me (landlord) and within 24 hours they will be in contact with you."" I checked the lease, he doesn't mention it. Of course.)  I call my fiance and organize taking our pets to her veterinarian office (she is a vet and works there) for the day, thinking that we'd get it repaired quickly. Around 3 pm the landlord tells me that due to large volume they wouldn't be able to come until 9 am to 1 pm MONDAY.  I tell him this is unacceptable. It is 99 F in our house. (It is hotter but our thermostat doesn't go into triple digits. Why would it?) I tell him that I know it's not his fault but he has failed us and that he needs to contract with a new repair company. He goes into some platitudes about how he knows it's hot but that he and his family have had to deal with it before. Just open the windows and reverse the fans. And he won't get a new company because it won't be under warranty. And this is an emergency call. The soonest anyone else could get out there was wednesday.  I then let my fiance handle him for a bit. She's chomping at the bit. After more runaround he gives her the same spiel about it being hard. She calls another repair company ""OurCityName Heating and Air"". They say they can be out here on Saturday (today) and it will cost $50 plus the cost of repairs.  We ask our landlord if we can hire them and prorate the rent for the repairs (assuming it's less than our rent). No again. Out of warranty. We try and explain that this is very expensive to us. We're in a new town and having to stay in hotels AND board our pets and that we need help.  Doesn't care.  So what can we do? Our house is literally unlivable right now. It's summer in the south. It's not getting cooler any time soon. We are having to pay out of pocket for lodging and board for our pets."	No
It seems that adult life has been set up in a way that makes things kind of complicated if you're trying to make financial decisions with someone who you are not married with. Some of the benefits of marriage include:  - Your spouse can make your medical decisions hassle free - If you're married your spouse can get health insurance through your job and you get the family rate if it's offered - Family leave is an option when you're married - Making big purchases is simpler  There seems to be so many benefits but I have no interest in getting married. Are there legal ways to get some of these benefits without getting married?   Location: Fl, US  Thanks reddit.	No
Hi r/legal! Recently split up with my s/o and am now in the process of setting up a new life for myself. While with s/o, we had an arrangement for rent/bills. Basically everything was split 50/50 including mortgage. The mortgage was paid off earlier this year and since February, we have both been setting aside money to pay property taxes and insurance at the end of the year. I still continued to pay my half of utilities while putting the property tax/insurance money aside in my savings account.   S/o is now asking me to give him all the money that I've saved up for that, now that I've left.   Am I legally obligated to pay him back?	No
"Hi Reddit! Thanks in advance for the help.  I am attempting to move out of an apartment that I currently live in in San Mateo, California. I alerted the landlord that I will be leaving yesterday, and he responded that I should have given 30 days notice as per the contract.   The 30 days notice before leaving (with a yearlong lease with a set end date) clause was not in the original contract. However, the landlord sent a notice 31 days ago which reads,   *""Dear Valued residents, Thank you for your concerned residency. Your rental agreement is about to expire and we would like to extend the offer for you to sign a new lease. Because of management changes, it is necessary for you to sign a new contract with us, even if you will be remaining on a month to month agreement. Below you will find your best available option to renew, as well as the rate for choosing a month to month agreement. New rental rates begin August 1, 2017.   Option I: 12 MO $2400   OPTION II : Month to month $2880   *If you do not respond to this notice by July 30, 2017, your rent will change per the month to month amount listed above. It is necessary for you to sign a new contract even if you are deciding to go month to month. If you are intending to move, please remember a written 30 day notice to vacate is required. So don't wait and renew today. Turn in the bottom portion of this letter to the Leasing Office and we will email your new lease paperwork to you. "" *   So I will alert them today that I will NOT be moving to a month to month lease. However, i am forced to break the 30-day notice rule. The only penalty stated on the original contract is that if I break the contract, they may choose to evict me within three days (which is fine, since the lease is up on the 31st.)  Is there anything I should know or do?  Thanks so much for reading."	No
Hi,   I am typing this in front of nice lake I am staying at the next a few days while this issue has been going on.     I signed a lease agreement back in March 2017 with a roommate for the period of Aug 2017 to July 2018. The end of June the roommate wanted to get out of the lease so I released him and took care of his part. On Aug 1st, I contacted the landlord to reschedule key pickup to the 2nd. On Aug 2nd, I again called landlord to schedule a key pick up and a walk through of the house. During this call, the landlord asked for the payment of Aug's rent plus last two months of the lease in advance because I do not have a co signer (foreign student). I asked the landlord if I can pay more than half ($2000) of the total amount $3600. And the rest will be paid in a week or two after receiving an international wire. They refused to comply and told me to pay the full amount or no keys. After the call, I read the lease agreement multiple times. And the clauses in the contract dont mention anything about paying last two months or even a co signer. However, the agreement of paying the last two months was only verbal back in March. One thing to mention, the contract has stated the amount of one month rent to receive the keys. Another thing, they have a late payment clause which 10% of the amount. Anyway, after deep thinking, I made an online pmt of $1200 which is August rent to put them legally liable in case of attorneys involvement. What do you think I should do in this case?    I am now living in my car the past few days. I am mentally exhausted and restless with lack of sleep and not sure what to do.   Thank you.	No
A little background about my living situation. I am located in Ontario and I have an apartment. Originally there were 3 people on the lease, over time they have moved on to other things and our lease has expired. I have been doing month to month since then.   About 6 months ago I informed my landlord that I would be letting another person move in since I have a spare bedroom and it would help with the bills. The landlord agreed and the person moved in. From there it has been nothing but an uphill battle. Our lease, which I still follow, specifies no pets, and they insist on keeping a cat in their room. It also doesn't help that I'm terribly allergic to them, but they refuse to remove it. This person also smokes marijuana frequently, which I don't particularly care what people do in their free time, but it's pretty disrespectful when they blatantly do it in their room and my entire home smells like it. Lastly, they have occasional guests, again which I'm fine with, I'm not fine when they stay for a month without any form of heads up. Plus minor damage here and there.  Anyways, I informed this person a week ago that I would no longer like to continue living together, and asked them kindly to leave within an appropriate amount of time. I wrote a letter outlining my wishes and as to why I feel they should leave, which I mentioned above, but they refused and said I had no legal ground to stand on to ask them to leave. This person has no agreement with the landlord, and nothing verbal or written with me other than I want x amount per month for rent/utilities.  Any advice on where to go from here would be appreciated.	No
So this was a weird day. Today my S/O was driving their car past our city's downtown bus terminal. An individual on a bus stole a bag from another passenger, and then attempted to flee the scene. While being perused by security, the individual ran out in front of my S/O's car and was hit. The person was lifted off their feet, slammed into the windshield, shattering it, and then proceeded to stand up and flee the scene. The individual was caught a few blocks over and taken to the hospital. My S/O was found not to be at fault by police at the scene, with many witnesses corroborating the events. So I'm just wondering what possible outcomes there are from here.. could this individual press charges against my S/O? Could the individual sue my S/O? Could my S/O sue? Really just wondering about any possible outcome.	No
"This happened in Dallas. I got cited for out of date registration in Dallas Thursday of last week. I took my car to get it inspected on Friday and plan to get the registration handled today.   However this morning a DPD police officer gave me another citation for the out of date registration. I showed him the earlier citation from the same police department and showed him how I was doing my due diligence on getting the inspection done so that I could get it registered.   He did not care. He told me that he ""Had no choice but to cite me.""   Now I am looking at 2 23.50 dollar fees at the dallas municipal courthouse. Its a 20 dollar dismissal fee plus 3.50 for using a card.   Does this not fall under double jeopardy since this is the same PD for the same violation?"	No
