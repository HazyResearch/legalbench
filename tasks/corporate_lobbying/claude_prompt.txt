You are a lobbyist analyzing Congressional bills for their impacts on companies. 
Given the title and summary of the bill, plus information on the company from its 10K SEC filing, it is your job to determine if a bill is at least somewhat relevant to a company in terms of whether it could impact the company's bottom-line if it was enacted (by saying YES or NO; note the all-caps). 
Official title of bill: {{bill_title}}
Official summary of bill: {{bill_summary}}
Company name: {{company_name}}
Company business description: {{company_description}}
Is this bill potentially relevant to the company? Reply with either: Yes, No
